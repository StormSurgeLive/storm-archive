<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Rafael, located over the central Gulf of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Near Greater Antilles:<br/>
A trough of low pressure that extends from near Hispaniola <br/>
northeastward over the southwestern Atlantic is producing <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Development, if any, of this <br/>
system should be slow to occur during the next couple of days while <br/>
it moves westward to west-northwestward near the Greater Antilles, <br/>
Turks and Caicos Islands, the southeastern Bahamas, and eastern <br/>
Cuba. Regardless of development, locally heavy rains are possible <br/>
across the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, Turks and Caicos <br/>
Islands, the southeastern Bahamas, and eastern Cuba through Sunday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Rafael Advisory Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
300 AM CST Sat Nov 09 2024
 
...RAFAEL MOVING SLOWLY WEST-NORTHWESTWARD...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM CST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...25.0N 90.8W
ABOUT 265 MI...425 KM NNW OF PROGRESO MEXICO
ABOUT 405 MI...650 KM E OF MOUTH OF THE RIO GRANDE
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 285 DEGREES AT 6 MPH...9 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...992 MB...29.30 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.

 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM CST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Rafael was 
located near latitude 25.0 North, longitude 90.8 West. Rafael is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this 
motion is expected through today. After that, Rafael is likely to 
move slowly south-southwestward toward the southwestern Gulf of 
Mexico through early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Steady weakening is expected during the next few 
days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael are expected to spread across most
of the Gulf of Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

RAINFALL: Heavy rainfall indirectly associated with the moisture 
from Rafael is expected to cause 3 to 6 inches of rain, with local 
amounts to 10 inches, across portions of the Piney Woods and Golden 
Triangle of Southeast Texas as well as Southwest and Central 
Louisiana through Sunday morning.  This rain will lead to 
potentially significant flash flooding.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM CST.

Tropical Storm Rafael Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
300 AM CST Sat Nov 09 2024
 
Latest satellite images show Rafael has continued to burst deep 
convection throughout the early morning hours, although shear has 
impacted the symmetry of the convective canopy. The convection is 
displaced to the northwest of the low-level center, as aircraft 
reconnaissance reported earlier, and was further confirmed by a 
scatterometer pass around 0230 UTC. There have been no microwave 
passes tonight to assist with the storm structure. Satellite 
intensity estimates continue to run higher than the flight level 
winds from the earlier aircraft data, as they struggle to keep up 
with the rapid weakening. Given shear has continued to disrupt the 
circulation, the initial intensity is set to 55 kt for this 
advisory, which is near the latest UW-CIMSS satellite consensus. An 
Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate the 
system in a few hours which will help better assess the storm 
structure and intensity.
 
Rafael remains over the warm waters of the central Gulf of Mexico, 
with vertical wind shear and drier air impacting the storms 
structure.  While the shear may decrease some after 36 h, relative 
humidities will drop below 40 percent around the same time which 
will lead to steady weakening.  Given the unfavorable atmospheric 
conditions the latest NHC intensity forecast continues to show 
steady weakening and follows the latest global model fields showing 
Rafael becoming a depression by 48 h and degenerating to a remnant 
low pressure area soon after that, although this could occur sooner 
than is currently forecast.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be west-northwest or 285/5 kt.  A 
ridge to the north of the storm should continue to steer it slowly 
west-northwestward for the next 24-36 h.  After that, the track 
guidance continues to come into agreement with the system meandering 
and eventually moving south to southwestward within the low-level 
wind flow as the system weakens.  The latest NHC forecast was 
shifted slightly towards the latest simple and corrected-consensus 
aids. 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Rafael are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions along the Gulf Coast for the next
few days.
