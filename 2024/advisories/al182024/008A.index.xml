WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Cayman Islands
* Cuban provinces of Pinar del Rio, Artemisa, La Habana, Mayabeque,
Matanzas, and the Isle of Youth
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Jamaica
* Cuban provinces of Villa Clara, Cienfuegos, Sancti Spiritus,
and Ciego de Avila

A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area.
 
Interests elsewhere in Cuba, the Florida Keys, and the southern
Florida Peninsula should monitor the progress of Rafael.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area
outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by
your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM EST (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Rafael was
located near latitude 18.6 North, longitude 79.1 West.  Rafael is
moving toward the northwest near 14 mph (23 km/h).  A generally
northwestward motion is anticipated over the next few days.  On the
forecast track, the storm is expected to move away from western 
Jamaica this afternoon, and be near or over the Cayman Islands
this evening and tonight, and be near or over western Cuba on
Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts. Steady to rapid intensification is expected during the next
24 to 36 hours, and Rafael is expected to become a hurricane as it
passes near the Cayman Islands with further strengthening before it
makes landfall in Cuba.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure recently reported by an Air Force
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 994 mb (29.36 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Rafael can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO
header WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the Cayman Islands by
this evening and are also expected in western Cuba and the Isle of
Youth on Wednesday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in
Jamaica for several more hours and are expected in parts of
west-central Cuba and the lower and middle Florida Keys on Wednesday
and Wednesday night.  Tropical Storm conditions are possible farther
east in central Cuba on Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Heavy rainfall will impact areas of the Western Caribbean
through early Thursday, particularly across Jamaica and the Cayman
Islands into southern and western portions of Cuba. Rainfall totals
between 3 to 6 inches are expected, with isolated higher totals up
to 10 inches anticipated across areas of higher terrain, which could
lead to areas of flash flooding and mudslides.
 
Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected for the Lower and
Middle Florida Keys.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Rafael, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE:  Minor coastal flooding is possible in Jamaica tonight.
Storm surge could raise water levels by 1 to 3 feet above normal
tide levels in the Cayman Islands on Tuesday, and could raise water
levels by as much as 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas
of onshore winds along the southern coast of Cuba in the Hurricane
Warning area, including the Isle of Youth.
 
The combination of a storm surge and the tide will cause normally
dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving
inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the following
heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Dry Tortugas...1-3 ft
Lower Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible Wednesday over the Keys and
southwesternmost Florida mainland.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Rafael are expected to affect much of
the western Caribbean during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 PM EST.

Tropical Storm Rafael Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
1000 AM EST Tue Nov 05 2024

Satellite imagery shows that the convection has increased near the 
center of Rafael during the past several hours.  However, reports 
from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft suggest that 
this has not yet translated into strengthening, possibly due to 
what looks like a tongue of dry air seen entraining into the 
center in microwave imagery.  The aircraft reported maximum winds 
of 54 kt at 850 mb with a minimum central pressure near 994 mb.  
Based on the aircraft data, the initial intensity remains 50 kt. 
One note is the radius of maximum winds has decreased to about 20 
n mi, suggesting that Rafael is trying to develop a better-defined 
inner core despite the apparent dry air.

The initial motion is still northwestward at 320/11 kt.  Rafael is 
currently on the southwestern side of a low- to mid-level ridge over 
the western Atlantic, and this feature should steer the cyclone 
generally northwestward for the next couple of days, with the center 
passing near the Cayman Islands and over western Cuba.  After that 
time, there is a significant spread in the track guidance. While all 
of the guidance suggests that Rafael should shear apart over the 
central and northern Gulf, the GFS takes longer to show this 
happening than the ECMWF/UKMET. In addition, the GFS shows a weaker 
ridge north of the system, while the ECMWF/UKMET show a stronger 
ridge.  The result is that the GFS shows a northward motion with 
landfall on the northern Gulf coast, while the ECMWF/UKMET show a 
westerly motion across the central Gulf of Mexico.  Until there is a 
clearer signal on which of these scenarios is more likely, the 
forecast compromises between these extremes with a slow motion over 
the northern Gulf of Mexico. 
 
Conditions are favorable for steady to rapid strengthening during 
the next 24-36 h if Rafael can develop a stronger inner wind core.  
Based on the expectation that the core will form, the system is 
forecast to reach hurricane strength in about 12 h and continue to 
strengthen until it reaches Cuba.  Once the center is north of 25N 
in the Gulf of Mexico, it is likely to encounter increasing 
vertical wind shear, dry air entrainment, and cooler sea surface 
temperatures, which should lead to Rafael weakening and eventually 
shearing apart vertically. The new intensity forecast remains on 
the high side of the intensity guidance and is similar to the 
previous forecast.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Rafael is forecast to be near hurricane intensity when it passes
near or over the Cayman Islands by tonight where damaging
hurricane-force winds, a dangerous storm surge, and destructive
waves are expected. Rafael should reach western Cuba and the Isle of
Youth on Wednesday. A hurricane warning is in effect for this
region, where a life-threatening storm surge and destructive waves 
are also expected.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in Jamaica through this 
afternoon. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Lower 
and Middle Florida Keys beginning Wednesday and Wednesday night.
 
3. It is too soon to determine what, if any, impacts Rafael could
bring to portions of the northern Gulf Coast.  Residents in this
area should regularly monitor updates to the forecast.
 
4. Rafael will bring areas of heavy rain across portions of the 
Western Caribbean through early Thursday, including the islands of 
Jamaica and the Cayman, along with southern and western portions of 
Cuba. Flash flooding and mudslides are possible along the higher 
terrain in Jamaica and Cuba.
