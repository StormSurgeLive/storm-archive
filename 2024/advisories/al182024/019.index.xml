...RAFAEL STRENGTHENS INTO MAJOR HURRICANE...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1200 AM CST...0600 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.7N 87.5W
ABOUT 275 MI...440 KM NNE OF PROGRESO MEXICO
ABOUT 610 MI...985 KM E OF MOUTH OF THE RIO GRANDE
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...120 MPH...195 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 280 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...956 MB...28.23 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the southern and southwestern Gulf of Mexico should
monitor the progress of Rafael.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 AM CST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rafael was 
located near latitude 24.7 North, longitude 87.5 West. Rafael is 
moving toward the west near 9 mph (15 km/h), and a general westward 
to west-northwestward motion at a slower forward speed is expected 
through the weekend. On the forecast track, Rafael is expected to 
move over the central Gulf of Mexico for the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 120 mph (195 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Rafael is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some additional strengthening 
is possible today. A weakening trend is forecast to begin late 
tonight and continue through the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 956 mb (28.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael are expected to spread across most
of the Gulf of Mexico during the next several days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM CST.

Hurricane Rafael Special Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
1200 AM CST Fri Nov 08 2024
 
Satellite imagery this morning depicts that Rafael continues to wrap 
deep convection around the center of the system, with cold cloud 
tops near -85 C. GLM satellite data shows lightning is occuring in 
the eastern eyewall. Subjective and objective intensity estimates 
have continued to rise from the previous advisory and range from 100 
to 115 kt. Given the improved satellite depiction and these 
estimates the current intensity is raised to 105 kt, which required 
the special advisory. Rafael is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. An Air Force Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft is scheduled to investigate the system later this morning.

The initial motion is 280/8 kt, and a general westward to 
west-northwestward motion is expected during the next 48 h or so as 
Rafael is steered by a building ridge to its north. There were no 
changes to the track forecast from the previous advisory.

Rafael is currently in an area of light vertical wind shear, and 
warm sea surface temperature, which has allowed the current 
intensification to occur. Additional strengthening is possible 
today, and the latest NHC forecast was adjusted in the short term 
through 36 h given the current higher intensity.  After that, 
westerly shear is forecast to increase, and while the shear is not 
likely to be strong it should help advect very dry air into the 
circulation. This should cause Rafael to steadily weaken, and the 
latest NHC intensity forecast follows these trends and lies near 
the consensus aids beyond 48 h.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Rafael are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions along the Gulf Coast for the next
few days.
 
2. Rafael is forecast to move slowly over the central Gulf of
Mexico this weekend and early next week. Interests in the southern
and southwestern Gulf of Mexico should monitor the progress of this
system.
