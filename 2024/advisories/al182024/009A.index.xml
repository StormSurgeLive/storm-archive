DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM EST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Rafael was 
located by NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft near 
latitude 19.3 North, longitude 79.9 West. Rafael is moving toward 
the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h). A general northwestward motion 
is anticipated over the next several days. On the forecast track, 
the storm is expected to move near or over the Cayman Islands 
tonight, be near or over western Cuba on Wednesday, and move into 
the southeastern Gulf of Mexico by Wednesday night.
 
Reports from Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds remain near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Steady to rapid intensification is expected 
during the next 24 hour or so, and Rafael is expected to become a 
hurricane shortly as it passes near the Cayman Islands, with 
additional strengthening before it makes landfall in Cuba.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from dropsonde data from the 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 987 mb (29.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the Cayman Islands by
this evening and are also expected in western Cuba and the Isle of
Youth on Wednesday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in parts
of west-central Cuba and the lower and middle Florida Keys on
Wednesday and Wednesday night.  Tropical Storm conditions are
possible farther east in central Cuba on Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Heavy rainfall will impact areas of the western Caribbean
through early Thursday, particularly across Jamaica and the Cayman
Islands into southern and western portions of Cuba. Rainfall totals
between 3 to 6 inches are expected, with isolated higher totals up
to 10 inches anticipated across areas of higher terrain, which could
lead to areas of flash flooding and mudslides.
 
Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected for the Lower and
Middle Florida Keys.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Rafael, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by 1 to 3 feet
above normal tide levels in the Cayman Islands on Tuesday, and
could raise water levels by as much as 6 to 9 feet above normal
tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the southern coast of
Cuba in the Hurricane Warning area, including the Isle of Youth.
 
The combination of a storm surge and the tide will cause normally
dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving
inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the following
heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Dry Tortugas...1-3 ft
Lower Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible Wednesday over the Keys and
far southwestern Florida mainland.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Rafael are expected to affect much of
the western Caribbean during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Tropical Storm Rafael Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Tropical Storm Rafael Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
400 PM EST Tue Nov 05 2024

Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft and 
radar data from Grand Cayman indicate that Rafael has developed an 
inner wind core during the past several hours.  The radar data shows 
the development of a ragged eye, and the Hurricane Hunter reported 
850-mb flight-level winds of 73 kt about 30-35 n mi northeast of the 
center. The aircraft also reported that the central pressure has 
fallen to near 989 mb.  Based on these data, the initial intensity 
is increased to 60 kt.  The wind radii have been revised some based 
on the aircraft data.
 
The initial motion is northwestward at 325/13 kt.  Rafael is
currently on the southwestern side of a low- to mid-level ridge over
the western Atlantic, and this feature should steer the cyclone
generally northwestward for the next 36-48 h, with the center 
passing near the Cayman Islands and over western Cuba. From 48-72 
h, the models are in better agreement that the center should turn 
more westward as the ridge builds a little westward along the 
northern Gulf coast.  After 72 h, there remains some significant 
spread in the track guidance, due partly to differences in how fast 
Rafael will shear apart and due partly to differences in the 
forecast strength of the ridge along the Gulf coast.  The GFS 
weakens the ridge and shows a northward turn, while the ECMWF keeps 
a stronger ridge and shows a more westward motion.  The 
deterministic UKMET has now changed to a northward turn scenario, 
but the HWRF, HMON, and UKMET ensemble mean join the ECMWF with a 
westward motion.  As mentioned with the previous forecast, until 
there is a clearer signal on which of these scenarios is more 
likely, the forecast compromises between these extremes with a slow 
turn toward the north over the northern Gulf of Mexico.
 
Now that Rafael has developed an inner wind core, conditions are 
favorable for steady to rapid strengthening during the next 24 h or 
so.  The system is expected to reach hurricane strength during 
the next several hours as it passes through the Cayman Islands with 
additional strengthening before it reaches Cuba.  While the peak 
intensity forecast is near the high end of the intensity guidance, 
there is a chance that Rafael could get stronger than currently 
forecast. Once the center is north of 25N in the Gulf of Mexico, 
the cyclone is likely to encounter increasing vertical wind shear, 
dry air entrainment, and cooler sea surface temperatures, which 
should lead to Rafael weakening and eventually shearing apart 
vertically. This part of the intensity forecast lies near or just 
above the intensity consensus.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Rafael is forecast to be a hurricane when it passes near or over 
the Cayman Islands during the next 12 hours, where damaging 
hurricane-force winds, a dangerous storm surge, and destructive 
waves are expected. Additional strengthening is expected before 
Rafael reaches western Cuba and the Isle of Youth on Wednesday. A 
hurricane warning is in effect for this region, where damaging 
hurricane-force winds, life-threatening storm surge, and destructive 
waves are also expected.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Lower and Middle 
Florida Keys beginning Wednesday and Wednesday night.
 
3. It is too soon to determine what, if any, impacts Rafael could
bring to portions of the northern Gulf Coast.  Residents in this
area should regularly monitor updates to the forecast.
 
4. Rafael will bring areas of heavy rain across portions of the 
western Caribbean through early Thursday, including  Jamaica and the 
Cayman Islands, along with southern and western portions of Cuba. 
Flash flooding and mudslides are possible along the higher terrain 
in Jamaica and Cuba.
