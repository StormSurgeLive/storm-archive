...RAFAEL SLIGHTLY STRONGER AND BETTER ORGANIZED...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM CST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.7N 86.2W
ABOUT 260 MI...420 KM WNW OF HAVANA CUBA
ABOUT 325 MI...520 KM NE OF PROGRESO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...105 MPH...165 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...968 MB...28.59 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the southern and southwestern Gulf of Mexico should
monitor the progress of Rafael.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rafael was located 
near latitude 24.7 North, longitude 86.2 West. Rafael is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A turn toward the 
west is expected tonight, with this general motion at a slightly 
slower forward speed continuing through the weekend. On the forecast 
track, Rafael is expected to move over the southern Gulf of Mexico 
for the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 105 mph (165 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Some small intensity fluctuations are possible 
tonight. Weakening is forecast to begin on Friday and continue 
through the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles
(165 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 968 mb (28.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael are expected to spread across most
of the Gulf of Mexico during the next several days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM CST.

Hurricane Rafael Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
900 AM CST Thu Nov 07 2024
 
The Air Force and NOAA Hurricane Hunters have been investigating 
Rafael this morning. Tail Doppler Radar data and reports from the 
flight crews, in addition to earlier passive microwave imagery, 
indicate the eyewall has opened up to the south and southwest of the 
center. This is likely due to the negative influences of some drier 
mid-level air and westerly shear. The Air Force Hurricane Hunters 
have reported peak 700-mb flight-level winds of 92 kt, and dropsonde 
data indicate the central pressure has risen slightly to around 971 
mb. Given the latest flight-level wind data and some erosion of the 
eyewall convection, the initial intensity is lowered to 85 kt.
 
The hurricane is expected to move into an even drier airmass over
the next few days, with at least weak to moderate westerly shear
over the system. So despite 27-28 deg C SSTs over the southern Gulf
of Mexico, some additional weakening is forecast through this
weekend into early next week. Rafael should remain a hurricane for
the next couple of days, but some downward adjustments were made to
the NHC intensity forecast to bring it closer to the latest
multi-model consensus aids. Even still, the NHC forecast lies on the
higher side of the guidance envelope.
 
Recent aircraft fixes indicate Rafael is beginning a leftward turn,
and the initial motion estimate is west-northwestward at 295/8 kt.
The hurricane should move westward over the next couple of days as a
mid-level ridge builds to its north. Then, there is still some
spread in the track guidance with a bifurcation in model solutions.
Most of the models (including the ECMWF, UKMET, and regional
hurricane models) show Rafael turning southwestward in response to a
narrow ridge building to its northwest. But, the GFS and Canadian
models still suggest a northward turn ahead of a slightly deeper
upper trough over the central United States. The NHC prediction
continues to favor the southern solutions and is similar to the
previous forecast, in agreement with the majority of track models
and consensus aids. There remains above average uncertainty in the
future track of Rafael, and additional adjustments to subsequent
official track forecasts are likely. If the northern model solutions
were to verify, Rafael would likely encounter even more hostile
environmental conditions and weaken faster than shown in the
official NHC forecast.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane Rafael will continue to bring periods of heavy rain to
western Cuba today. Flash flooding and mudslides are possible along
the higher terrain.
 
2. Rafael is forecast to move slowly over the south-central Gulf of
Mexico this weekend and early next week. Interests in the southern
and southwestern Gulf of Mexico should monitor the progress of this
system.
