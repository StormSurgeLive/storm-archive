Tropical Storm Rafael Advisory Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
900 AM CST Sun Nov 10 2024
 
...RAFAEL BECOMING LESS ORGANIZED...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM CST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...26.3N 91.9W
ABOUT 370 MI...600 KM NNW OF PROGRESO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 345 DEGREES AT 3 MPH...6 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1003 MB...29.62 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM CST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Rafael was
located near latitude 26.3 North, longitude 91.9 West. Rafael is
moving toward the north-northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h). The storm
is expected to meander over the central Gulf of Mexico through
tonight, then turn toward the south and south-southwest on Monday
and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is expected, and Rafael is forecast to degenerate to a
post-tropical remnant low by Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center. A few hours ago, NOAA buoy 42001 over the central
Gulf of Mexico recorded a sustained wind of 38 mph (61 km/h) with a
gust of 45 mph (72 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Rafael can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael will continue impacting portions of
the northern and western Gulf Coast through the remainder of this
weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM CST.

Tropical Storm Rafael Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
900 AM CST Sun Nov 10 2024
 
Convection has continued to weaken this morning and move farther
away to the east of the low-level center.  Rafaelâ€™s remaining
convection is all located more than 75 miles east-northeast of the
center.  A recent observation of a 33-kt 1-min wind from buoy 42001
indicates that Rafael still likely has tropical-storm-force winds.
Gradual weakening is expected to continue because Rafael is located
within a very dry environment, which is forecast to become even
drier over the next 24 to 36 h.  The NHC intensity forecast is
similar to the previous one and follows the intensity guidance.
Simulated satellite imagery from the ECMWF model suggests that
Rafael should lose its convection and become a remnant low within
the next 12 to 24 h.  Rafael is expected to become a remnant low
either tonight or on Monday.
 
Rafael has been drifting toward the north-northwest, or 345/3 kt.
Rafael will remain over the Gulf of Mexico as it spins down over the
next couple of days, performing a small clockwise loop over the
central Gulf of Mexico through Monday in weak steering currents,
before being pushed southward and southwestward by the low-level
flow on Tuesday.  The latest NHC track forecast lies close to the
consensus models, and only minor tweaks were made to the previous
NHC track forecast.  The NHC forecast calls for the remnant low of
Rafael to open up into a trough and dissipate by mid-week, and this
solution is also shown by the latest GFS and ECMWF models.
 
Rafael poses no direct threat to land, but swells from the storm are
still contributing to an elevated rip current risk along the
northern and western Gulf Coast, and this will likely continue
into Monday before subsiding on Tuesday.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Rafael are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions along portions of the Gulf Coast
through the weekend.
