Hurricane Rafael Advisory Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
300 AM CST Fri Nov 08 2024
 
...RAFAEL MOVING WESTWARD IN THE CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM CST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.5N 88.0W
ABOUT 245 MI...395 KM NNE OF PROGRESO MEXICO
ABOUT 585 MI...940 KM E OF MOUTH OF THE RIO GRANDE
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...120 MPH...195 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 275 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...956 MB...28.23 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the southern and southwestern Gulf of Mexico should
monitor the progress of Rafael.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM CST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rafael was located 
near latitude 24.5 North, longitude 88.0 West. Rafael is moving 
toward the west near 9 mph (15 km/h), and a general westward to 
west-northwestward motion at a slower forward speed is expected 
through the weekend. On the forecast track, Rafael is expected to 
move over the central Gulf of Mexico for the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Rafael is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Some fluctuations in intensity are possible 
today. By tonight, a steady weakening trend is forecast and should 
continue through the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 956 mb (28.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael are expected to spread across most
of the Gulf of Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM CST.

Hurricane Rafael Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
300 AM CST Fri Nov 08 2024
 
Satellite images depict Rafael continues to produce deep convection, 
with cloud tops around -80 C.  However, in the last few hours, the 
eye has become more cloud filled and less pronounced. Subjective 
Dvorak satellite intensity estimates this cycle were T/5.5 and 
T/6.0, from TAFB and SAB respectively. Objective satellite intensity 
estimates from UW-CIMSS range from 100-119 kt. Using a blend of 
these estimates, the initial intensity is set to 105 kt.  An Air 
Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate the 
system in a few hours.
 
The initial motion is 275/8 kt, and a general westward to 
west-northwestward motion is expected during the next 48 h or so as 
Rafael continues to be steered by a building ridge to the north. 
Model guidance has come into a little better agreement this cycle, 
with the latest operational ECMWF and UKMET leaning towards the GFS 
solution, which shows a slow anticyclonic meandering loop over the 
central Gulf of Mexico. Although there remains some ensemble 
divergence, the ensemble means are in better agreement as well. As 
the Rafael weakens, the low-level flow then causes the system to 
move southwestward in the Gulf of Mexico through the end of the 
forecast period. The NHC track was shifted towards these model 
trends and lies near to the simple and corrected-consensus aids.
 
Rafael is currently in an area of light vertical wind shear, and 
warm sea surface temperatures. Some intensity fluctuations are 
possible today. By tonight, westerly shear is forecast to increase 
slightly, and a drier airmass will begin to impact the system. This 
should cause Rafael to steadily weaken throughout the forecast 
period, and the latest NHC intensity forecast follows the latest 
model weakening trends. Model simulated IR satellite depicts that 
the system will struggle to produce convection by the end of the 
period, and the latest NHC forecast shows the system becoming a 
remnant low in 120 h. Although, some models like the GFS depict that 
this could occur sooner than currently forecast.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Rafael are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions along the Gulf Coast for the next
few days.
 
2. Rafael is forecast to move slowly over the central Gulf of
Mexico this weekend and early next week. Interests in the southern
and southwestern Gulf of Mexico should monitor the progress of this
system.
