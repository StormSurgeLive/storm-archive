The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Rafael, located over the northwest Caribbean Sea.<br/>

Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
A trough of low pressure is producing an area of disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms several hundred miles east-northeast of <br/>

westward during the next few days, and an area of low pressure could <br/>
form near the northern Leeward Islands tonight or Thursday.  <br/>
Afterward, some gradual development of this system is possible <br/>
toward the end of the week and into the early part of the weekend <br/>
while it moves near or to the north of the Virgin Islands and  <br/>
Puerto Rico, and approaches the Southeast Bahamas.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM EST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rafael was
located near latitude 21.4 North, longitude 81.9 West. Rafael is
moving toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A general
northwestward motion is anticipated over the next day or so,
followed by a gradual west-northwestward turn in the Gulf of Mexico.
On the forecast track, Rafael is expected move near or just east of
the Isle of Youth during the next few hours, and make landfall
in western Cuba later today.  Rafael is forecast to move into the
southeastern Gulf of Mexico tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 110 mph (175 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is expected, and
Rafael is forecast to be a major hurricane when it makes landfall 
in Cuba later today.  Rafael is forecast to weaken over Cuba but is 
expected to emerge into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico as a 
hurricane.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 960 mb (28.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in western Cuba and the 
Isle of Youth today.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in 
parts of west-central Cuba and the lower and middle Florida Keys 
today and tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are possible farther 
east in central Cuba today.
 
RAINFALL: RAINFALL: Heavy rainfall will impact areas of the Western
Caribbean through early Thursday, particularly across the Cayman
Islands into western Cuba. Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches are
expected across portions of western Cuba, with isolated higher
totals up to 12 inches anticipated across areas of higher terrain.
This will lead to areas of flash flooding and mudslides. Across the
Cayman Islands additional rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected.
 
Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected for the Lower and
Middle Florida Keys.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Rafael, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels as much as 9 to
14 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along
the southern coast of Cuba in the Hurricane Warning area, including
the Isle of Youth.
 
The combination of a storm surge and the tide will cause normally
dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving
inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the following
heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Dry Tortugas...1-3 ft
Lower Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
TORNADOES: A couple of tornadoes are possible through tonight over
the Florida Keys and far southwestern Florida mainland.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael are expected to affect much of the
western Caribbean during the next day or so and will also spread
across most of the Gulf of Mexico from east to west late this week
into the weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 PM EST.
Next complete advisory at 400 PM EST.

Hurricane Rafael Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
1000 AM EST Wed Nov 06 2024
 
The satellite presentation of Rafael has continued to improve this
morning with the eye becoming apparent in geostationary imagery.
Radar data from the Cayman Islands and reports from both NOAA and
Air Force Hurricane Hunters indicated Rafael has a double eyewall
structure.  Both the NOAA and Air Force planes measured peak
flight-level winds of 94 kt earlier this morning.  Dropsonde data
indicated that the pressure had fallen to around 963 mb on the last
pass of the NOAA P-3 aircraft around 1245 UTC. Given the continued
improvement in the satellite structure and earlier tail-Doppler
radar data, the initial wind speed has been set at 95 kt for this
advisory.  Another Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 
scheduled to be in the storm by early this afternoon. 
 
Rafael will remain in a favorable environment for strengthening
while it approaches western Cuba.  The hurricane will be traversing
warm waters and remain in light to moderate vertical wind shear
conditions.  The apparent beginning of an eyewall replacement cycle
could ease the recent rate of rapid intensification, but it appears
very likely that Rafael will become a major hurricane before it 
makes landfall in western Cuba later today.  Some weakening is 
forecast when the storm crosses Cuba, but Rafael is likely to 
remain a hurricane over the southeastern and southern Gulf of 
Mexico during the next few days.  After that time, increasing 
southwesterly shear and significantly drier air are likely to result 
in weakening, however a more southerly track over the Gulf could 
result in less hostile conditions, and there is larger-than-normal 
uncertainty regarding Rafael's intensity later in the forecast 
period.
 
The hurricane is moving northwestward or 320/11 kt.  Rafael should
continue to move around the southwestern side of a mid-level high
pressure ridge over the southwestern Atlantic.  The ridge is
forecast to build westward over the eastern Gulf of Mexico during
the next couple of days which is expected to cause Rafael to turn
more westward over the southern Gulf of Mexico.  The track guidance
is in good agreement for the first 48 to 60 h, but there is
increasing spread after that time.  Much of the guidance now
suggests that the ridge will remain to the north of the system
through much of the forecast period.  This has resulted in a
southward shift in the model envelope and the updated NHC track
forecast has been shifted in that direction after 72 hours.  The
new forecast lies north of the latest consensus aids and additional
southward adjustments may be needed in subsequent forecasts.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Rafael is forecast to become a major hurricane before it reaches
western Cuba and the Isle of Youth.  A hurricane warning is
in effect for this region, where a life-threatening storm surge,
damaging hurricane-force winds, and destructive waves are expected.
 
2. Tropical-storm-force winds, especially in gusts, are expected in
the Lower and Middle Florida Keys beginning later today and tonight.
 
3. Rafael will bring areas of heavy rain to the Cayman Islands and
western Cuba through Thursday. Flash flooding and mudslides are
expected in areas of higher terrain in western Cuba.
 
4. It is too soon to determine what, if any, impacts Rafael could
bring to portions of the western Gulf Coast.  Residents in this area
should regularly monitor updates to the forecast.
