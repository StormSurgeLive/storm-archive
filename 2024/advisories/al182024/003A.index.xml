Tropical Storm Patty Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172024
900 AM GMT Mon Nov 04 2024
 
This morning's METSAT-10 satellite imagery presentation consists of
a fragmented curved band with -30C to -40C cloud tops displaced to
the east of the exposed elongated surface center.  A blend of the 
TAFB and SAB subjective and UW-CIMSS objective technique satellite 
intensity estimates yields an initial intensity of 35 kt for this 
advisory.
 
Although Patty's cloud pattern is typical of a sheared tropical
cyclone, the FSU cyclone phase diagram based on the GFS and ECMWF 
models indicates an asymmetric deep cold core thermal structure.  
Despite the sub-23C oceanic sea surface temperatures, the very cold 
upper-tropospheric temperatures are more than likely supporting
sufficient thermodynamic instability to produce the remaining
convection associated with the cyclone.  The vertical tilt with
height is becoming more pronounced due to the strong westerly shear
and Patty should spin down while losing what remains of the
convection and become a post-tropical cyclone later today.  The
global models agree with Patty opening up into a trough by the 36
hr period and the official forecast follows suit.
 
Patty's initial motion is estimated to be eastward, or 070/17 kt.
A turn toward the east-northeast is expected today and this motion
should continue until it dissipates on Tuesday.  The NHC forecast
is similar to the previous one and closely follows the various
consensus aids.
 
Key messages:
 
1. Between late today and Tuesday, heavy rainfall across portions 
of Portugal and western Spain is possible from Patty or its 
remnants.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Cayman Islands
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Jamaica
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within
24 hours.
 
Interests in Cuba and the Florida Keys should closely monitor this
system.  Additional watches or warnings could be required today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM EST (1200 UTC), the disturbance was centered near latitude
14.8 North, longitude 76.8 West. The system is moving toward the
north near 7 mph (11 km/h). A northwestward motion is expected 
later today and forecast to continue for the next few days. On
the forecast track, the system is expected to move near Jamaica 
this evening, be near or over the Cayman Islands on Tuesday,

Potential Tropical Cyclone Eighteen Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
400 AM EST Mon Nov 04 2024

The system's deep convection is gradually becoming better organized 
with a little more concentration of the shower and thunderstorm 
activity.  However, convective banding features are not yet well 
defined, and observations from an Air Force Hurricane aircraft did 
not show a distinct circulation center.  Surface observations and 
scatterometer data indicate very light winds over the western 
portion of the disturbance.  Since the circulation has yet to 
become well defined, the system is still being designated as a 
potential tropical cyclone at this time.  The current intensity 
estimate remains at 30 kt based on the scatterometer winds and the 
aircraft observations.  Another Air Force plane is scheduled to 
investigate the system later this morning.

Given the lack of a well-defined center, the initial motion is 
rather uncertain.  My best estimate is slowly northward, or 360/6 
kt.  Over the next few days, the system should move generally 
northwestward on the southwestern periphery of a mid-level high 
pressure system near and east of the Florida peninsula.  Later in 
the forecast period, the track guidance diverges significantly, 
with the latest ECMWF and U.K. Met office model predictions well to 
the southwest of most of the other guidance tracks.  The motion 
during the latter part of the period is partially dependent on how 
much the mid-level subtropical ridge to the northeast is eroded by 
the upstream flow and how strong and vertically deep the tropical 
cyclone will become.  The details of this evolution are not well 
known at this time.  In any event it should be noted that, given the 
uncertainty in the center location, there is greater than usual 
uncertainty in the track forecast.

As noted earlier, there is also significant uncertainty in the 
intensity prediction.  For the next 48 hours or so, the system 
will be traversing waters of high oceanic heat content with low 
vertical wind shear.  Therefore strengthening is likely, but the 
amount of intensification is largely dependent on whether a 
well-defined inner core and vertically aligned circulation 
develops.  If this evolution occurs, which cannot be known with 
great certainty, significant intensification is likely before the 
system reaches Western Cuba.  Later, the environment over the Gulf 
of Mexico should be less conducive for strengthening with strong 
southwesterly shear and drier air.  The official intensity 
forecast lies between the more conservative statistical-dynamical 
guidance and the more aggressive regional hurricane models.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. The disturbance is expected to become a tropical storm today and
pass near Jamaica on tonight and Tuesday where a Tropical Storm
Warning is in effect.  The system is forecast to become a hurricane
by Tuesday night and there is a risk of dangerous impacts from
hurricane-force winds and storm surge in the Cayman Islands and
portions of western Cuba.
 
2. Interests in Cuba and the Florida Keys should closely monitor
this system as hurricane and tropical storm watches could be
required for portions of these areas later today.
 
3. The system is forecast to enter the western Gulf of Mexico later
this week, but given significant uncertainties in the long-range
forecast track and intensity, it is too soon to determine what, if
any, impacts could occur.  Residents in this area should regularly
monitor updates to the forecast.
 
4. The system will bring areas of heavy rain across portions of the 
Western Caribbean, including the island of Jamaica and portions of 
Cuba through mid-week. Flooding could occur over portions of Jamaica 
and Cuba, with mudslides possible.  Heavy rainfall would then 
spread north into Florida and adjacent areas of the Southeast United 
States mid to late week.
