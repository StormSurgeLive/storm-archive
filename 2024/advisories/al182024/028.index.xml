Tropical Storm Rafael Advisory Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
300 AM CST Sun Nov 10 2024
 
...RAFAEL GRADUALLY WEAKENING...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM CST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...26.1N 91.8W
ABOUT 355 MI...575 KM NNW OF PROGRESO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 345 DEGREES AT 2 MPH...4 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1003 MB...29.62 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM CST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Rafael was
located near latitude 26.1 North, longitude 91.8 West. Rafael is
moving toward the north-northwest near 2 mph (4 km/h). The storm is
expected to meander over the central Gulf of Mexico through tonight, 
then turn toward the south and south-southwest on Monday and 
Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Weakening is expected through early next week, 
and Rafael is forecast to degenerate to a post-tropical remnant low 
by Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Rafael can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael will continue impacting portions of
the northern and western Gulf Coast through the weekend. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Indirect rainfall associated with the moisture from Rafael 
is expected to lead to additional rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 
inches, with local totals to 15 inches, across portions of 
southwestern and central Louisiana into this afternoon.  This rain 
could lead to or continue significant flash flooding.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM CST.

Tropical Storm Rafael Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
300 AM CST Sun Nov 10 2024
 
Rafael continues to gradually weaken.  Satellite images show that
the low-level center remains exposed, with an area of shrinking deep
convection located well east of the center.  The initial intensity
is reduced to 35 kt, in accordance with nearby buoy observations and
recent satellite intensity estimates.  Gradual weakening is 
expected due to a harsh environment of very dry air aloft and wind 
shear.  The system should lose organized deep convection later 
today and become a post-tropical cyclone in about 24 hours.  Only 
small changes were made to the previous intensity forecast.
 
The storm is basically drifting to the north-northwest now, and   
Rafael is forecast to make a small clockwise loop during the next 
day or so over the central Gulf of Mexico in light steering 
currents.  After that time, the low-level flow should steer the 
cyclone or its remnants southward and southwestward, and the 
remnant low should open up into a trough of low pressure in about 3 
days.  The new forecast is a touch east of the previous one in the 
near term and also shows dissipation a little sooner based on the 
latest model solutions.
 
Rafael poses no direct threat to land, but swells from the storm are
still contributing to an elevated rip current risk along the
northern and western Gulf Coast. Also, the interaction of distant
moisture from Rafael with a slow-moving front will cause heavy
rainfall and potentially significant flash flooding across portions
of southwestern and central Louisiana through this morning.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Rafael are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions along the Gulf Coast through the
weekend.
