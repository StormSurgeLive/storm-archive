For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Rafael, located over the northwest Caribbean Sea.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
A trough of low pressure is producing an area of disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms several hundred miles east-northeast of <br/>
the Leeward Islands.  This system is expected to move generally <br/>
westward during the next few days, and an area of low pressure could <br/>
form near the northern Leeward Islands tonight or Thursday.  <br/>
Afterward, some gradual development of this system is possible <br/>
toward the end of the week and into the early part of the weekend <br/>
while it moves near or to the north of the Virgin Islands and  <br/>
Puerto Rico, and approaches the Southeast Bahamas.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM EST (1200 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Rafael was located
near latitude 21.0 North, longitude 81.6 West. Rafael is moving 
toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A general northwestward 
motion is anticipated over the next day or two, followed by a 
gradual west-northwestward turn in the Gulf of Mexico.  On the 
forecast track, Rafael is expected move near or over the Isle of 
Youth later this morning or early this afternoon, and make landfall 
in western Cuba later today.  Rafael is forecast to move into the 
southeastern Gulf of Mexico tonight.
 
Reports from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the 
maximum sustained winds have increased to near 100 mph (160 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Rapid strengthening is forecast, and Rafael 
could be near major hurricane intensity before it makes landfall in 
Cuba later today.  Rafael is forecast to weaken over Cuba but is 
expected to emerge into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico as a 
hurricane.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105
miles (165 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Hurricane
Hunter aircraft observations is 964 mb (28.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions, possibly in gusts, are expected in
portions of the Cayman Islands for the next couple of hours.
Hurricane conditions are expected in western Cuba and the Isle of
Youth today.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in parts of
west-central Cuba and the lower and middle Florida Keys today and
tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are possible farther east in
central Cuba today.
 
RAINFALL: Heavy rainfall will impact areas of the Western Caribbean
through early Thursday, particularly across Jamaica and the Cayman
Islands into western Cuba.  Rainfall totals between 4 to 7 inches
are expected across the Cayman Islands and western Cuba, with
isolated higher totals up to 10 inches anticipated across areas of
higher terrain.  This will lead to areas of flash flooding and
mudslides. Across Jamaica, heavy rain bands on the backside of
Rafael will bring an additional 1 to 3 inches of rain.
 
Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected for the Lower and
Middle Florida Keys.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Rafael, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by 1 to 3 feet
above normal tide levels in the Cayman Islands, and could raise 
water levels by as much as 9 to 13 feet above normal tide levels in 
areas of onshore winds along the southern coast of Cuba in the 
Hurricane Warning area, including the Isle of Youth on Wednesday.
 
The combination of a storm surge and the tide will cause normally
dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving
inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the following
heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Dry Tortugas...1-3 ft
Lower Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible today over the Florida
Keys and far southwestern Florida mainland.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael are expected to affect much of the
western Caribbean during the next few days and will also spread
across most of the Gulf of Mexico from east to west late this week
into the early part of the weekend. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM EST.

Hurricane Rafael Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
400 AM EST Wed Nov 06 2024
 
Rafael continues to intensify as it approaches western Cuba.  Deep
convection within the hurricane's Central Dense Overcast (CDO) is
very intense, with cloud tops colder than -80 deg C.  There are
also strong convective banding features surrounding the CDO.
Observations from an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate a
closed eyewall at times, with the central pressure falling at a
rate of around 2 mb per hour.  Based on the highest flight-level
winds reported from the aircraft so far, the current intensity is
set at 80 kt for this advisory.  Rafael's inner core is relatively
small in size, with hurricane-force winds extending about 25 n mi
from its 10-15 n mi wide eye.
 
The hurricane continues its northwestward trek, and the initial
motion is a slightly faster 315/12 kt.  For the next day or two,
Rafael should  continue to move along the southwestern side of a
mid-level high pressure system and move over the southeastern Gulf
of Mexico through Thursday night.  After 48 hours the track guidance
becomes very divergent, with a number of model solutions taking the
system toward the southwest Gulf in 3-4 days.  It appears that,
during the latter part of the forecast period, a mid-level ridge 
could build to the north of the tropical cyclone.  This could
force Rafael to turn to the west or south of west in 4 to 5 days.
In order to maintain continuity from the previous NHC predictions,
the official track forecast is shifted to the left of the previous
one, but not as far as dictated by the latest model consensus.  If
future model runs continue to show this trend, however, additional
leftward adjustment to the NHC track may be required.
 
Rafael is expected remain in an environment of high oceanic heat
content, low vertical wind shear and a very moist low- to
mid-tropospheric air mass until the center reaches western Cuba.
Therefore, the cyclone will probably be nearing major hurricane
status at landfall in Cuba.  Once the system moves over the Gulf of
Mexico, the environment should become increasingly less conducive
for Rafael to maintain its intensity.  Increasing southwesterly
shear, significantly drier air, and gradually decreasing SSTs are
likely to result in weakening.  The official forecast remains near
the high end of the model guidance in the 3- to 5-day forecast
period.  This is similar to the previous NHC intensity forecast.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Rafael is expected to strengthen to near major hurricane
intensity before reaches western Cuba and the Isle of Youth
today.  A hurricane warning is in effect for this region, where
damaging hurricane-force winds, life-threatening storm surge, and
destructive waves are also expected.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Lower and Middle
Florida Keys beginning today and tonight.
 
3. It is too soon to determine what, if any, impacts Rafael could
bring to portions of the northern Gulf Coast.  Residents in this
area should regularly monitor updates to the forecast.
 
4. Rafael will bring areas of heavy rain across portions of the
Western Caribbean through early Thursday, including the islands of
Jamaica and the Caymans along with western Cuba. Flash flooding and
mudslides are expected along the higher terrain in western Cuba.
