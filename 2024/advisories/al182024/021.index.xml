GULF OF MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM CST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.5N 88.8W
ABOUT 230 MI...365 KM NNE OF PROGRESO MEXICO
ABOUT 535 MI...860 KM E OF MOUTH OF THE RIO GRANDE
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...110 MPH...175 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 270 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...961 MB...28.38 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the southern and southwestern Gulf of Mexico should
monitor the progress of Rafael.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM CST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rafael was located
near latitude 24.5 North, longitude 88.8 West. Rafael is moving
toward the west near 9 mph (15 km/h). A slower west-northwestward 
motion is expected during the next day or so. After that, Rafael is 
likely to meander over the central Gulf of Mexico through early 
next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 110 mph (175 km/h) with higher
gusts. Steady weakening is expected during the next few days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 961 mb (28.38 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael are expected to spread across most
of the Gulf of Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM CST.

Hurricane Rafael Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
900 AM CST Fri Nov 08 2024
 
Rafael has lost a little strength, but remains a powerful hurricane. 
Although the eye that was apparent in satellite images overnight has 
filled, the system still has a well organized central dense overcast 
pattern with compact banding features surrounding it. The Air Force 
Hurricane Hunters have been investigating Rafael this morning and 
based on their data, the initial intensity is set to 95 kt. The 
minimum pressure is estimated to be 961 mb based on dropsonde 
information. Rafael is a very compact hurricane, with 
tropical-storm-force and hurricane-force winds estimated to extend 
only 80 n mi and 25 n mi from the center, respectively.

Although the waters are still relatively warm over the Gulf of 
Mexico, a combination of increasing westerly vertical wind shear and 
intrusions of dry air should promote steady to rapid weakening 
during the next few days. The intensity models are in good agreement 
on this scenario, and the NHC forecast is a touch lower than the 
previous one. Rafael is forecast to fall below hurricane strength on 
Saturday and degenerate to a remnant low in 3 to 4 days.

Rafael is moving westward at about 8 kt on the south side of a ridge 
that extends across the western Atlantic and the east-central Gulf 
of Mexico. A slightly slower west-northwestward motion is expected 
during the next 24 hours or so as the ridge weakens. A trough 
approaching from the west should leave Rafael in very weak steering 
currents over the weekend and early next week, causing the system to 
meander over the central Gulf during that time. Once the system 
becomes weak and shallow, a turn to the south-southwest is expected 
in the low-level flow. Despite the complex steering, the models 
are in fair agreement and this forecast is generally similar to the 
previous one.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Rafael are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions along the Gulf Coast for the next
few days.
 
2. Rafael is forecast to move slowly over the central Gulf of
Mexico this weekend and early next week. Interests in the southern
and southwestern Gulf of Mexico should monitor the progress of this
system.
