SUMMARY OF 300 PM CST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.6N 89.7W
ABOUT 230 MI...365 KM N OF PROGRESO MEXICO
ABOUT 475 MI...765 KM E OF MOUTH OF THE RIO GRANDE
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...100 MPH...155 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 275 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...967 MB...28.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the southern and southwestern Gulf of Mexico should
monitor the progress of Rafael.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rafael was located 
near latitude 24.6 North, longitude 89.7 West. Rafael is moving 
toward the west near 9 mph (15 km/h). A slow west-northwestward 
motion is expected through tonight. After that, Rafael is likely to 
meander over the central Gulf of Mexico through early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts. Steady weakening is expected during the next few days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 967 mb (28.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael are expected to spread across most
of the Gulf of Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Rafael Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
300 PM CST Fri Nov 08 2024
 
Satellite images suggest that Rafael is gradually losing strength
and organization. The convective pattern has become ragged, and
microwave images suggest that westerly vertical wind shear and dry
air are beginning to take a toll on the system's structure. A blend
of the latest Dvorak estimates supports lowering the initial
intensity to 85 kt. An Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft is
scheduled to investigate Rafael this evening, and that data will
provide a better estimate of the hurricane's intensity. ASCAT data
and earlier reconnaissance information indicate that Rafael is a
very compact hurricane, with tropical-storm-force and
hurricane-force winds estimated to extend only 80 n mi and 25 n mi
from the center, respectively.
 
Even though Rafael remains over the warm waters of the central Gulf
of Mexico, increasing westerly vertical wind shear and intrusions of
dry air should cause steady to rapid weakening during the next few
days. Rafael is expected to fall below hurricane strength on
Saturday, and become a remnant low by day 3. This prediction is in
line with the majority of the models.
 
Rafael is moving westward at about 8 kt on the south side of a ridge
that extends across the western Atlantic and the east-central Gulf
of Mexico. A slightly slower west-northwestward motion is expected
through tonight as the ridge weakens. A trough approaching from the
west should leave Rafael in very weak steering currents over the
weekend and early next week, causing the system to meander over the
central Gulf during that time. Once the system becomes weak and
shallow, a turn to the south-southwest is expected in the low-level
flow. The NHC track forecast is similar to the previous one.
Although there are differences in the models, they all agree that
Rafael will remain over water and not directly impact land.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Rafael are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions along the Gulf Coast for the next
few days.
 
2. Rafael is forecast to move slowly over the central Gulf of
Mexico this weekend and early next week. Interests in the southern
and southwestern Gulf of Mexico should monitor the progress of this
system.
