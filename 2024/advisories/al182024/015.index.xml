WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Cuba has discontinued the Hurricane Warning for
Cuba.
 
The Tropical Storm Warning for the Lower and Middle Florida Keys is
discontinued.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Dry Tortugas
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United States, 
please monitor products issued by your local National Weather 
Service forecast office. 
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM EST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rafael was located
near latitude 24.2 North, longitude 84.6 West.  Rafael is moving
toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A turn toward the west
at a slower forward speed is expected later today, with this general
motion continuing through Saturday.  On the forecast track, Rafael
is expected to continue to move away from western Cuba over the
southeastern Gulf of Mexico this morning.  Rafael is then forecast
to move over the southern Gulf of Mexico for the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some weakening is possible during the next couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 969 mb (28.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected over the Dry Tortugas
through this morning.
 
RAINFALL: Additional rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches are expected
today, leading to storm total accumulations of 12 inches across
portions of western Cuba.  This may lead to areas of flash flooding
and mudslides, especially along the higher terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Rafael, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
<a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf">www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf</a>

STORM SURGE: The combination of a storm surge and the tide will 
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising 
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the 
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if 
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Dry Tortugas...1-3 ft
Lower Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael are expected to spread across most 
of the Gulf of Mexico from east to west during the next several 
days.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and 
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local 
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 AM EST.
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM EST.

<title>Hurricane Rafael Forecast Discussion Number 14</title>

Hurricane Rafael Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
1000 PM EST Wed Nov 06 2024

The eye of Rafael made landfall just after the last advisory was 
issued with an estimated intensity of 100 kt.  Since then, the 
center has crossed western Cuba into the southeastern Gulf of 
Mexico, and a combination of land interaction and increasing 
southwesterly shear has caused some weakening.  Reports from NOAA 
and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the 
central pressure has risen to near 969 mb, and that the maximum 
winds have decreased to near 90 kt. In addition, radar data from 
Cuba and the Key West WSR-88D show that the eyewall structure has 
decayed, with the deep convection now confined to the northeastern 
quadrant.

The initial motion is 315/11.  Rafael is on the southwest side of a 
low- to mid-level ridge over the western Atlantic and the Florida 
Peninsula. This ridge is forecast to build westward in response to 
a developing deep-layer trough over the southwestern United States.
This evolution should cause the cyclone to move westward across the 
Gulf of Mexico with some decrease in forward speed during the next 
2-3 days.  The track guidance remains divergent after 72 h.  The 
GFS and Canadian models show the cyclone being caught in southerly 
flow between the deep-layer trough and a ridge over the eastern 
Gulf of Mexico and turn the system northward.  The ECMWF and UKMET 
forecast the ridge to be more over the western Gulf of Mexico 
between Rafael and the trough, and thus turn the cyclone 
southwestward.  The GFS and ECMWF ensemble runs have tracks that 
support both of these possibilities.  Given the spread and 
uncertainty, this low-confidence latter part of the forecast track 
shows a slow west-southwestward motion close the the consensus 
models.

The global models suggest that the current shear should decrease in 
about 24 h, then increase again later in the forecast period.  The 
forecast track keeps the system over relatively warm sea surface 
temperatures, especially if it turns southwestward.  However, all 
of the guidance agrees that the airmass over the Gulf will be quite 
dry, and this should lead to gradual weakening even if the system 
stays over the warm water. There remains a lot of uncertainty in 
the intensity forecast, as the environment is much more hostile to 
the north of the forecast track and somewhat more favorable to the 
south of the forecast track.  The intensity forecast follows the 
overall trend of the guidance, but the guidance itself has a 
significant spread.

Since the eyewall structure has decayed and the system is moving 
away from western Cuba, there will be no more hourly updates for 
Rafael.  Three-hourly public advisories will continue as long as 
watches and warnings are in effect.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. While Rafael is now moving away from western Cuba, a hurricane 
warning remains in effect for this region where a life-threatening 
storm surge, damaging hurricane-force winds, and destructive waves 
are still possible.
 
2. Tropical-storm-force winds, especially in gusts, are expected in
the Lower and Middle Florida Keys tonight.
 
3. Hurricane Rafael will continue to bring periods of heavy rain to 
western Cuba into Thursday. Flash flooding and mudslides are 
possible along the higher terrain.
 
4. Rafael is forecast to meander over the south-central Gulf of
Mexico this weekend and early next week.  Interests in the southern
and southwestern Gulf of Mexico should monitor the progress of this
system.
