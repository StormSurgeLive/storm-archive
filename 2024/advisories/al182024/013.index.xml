Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Rafael, located near western Cuba.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
A trough of low pressure is producing an area of disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms a few hundred miles east-northeast of <br/>
the Leeward Islands.  This system is expected to move generally <br/>
westward during the next few days, and an area of low pressure could <br/>
form near the northern Leeward Islands tonight or Thursday.  <br/>
Afterward, some gradual development of this system is possible <br/>
toward the end of the week and into the weekend while it moves near <br/>
or to the north of the Virgin Islands and  Puerto Rico, and <br/>
approaches the Southeast Bahamas.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM EST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rafael was located
near latitude 22.6 North, longitude 82.7 West. Rafael is moving
toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A general northwestward
motion is anticipated tonight.  A slower west-northwestward to 
westward motion is expected Friday through the weekend.  On the 
forecast track, Rafael is expected to cross Cuba this evening, and 
emerge over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico later this evening or 
tonight.  Rafael is forecast to move over the southern Gulf of 
Mexico this weekend. 

Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Rafael is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in strength is expected 
before Rafael makes landfall in western Cuba.  Some weakening is 
forecast while Rafael crosses western Cuba, but the storm is 
forecast to remain a hurricane over the southeastern Gulf of 
Mexico.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km). A wind gust to 45 mph (72 km/h) was recently reported at 
the Havana International Airport. 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 956 mb (28.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in portions of western 
Cuba through the evening.  Tropical storm conditions are expected 
in parts of west-central Cuba and the lower and middle Florida Keys 
through tonight.
 
RAINFALL: Heavy rainfall will impact areas of the western Caribbean
through early Thursday, particularly across the Cayman Islands and
western Cuba.  Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches are expected across
portions of western Cuba, with isolated higher totals up to 12
inches in areas of higher terrain. This will lead to areas of flash 
flooding and mudslides. Across the Cayman Islands additional 
rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected.
 
Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected for the Lower and
Middle Florida Keys.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Rafael, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels as much as 9 to
14 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along
the southern coast of Cuba in the Hurricane Warning area, including
the Isle of Youth.
 
The combination of a storm surge and the tide will cause normally
dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving
inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the following
heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Dry Tortugas...1-3 ft
Lower Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
TORNADOES: A couple of tornadoes are possible through tonight over
the Florida Keys and far southwestern Florida mainland.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael are expected to affect much of the
western Caribbean during the next day or so and will also spread
across most of the Gulf of Mexico from east to west late this week
into the weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 PM EST.
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM EST.

<title>Hurricane Rafael Forecast Discussion Number 13</title>

Hurricane Rafael Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
400 PM EST Wed Nov 06 2024
 
The radar and satellite presentation of Rafael continued to improve
after the release of the previous advisory with the eye becoming 
quite distinct around midday in geostationary satellite imagery.  
An Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft was able to fly a 
couple of passes through the center earlier this afternoon and 
measured a peak flight-level wind of 104 kt and an extrapolated 
minimum pressure of 956 mb.  The aircraft was unable to sample the 
northeastern quadrant where the maximum winds were likely located.  
Therefore, the initial intensity was increased to 100 kt on the 
1800 UTC intermediate advisory.  The 100-kt initial intensity is 
supported by a blend of the various UW/CIMSS objective Dvorak 
estimates, and UW/CIMSS SATCON which peaked near that value. Over 
the past few hours it appears that an eyewall replacement cycle is 
underway as the eye has become less distinct in satellite imagery, 
and radar data has shown the erosion of the smaller inner-eyewall. 

With the eyewall replacement ongoing, little additional change in 
strength is expected before Rafael makes landfall in western Cuba 
within the next hour or so.  Some weakening is expected as the 
storm crosses Cuba, but Rafael is likely to remain a hurricane over 
the southeastern and southern Gulf of Mexico during the next few 
days.  After that time, increasing southwesterly shear and 
significantly drier air are likely to result in weakening.  As 
noted earlier, there are some models that take Rafael southwestward 
late in the period over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico where 
environmental conditions could be less hostile.  If additional 
southward adjustments to the track forecast are needed on 
subsequent advisories, it is likely that some modest upward 
adjustments to the longer-range intensity may also be required.  

The initial motion estimate is northwestward or 320/11 kt.  Rafael 
is expected to continue to move around the southwestern side of
a mid-level ridge over the southwestern Atlantic during the next 
day or so.  After that time, the ridge is forecast to build 
westward over the eastern Gulf of Mexico which should cause Rafael 
to turn more westward over the southern Gulf of Mexico.  By 72 
hours, the spread in the track guidance increases once again, with 
the GFS showing a more northward solution than most of the 
remainder of the track guidance.  The NHC track forecast has been 
shifted southward once again to be in better agreement with the 
various consensus aids.  It is possible that future southward and 
southwestward adjustment will be needed as several of the models 
now show the cyclone moving west-southwestward over the southwestern 
Gulf by the end of the period.  
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Rafael is forecast to cross western Cuba as a major hurricane 
this afternoon and evening. A hurricane warning is in effect for 
this region, where a life-threatening storm surge, damaging 
hurricane-force winds, and destructive waves are expected.
 
2. Tropical-storm-force winds, especially in gusts, are expected in
the Lower and Middle Florida Keys beginning later today and tonight.
 
3. Rafael will bring areas of heavy rain to the Cayman Islands and
western Cuba through Thursday. Flash flooding and mudslides are
expected in areas of higher terrain in western Cuba.
 
4. Rafael is forecast to meander over the south-central Gulf of 
Mexico this weekend and early next week.  Interests in the southern 
and southwestern Gulf of Mexico should monitor the progress of this 
system.
