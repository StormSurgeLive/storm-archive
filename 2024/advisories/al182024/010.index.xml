The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Rafael, located just southeast of Little Cayman Island.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
An elongated trough of low pressure is producing disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms several hundred miles east-northeast of <br/>
the Leeward Islands.  A portion of this system is forecast to begin <br/>
moving westward by early Wednesday, and an area of low pressure <br/>
could form near the northern Leeward Islands by Wednesday night.  <br/>
Afterward, some slow development of this system is possible during <br/>
the latter part of the week while it moves generally westward, <br/>
passing near or north of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on <br/>
Thursday, and approaching the Southeast Bahamas by Friday.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM EST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rafael was 
located near latitude 19.7 North, longitude 80.4 West. Rafael is 
moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). A general 
northwestward motion is anticipated over the next day or so, 
followed by a gradual west-northwestward turn in the Gulf of Mexico. 
On the forecast track, Rafael is expected to pass through the Cayman 
Islands tonight, be near or over western Cuba on Wednesday, and move 
into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico by Wednesday night.
 
Aircraft dropsonde data indicates that maximum sustained winds have 
increased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher gusts. Additional 
rapid strengthening is forecast over the next 12-18 hours, and 
Rafael is now forecast to become a Category 2 hurricane before it 
makes landfall in Cuba on Wednesday. Rafael could briefly weaken 
over Cuba but is then expected to emerge into the southeastern Gulf 
of Mexico as a hurricane.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km). An observation site on Cayman Brac recently reported a 
wind gust of 80 mph (129 km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from aircraft dropsonde
observations is 985 mb (29.09 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the Cayman Islands
tonight and are also expected in western Cuba and the Isle of
Youth on Wednesday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in parts
of west-central Cuba and the lower and middle Florida Keys on
Wednesday and Wednesday night.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible farther east in central Cuba late tonight into Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Heavy rainfall will impact areas of the western Caribbean
through early Thursday, particularly across Jamaica and the Cayman
Islands into southern and western portions of Cuba. Rainfall totals
between 3 to 6 inches are expected, with isolated higher totals up
to 10 inches anticipated across areas of higher terrain, which could
lead to areas of flash flooding and mudslides.
 
Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected for the Lower and
Middle Florida Keys.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Rafael, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by 1 to 3 feet
above normal tide levels in the Cayman Islands tonight, and
could raise water levels by as much as 6 to 9 feet above normal
tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the southern coast of
Cuba in the Hurricane Warning area, including the Isle of Youth on
Wednesday.
 
The combination of a storm surge and the tide will cause normally
dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving
inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the following
heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Dry Tortugas...1-3 ft
Lower Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible Wednesday over the Florida 
Keys and far southwestern Florida mainland.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael are expected to affect much of the 
western Caribbean during the next few days and will also spread 
across most of the Gulf of Mexico from east to west late this week 
into the early part of the weekend. These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next intermediate advisory at 100 AM EST.
Next complete advisory at 400 AM EST.

<title>Hurricane Rafael Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Tropical Storm Rafael Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
400 PM EST Tue Nov 05 2024

Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft and 
radar data from Grand Cayman indicate that Rafael has developed an 
inner wind core during the past several hours.  The radar data shows 
the development of a ragged eye, and the Hurricane Hunter reported 
850-mb flight-level winds of 73 kt about 30-35 n mi northeast of the 
center. The aircraft also reported that the central pressure has 
fallen to near 989 mb.  Based on these data, the initial intensity 
is increased to 60 kt.  The wind radii have been revised some based 
on the aircraft data.
 
The initial motion is northwestward at 325/13 kt.  Rafael is
currently on the southwestern side of a low- to mid-level ridge over
the western Atlantic, and this feature should steer the cyclone
generally northwestward for the next 36-48 h, with the center 
passing near the Cayman Islands and over western Cuba. From 48-72 
h, the models are in better agreement that the center should turn 
more westward as the ridge builds a little westward along the 
northern Gulf coast.  After 72 h, there remains some significant 
spread in the track guidance, due partly to differences in how fast 
Rafael will shear apart and due partly to differences in the 
forecast strength of the ridge along the Gulf coast.  The GFS 
weakens the ridge and shows a northward turn, while the ECMWF keeps 
a stronger ridge and shows a more westward motion.  The 
deterministic UKMET has now changed to a northward turn scenario, 
but the HWRF, HMON, and UKMET ensemble mean join the ECMWF with a 
westward motion.  As mentioned with the previous forecast, until 
there is a clearer signal on which of these scenarios is more 
likely, the forecast compromises between these extremes with a slow 
turn toward the north over the northern Gulf of Mexico.
 
Now that Rafael has developed an inner wind core, conditions are 
favorable for steady to rapid strengthening during the next 24 h or 
so.  The system is expected to reach hurricane strength during 
the next several hours as it passes through the Cayman Islands with 
additional strengthening before it reaches Cuba.  While the peak 
intensity forecast is near the high end of the intensity guidance, 
there is a chance that Rafael could get stronger than currently 
forecast. Once the center is north of 25N in the Gulf of Mexico, 
the cyclone is likely to encounter increasing vertical wind shear, 
dry air entrainment, and cooler sea surface temperatures, which 
should lead to Rafael weakening and eventually shearing apart 
vertically. This part of the intensity forecast lies near or just 
above the intensity consensus.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Rafael is forecast to be a hurricane when it passes near or over 
the Cayman Islands during the next 12 hours, where damaging 
hurricane-force winds, a dangerous storm surge, and destructive 
waves are expected. Additional strengthening is expected before 
Rafael reaches western Cuba and the Isle of Youth on Wednesday. A 
hurricane warning is in effect for this region, where damaging 
hurricane-force winds, life-threatening storm surge, and destructive 
waves are also expected.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Lower and Middle 
Florida Keys beginning Wednesday and Wednesday night.
 
3. It is too soon to determine what, if any, impacts Rafael could
bring to portions of the northern Gulf Coast.  Residents in this
area should regularly monitor updates to the forecast.
 
4. Rafael will bring areas of heavy rain across portions of the 
western Caribbean through early Thursday, including  Jamaica and the 
Cayman Islands, along with southern and western portions of Cuba. 
Flash flooding and mudslides are possible along the higher terrain 
in Jamaica and Cuba.
