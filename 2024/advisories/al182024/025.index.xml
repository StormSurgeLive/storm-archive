...AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTERS FIND RAFAEL CONTINUES TO WEAKEN...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM CST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...25.2N 91.5W
ABOUT 290 MI...470 KM NNW OF PROGRESO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 6 MPH...9 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM CST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Rafael was
located near latitude 25.2 North, longitude 91.5 West. Rafael is
moving toward the west-northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h). The storm is
expected to slow down and meander over the central Gulf of Mexico
Sunday into Monday, then turn toward the south or south-southwest by
Monday night.

Data from the Air Force Hurricane Hunters indicate that maximum
sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts. Continued weakening is forecast through early next week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on aircraft data is
999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Rafael can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael will continue impacting portions of
the northern and western Gulf Coast through the weekend. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall indirectly associated with the moisture from
Rafael is expected to lead to 3 to 6 inches of rain, with local
amounts to 10 inches, across portions of the Upper Texas Coast into
Southwest and Central Louisiana through Sunday morning. This rain
will lead to potentially significant flash flooding.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM CST.

Tropical Storm Rafael Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
900 AM CST Sat Nov 09 2024
 
Rafael is a sheared tropical storm. High-resolution AMSR2 passive
microwave images received after the previous advisory showed the
northeastward tilt of the vortex with height. Recent data from the
Air Force Hurricane Hunters confirm the surface center lies on the
southwestern edge of the deep convective mass over the central Gulf
of Mexico. The strongest winds are likely confined to the northeast
quadrant of the storm underneath this sheared convection. Dropsonde
data indicate the central pressure has risen to around 999 mb, and
the initial intensity is lowered to 45 kt based on flight-level
winds from the aircraft.
 
The storm is likely to continue weakening due to unfavorable
environmental conditions. Moderate westerly shear (15-20 kt) through
Sunday and mid-level relative humidities falling below 40 percent
should make it difficult for Rafael to become better organized and
sustain deep convection going forward. Steady weakening is shown in
the NHC intensity forecast through Sunday, and Rafael is now
predicted to become a post-tropical remnant low in 48 h.
 
Rafael is moving west-northwestward (290/5 kt), but the storm is
expected to slow down and meander over the central Gulf of Mexico
within weakening steering currents during the next 24-36 h. As
Rafael becomes weak and shallow, the track guidance agrees on a turn
toward the south and south-southwest within the low-level flow
through the middle of next week. Only minor adjustments were made to
the NHC track forecast, which lies near the center of the guidance
envelope in good agreement with the TVCA simple consensus.
 
Rafael poses no direct threat to land, but swells from the storm are
still contributing to an elevated rip current risk along the
northern and western Gulf Coast. Also, the interaction of distant
moisture from Rafael with a slow-moving front will cause heavy
rainfall and potentially significant flash flooding across portions
of the Upper Texas Coast into Southwest and Central Louisiana
through Sunday morning.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Rafael are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions along the Gulf Coast through the
weekend.
