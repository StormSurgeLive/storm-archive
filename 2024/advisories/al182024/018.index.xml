900 PM CST Thu Nov 07 2024
 
...RAFAEL GETS A LITTLE BETTER ORGANIZED AS IT MOVES
WESTWARD OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM CST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.6N 87.1W
ABOUT 280 MI...455 KM NE OF PROGRESO MEXICO
ABOUT 635 MI...1025 KM E OF MOUTH OF THE RIO GRANDE
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...105 MPH...165 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 280 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...965 MB...28.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the southern and southwestern Gulf of Mexico should
monitor the progress of Rafael.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM CST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rafael was located
near latitude 24.6 North, longitude 87.1 West. Rafael is moving
toward the west near 9 mph (15 km/h), and a general westward to
west-northwestward motion at a slower forward speed is expected
through the weekend. On the forecast track, Rafael is expected to
move over the central Gulf of Mexico for the next few days.
 
Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate
that maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some small intensity fluctuations are possible tonight and
Friday. Weakening is forecast to begin on Friday night and continue
through the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure reported by the Hurricane
Hunter aircraft is 965 mb (28.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael are expected to spread across most
of the Gulf of Mexico during the next several days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM CST.

Hurricane Rafael Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
900 PM CST Thu Nov 07 2024
 
Satellite imagery this evening shows that Rafael has become better
organized, with the eye becoming more distinct and the cloud tops
in the eyewall getting colder. However, reports from an Air Force
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that this has not yet
resulted in strengthening. The central pressure is near 965 mb, and
a combination of 700-mb flight level winds and dropsonde data
supports an initial intensity of 90 kt.  Interestingly, this is at
the lower end of the various subjective and objective satellite
intensity estimates.
 
The initial motion is now 280/8 kt, and a general westward to
west-northwestward motion is expected during the next 48 h or so as
Rafael is steered by a building ridge to its north.  After that,
the track guidance is still quite divergent. The Canadian, NAVGEM, 
and COAMPS-TC models call for the cyclone to turn northward or 
northeastward toward the northern Gulf coast as it gets affected by 
the large deep-layer trough over the southwestern United States.  
The GFS, which previously supported this scenario, is now calling 
for a slow anticyclonic loop over the central Gulf of Mexico, and 
this is also the forecast of the GFS and UKMET ensemble means. The 
ECMWF, deterministic UKMET, and the GFS-based regional hurricane 
models still show a turn toward the southwest and south as a narrow 
ridge builds between the hurricane and the aforementioned trough.  
To add to the uncertainty, the GFS and ECWMF ensembles still have 
numerous tracks supporting both the northward and southward turns.  
Based on the continued guidance spread and continuity from the 
previous forecast, the new track forecast continues to lean toward 
the southward scenario, although the new track is a little slower 
than the previous track to match the overall slower set of guidance.
 
Rafael is currently in an area of light vertical wind shear, and
the hurricane is crossing a warm eddy in the Loop Current. This
combination should at least maintain the current intensity for the
next 12-24 h, and slight strengthening cannot be ruled out.  After
that, westerly shear is forecast to increase, and while the shear
is not likely to be strong it should help advect very dry air into
the circulation. This should cause Rafael to steadily weaken, and
the intensity forecast has been adjusted to show an increased
weakening rate between 24-60 h to better fit the trend of the
guidance.  The intensity forecast generally follows the faster
weakening rate of the global and GFS-based regional hurricane
models, as the statistical-dynamical models have a slower rate of
weakening.  It should be noted that if Rafael turns northward, it
would move over cooler sea surface temperatures and encounter
stronger shear, which would likely cause a faster weakening than
currently forecast.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Rafael are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions along the Gulf Coast for the next
few days.
 
2. Rafael is forecast to move slowly over the central Gulf of
Mexico this weekend and early next week. Interests in the southern
and southwestern Gulf of Mexico should monitor the progress of this
system.
