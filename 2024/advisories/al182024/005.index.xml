300 PM GMT Mon Nov 04 2024
 
Satellite images and satellite derived wind data indicate that the 
low-level center of Patty has become elongated, and opened into a 
trough over the northeastern Atlantic. Therefore, the system is no 
longer a tropical cyclone, and this is the last NHC advisory.

The remnants of Patty will turn toward the east-northeast later 
today. Between tonight and Tuesday, heavy rainfall across portions 
of Portugal and western Spain is possible from the remnants of 
Patty.

This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane 
Center on this system. Additional information on this system can be 
found in High Seas Forecasts issued by Meteo France under WMO 
header FQNT50 LFPW and available on the web at

header WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the Cayman Islands by 
Tuesday afternoon and are possible in western Cuba and the Isle of 
Youth on Wednesday. Tropical storm conditions are expected in 
Jamaica by late tonight and are possible in central Cuba, and in the 
lower and middle Florida Keys on Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Heavy rainfall will impact areas of the Western Caribbean 
with the heaviest rainfall occurring over Jamaica and portions of 
Cuba through mid-week. Rainfall totals between 3 to 6 inches with 
locally up to 9 inches are expected.  Flooding and mudslides could 
occur over portions of Jamaica and Cuba.

Heavy rainfall will spread north into Florida and adjacent areas of 
the Southeast United States mid to late week.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Tropical Storm Rafael, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE:  Minor coastal flooding is possible in Jamaica tonight.
Storm surge could raise water levels by 1-3 feet above normal tide
levels in the Cayman Islands on Tuesday, and could raise water
levels by as much as 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas
of onshore winds along the southern coast of Pinar del Rio, Cuba,
including the Isle of Youth.

The combination of a storm surge and the tide will cause normally 
dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving 
inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the following 
heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak 
surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Dry Tortugas...1-3 ft
Lower Florida Keys...1-2 ft

SURF:  Swells generated by the system are expected to affect much of 
the western Caribbean during the next few days. These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  
Please consult products from your local weather office. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Rafael Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
400 PM EST Mon Nov 04 2024
 
Deep convection continues to burst near the center of the system, 
with improving overall structure and curved banding depicted in 
recent satellite images. Recent Air Force Hurricane Hunter data has 
found flight level winds around 40-45 kt with higher SFMR values. 
The Hurricane Hunters also indicated that an eyewall appears to be 
developing. Based on the aircraft data, the intensity is being 
increased to 40 kt. The system is now designated as Tropical Storm 
Rafael, and is the seventeenth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane 
season.
 
The storm has jogged a bit to the right of the previous track,
and the initial motion is estimated 010/8 kt. A turn to the
northwest is expected later tonight, and that motion is forecast to
continue during the next few days as a ridge builds over the
southwestern Atlantic and northeastern Caribbean. This motion should
take the center of the system near Jamaica tonight, near or over the
Cayman Islands by late Tuesday, and across western Cuba on
Wednesday. After that time, when the system reaches the Gulf of
Mexico, the model solutions diverge, which appears to be due to
differences in the steering patterns and vertical depth of the
storm. The NHC track forecast is largely an update of the previous
one and remains close to the various consensus models.  However, it
should be noted that the track forecast over the Gulf of Mexico is
of lower confidence.
 
Given the improving overall structure with an inner core developing, 
combined with favorable environmental factors of low wind shear, 
high moisture, and warm SSTs all support intensification. Models all 
support steady to rapid intensification, and SHIPS RI probabilities 
indicate a near 40 percent chance of a 30 kt increase in the next 24 
hours and a near 50 percent chance of a 55 kt increase in 48 hours. 
Thus, the latest NHC intensity forecast and peak intensity has been 
increased and lies near the higher end of the guidance envelope 
through the middle part of the forecast period. Based on the 
SHIPS RI guidance, future upward intensity adjustments during the 
first 48 h may be necessary in subsequent forecast cycles. In a 
few days, when the system reaches the central Gulf, a sharp increase 
in southwesterly vertical wind shear, drier air, and slightly cooler 
waters should end the strengthening trend and induce weakening, and 
the NHC intensity forecast follows these weakening trends and lies 
near the HCCA and IVCN consensus aids through the end of the 
forecast period.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Rafael is forecast to be a hurricane when it passes near or over 
the Cayman Islands by Tuesday evening where damaging hurricane-force 
winds, a dangerous storm surge, and destructive waves are expected. 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in Jamaica tonight and 
Tuesday.

2. Additional strengthening is forecast before Rafael reaches 
western Cuba and the Isle of Youth on Wednesday where there is an 
increasing risk of a dangerous storm surge and damaging 
hurricane-force winds. 

3. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the Lower and Middle 
Florida Keys beginning late Wednesday or Wednesday night. 

4. It is too soon to determine what, if any, impacts Rafael could 
bring to portions of the northern Gulf coast.  Residents in this 
area should regularly monitor updates to the forecast.

5. Rafael will bring areas of heavy rain to portions of the western 
Caribbean, including Jamaica and Cuba through mid-week, where 
flooding and landslides are possible.  Heavy rainfall will spread 
into Florida and adjacent areas of the Southeast United States mid 
to late week.
