Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
700 PM EST Sun Nov 3 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Subtropical <br/>
Storm Patty, located over the northeastern Atlantic Ocean east of <br/>
the Azores Islands. <br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Potential <br/>
Tropical Cyclone Eighteen, located over the south-central portion of <br/>
the Caribbean Sea.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...near 100 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...near 100 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
An area of disturbed weather could develop from an interaction of <br/>
moisture with an upper-level trough digging near the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands around the middle of this week.  Some slow <br/>
subtropical or tropical development of this system is possible after <br/>
that time as it moves generally westward over the southwestern <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Near the Southeastern Bahamas:<br/>
A trough of low pressure continues to produce disorganized showers <br/>
and thunderstorms along with gusty winds over the southeastern <br/>
Bahamas and adjacent waters. This system is expected to be absorbed <br/>
into Potential Tropical Cyclone Eighteen (AL18) over the Caribbean <br/>
Sea by late Monday, and development before that time is no longer <br/>
anticipated. Regardless, locally heavy rains are possible during the <br/>
next couple of days across the Greater Antilles and the Bahamas.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
Public Advisories on Potential Tropical Cyclone Eighteen are issued <br/>
under WMO header WTNT33 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCPAT3. <br/>

Tropical Storm Patty Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172024
300 AM GMT Mon Nov 04 2024

Patty has continued producing deep convection since the time of the 
previous advisory, although the convective structure has recently 
degraded slightly on the latest infrared images.  The infrared 
satellite images and an 03/2138 UTC ASCAT pass depict a more compact 
cyclone with a confined radius of maximum winds than earlier in the 
system's life. Patty is also no longer co-located with the 
upper-level low that was earlier responsible for its hybrid 
characteristics. Based on these observations, Patty has made the 
transition into a tropical storm. The earlier ASCAT pass showed 
tropical storm force winds as high as 39 kt in the southern 
semicircle.  The initial intensity is therefore held at 40 kt.

The initial motion of the tropical storm is estimated to be 
eastward, or 085/17 kt.  Patty is expected to turn 
east-northeastward over the next day, and only a slight northward 
adjustment was made to the previous forecast, closer to the latest 
track consensus guidance.

All guidance insists Patty will weaken significantly during the next 
day or two as the cyclone encounters progressively colder 
sea-surface temperatures, stronger vertical wind shear and drier 
air.  Although the timing of when Patty is forecast to lose its 
convection and become post-tropical has been pushed back slightly, 
confidence is fairly high that the system will be falling apart and 
weakening in a day or two.  The various global models agree that 
Patty should open up into a trough and dissipate by hour 48, around 
the time that the circulation reaches the west coast of the Iberian 
Peninsula.  Due to orographic lifting, some rainfall impacts appear 
possible for portions of Portugal and Spain from Patty's remnants.

Key messages:

1. Between late Monday and Tuesday, heavy rainfall across portions 
of Portugal and western Spain is possible from Patty or its 
remnants.

<title>Potential Tropical Cyclone Eighteen Forecast Discussion Number 1</title>

Potential Tropical Cyclone Eighteen Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
400 PM EST Sun Nov 03 2024
 
The Air Force Hurricane Hunters have been investigating the 
disturbance over the south-central Caribbean Sea and their data 
indicates that the system has developed a closed center. However, 
deep convection is not quite organized enough to designate the 
system a tropical depression at this time. Given the potential for 
development and impacts to Jamaica and the Cayman Islands during the 
next day or two, advisories are being issued on Potential Tropical 
Cyclone Eighteen.
 
The initial motion is northeastward at 6 kt, but this is uncertain 
given that the system has only recently closed off. A turn to the 
north and then northwest is expected over the next couple of days as 
a mid-level ridge builds across the southwestern Atlantic and the 
eastern Caribbean. This motion should take the disturbance near 
Jamaica by late Monday and near or over the Cayman Islands and Cuba 
on Tuesday and Wednesday. The models are in relatively good 
agreement during that time period, and the official track forecast 
lies near the various consensus models. Once the system reaches the 
Gulf of Mexico by the middle of the week, the model solutions 
diverge due to differences in the predicted steering patterns and 
vertical depth of the system by that time. Therefore, the NHC track 
forecast during that time period is of notably lower confidence.
 
The environmental conditions appear conducive for strengthening 
during the next few days, and it seems likely that the system will 
become a tropical storm before it reaches Jamaica and a hurricane 
before it reaches Cuba. However, later in the week, southwesterly 
vertical wind shear and intrusions of dry air should end the 
strengthening process and likely induce some weakening once the 
system reaches the Gulf of Mexico. The hurricane regional models are 
very aggressive, however, their intensity predictions appear 
overdone, at least in the short term. The NHC intensity forecast is 
closer to the statistical-dynamical models DSHP and LGEM and near 
the IVCN consensus aid.  
 
 
Key Messages:

1. The disturbance is expected to become a tropical storm Monday and 
pass near Jamaica on Monday night and Tuesday where a Tropical Storm 
Warning is now in effect. The system is forecast to become a 
hurricane by Tuesday night and there is a risk of dangerous impacts 
from hurricane-force winds and storm surge in the Cayman Islands and 
portions of Cuba. 

2. Interests in the Florida Keys should closely monitor this system 
as tropical storm watches could be required for portions of the 
Florida Keys tonight or early Monday.

3. The system is forecast to approach the northern Gulf Coast as a 
tropical storm later this week, but given uncertainties in the 
long-range forecast, it is too soon to determine what, if any, 
impacts could occur. Residents in this area should regularly 
monitor updates to the forecast.

4. The system will bring areas of heavy rain across portions of the 
western Caribbean, including Jamaica and the southern and western 
portions of Cuba through mid-week. Flooding could occur over 
portions of Jamaica and Cuba, with mudslides possible. Heavy 
rainfall could then spread northward into Florida and adjacent 
areas of the Southeast United States during the middle to late 
portions of the week.
