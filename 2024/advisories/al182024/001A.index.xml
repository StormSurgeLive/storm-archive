Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
100 PM EST Sun Nov 3 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Subtropical <br/>
Storm Patty, located over the northeastern Atlantic Ocean just east <br/>
of the Azores Islands.<br/>
<br/>
Western Caribbean Sea (AL97):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms are showing signs of organization in <br/>
association with a low pressure system over the south-central <br/>
Caribbean Sea. This system is expected to become a tropical <br/>
depression during the next day or two as it moves generally <br/>
northward toward Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, and Cuba. Interests in <br/>
those locations should monitor the progress of this system as <br/>
tropical storm watches or warnings could be required later today or <br/>
tonight. Regardless of development, locally heavy rains are possible <br/>
across Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Cuba during the next few days. An <br/>
Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft is currently investigating this <br/>
system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Near the Southeastern Bahamas:<br/>
A trough of low pressure is producing disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms along with gusty winds over the southeastern Bahamas <br/>
and adjacent waters. Slow development of this system is possible <br/>
during the next day or so while it moves westward toward Cuba and <br/>
the Bahamas. This system is expected to be absorbed into the low <br/>
pressure area over the Caribbean Sea (AL97) by late Monday, ending <br/>
its chances of development. Regardless of formation, locally heavy <br/>
rains are possible during the next couple of days across the Greater <br/>
Antilles and the Bahamas.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
An area of disturbed weather is expected to develop near the <br/>
northern Leeward Islands around the middle of the week.  Some slow <br/>
development of this system is possible after that time as it moves <br/>
generally westward over the southwestern Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Subtropical Storm Patty Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172024
900 PM GMT Sun Nov 03 2024
 
After being devoid of deep convection for much of the day, 
thunderstorms have reformed near the center of Patty.  Therefore, 
Patty will hold its subtropical storm designation for now.  The 
initial intensity is held at 40 kt in deference to the earlier 
scatterometer data.  However, strong vertical wind shear, dry 
mid-latitude air, and cool sea surface temperatures should weaken 
Patty during the next couple of days.  No changes have been made to 
the latest NHC intensity forecast. 

The storm is moving eastward at 15 kt and is forecast to move 
eastward to east-northeastward for the next couple of days.  Patty 
is still expected to open into a trough near or over western Europe, 
and only minor adjustments have been made to the official track 
forecast.

----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...13.0N 76.9W
ABOUT 345 MI...555 KM S OF KINGSTON JAMAICA
ABOUT 520 MI...835 KM SSE OF GRAND CAYMAN

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Cayman Islands
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Jamaica
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within

Potential Tropical Cyclone Eighteen Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
400 PM EST Sun Nov 03 2024
 
The Air Force Hurricane Hunters have been investigating the 
disturbance over the south-central Caribbean Sea and their data 
indicates that the system has developed a closed center. However, 
deep convection is not quite organized enough to designate the 
system a tropical depression at this time. Given the potential for 
development and impacts to Jamaica and the Cayman Islands during the 
next day or two, advisories are being issued on Potential Tropical 
Cyclone Eighteen.
 
The initial motion is northeastward at 6 kt, but this is uncertain 
given that the system has only recently closed off. A turn to the 
north and then northwest is expected over the next couple of days as 
a mid-level ridge builds across the southwestern Atlantic and the 
eastern Caribbean. This motion should take the disturbance near 
Jamaica by late Monday and near or over the Cayman Islands and Cuba 
on Tuesday and Wednesday. The models are in relatively good 
agreement during that time period, and the official track forecast 
lies near the various consensus models. Once the system reaches the 
Gulf of Mexico by the middle of the week, the model solutions 
diverge due to differences in the predicted steering patterns and 
vertical depth of the system by that time. Therefore, the NHC track 
forecast during that time period is of notably lower confidence.
 
The environmental conditions appear conducive for strengthening 
during the next few days, and it seems likely that the system will 
become a tropical storm before it reaches Jamaica and a hurricane 
before it reaches Cuba. However, later in the week, southwesterly 
vertical wind shear and intrusions of dry air should end the 
strengthening process and likely induce some weakening once the 
system reaches the Gulf of Mexico. The hurricane regional models are 
very aggressive, however, their intensity predictions appear 
overdone, at least in the short term. The NHC intensity forecast is 
closer to the statistical-dynamical models DSHP and LGEM and near 
the IVCN consensus aid.  
 
 
Key Messages:

1. The disturbance is expected to become a tropical storm Monday and 
pass near Jamaica on Monday night and Tuesday where a Tropical Storm 
Warning is now in effect. The system is forecast to become a 
hurricane by Tuesday night and there is a risk of dangerous impacts 
from hurricane-force winds and storm surge in the Cayman Islands and 
portions of Cuba. 

2. Interests in the Florida Keys should closely monitor this system 
as tropical storm watches could be required for portions of the 
Florida Keys tonight or early Monday.

3. The system is forecast to approach the northern Gulf Coast as a 
tropical storm later this week, but given uncertainties in the 
long-range forecast, it is too soon to determine what, if any, 
impacts could occur. Residents in this area should regularly 
monitor updates to the forecast.

4. The system will bring areas of heavy rain across portions of the 
western Caribbean, including Jamaica and the southern and western 
portions of Cuba through mid-week. Flooding could occur over 
portions of Jamaica and Cuba, with mudslides possible. Heavy 
rainfall could then spread northward into Florida and adjacent 
areas of the Southeast United States during the middle to late 
portions of the week.
