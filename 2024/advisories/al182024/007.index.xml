DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM EST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Rafael was
located near latitude 17.0 North, longitude 78.0 West.  Rafael is
moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A generally
northwestward motion is anticipated over the next few days.  On the
forecast track, the storm is expected to move near Jamaica this
morning, be near or over the Cayman Islands tonight, and be near or
over western Cuba on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Steady to rapid intensification is forecast 
over the next 24 to 36 hours, and Rafael is forecast to become a 
hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean near the Cayman Islands 
with further strengthening before it makes landfall in Cuba.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 993 mb (29.33 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Rafael can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO
header WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the Cayman Islands by
this afternoon and are also expected in western Cuba and the Isle
of Youth on Wednesday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in
Jamaica through early this afternoon and are expected in parts of
west-central Cuba, possible farther east in central Cuba, and in
the lower and middle Florida Keys on Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Heavy rainfall will impact areas of the Western Caribbean 
through early Thursday, particularly across Jamaica and the Cayman 
Islands into southern and western portions of Cuba where rainfall 
totals between 3 to 6 inches are expected. Isolated higher totals up 
to 10 inches are anticipated across the higher terrain in Jamaica 
and Cuba, which could lead to areas of flash flooding and mudslides.

Heavy rainfall will spread north into Florida and adjacent areas of 
the Southeast United States during the middle to latter part of the 
week. Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected for the Lower 
and Middle Florida Keys. 

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Tropical Storm Rafael, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf

STORM SURGE:  Minor coastal flooding is possible in Jamaica tonight.
Storm surge could raise water levels by 1 to 3 feet above normal
tide levels in the Cayman Islands on Tuesday, and could raise water
levels by as much as 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas
of onshore winds along the southern coast of Cuba in the Hurricane
Warning area, including the Isle of Youth.
 
The combination of a storm surge and the tide will cause normally
dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving
inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the following
heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Dry Tortugas...1-3 ft
Lower Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible Wednesday over the Keys and
southwesternmost Florida mainland.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Rafael are expected to affect much of
the western Caribbean during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 AM EST.
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM EST.

<title>Tropical Storm Rafael Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Tropical Storm Rafael Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
400 AM EST Tue Nov 05 2024

Satellite imagery shows that Rafael is becoming better organized, 
with convective banding features becoming more prominent, 
especially over the eastern semicircle of the circulation.  Central 
convection is still a bit limited at this time, with a rather small 
Central Dense Overcast.  An earlier Air Force Hurricane Hunter 
mission indicated falling central pressure, with maximum  winds 
approaching 50 kt.  The current intensity is set at that value, 
which is slightly above the subjective Dvorak estimates, based on 
the increasing organization of the system.  Another Air Force 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft will investigate Rafael a little later 
this morning which should provide a good estimate on the strength of 
the tropical cyclone.

Rafael is moving northwestward, with an initial motion estimate of 
about 325/11 kt.  The tropical cyclone should continue this general 
motion for the next couple of days, crossing western Cuba and 
moving into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico.  The track guidance is 
in fairly good agreement for the first 48 hours of the period.  
Thereafter, the model tracks diverge with an increasing spread 
between the GFS and ECMWF solutions with time.  The ECMWF 
simulation shows a much stronger mid-level ridge over the 
southeastern U.S., resulting in Rafael moving into the western Gulf 
in the latter part of the period.  In contrast, the GFS model 
indicates that ridge will break down in 3-4 days, allowing the 
system to turn northward.  The official forecast lies roughly 
between these two possibilities and is fairly close to the model 
consensus.  This is just slightly west of the previous NHC track.  
Given the model spread, there is a less confidence than usual in the 
4-5 day forecast.

The storm is currently situated in an atmospheric and oceanic 
environment that is quite conducive for strengthening, with high 
oceanic heat content, low vertical wind shear, and high low- to 
mid-tropospheric humidity.  The various Rapid Intensification (RI) 
indices from our model guidance show a significant chance of RI 
during the next day or so, so the shorter-term official intensity 
forecast might be a bit conservative.  After Rafael moves into the 
Gulf of Mexico, however, drier air and stronger vertical wind shear 
should halt the strengthening process.  The official intensity 
forecast is on the high side of the guidance for the 3-5 day 
forecast, and is similar to the previous NHC prediction.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Rafael is forecast to be near hurricane intensity when it passes
near or over the Cayman Islands by tonight where damaging 
hurricane-force winds, a dangerous storm surge, and destructive
waves are expected. Rafael should reach western Cuba and the Isle of
Youth on Wednesday. A hurricane warning is in effect for this
region, where a dangerous storm surge and destructive waves are
also expected.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in Jamaica through early 
this afternoon. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the 
Lower and Middle Florida Keys beginning late Wednesday or Wednesday 
night.
 
3. It is too soon to determine what, if any, impacts Rafael could
bring to portions of the northern Gulf Coast.  Residents in this
area should regularly monitor updates to the forecast.
 
4. Rafael will bring areas of heavy rain across portions of the 
Western Caribbean through early Thursday, including the islands of 
Jamaica and the Caymans, along with southern and western portions of 
Cuba. Flash flooding and mudslides are possible along the higher 
terrain in Jamaica and Cuba. Heavy rainfall will spread north into 
Florida and adjacent areas of the Southeast United States mid to 
late week.
