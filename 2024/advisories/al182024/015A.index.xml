Near the Leeward Islands:<br/>
A trough of low pressure over the northern Leeward Islands continues <br/>
to produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Some gradual <br/>
development of this system is possible during the next couple of <br/>
days while it moves westward near the Greater Antilles. Regardless <br/>
of development, locally heavy rains are possible across the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and <br/>
the southeastern Bahamas through Saturday.<br/>

--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Tropical Storm Warning for the Dry Tortugas has been 
discontinued.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.

Interests in the southern and southwestern Gulf of Mexico should 
monitor the progress of Rafael.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM EST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Rafael was located 
near latitude 24.3 North, longitude 84.9 West. Rafael is moving 
toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A turn toward the west at 
a slower forward speed is expected later today, with this general 
motion continuing through Saturday. On the forecast track, Rafael is 
expected to move over the southern Gulf of Mexico for the next few 
days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Some weakening is anticipated during the next few days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115
miles (185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on aircraft data is 
970 mb (28.64 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Rafael can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Additional rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches are expected
today, leading to storm total accumulations of 12 inches across
portions of western Cuba. This may lead to areas of flash flooding
and mudslides, especially along the higher terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Rafael, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael are expected to spread across most
of the Gulf of Mexico from east to west during the next several
days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM EST.

Hurricane Rafael Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
400 AM EST Thu Nov 07 2024
 
Satellite images show that Rafael remains fairly well-organized, 
with very cold convective cloud tops, although the Central Dense 
Overcast is a bit ragged looking.  Convective banding features are 
limited and no eye is evident on the imagery at this time.  
Upper-level outflow is restricted over the western semicircle of the 
circulation, indicative of some westerly vertical wind shear over 
the tropical cyclone.  An earlier Air Force Hurricane Hunter mission 
into the system measured 700 mb flight-level winds of 101 kt in the 
northeast quadrant which equates to a peak surface wind of about 90 
kt.  This  intensity is also supported by a blend of the latest 
subjective and objective Dvorak estimates.  Another Air Force 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate Rafael later 
this morning. 

The hurricane continues to move away from western Cuba with an 
initial motion of about 305/10 kt.  Rafael is located on the 
southwest side of mid-level ridge over the western Atlantic 
and the Florida Peninsula.  Most of the global models guidance 
shows this ridge building westward, albeit weakly, over the 
Gulf of Mexico during the next few days.  As a result, Rafael 
should turn westward with some decrease in forward speed during the 
next 2-3 days.  Then, the majority of the models show a ridge 
building to the west of the system.  This steering evolution would 
cause Rafael to turn more southward, and this is shown by the 
dynamical model consensus track prediction.  The new official 
forecast is adjusted to the left of the previous NHC track but is 
not as far south as the consensus.  The motion is likely to be 
quite slow during the latter part of the forecast period.  There 
remains significant uncertainty in the future track of Rafael over 
the Gulf of Mexico and additional adjustments to subsequent official 
track forecasts are likely.

Southwesterly vertical wind shear should continue to affect Rafael, 
although the latest SHIPS model output does not show very strong 
shear over the system during the next several days.  However, the 
numerical guidance does indicate very dry air around Rafael through 
the forecast period, which should induce weakening. If the system 
moves farther south over the Gulf than currently anticipated, it 
could encounter lower wind shear, and likely a more moist air mass.  
This could result in Rafael maintaining its intensity more than 
currently expected.  For now, the official intensity forecast is 
similar to the previous one and calls for weakening later in the 
period.  This is similar to the latest model consensus.


Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical-storm-force winds are expected in the Dry Tortugas 
through this morning.
 
2. Hurricane Rafael will continue to bring periods of heavy rain to 
western Cuba today.  Flash flooding and mudslides are possible along 
the higher terrain.
 
3. Rafael is forecast to meander over the south-central Gulf of
Mexico this weekend and early next week.  Interests in the southern
and southwestern Gulf of Mexico should monitor the progress of this
system.
