...SHEARED RAFAEL BECOMING LESS ORGANIZED...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM CST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...25.5N 91.7W
ABOUT 315 MI...510 KM NNW OF PROGRESO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Rafael was 
located near latitude 25.5 North, longitude 91.7 West. Rafael is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h). The storm is 
expected to slow down and meander over the central Gulf of Mexico 
through Sunday night, then turn toward the south and south-southwest 
on Monday and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is expected through early next week. Rafael is forecast to
degenerate to a post-tropical remnant low by early Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Rafael can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael will continue impacting portions of
the northern and western Gulf Coast through the weekend. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall indirectly associated with the moisture from
Rafael is expected to lead to 3 to 6 inches of rain, with local
amounts to 10 inches, across portions of Southwest and Central
Louisiana through Sunday morning. This rain will lead to potentially
significant flash flooding.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM CST.

Tropical Storm Rafael Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
300 PM CST Sat Nov 09 2024
 
The center of Rafael has become exposed to the southwest of its
associated convective mass in visible satellite images. The
low-level circulation is becoming broader and less defined, and the
cold overcast from the sheared convection has contracted and warmed
this afternoon. Overall, the storm appears less organized as it
contends with westerly shear and a dry mid-level environment. A
partial ASCAT pass showed 35-40 kt winds in the northeast quadrant,
but may not have sampled the area of strongest winds. The initial
intensity is held at 45 kt, which is consistent with a blend of the
latest subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates.
 
The storm should continue weakening tonight due to the negative
effects of increasing westerly shear and continued intrusions of dry
mid-level air. In fact, the latest simulated satellite imagery from
the GFS and ECMWF models suggest Rafael could become devoid of
convection as early as Sunday. The official NHC forecast now shows
post-tropical/remnant low status at 36 h, but further timing
adjustments could be necessary if current trends continue. Rafael is
beginning to slow down (300/4 kt), and the storm is likely to
meander within weakening steering currents over the central Gulf of
Mexico tonight and Sunday. Then, the shallow vortex should become
steered by the prevailing low-level flow on Monday and move toward
the south and south-southwest through the middle of next week. Most
of the guidance shows the remnant low spinning down and opening into
a trough over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico late in the 5-day
forecast period, and the NHC forecast shows dissipation by 120 h.
 
Rafael poses no direct threat to land, but swells from the storm are 
still contributing to an elevated rip current risk along the 
northern and western Gulf Coast. Also, the interaction of distant 
moisture from Rafael with a slow-moving front will cause heavy 
rainfall and potentially significant flash flooding across portions 
of Southwest and Central Louisiana through Sunday morning.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Rafael are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions along the Gulf Coast through the
weekend.
