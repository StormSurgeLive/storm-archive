...RAFAEL DEGENERATES TO A POST-TROPICAL REMNANT LOW...
...THIS IS THE FINAL NHC ADVISORY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM CST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...26.1N 91.3W
ABOUT 345 MI...560 KM NNW OF PROGRESO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...E OR 90 DEGREES AT 3 MPH...6 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1006 MB...29.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Rafael 
was located near latitude 26.1 North, longitude 91.3 West. The 
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east near 3 mph (6 km/h). 
The remnant low is expected to meander over the central Gulf of 
Mexico through tonight, then turn toward the south and 
south-southwest on Monday and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) with 
higher gusts. The remnant low is forecast to dissipate by Tuesday 
night.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under 
AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the web at 
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF: Swells will continue impacting portions of the northern and
western Gulf Coast through Monday. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane 
Center on Rafael. Additional information on this system can be found 
in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under

Post-Tropical Cyclone Rafael Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
300 PM CST Sun Nov 10 2024
 
The limited convection that Rafael was producing in its eastern 
semicircle has collapsed. Surface observations, visible satellite 
images, and a 1530z ASCAT-C pass show the surface circulation has 
become poorly defined and very elongated in the north-south 
direction. Since Rafael does not possess a well-defined center or 
organized convection, it no longer meets the definition of a 
tropical cyclone. This will be the final NHC advisory on Rafael.

The remnant low is expected to drift eastward over the central Gulf 
of Mexico tonight, then turn toward the south and southwest on 
Monday and Tuesday. The forecast calls for dissipation by Tuesday 
night, but this could occur even sooner if current trends continue. 
The elevated rip current risk along the northern and western Gulf 
Coast will likely continue into Monday. For more information, see 
products from your local NWS forecast office.

Additional information can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by 
the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO 
header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions along portions of the Gulf Coast through Monday.
