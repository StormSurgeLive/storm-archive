...RAFAEL REMAINS SHEARED AND DISORGANIZED...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM CST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...25.7N 91.7W
ABOUT 330 MI...530 KM NNW OF PROGRESO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 325 DEGREES AT 3 MPH...6 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1002 MB...29.59 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM CST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Rafael was
located near latitude 25.7 North, longitude 91.7 West. Rafael is
moving toward the northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h). The storm is
expected to meander over the central Gulf of Mexico through Sunday 
night, then turn toward the south and south-southwest on Monday and 
Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is expected through early next week, and Rafael is 
forecast to degenerate to a post-tropical remnant low on Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Rafael can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF: Swells generated by Rafael will continue impacting portions of
the northern and western Gulf Coast through the weekend. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Rainfall indirectly associated with the moisture from 
Rafael is expected to lead to 3 to 6 inches of rain, with local 
amounts to 10 inches, across portions of Southwest and Central 
Louisiana through Sunday morning.  This rain will lead to 
potentially significant flash flooding.

 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM CST.

Tropical Storm Rafael Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182024
900 PM CST Sat Nov 09 2024
 
Rafael remains sheared this evening, with the remaining convection 
located to the northeast of the exposed low-level center. The 
circulation center itself is broad and appears to have multiple 
small vorticity center embedded in it. The initial intensity is 
decreased to 40 kt based on a blend of the various subjective and 
objective satellite intensity estimates. These winds are likely 
occurring in the area of convection northeast of the center and 
northwest of buoy 42001. 

The initial motion is now a slow 325/3. during the next 36 h or so, 
Rafael should make a small clockwise loop over the central Gulf of 
Mexico.  After that time, the low-level flow should steer the 
cyclone or its remnants southward and southwestward.  One change in 
the track guidance is that that the GFS and HWRF models turn the 
system move westward after 60 h and wind up to the north of the rest 
of the guidance.  Overall, the new forecast track is little changed 
from the previous track and lies near the consensus models.

Rafael should continue to weaken due to a combination of 
southwesterly shear and dry air entrainment.  Simulated satellite 
imagery from the GFS and ECMWF continue to indicate that the 
associated convection will dissipate between 24-36 h, with the 
circulation becoming elongated.  Based on this, the intensity 
forecast calls for the cyclone to degenerate to a remnant low 
pressure area by 36 h, with final dissipation by 120 h as suggested 
by most of the global models. The new intensity forecast has only 
minor tweaks from the previous forecast.

Rafael poses no direct threat to land, but swells from the storm are
still contributing to an elevated rip current risk along the
northern and western Gulf Coast. Also, the interaction of distant
moisture from Rafael with a slow-moving front will cause heavy
rainfall and potentially significant flash flooding across portions
of Southwest and Central Louisiana through Sunday morning.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Rafael are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions along the Gulf Coast through the
weekend.
