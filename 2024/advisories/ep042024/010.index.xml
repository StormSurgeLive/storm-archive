Tropical Storm Fabio Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
800 AM MST Mon Aug 05 2024
 
Satellite imagery this morning indicates that the disturbance 
located well southwest of the southwestern coast of Mexico has 
continued to become better organized, and that it now has sufficient 
convection and a well-enough defined circulation to be considered a 
tropical cyclone.  With an initial intensity of 35 kt based on 
earlier scatterometer data, advisories are being initiated on 
Tropical Storm Fabio.

The initial motion is a somewhat uncertain 310/10.  Fabio's motion 
should be dominated by interaction with Tropical Storm Emilia to 
the west, with Fabio expected to move northwestward and westward at 
an increased forward speed around the north side of Emilia through 
the next 48 h.  

The intensity forecast is based on the global model forecasts 
that Fabio will wind up being absorbed into Emilia in the not 
too distant future.  Some strengthening is expected during the next 
12-24 h.  After that, the global models are forecasting that Fabio 
will dissipate as it is absorbed into Emilia by the 60 h point.  
The intensity forecast and dissipation time lean toward the GFS and 
Canadian model solutions, which keep Fabio separate from Emilia 
through about 48 h.  This forecast is low confidence due to the 
possibility that Fabio could try to absorb Emilia.

with a slight decrease in forward speed is expected today. A 
west-southwestward motion is expected on Tuesday until Carlotta 
dissipates.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours. Weakening is 
expected. Carlotta could become a post-tropical low at any time and 
is forecast to dissipate near the middle of this week.

Tropical Storm Carlotta Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024

If not for a recent small burst of convection nearly 60 n mi from 
its center, Carlotta would be devoid of organized deep convection. 
The intensity estimate remains 40 kt, close to a recent UW-CIMSS 
SATCON estimate. Deep convection may persist today, but could cease 
at just about any time due to cold waters beneath Carlotta and a 
surounding dry and stable environment. By this time tomorrow, 
Carlotta should be a post-tropical cyclone.

Carlotta's initial motion remains 280/8kt. This general motion 
should continue today as long as Carlotta maintains some deep 
convection. A slight left turn toward the west-southwest should 
begin once the last of Carlotta's convection is gone. No significant 
changes were made to the NHC track or intensity forecasts.

Tropical Depression Daniel Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042024
200 PM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024
 
A recent ASCAT-B pass over Daniel this afternoon revealed that
Daniel barely has a closed circulation and its maximum winds
have decreased to 30 kt, making Daniel a tropical depression.
Daniel's convective organization is also lacking, but it has
produced persistent deep convection over its center for the past
several hours.
 
Little change was made to the NHC forecast. Daniel should 
weaken and wrap cyclonically around the larger and more robust 
circulation of Carlotta during the next couple of days. Global 
models indicate that Daniel could open into a trough at any time, 
Even if it maintains its circulation, its unlikely to maintain its 
organized deep convection beyond tonight. Therefore the largest 
change in the NHC forecast is to show Daniel becoming a remnant low 
tonight or early tomorrow and dissipating soon after that.

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
800 AM MST Mon Aug 05 2024

Satellite imagery shows that Emilia remains a sheared cyclone this 
morning, with the low-level center located near the northeastern 
edge of a large convective mass with cloud tops to near -85C.  The 
various subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates have 
nudged upward to the 35-40 kt range, and the initial intensity is 
set at 40 kt.

The latest global model runs continue to suggest that Emilia will be 
the survivor in interaction with the newly formed Tropical Storm 
Fabio to the east, and the intensity forecast is based on this 
scenario and the expectation of continued moderate easterly shear.  
The forecast follows the trend of the intensity guidance and 
forecasts a peak intensity of 60 kt in 48 h.  After that time, 
Emilia is expected to slowly weaken as it moves over decreasing sea 
surface temperatures.  The new forecast is basically an update of 
the previous forecast.  It should be noted that this forecast is low 
confidence due to the possibility that Fabio might still end up as 
the dominant cyclone.

Interaction with Fabio should steer Emilia south-southwestward to 
southward for the next 12 h or so.  After that, a turn toward the 
northwest or north-northwest with an increase in forward speed is 
expected as Emilia start to absorb Fabio.  After Fabio dissipates in 
about 60 h, Emilia should generally move west-northwestward on the 
south side of a low- to mid-level ridge to the north.  The first 96 
h of the forecast track have been adjusted somewhat based on the GFS 
and Canadian model forecasts of the interaction between Emilia and 
Fabio.
