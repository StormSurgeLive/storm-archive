Tropical Storm Carlotta Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
200 AM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024
 
A diminishing area of fragmented moderate convection is all that
remains of Carlotta's cloud pattern this morning.  The advisory's
initial intensity is lowered to 40 kt and is just above the
consensus of the various UW-CIMSS objective intensity guidance.  
Carlotta should continue to spin down through the period gradually 
and could become a post-tropical cyclone later today if these
convective trends continue.  If not, the cyclone is forecast to
become a remnant low on Tuesday and dissipate by the end of the
week, which is shown explicitly in the NHC intensity forecast.
 
Carlotta's initial motion is estimated to be a little to the right 
of due west or 280/8 kt, and is forecast to continue moving in 
this general direction today.  Through the remainder of the period, 
Carlotta should slow some in forward speed while turning toward the 
west-southwest on Tuesday and degenerating into a post-tropical 
remnant low.  Dissipation is forecast to occur during the next 
couple of days while the remnant low traverses cooler sea surface 
temperatures and moves through a dry/stable marine-layer air mass.

There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM PDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Daniel was
located near latitude 14.8 North, longitude 128.7 West. Daniel is
moving toward the east-northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this 
motion is forecast to continue through Monday, followed by a turn 
toward the north and northwest on Monday night and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Small intensity fluctuations are possible during the next day or 
so. Daniel is forecast to become a post-tropical remnant low on
Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).

Tropical Storm Daniel Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042024
200 AM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024
 
A 05/0422 UTC GPM/GMI microwave pass and GOES proxy-vis imagery
indicate that Daniel's structure continues deteriorating due to
the disrupting dominant monsoonal flow.  Despite the advantageous
microwave image, it has become increasingly difficult to pinpoint 
the cyclone's surface circulation center.
 
Some fluctuations in Daniel's strength are possible today while the 
cyclone continues its trek over warm waters and remains within a 
modest wind shear environment.  Afterward, the cyclone should move 
counter-clockwise around the eastern periphery of the larger 
Carlotta.  During that time, SHIPS statistical intensity guidance 
and the global models show increasing dry air entrainment, 
prompting the cyclone to weaken through the remainder of the 
forecast period.  The official intensity forecast agrees with the 
HCCA and IVCN intensity consensus guidance and is similar to the 
previous advisory.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be east-northeastward, 060/10 
kt, and this general motion within the low to mid-level 
southwesterly monsoonal flow should continue through today.  After 
that time, global and regional models indicate that Daniel will 
move into the eastern periphery of Carlotta's cyclonic flow, 
resulting in a turn toward the north and northwest while spinning 
down to a remnant low on Tuesday and eventually opening up into a 
trough on Thursday.  The NHC track forecast is an update to the 
previous one and closely follows the HCCA and TVCE consensus models.

...DEPRESSION STRENGTHENS TO TROPICAL STORM EMILIA...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 PM MST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.0N 113.2W
ABOUT 585 MI...945 KM SSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...SSW OR 200 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1003 MB...29.62 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM MST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Emilia was
located near latitude 15.0 North, longitude 113.2 West. Emilia is
moving toward the south-southwest near 5 mph (7 km/h) and this
motion is expected to continue through Monday. A sharp turn towards 
the northwest or north-northwest is expected by early Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast during the next day or two. The 
cyclone will then begin to interact with a large disturbance 
approaching from the east, which is expected to cause this system to 
dissipate or merge with the large disturbance in a few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
800 PM MST Sun Aug 04 2024
 
The organization of the tropical cyclone has improved on satellite 
imagery since the previous advisory.  The subjective CI numbers from 
TAFB and SAB are both T-2.5/35 kt, and the CIMSS objective intensity 
estimates range from 33 to 35 kt.  Earlier ASCAT data from around 17 
UTC had peak wind vectors of 31 kt, and the organization on 
satellite imagery has certainty improved since that time, with the 
cyclone becoming more compact.  Based on the Dvorak estimates, the 
depression is upgraded to Tropical Storm Emilia with an initial 
intensity of 35 kt.

The track forecast for Emilia is very dependent on a disturbance to 
the east of the system (Invest 96E), which has a high chance of 
becoming a tropical cyclone over the next day or so. Most of the 
global models show both systems interacting with and rotating 
cyclonically around each other.  Emilia should move to the 
south-southwest for the next 24 h, while it is located to the west 
of 96E.  After that time, the larger circulation of 96E should pull 
the smaller Emilia toward the northwest or north-northwest.  Only 
minor changes were made to the previous NHC track forecast.  96E 
and Emilia should merge together into one cyclone over the next 
couple of days, but it is uncertain which cyclone will be dominant 
and which cyclone will be absorbed.  This forecast assumes that 96E 
will absorb Emilia, with Emilia dissipating beyond 48 h.  However, 
it is quite possible that the opposite occurs, with Emilia absorbing 
96E.  Either way, I expect a tropical cyclone (the merged system) to 
be moving west-northwestward in 3 to 4 days, spreading tropical 
storm conditions across the open waters of the Pacific.  The ECMWF 
model shows the two systems merging in 36-48 h, but the latest GFS 
model predicts a longer binary interaction, with the merger 
occurring in 3 to 4 days.  
 
Until the disturbance to the east starts to interact with Emilia, 
the environment appears favorable for intensification, and the 
intensity guidance has trended upward this cycle.  The new NHC 
forecast shows Emilia strengthening to a 55 kt tropical storm in 36 
h.  This is near, or slightly below the middle of the intensity 
guidance envelope.  The thinking is that Emilia will merge with 96E 
after that time, and 96E will likely be a tropical storm at the 
time of the merger.
