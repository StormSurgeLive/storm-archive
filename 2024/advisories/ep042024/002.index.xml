Hurricane Carlotta Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
800 AM PDT Sat Aug 03 2024
 
This morning Carlotta might be near or just past its peak intensity.
The smaller inner-core we had been observing over the last day or so
has become a bit broader, with an AMSR-2 microwave pass at 0943 UTC
showing that an eyewall replacement cycle has been underway.
Intensity estimates this morning are about the same as they were
last night, and given the structural evolution seen on satellite,
the initial intensity is being held at 80 kt.
 
Carlotta continues to move westward to west-northwestward at
285/12-kt. A gradual slow down in the hurricane's forward motion is
expected over the next few days as it reaches the westward extent of
a deep-layer ridge. After that time, Carlotta is expected to become
more vertically shallow, which should ultimately cause the cyclone
to turn back westward towards the end of the forecast period. Only
minor adjustments were made in the forecast track this cycle, and
the latest NHC forecast remains in good agreement with the consensus
aids which are tightly clustered with the overall model guidance.
 
With the aforementioned eyewall replacement cycle ongoing, Carlotta
has likely run out of time to intensify much more in the short-term,
especially since the hurricane will be crossing the 26 C isotherm in
12 hours. Thus, no more intensification is shown in the latest NHC
forecast, with gradual weakening expected to begin on Sunday. This
weakening will likely be hastened by an abrupt increase in
southwesterly vertical wind shear after 24 h as indicated by the
SHIPS guidance, and Carlotta is likely to become a remnant low
before the end of the forecast period as its remaining organized
convection dissipates as seen in simulated IR from the GFS/ECMWF.
The NHC intensity forecast is in good agreement with the intensity
consensus aids.

Tropical Storm Daniel Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042024
800 AM PDT Sat Aug 03 2024
 
Over the last several days, we have been monitoring the area of low 
pressure located in the western part of the east Pacific basin, 
currently near 130W. The deep convection with the system has been 
pulsing during this time, and has been showing evidence of 
organization. In fact, TAFB has been providing Dvorak intensity 
estimates of CI-2.0/30 kt over the past day, and SAB more recently 
provided a Data-T of 2.0/30 kt at 12 UTC. Overnight, scatterometer 
wind data showed a well-defined circulation and peak winds of 
35-40 kt west of the center. Some of these winds may have been 
rain- inflated, but the coverage was broad enough that it is likely 
that tropical storm force winds exist with the circulation. The 
combination of these data suggest that the low has become a Tropical 
Storm, and advisories are being initiated on Daniel with an 
intensity of 35 kt. 
 
The tropical storm has been meandering, but the current motion is 
estimated to be slowly off to the northwest at 315/4 kt. Over the 
next day or two, Daniel is expected to be embedded in southwesterly 
monsoonal flow that is shifting northward ahead of Hurricane 
Carlotta. This flow is expected to result in Daniel soon turning 
northward and then northeastward as it remains embedded in this 
flow. After 48 h, The storm may pivot back toward the north and 
north-northwest as it becomes captures by Carlotta's larger outer 
circulation. The track guidance does have a significant amount of 
spread beyond 48 h related to how much Carlotta captures the smaller 
Daniel, with the initial track forecast electing to go in between 
the HCCA and TCVE consensus aids, which also roughly splits the 
difference between the GFS and ECMWF tracks.
 
The environment Daniel has been and will be embedded in is not very 
favorable for much additional intensification, with moderate 
northeasterly vertical wind shear and dry mid-level relative 
humidity. Only a modest amount of strengthening is shown in the 
short-term, and ultimately Daniel is likely to get caught up in 
Carlotta's circulation, finally being absorbed by the larger cyclone 
after day 3. The NHC intensity forecast is in good agreement with 
the guidance, close to SHIPS and HCCA intensity aids.
