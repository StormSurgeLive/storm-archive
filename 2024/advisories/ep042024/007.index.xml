Tropical Storm Carlotta Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
800 PM PDT Sun Aug 04 2024
 
Conventional satellite imagery shows only a few fragments of deep 
convection remaining this evening, just to the northeast of the 
surface circulation center.  Consequently, the cyclone is too weak 
to classify based on the Dvorak satellite intensity technique.  The 
initial intensity is based on a blend of the UW-CIMSS objective 
current intensity guidance, which yields 45 kt.  
 
Carlotta's initial motion is estimated to be west-northwestward, or 
285/8 kt, and should continue moving in this trajectory with 
some increase in forward speed during the next day or so.  
Afterward, the cyclone is expected to slow down a bit while turning
west-southwestward on Tuesday as it weakens further and becomes a 
post-tropical remnant low.  Dissipation is forecast to occur in 60 
hours, or possibly sooner, while the remnant low moves over cooler 
water and through a dry/stable air mass.

Tropical Storm Daniel Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042024
800 PM PDT Sun Aug 04 2024
 
Daniel's cloud pattern this evening is characterized by a few 
intermittently bursting deep convective clusters surrounding the 
poorly defined and elongated surface circulation.  The satellite 
intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB remained unchanged, and the 
initial intensity is held at 35 kt. 
 
Warm oceanic surface temperatures and a modest wind shear
environment should allow for some slight strengthening through
Monday.  While the cyclone moves in a counter-clockwise motion
around the eastern periphery of more prominent Carlotta, increasing 
dry air entrainment is expected to induce a weakening trend through 
the forecast period.  The NHC intensity forecast shows Daniel 
becoming a remnant low on Tuesday and dissipating on Wednesday.
 
The cyclone's initial motion is estimated to be northeastward, 
050/8 kt, and this general motion within the low to mid-level
southwesterly monsoonal flow should continue through Monday.
Afterward, global models agree that Daniel will move into the
eastern periphery of Carlotta's cyclonic flow, resulting in
a turn north and northwestward before it degenerates into an open
trough on Thursday, or sooner.  The official forecast track 
follows suit and is similar to the previous advisory and the 
various consensus aids.

...DEPRESSION DRIFTING AND HAS AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM MST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.5N 113.2W
ABOUT 555 MI...890 KM SSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...S OR 190 DEGREES AT 2 MPH...4 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1007 MB...29.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Five-E 
was located near latitude 15.5 North, longitude 113.2 West. The 
depression is drifting toward the south near 2 mph (4 km/h) and a 
slow generally southward motion is expected to continue into Monday. 
A sharp turn back toward the north or northwest is possible by 
Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Slow strengthening is expected and the depression forecast to become 
a tropical storm tonight or tomorrow. The cyclone will then begin to 
interact with a large disturbance approaching from the east, which 
is expected to cause this system to dissipate or merge with the 
large disturbance in a few days.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None

Tropical Depression Five-E Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
200 PM MST Sun Aug 04 2024

The depression has changed little in organization today, as a broad 
area of showers and thunderstorms with some modest banding is 
present on the western side of the low-level circulation. Subjective 
Dvorak intensity estimates and a partial ASCAT-C pass at 1747 UTC 
both suggest that the initial intensity remains 30 kt this 
afternoon. 

The track forecast for TD Five-E is very dependent on a disturbance 
to the east of the system (96E), which has a high chance of becoming 
a tropical cyclone over the next day or so. Most of the global 
models show both of these systems interacting with and rotating 
cyclonically around each other. A variety of different model 
solutions are depicted, from TD Five-E becoming absorbed by the 
larger 96E, to TD Five-E remaining dominant, or a near equal merger 
of both systems in the 48-60 h forecast time frame. For this cycle, 
the NHC track forecast still shows TD Five-E being absorbed by 96E 
and dissipating beyond 48 h, though this is far from certain. It is 
possible one of the other two scenarios mentioned above could pan 
out. Most of the track guidance due to the interaction initially 
show a southward motion that swings rapidly back north or northwest 
over the next couple of days before the vortex trackers cannot 
distinguish between the two systems. As mentioned this morning 
though, dynamical models historically handle interaction cases like 
this poorly, so confidence in the track forecast is quite low, 
despite the agreement between the dynamical guidance of this binary 
interaction. 

Until the disturbance to the east starts to interact with TD Five-E, 
the environment appears relatively favorable for some 
intensification, and the NHC intensity forecast shows strengthening 
into a 45 kt tropical storm over the next 24-36 h, prior to the 
system's forecast absorption. Note that the interaction of the two 
systems also results in a dramatic expansion of the 34-kt wind radii 
by 48 h, which should be considered more of the combined wind field 
of both features.
