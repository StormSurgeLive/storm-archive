Tropical Weather Outlook...Corrected<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 AM PDT Sun Aug 4 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Corrected to update active systems and include statement for gale <br/>
warnings for EP96.<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
downgraded Tropical Storm Carlotta, located several hundred miles to <br/>
the west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California <br/>
peninsula, and on Tropical Storm Daniel, located more than one <br/>
thousand miles to the west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja <br/>
California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
South of Southwestern Mexico (EP96):<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity has increased with a broad area of <br/>
low pressure located a few hundred miles south of southwestern <br/>
Mexico. Environmental conditions remain conducive for gradual <br/>
development, and a tropical depression is likely to form during the <br/>
next day or two while the system moves generally west-northwestward <br/>
at 10 to 15 mph, remaining well offshore of the coast of Mexico. For <br/>
more information of this system, including Gale Warnings, see High <br/>
Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South-Southwest of the Baja California Peninsula (EP97):<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity is showing signs of organization <br/>
with an area of low pressure located several hundred miles to the <br/>
south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California <br/>
peninsula. Environmental conditions appear conducive for development <br/>
over the next day or two, and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form during that time while the system meanders within weak steering <br/>
currents. Thereafter, the system is forecast to interact with the <br/>
disturbance (EP96) to its southeast, which should limit the chances <br/>
of further development afterwards.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

<title>Tropical Storm Carlotta Forecast Discussion Number 16</title>

Tropical Storm Carlotta Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
200 AM PDT Sun Aug 04 2024

Carlotta has continued to weaken overnight. Central deep convection 
has collapsed, and the low-level center appears to be at least 
partially exposed in proxy-visible satellite images. As a result, 
the satellite-based intensity estimates have decreased. The initial 
intensity is lowered to 60 kt for this advisory, which makes 
Carlotta a tropical storm.

The storm is expected to move over progressively cooler SSTs over 
the next few days while encountering stronger deep-layer shear in a 
drier, more stable environment. Therefore, steady weakening is 
forecast, and Carlotta is likely to lose organized convection and 
become a post-tropical remnant low on Tuesday. After that, the 
shallow cyclone should spin down and dissipate around midweek.

Carlotta continues to move west-northwestward at around 10 kt while 
being steered by a deep-layer ridge centered to its north and east. 
This general motion is expected to continue during the next day or 
two. As the system weakens, the shallow vortex should move westward 
within the low-level steering currents. There are no significant 
changes to the latest NHC track prediction.

Tropical Storm Daniel Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042024
200 AM PDT Sun Aug 04 2024
 
Daniel is not a particularly well organized tropical cyclone, and 
the satellite presentation suggests the storm could be elongated 
from southwest to northeast. However, it continues to produce some 
deep convection near the estimated center position. Unfortunately, 
recent scatterometer data swaths missed Daniel overnight. The latest 
UW-CIMSS objective ADT and AiDT estimates as well as the subjective 
Dvorak classification from TAFB support keeping the initial 
intensity at 35 kt.

The initial position of Daniel is uncertain, but it appears the 
storm is presently drifting northward. A faster northeastward motion 
is expected later today through Monday due to increasing 
southwesterly low- to mid-level flow while Tropical Storm Carlotta 
passes to the north. Most of the global models show Daniel becoming 
caught in the outer circulation of Carlotta, and the updated NHC 
track forecast has been adjusted beyond 36 h to show Daniel slowing 
down and turning toward the north and northwest later in the period. 
These adjustments reflect the latest trends in the multi-model 
consensus aids.

In the short term, the moderate northeasterly shear that has 
plagued Daniel is forecast to diminish. The latest NHC intensity 
forecast shows a bit of strengthening during the next day or so, 
but this is primarily related to the northeastward acceleration of 
the storm as opposed to significant deepening of the low. As 
Daniel make a counter-clockwise turn around the outer circulation 
of Carlotta, it appears that significant dry air entrainment will 
make it difficult for the storm to sustain organized convection. 
The NHC forecast indicates Daniel will weaken to a post-tropical 
remnant low on Tuesday and dissipate around midweek.

800 AM MST Sun Aug 04 2024
 
...NEW TROPICAL DEPRESSION FORMS OVER THE OPEN EASTERN PACIFIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM MST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.8N 112.9W
ABOUT 530 MI...850 KM SSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...STATIONARY
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1007 MB...29.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Five-E
was located near latitude 15.8 North, longitude 112.9 West. The
depression is nearly stationary, but a slow generally southward 
motion is expected to begin later today and continue into Monday. A 
sharp turn back toward the north is possible by Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Slow strengthening is expected today and the system is forecast to 
become a tropical storm tonight. The cyclone will then begin to 
interact with another larger disturbance approaching from the east, 
which is expected to cause this system to dissipate in a few days.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Tropical Depression Five-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
800 AM MST Sun Aug 04 2024
 
Convection associated with a low located well offshore Mexico has 
steadily increased in coverage and organization since yesterday. 
Overnight ASCAT and first-light visible imagery indicate that the 
cyclone also has a well-defined, if somewhat broad, circulation. 
Subjective Dvorak classifications from TAFB and SAB were both 2.0 
at 1200 UTC, which support initiating advisories on the system as a 
30 kt depression.

The depression is located within a very convectively active 
environment over the east Pacific, deep-layer wind shear is low, and 
SSTs are plenty warm, so strengthening is expected in the short 
term. The biggest source of uncertainty for this forecast is an 
expected interaction with a larger disturbance, currently Invest 
96E, which is approaching from the east. Based on the available 
global and hurricane dynamical model forecasts, the most likely 
scenario is that 96E will be the dominant system. In that case, the 
new depression will only have a short window to strengthen before it 
is wrapped into and dissipates within the other circulation. Models 
historically handle interaction cases like this poorly, so 
confidence in the forecast is not high, despite the near universal 
agreement between the dynamical guidance on this upcoming evolution.

The NHC forecast is very close to the consensus guidance through 24 
to 36 h.  After that, the model trackers appear to be getting fooled 
by the close proximity of 96E and TD Five-E and are following the 
stronger vortex instead. The NHC forecast is based heavily on a 
broad consensus of model fields beyond 36 h and shows dissipation 
occuring by 60 h.  There is some chance that the depression could 
persist longer than forecast if the two systems remain farther 
apart, however there is not enough guidance with a trackable vortex 
to justify an explicit forecast beyond what is currently shown.
