Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
100 PM EST Sun Nov 3 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Subtropical <br/>
Storm Patty, located over the northeastern Atlantic Ocean just east <br/>
of the Azores Islands.<br/>
<br/>
Western Caribbean Sea (AL97):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms are showing signs of organization in <br/>
association with a low pressure system over the south-central <br/>
Caribbean Sea. This system is expected to become a tropical <br/>
depression during the next day or two as it moves generally <br/>
northward toward Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, and Cuba. Interests in <br/>
those locations should monitor the progress of this system as <br/>
tropical storm watches or warnings could be required later today or <br/>
tonight. Regardless of development, locally heavy rains are possible <br/>
across Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Cuba during the next few days. An <br/>
Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft is currently investigating this <br/>
system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Near the Southeastern Bahamas:<br/>
A trough of low pressure is producing disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms along with gusty winds over the southeastern Bahamas <br/>
and adjacent waters. Slow development of this system is possible <br/>
during the next day or so while it moves westward toward Cuba and <br/>
the Bahamas. This system is expected to be absorbed into the low <br/>
pressure area over the Caribbean Sea (AL97) by late Monday, ending <br/>
its chances of development. Regardless of formation, locally heavy <br/>
rains are possible during the next couple of days across the Greater <br/>
Antilles and the Bahamas.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
An area of disturbed weather is expected to develop near the <br/>
northern Leeward Islands around the middle of the week.  Some slow <br/>
development of this system is possible after that time as it moves <br/>
generally westward over the southwestern Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

...TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS DISCONTINUED FOR THE AZORES...
...PATTY EXPECTED TO BECOME A POST-TROPICAL CYCLONE LATER TONIGHT...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 600 PM GMT...1800 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...37.2N 23.5W
ABOUT 225 MI...360 KM ESE OF LAJES AIR BASE IN THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...E OR 100 DEGREES AT 16 MPH...26 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Azores Meteorological Service has discontinued the Tropical 
Storm Warning for all of the Azores.

For additional storm information specific to your area, please 
monitor products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM GMT (1800 UTC), the center of Subtropical Storm Patty was
located near latitude 37.2 North, longitude 23.5 West. The storm is
moving toward the east near 16 mph (26 km/h) and an eastward to
east-northeastward motion is expected during the next couple of 
days. On the forecast track, the center of Patty is expected to 
continue moving away from the Azores.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts. Weakening is expected during the next couple of days, and
Patty is forecast to become a post-tropical low later tonight.
 
Winds of 40 mph extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from the
center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Patty is expected to produce additional rainfall amounts 
of 1 to 2 inches (25 to 50 millimeters) across the Azores through 
early Monday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Patty will affect the Azores through
tonight. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM GMT.

Subtropical Storm Patty Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172024
300 PM GMT Sun Nov 03 2024
 
Patty is beginning to pull away from the Azores, with the center
now just east of the easternmost islands.  The storm is also on
its way to becoming a post-tropical cyclone as deep convection has
been absent for more than 6 hours.  Recent ASCAT-A and ASCAT-B
passes show peak winds in the 35-40 kt range, and based on that
data and the degraded satellite appearance, the initial intensity
is lowered to 40 kt.  The strongest winds are occurring on the
system's south side, just south of the easternmost Azores.
 
Very strong westerly vertical wind shear, stable air, and cool
waters should continue to cause weakening, and Patty will likely
degenerate into a post-tropical cyclone in the next 6 to 12 hours.
Dissipation has been moved up to 60 h based on the latest global
model guidance.
 
Patty is moving eastward at 14 kt in relatively zonal flow, and an
eastward to east-northeastward toward western Europe is expected
until the system dissipates.  The NHC track forecast is near the
middle of the guidance envelope.
