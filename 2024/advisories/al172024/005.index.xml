Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
100 AM EST Sun Nov 3 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Subtropical <br/>
Storm Patty, located over the northeastern Atlantic Ocean near the <br/>
Azores Islands.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Caribbean Sea (AL97):<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue in association with <br/>
a broad area of low pressure over the southwestern Caribbean Sea. <br/>
Gradual development of this system is expected, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form within the next couple of days while <br/>
moving generally northward to northwestward over the central and <br/>
western Caribbean Sea. Regardless of development, locally heavy <br/>
rains are possible over portions of the adjacent land areas of the <br/>
western Caribbean, including Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Cuba. <br/>
Interests in the western Caribbean Sea should monitor the progress <br/>
of this system. An Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled <br/>
to investigate this system later today.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Near the Greater Antilles:<br/>
A trough of low pressure just north of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico <br/>
continues to produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms along <br/>
with gusty winds over the adjacent waters of the southwestern <br/>
Atlantic. Slow development of this system is possible during the day <br/>
or two while it moves westward near the Greater Antilles. By early <br/>
this week, this system is expected to be absorbed into the low <br/>
pressure area over the Caribbean Sea (AL97). Regardless of <br/>
development, locally heavy rains are possible during the next couple <br/>
of days across the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, <br/>
Hispaniola, eastern Cuba, and the southeastern Bahamas.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM GMT (0900 UTC), the center of Subtropical Storm Patty was 
located near latitude 37.9 North, longitude 26.0 West. The storm is 
moving toward the east near 18 mph (30 km/h), and an eastward to 
east-northeastward motion is expected during the next couple of 
days. On the forecast track, the center of Patty is expected to move 
near the southeastern Azores today.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h)
with higher gusts. Additional weakening is expected during the next
couple of days. Patty is forecast to become a post-tropical low by
early Monday and dissipate by midweek.
 
Winds of 40 mph extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km), mainly
to the south and southwest of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 989 mb (29.21 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Azores through

RAINFALL: Patty is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 1 to 2
inches (25 to 50 millimeters) with local amounts to 4 inches
(100 mm) across the Azores through early Monday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Patty will affect the Azores through
tonight. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.

Subtropical Storm Patty Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172024
900 AM GMT Sun Nov 03 2024
 
The center of Patty passed south of Terceira Island early this 
morning and is now approaching Sao Miguel Island in the southeastern 
Azores. Satellite images reveal the convective structure of the 
storm has degraded, with warming cloud tops and limited convection 
that has become displaced to the north and east of the center. Based 
on these trends and decreasing satellite intensity estimates, the 
intensity of Patty is lowered to 45 kt. The strongest winds are 
likely occurring to the south and southwest of the center. 
Scatterometer passes expected later this morning should provide more 
clarity on the storm's wind structure and current intensity.
 
Patty is moving quickly eastward (090/16 kt) within mid-latitude 
westerlies over the northeastern Atlantic. A turn toward the 
east-northeast is forecast on Monday and Tuesday, in good agreement 
with the tightly clustered track guidance. No major changes were 
made to the updated NHC track forecast. The storm is already showing 
ill effects from westerly shear and dry air on its west side, and 
the environmental conditions are not expected to improve during the 
next couple of days. Therefore more weakening is anticipated, and 
Patty could lose organized convection and degenerate to a 
post-tropical cyclone by tonight or early Monday. Then, the global 
models indicate the low should gradually fill and eventually open 
into a trough by midweek near the coast of Portugal.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the Azores
today, where Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect.
 
2. Locally heavy rains are possible across the Azores through early
Monday.
