Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Sat Nov 2 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Subtropical <br/>
Storm Patty, located over the northeastern Atlantic Ocean near the <br/>
Azores Islands.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Caribbean Sea (AL97):<br/>
Shower activity associated with a broad area of low pressure over <br/>
the southwestern Caribbean Sea remains disorganized at this time. <br/>
Gradual development of this system is still expected, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form within the next couple of days while it <br/>
moves generally northward to northwestward over the central and <br/>
western Caribbean Sea. Regardless of development, locally heavy <br/>
rains are possible over portions of the adjacent land areas of the <br/>
western Caribbean, including Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Cuba. <br/>
Interests in the western Caribbean Sea should monitor the progress <br/>
of this system. An Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled <br/>
to investigate this system on Sunday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Near the Greater Antilles:<br/>
A trough of low pressure just north of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola <br/>
continues to produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms, and <br/>
gusty winds. Slow development of this system is possible during the <br/>
day or two while it moves westward near the Greater Antilles. By <br/>
early next week, this system is expected to be absorbed into the low <br/>
pressure area over the Caribbean Sea. Regardless of development, <br/>
locally heavy rains are possible during the next couple of days <br/>
across the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, <br/>
eastern Cuba and the southeastern Bahamas.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

<title>Subtropical Storm Patty Forecast Discussion Number 3</title>

Subtropical Storm Patty Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172024
900 PM GMT Sat Nov 02 2024
 
Patty has not changed much during the past several hours. The storm 
has been maintaining a small core, though the cloud tops are not as 
cold as they were earlier today. The system is still co-located with 
an upper-level low and dry and stable air continues to wrap around 
the core region. These mixed tropical and extratropical 
characteristics continue to support Patty's subtropical designation. 
The initial intensity is held at 55 kt based on the earlier ASCAT 
data, but this is above the latest satellite estimates. Patty is 
located about 60 n mi south of the westernmost Azores, and it will 
be passing near the central and eastern Azores later tonight and 
Sunday.
 
Weakening should begin soon as the parent upper-level low weakens, 
leaving the storm in more stable conditions and stronger vertical 
wind shear. The models suggest that the low could lose its core and 
deep convection by late Sunday, which should cause it to become a 
post-tropical cyclone in 24 to 36 hours. Additional weakening is 
expected after that, and the storm will likely dissipate in 3 to 4 
days.
 
The subtropical storm is accelerating southeastward, and the latest 
initial motion estimate is 125/16 kt. An eastward motion is expected 
to begin overnight, taking Patty near or just south of the Azores 
through Sunday. An east-northeastward motion is expected after that 
toward western Europe. The models are in fairly good agreement, and 
this forecast remains near the middle of the guidance envelope.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Azores through 
Sunday, where Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect.
 
2. Locally heavy rains are possible across the Azores through
Sunday.
