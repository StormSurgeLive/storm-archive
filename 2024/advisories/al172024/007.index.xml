Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
100 PM EST Sun Nov 3 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Subtropical <br/>
Storm Patty, located over the northeastern Atlantic Ocean just east <br/>
of the Azores Islands.<br/>
<br/>
Western Caribbean Sea (AL97):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms are showing signs of organization in <br/>
association with a low pressure system over the south-central <br/>
Caribbean Sea. This system is expected to become a tropical <br/>
depression during the next day or two as it moves generally <br/>
northward toward Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, and Cuba. Interests in <br/>
those locations should monitor the progress of this system as <br/>
tropical storm watches or warnings could be required later today or <br/>
tonight. Regardless of development, locally heavy rains are possible <br/>
across Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Cuba during the next few days. An <br/>
Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft is currently investigating this <br/>
system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Near the Southeastern Bahamas:<br/>
A trough of low pressure is producing disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms along with gusty winds over the southeastern Bahamas <br/>
and adjacent waters. Slow development of this system is possible <br/>
during the next day or so while it moves westward toward Cuba and <br/>
the Bahamas. This system is expected to be absorbed into the low <br/>
pressure area over the Caribbean Sea (AL97) by late Monday, ending <br/>
its chances of development. Regardless of formation, locally heavy <br/>
rains are possible during the next couple of days across the Greater <br/>
Antilles and the Bahamas.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
An area of disturbed weather is expected to develop near the <br/>
northern Leeward Islands around the middle of the week.  Some slow <br/>
development of this system is possible after that time as it moves <br/>
generally westward over the southwestern Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Subtropical Storm Patty Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172024
900 PM GMT Sun Nov 03 2024
 
After being devoid of deep convection for much of the day, 
thunderstorms have reformed near the center of Patty.  Therefore, 
Patty will hold its subtropical storm designation for now.  The 
initial intensity is held at 40 kt in deference to the earlier 
scatterometer data.  However, strong vertical wind shear, dry 
mid-latitude air, and cool sea surface temperatures should weaken 
Patty during the next couple of days.  No changes have been made to 
the latest NHC intensity forecast. 

The storm is moving eastward at 15 kt and is forecast to move 
eastward to east-northeastward for the next couple of days.  Patty 
is still expected to open into a trough near or over western Europe, 
and only minor adjustments have been made to the official track 
forecast.
