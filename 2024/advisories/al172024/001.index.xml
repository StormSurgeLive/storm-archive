Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Sat Nov 2 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Caribbean Sea:<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the southwestern <br/>
Caribbean Sea are associated with a broad area of low pressure. <br/>
Gradual development of this system is expected over the next several <br/>
days, and a tropical depression is likely to form by early next week <br/>
while the system moves generally northward to northwestward over the <br/>
central and western Caribbean Sea. Regardless of development, <br/>
locally heavy rains are possible over portions of the adjacent land <br/>
areas of the western Caribbean during the next few days, including <br/>
Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Cuba.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Near the Greater Antilles:<br/>
A trough of low pressure extending from near Puerto Rico eastward <br/>
over the adjacent waters of the Atlantic is producing a large area <br/>
of showers and thunderstorms near and over portions of the Greater <br/>
Antilles and the Leeward Islands. Slow development is possible <br/>
during the next couple of days while the system moves <br/>
west-northwestward near the Greater Antilles. Then, this system is <br/>
expected to be absorbed into the low pressure area over the <br/>
Caribbean Sea. Regardless of development, locally heavy rains are <br/>
possible during the next few days from the northern Leeward Islands <br/>
westward across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola to eastern Cuba and the <br/>
southeastern Bahamas. For more information on this system, including <br/>
gale warnings, see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National <br/>
Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
North Atlantic (AL96):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to show signs of organization <br/>
near a low pressure system centered a few hundred miles <br/>
west-northwest of the Azores. Environmental conditions could allow <br/>
for additional development today and tonight, and the system could <br/>
become a short-lived subtropical or tropical storm while it moves <br/>
east-southeastward at 10 to 15 mph. Upper-level winds are forecast <br/>
to become unfavorable for further development by late this weekend. <br/>
Interests in the Azores should monitor the progress of this system. <br/>
For more information, including gale warnings, see High Seas <br/>
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service and Meteo France.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

Subtropical Storm Patty Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172024
900 AM GMT Sat Nov 02 2024
 
The low pressure system that the NHC has been monitoring over the 
northern Atlantic has gradually acquired subtropical characteristics 
during the past 12-24 h. The low has become detached from fronts and 
has a shallow warm-core structure, though it remains within a cooler 
airmass behind a cold front over the eastern Atlantic. Despite SSTs 
around 21 deg C, instability aloft has allowed the system to sustain 
some moderate convection that wraps most of the way around its 
center in geostationary and passive microwave images. Since the 
wind field is asymmetric and the system remains co-located with an 
upper-level low, it seems best classified as a subtropical cyclone, 
which is consistent with ST2.5 classifications from TAFB. Thus, the 
NHC is initiating advisories on Subtropical Storm Patty. Earlier 
partial scatterometer data showed 35-40 kt winds in the southern 
semicircle, and the initial intensity is set at 45 kt since it does 
not appear the strongest winds were sampled by the instrument.

Patty is moving east-southeastward at 105/7 kt. The track guidance 
is in very good agreement that Patty will move faster toward the 
east-southeast through early Sunday, bringing the center near or 
over portions of the Azores. Then, a turn toward the east and 
east-northeast is expected through early next week as Patty is 
steered by an upper-level trough. The NHC track forecast lies near 
the center of the guidance envelope, generally between the simple 
and corrected consensus aids.

Little change in strength is expected today, and Patty is forecast 
to be a fairly short-lived subtropical cyclone. This is because 
westerly shear is forecast to increase over the system during the 
next couple of days, which will likely make it difficult for the 
system to sustain convection near and around its center. Due to its 
increasing forward speed, the strongest winds of Patty should 
generally remain over the southern portion of the circulation during 
its lifetime. Given the non-tropical origins of this system, the 
NHC intensity forecast leans more heavily on the GFS and ECMWF 
global models, which lie on the lower end of the guidance envelope.
