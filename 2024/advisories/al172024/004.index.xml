Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Sat Nov 2 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Subtropical <br/>
Storm Patty, located over the northeastern Atlantic Ocean near the <br/>
Azores Islands.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Caribbean Sea (AL97):<br/>
Shower activity associated with a broad area of low pressure over <br/>
the southwestern Caribbean Sea remains disorganized at this time. <br/>
Gradual development of this system is still expected, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form within the next couple of days while it <br/>
moves generally northward to northwestward over the central and <br/>
western Caribbean Sea. Regardless of development, locally heavy <br/>
rains are possible over portions of the adjacent land areas of the <br/>
western Caribbean, including Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Cuba. <br/>
Interests in the western Caribbean Sea should monitor the progress <br/>
of this system. An Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled <br/>
to investigate this system on Sunday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Near the Greater Antilles:<br/>
A trough of low pressure just north of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola <br/>
continues to produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms, and <br/>
gusty winds. Slow development of this system is possible during the <br/>
day or two while it moves westward near the Greater Antilles. By <br/>
early next week, this system is expected to be absorbed into the low <br/>
pressure area over the Caribbean Sea. Regardless of development, <br/>
locally heavy rains are possible during the next couple of days <br/>
across the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, <br/>
eastern Cuba and the southeastern Bahamas.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM GMT (0300 UTC), the center of Subtropical Storm Patty was
located near latitude 37.9 North, longitude 27.8 West. The storm is
moving toward the east near 20 mph (31 km/h), and an eastward to 
east-northeastward motion is expected during the next couple of 
days. On the forecast track, the center of Patty is expected to move 
near or just south of the Azores through the overnight period.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual weakening is expected during the next few days. Patty is 
forecast to become a post-tropical low late this weekend or Monday.
 
Winds of 40 mph extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km) mainly to 
the southwest of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 985 mb (29.09 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Azores through
the weekend. For more information, see products issued by
the meteorological service in the Azores.
 
RAINFALL: RAINFALL: Patty is expected to produce rainfall amounts of
1 to 2 inches (25 to 50 millimeters) with local amounts to 4 inches
(100 mm) across the Azores through early Monday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Patty will affect the Azores over the next
day or two. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 600 AM GMT.
Next complete advisory at 900 AM GMT.

<title>Subtropical Storm Patty Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>

Subtropical Storm Patty Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172024
300 AM GMT Sun Nov 03 2024

The convective structure of Patty has changed some over the past 
several hours as the center passes just south of the central 
Azores. While the cloud tops have cooled, the convection is now 
mainly to the northeast of the center, and the overall cloud pattern 
is elongated south-to-north.  The system remains embedded in a 
deep-layer cold air mass, with surface temperatures in the Azores 
currently below 20C.  Satellite intensity estimates have decreased 
a little due to the decreased convective symmetry, and this is the 
basis for lowering the initial intensity to 50 kt.

Patty is expected to weaken over the next few days as the parent 
upper-level low decays to an open trough, leaving the storm in 
stronger shear.  While this happens, it should also move into a 
drier and more stable airmass.  This combination is expected to 
cause the convection to dissipate by 36 h, with the storm becoming 
a post-tropical low at that time.  The latest global model guidance 
suggests that the remnant low is likely to decay to a trough by 72 
h, so the new intensity forecast now calls for dissipation by then.
 
The initial motion is now 095/17 kt.  The mid-latitude westerly 
flow is expected to steer the cyclone eastward for 12-24 h, 
followed by an east-northeastward motion. The models remain in 
fairly good agreement, and the forecast track is again near the 
middle of the guidance envelope.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Azores through the 
weekend, where Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect.
 
2. Locally heavy rains are possible across the Azores through the 
weekend.
