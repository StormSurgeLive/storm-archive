Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Sat Nov 2 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on newly formed <br/>
Subtropical Storm Patty, located over the northeastern Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Caribbean Sea:<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the southwestern <br/>
Caribbean Sea are associated with a broad area of low pressure. <br/>
Gradual development of this system is expected, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form within the next few days while the <br/>
system moves generally northward to northwestward over the central <br/>
and western Caribbean Sea. Regardless of development, locally heavy <br/>
rains are possible over portions of the adjacent land areas of the <br/>
western Caribbean, including Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Cuba.  <br/>
Interests in the western Caribbean Sea should monitor the progress <br/>
of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Near the Greater Antilles:<br/>
A large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms, and gusty <br/>
winds extending from near Puerto Rico and Hispaniola northeastward <br/>
for a few hundred miles are associated with a trough of low <br/>
pressure. Slow development of this system is possible during the <br/>
next couple of days while it moves west-northwestward near the <br/>
Greater Antilles. By early next week, this system is expected to be <br/>
absorbed into the low pressure area over the Caribbean Sea. <br/>
Regardless of development, locally heavy rains are possible during <br/>
the next few days across the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, <br/>
Hispaniola, eastern Cuba and the southeastern Bahamas. For more <br/>
information on this system, including gale warnings, see High Seas <br/>
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

<title>Subtropical Storm Patty Forecast Discussion Number 2</title>

Subtropical Storm Patty Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172024
300 PM GMT Sat Nov 02 2024
 
Patty has strengthened over the past several hours. Satellite images 
continue to show the system maintaining a tight core with a ring of 
cold cloud tops surrounding the center. On a larger scale, however, 
the storm has a considerable amount of cool and dry air wrapping 
around the core and it is co-located with an upper-level low. These 
mixed tropical and extratropical characteristics are supportive of 
maintaining Patty's subtropical status. ASCAT data from a few hours 
ago showed peak winds near 50 kt in the southwestern quadrant, and 
given potential undersampling due to the instrument's resolution, 
the initial wind speed is increased to 55 kt. The wind radii have 
also been adjusted based on the ASCAT data.

Patty is likely near its peak intensity as it currently lies in a 
region of instability beneath its parent upper-level low and in 
relatively low vertical wind shear. However, the models show the 
upper-level feature weakening, resulting in more stable conditions 
and increasing westerly vertical wind shear. These environmental 
factors should cause steady weakening and lead to post-tropical 
transition by Sunday night. The low is expected to dissipate in 3 to 
4 days. The NHC intensity forecast is above the previous in the 
short term due to the higher initial intensity.

The subtropical storm is accelerating southeastward, and the latest 
initial motion estimate is 130/11 kt. A faster eastward motion is 
expected to begin soon, taking the storm near or just south of the 
Azores tonight and Sunday. An east-northeastward motion is expected 
after that toward western Europe. The models are in fairly good 
agreement, and this forecast lies near the middle of the guidance 
envelope. 

Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Azores tonight and 
Sunday.

2. Locally heavy rains are possible across the Azores through 
Sunday.
