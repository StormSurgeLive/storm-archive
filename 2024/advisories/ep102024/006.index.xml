DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane John was located 
near latitude 15.5 North, longitude 98.5 West. John is moving toward 
the north near 6 mph (9 km/h). A slow motion to the north or 
north-northeast is expected during the next 24 hours. On the 
forecast track, the center of John is forecast to move inland along 
the coast of southern Mexico tonight or early Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 100 mph (155 km/h) 
with higher gusts. John is a category 2 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Rapid strengthening is forecast 
to continue, and John is expected to become a major hurricane as it 
approaches the coast of southern Mexico.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles
(75 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 973 mb (28.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for John can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP5.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Through Thursday, John is expected to produce 6 to 12 
inches of rain with isolated totals around 15 inches across the 
coastal areas of Chiapas.  In areas along and near the Oaxaca coast 
to southeast Guerrero, between 10 and 20 inches of rain with 
isolated totals near 30 inches can be expected through Thursday. 
This heavy rainfall will likely cause significant and possibly 
catastrophic, life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides to the 
Mexican States of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and southeast Guerrero, 
particularly in areas near the coast.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane John, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE:  A life-threatening storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the east of where the
center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within
the hurricane warning area tonight. Winds are expected to first
reach tropical storm strength later this afternoon, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous. Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the coast
within the tropical storm warning area this evening.
 
SURF:  Swells associated with John are forecast to continue
affecting the coast of southern Mexico during the next couple of
days, with the potential for dangerous surf and rip currents much of
the week.  Please see local statements for more information.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next intermediate advisory at 600 PM CST.

Hurricane John Special Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102024
1200 PM CST Mon Sep 23 2024
 
John has continued to rapidly intensify and the latest images
suggest an eye may be forming on visible and infrared imagery.
Recent objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS range from
65 to 85 kt.  The current intensity estimate is increased to 75 kt.
The new NHC intensity forecast shows John strengthening to a major
hurricane prior to reaching the coast of Mexico.  It is possible
that the hurricane could strengthen more than forecast.
 
Only a minor tweak was made to the previous NHC track forecast to 
show landfall occurring a bit sooner.  Residents of Mexico in the 
hurricane warning area should rush preparations to completion this 
afternoon.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. John is expected to continue rapidly intensifying, and is 
forecast to become a major hurricane before the center reaches the 
coast of southern Mexico within the Hurricane Warning area on 
Tuesday. Damaging hurricane-force winds and a dangerous storm surge 
are expected within portions of the warning area.
 
2. John will bring very heavy rainfall to coastal portions of
southern Mexico through this week.  This heavy rainfall will likely
cause significant and possibly catastrophic, life-threatening flash
flooding and mudslides to the Mexican States of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and
southeast Guerrero, particularly in areas near the coast.
