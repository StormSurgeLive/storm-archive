Remnants Of John Special Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102024
1200 PM CST Tue Sep 24 2024
 
Satellite images and surface observations indicate that the 
low-level center of John has dissipated.  Therefore, the system 
is no longer a tropical cyclone, and this is the last NHC 
advisory.  However, an elongated trough partly associated with 
John's remnants appears to be forming off the coast of southern and 
southwestern Mexico.  This system is now included in the Tropical 
Weather Outlook with a medium chance of development.  

Regardless of whether or not John re-forms or a new system 
develops, heavy rainfall with the potential for significant flooding 
is likely during the next several days over portions of southern 
and southwestern Mexico, especially in areas of high terrain.
