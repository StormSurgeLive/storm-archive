DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 PM CST (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm John was 
located near latitude 18.3 North, longitude 103.2 West. John is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h) and this

southwestern Mexico today and tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Gradual weakening is expected today, with a faster 
rate of weakening forecast by tonight as the center continues to 
interact with the higher terrain of southwestern Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Through Saturday, Tropical Storm John is expected to
produce additional rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches with locally
over 10 inches across portions of the Mexican States of Guerrero and

inches are expected today across the Mexican States of Colima and

Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge is likely to produce coastal flooding near
and to the east of where the center makes landfall.  Near the coast,
the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue across
coastal portions of the Tropical Storm Warning area through today.
 
SURF: Swells associated with John are forecast to continue to
affect the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico through tonight
into Saturday, with the potential for dangerous surf and rip
currents. Please see local statements for more information.

<title>Tropical Storm John Forecast Discussion Number 19</title>

Tropical Storm John Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102024
900 AM CST Fri Sep 27 2024
 
John's satellite depiction has banding mainly concentrated on the 
southern semicircle. The center of the system is very near or just 
touching the coast of southwestern Mexico. There continues to be 
burst of convection within the curved bands to the south of the 
center, and GLM data depicts plenty of lightning within the bands. 
The various objective and subjective satellite intensity estimates 
range from 35 to 55 kt. Given the satellite presentation will lean 
to the higher side of these estimates, with an initial intensity for 
this advisory at 50 kt.
 
The center of John is right along the coast, and gradual weakening 
should continue as the storm moves inland or moves along the 
coastline. Later today, the high mountainous terrain will disrupt 
the low-level circulation and a faster rate of weakening should 
ensue. Beyond the next 24 h, the forecast is highly dependent if the 
center of John survives the interaction with land, and could 
dissipate sooner than what is currently forecast. If the surface 
center remains intact and doesn't dissipate, the remnants should 
re-emerge over the water in a few days, although models do not show 
regeneration and keep the system as a remnant low. The NHC intensity 
forecast lies near the HCCA and simple consensus aids.
 
John's initial motion is estimated to be northwestward, or 320/3
kt, and a turn to the west-northwest with a slight increase in
forward speed is forecast, provided John survives its interaction
with mountainous terrain.  The track forecast is similar to the
previous forecast and lies to the right of the previous forecast.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical Storm John will bring additional very heavy rainfall to
coastal portions of southwest Mexico through Friday. The additional
rainfall totals will be falling across areas that have received very
heavy rainfall amounts over the past few days.  This heavy rainfall
will likely cause significant and catastrophic life-threatening
flash flooding and mudslides to the Mexican States of Guerrero and
Michoac√°n.
 
2. John is forecast to continue bringing tropical storm conditions
across portions of the Tropical Storm Warnings area through today.
