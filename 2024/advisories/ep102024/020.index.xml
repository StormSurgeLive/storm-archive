Remnants Of John Discussion Number  20

300 PM CST Fri Sep 27 2024
 
Satellite images and surface observations indicate that the 
low-level center of John has dissipated.  Therefore, the system 
is no longer a tropical cyclone, and this is the last NHC 
advisory.

The monsoon trough associated with the remnants of John will bring 
additional very heavy rainfall to coastal portions of southwest 
Mexico through Saturday. The additional rainfall totals will be 
falling across areas that have received extreme rainfall amounts 
over the past few days.  This heavy rainfall will likely cause 
significant and catastrophic life-threatening flash flooding and 
mudslides to the Mexican states of Guerrero and Michoacán.

For additional information on the monsoon trough associated with the 
remnants of John, please see High Seas Forecasts issued by the 
National Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header 
FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php
