the center of the system is forecast to approach the southern and 
southwestern coast of Mexico on early Thursday and be inland on 
Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with 
higher gusts. John is forecast to strengthen as it approaches the 
coast of southern Mexico on Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Through Friday, Tropical Storm John is expected to produce
additional rainfall amounts of 10 to 20 inches with isolated totals
around 30 inches across the Mexican States of Guerrero, Oaxaca,
coastal Chiapas, and coastal Michoaca.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm John, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding near and to the east of where the center makes landfall.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible along the coast within the
hurricane watch area Thursday.  Winds are expected to first reach
tropical storm strength as early as tonight, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the coast
within the tropical storm warning area as early as tonight.
 
SURF: Swells associated with John are forecast to continue to
affect the coast of southern Mexico through the week, with the
potential for dangerous surf and rip currents.  Please see local
statements for more information.

<title>Tropical Storm John Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Tropical Storm John Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102024
900 AM CST Wed Sep 25 2024
 
John has reformed near the southwestern coast of Mexico.  The 
CIMSS-UW satellite vorticity analyses show remnants of vorticity, 
likely associated with the mid-level circulation of John, have 
merged with a larger source of vorticity from the monsoon trough.  
Convection has gradually become better organized based on 
geostationary infrared and visibly imagery.  An AMSR2 microwave pass 
at 0807 UTC showed curved banding near the surface, indicating a 
well-defined surface center. A Dvorak classification from TAFB has 
given John a 2.0/35 kt and that is the initial intensity for this 
advisory. 

The environmental conditions appear conducive for John to strengthen 
in the next day or so, as long as the circulation stays over water.  
Global models show the vertical wind shear remaining 
weak-to-moderate, ample mid-level moisture, and very warm sea 
surface temperatures.  Statistical guidance even suggests there is 
an above average possibility for strong-to-rapid intensification.  
The latest NHC intensity forecast shows John reaching a peak 
intensity of 55 kt in 24 h, which is near the HCCA intensity aid and 
at the top of the guidance envelope.  However, there is a chance 
John may become a hurricane prior to landfall.

The tropical storm is meandering eastward in the monsoonal flow with 
an estimate motion of 80/2 kt.  Models indicate that John will 
gradually turn towards the north later today and accelerate slightly 
towards the coast on Thursday.  Regional and global models vary the 
timing of landfall, with the GFS and GFS-based hurricane models 
showing John at the coast by tomorrow evening and the ECMWF 
lingering offshore until Friday.  The official track forecast calls 
for landfall along the southern and southwestern coast of Mexico on 
Thursday evening, however, there is uncertainty associated with this 
timing.  A Hurricane Watch and Tropical Storm Warning have been 
issued by the government of Mexico for portions of the coast of 
southern Mexico and interests there should closely monitor future 
forecasts for updates.

KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical Storm John will bring additional very heavy rainfall to 
coastal portions of southwest Mexico through Friday.  The additional 
rainfall totals will be falling across areas that have received very 
heavy rainfall amounts over the past few days.   This heavy rainfall 
will likely cause significant and  catastrophic, life-threatening 
flash flooding and mudslides to the Mexican States of Guerrero,  
Oaxaca, coastal Chiapas, and coastal Michoaca.
 
2. John is forecast to strengthen before landfall, and a Hurricane 
Watch and a Tropical Storm Warning have been issued for a portion of 
the coastline of southern and southwestern Mexico, where tropical 
storm conditions could begin later today.
