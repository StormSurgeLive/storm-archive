DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM CST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane John was located
near latitude 17.5 North, longitude 102.7 West. John is moving
toward the northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h), and this motion should
continue through the remainder of today.  On the forecast track,
the center of John is forecast to approach and move along the coast
of southwestern Mexico or just inland on later today.

Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts. Additional strengthening is expected until the center moves
along the coast or inland later today, which should cause John to
quickly weaken to a depression Friday

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Through Friday, Hurricane John is expected to produce
additional rainfall amounts of 10 to 20 inches across portions of
the Mexican States of Guerrero and Michoac√°n. Additional rainfall o
2 to 4 inches with locally up to 6 inches expected across the
Mexican States of Colima and western Oaxaca.

Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf

STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding near and to the east of where the center makes landfall.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.

WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected along the coast within the
hurricane warning area by tonight or early Friday. Winds are
expected to first reach tropical storm strength later within a few
hours. Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and
mountains are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface
winds indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations
could be even greater.

Tropical storm conditions are currently occurring over portions of
the coast within the tropical storm warning area, and should
continue through today.

SURF: Swells associated with John are forecast to continue to
affect the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico through the
week, with the potential for dangerous surf and rip currents.
Please see local statements for more information.
