DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM CST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm John was
located near latitude 14.8 North, longitude 98.5 West. John is
moving toward the north near 3 mph (6 km/h). A slow motion to the 
north-northeast or northeast is expected for the next couple of 
days.  On the forecast track, the center of the system is forecast 
to approach the southern coast of Mexico late tonight and early 
Tuesday, and move inland on Tuesday or Tuesday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Rapid strengthening is forecast, and John is expected to 
become a hurricane by this afternoon, with additional strengthening 
expected before the center reaches the coast of southern Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for John can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP5.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Through Thursday, John is expected to produce 6 to 12
inches of rain with isolated totals around 15 inches across the
coastal areas of Chiapas.  In areas along and near the Oaxaca coast
to southeast Guerrero, between 10 and 20 inches of rain with
isolated totals near 30 inches can be expected through Thursday.
This heavy rainfall will likely cause significant and possibly
catastrophic, life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides to the
Mexican States of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and southeast Guerrero,
particularly in areas near the coast.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm John, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the east of where the
center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within
the hurricane warning area early Tuesday.  Winds are expected to
first reach tropical storm strength tonight, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the coast
within the tropical storm warning area on Tuesday.
 
SURF:  Swells associated with John are forecast to continue
affecting the coast of southern Mexico during the next couple of
days, with the potential for dangerous surf and rip currents much of
the week.  Please see local statements for more information.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1200 PM CST.
Next complete advisory at 300 PM CST.

Tropical Storm John Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102024
900 AM CST Mon Sep 23 2024

Satellite images show that John has been strengthening quickly.  A 
large area of cold cloud tops between -70C and -85C is present over 
the tropical cyclone, with tight curved bands wrapping around the 
center.  The latest subjective Dvorak intensity estimates are 
T-3.5/55 kt from TAFB and T-3.0/45 kt from SAB.  Recent objective 
Dvorak intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS have been ranging between 
57 and 76 kt.  A 23/0836 UTC AMSR-2 microwave pass shows that the 
inner core has become much better defined, showing a small eye-like 
feature on microwave imagery, although there are no signs of an eye 
showing up yet in infrared or visible images.  A 23/1011 UTC SSMIS 
pass showed a similar structure to the AMSR-2 pass.  Based on the 
above data and imagery, the initial intensity is raised to 60 kt.

John will continue to be located within an environment of extremely 
warm ocean temperatures, light wind shear and a moist low- to 
mid-level troposphere as it approaches the coast of Mexico.  While 
the hurricane regional and dynamical models show a more limited 
amount of additional strengthening, the statistical models like 
SHIPS and LGEM are at the high end of the guidance suite.  Given 
that the system has already intensified by 30 kt in the past 18 h, 
and given that the SHIPS rapid intensity index is showing greater 
than an 85 percent chance of a 30-kt increase in the next 24 h, the 
NHC intensity forecast will now explicitly show rapid strengthening 
over the next 24 h.  This intensity forecast is at the high end of 
the guidance suite.  It is possible that John could peak even 
higher than shown below between the 24 h forecast point and when it 
is forecast to move inland around 36 hours.  Interests along the 
coast of southern Mexico should closely monitor future forecast 
updates on John.

Based on center fixes over the past 6 to 12 hours, John's motion is 
estimated to be northward, or 0 degrees at 3 kt.  John is embedded 
in very weak steering currents, and the primary steering mechanism 
is likely the southwesterly monsoonal flow that the cyclone is 
embedded in.  The new NHC track forecast has been shifted to the 
west of the previous official forecast and now lies very near the 
latest model consensus.  It should be noted that the track forecast 
and timing of when the center reaches the coast is more uncertain 
than normal.


KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. John is expected to become a hurricane later today and 
additional strengthening is likely before the center reaches the 
coast of southern Mexico within the Hurricane Warning area on 
Tuesday. Damaging hurricane-force winds and a dangerous storm surge 
are expected within portions of the warning area. 

2. John will bring very heavy rainfall to coastal portions of 
southern Mexico through this week.  This heavy rainfall will likely 
cause significant and possibly catastrophic, life-threatening flash 
flooding and mudslides to the Mexican States of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and 
southeast Guerrero, particularly in areas near the coast.
