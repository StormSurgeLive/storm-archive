DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 PM CST (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane John was located 
near latitude 17.5 North, longitude 102.7 West. John is currently 
stationary, a slow northwestward motion towards the coast is 
anticipated later today.  On the forecast track, the center of John 
is forecast to approach and move along the coast of southwestern 
Mexico or just inland on later today or tonight.

Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Some strengthening is expected until the center moves 
along the coast or inland later today or tonight, which should cause 
John to quickly weaken to a depression Friday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140
miles (220 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Through Friday, Hurricane John is expected to produce
additional rainfall amounts of 10 to 20 inches across portions of
the Mexican States of Guerrero and Michoac√°n. Additional rainfall o
2 to 4 inches with locally up to 6 inches expected across the
Mexican States of Colima and western Oaxaca.

Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf

STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding near and to the east of where the center makes landfall.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.

WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected along the coast within the
hurricane warning area by tonight or early Friday. Winds are
expected to first reach tropical storm strength within a few
hours. Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and
mountains are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface
winds indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations
could be even greater.

Tropical storm conditions are currently occurring over portions of
the coast within the tropical storm warning area, and should
continue through today.

SURF: Swells associated with John are forecast to continue to
affect the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico through the
week, with the potential for dangerous surf and rip currents.
Please see local statements for more information.
