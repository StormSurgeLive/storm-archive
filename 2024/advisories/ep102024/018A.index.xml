DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM CST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm John was
located near latitude 17.9 North, longitude 102.9 West. John is
moving toward the northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h) and this motion is
expected to continue through today.  On the forecast track, the
center of John is forecast to move along the coast or just inland of
southwestern Mexico later today and tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is expected today, with a faster rate of
weakening forecast by tonight while the center begins to interact
with the higher terrain of the Sierra Madre Del Sur mountains.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 988 mb (29.18 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Through today, Tropical Storm John is expected to produce
rainfall amounts of 10 to 20 inches across portions of the Mexican
States of Guerrero and Michoac√°n. Additional rainfall of 2 to 4
inches with locally up to 6 inches expected across the Mexican
States of Colima and western Oaxaca.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with John,
please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall
Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge is likely to produce coastal flooding near
and to the east of where the center makes landfall.  Near the coast,
the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue across
coastal portions of the Tropical Storm Warning area through today.
 
SURF: Swells associated with John are forecast to continue to
affect the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico through tonight
into Saturday, with the potential for dangerous surf and rip
currents. Please see local statements for more information.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM CST.

Tropical Storm John Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102024
300 AM CST Fri Sep 27 2024
 
This morning's satellite presentation consists of a partially
exposed surface center with a primary banding feature wrapping
around from the southeast.  A few fragmented intermittent bursts of
deep convection are also evident in the northwest quadrant of the
cyclone.  The initial intensity is set at 55 kt and is based on
the TAFB and SAB Dvorak satellite intensity estimates and a
UW-CIMSS DMINT objective estimate using SSMIS F16-17 passes of 56
and 55 kt, respectively.
 
Gradual weakening should continue as the cyclone approaches and
moves inland. The high terrain of the Sierra Madre Del Sur
mountains is expected to disrupt what remains of John's inner 
core and should cause a faster rate of weakening.  Therefore, John 
is expected to become a remnant low in 36 hrs.  If the surface 
center remains intact and doesn't dissipate, the remnants should 
re-emerge over the water in a few days; however, regeneration 
appears unlikely. The NHC intensity forecast is weighed heavily on 
the global model guidance and the IVCN intensity consensus.
 
John's initial motion is estimated to be northwestward, or 320/4
kt, and a turn to the west-northwest with a slight increase in
forward speed is forecast, provided John survives its interaction
with the rugged mountainous terrain.  The track forecast favors a
compromise of the global model solutions and is just to the right
of the HCCA consensus aid.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical Storm John will bring additional very heavy rainfall to 
coastal portions of southwest Mexico through today. The additional 
rainfall totals will be falling across areas that have received very 
heavy rainfall amounts over the past few days. This heavy rainfall 
will likely cause significant and catastrophic life-threatening 
flash flooding and mudslides to the Mexican States of Guerrero and 
Michoac√°n. 
 
2. John is forecast to continue bringing tropical storm conditions
across portions of the Tropical Storm Warnings area through today.
