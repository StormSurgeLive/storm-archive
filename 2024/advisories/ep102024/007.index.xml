DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM CST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane John was located 
near latitude 16.3 North, longitude 98.8 West. John is moving toward 
the north near 8 mph (13 km/h). On the forecast track, the center of 
John is forecast to move inland along the coast of southern Mexico 
in the next couple of hours. John will continue to move inland over 
southern Mexico on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 120 mph (195 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  John is now a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Some additional strengthening 
is possible the next couple of hours before John makes landfall. 
After landfall, the system will rapidly weaken over the high terrain 
of southern Mexico.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles
(75 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 959 mb (28.32 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for John can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP5.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Through Thursday, Hurricane John is expected to
produce 6 to 12 inches of rain with isolated totals around 15 inches
across the coastal areas of Chiapas. In areas along and near the
Oaxaca coast to southeast Guerrero, between 10 and 20 inches of rain
with isolated totals near 30 inches can be expected through
Thursday.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane John, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE:  A life-threatening storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the east of where the
center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are ongoing within portions of the
hurricane warning area. Tropical-storm-force winds are already
occuring within the warning area. Wind speeds atop and on the
windward sides of hills and mountains are often up to 30 percent
stronger than the near-surface winds indicated in this advisory, and
in some elevated locations could be even greater.
 
SURF:  Swells associated with John are forecast to continue
affecting the coast of southern Mexico during the next couple of
days, with the potential for dangerous surf and rip currents much of
the week.  Please see local statements for more information.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1200 AM CST.
Next complete advisory at 300 AM CST.

Hurricane John Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102024
900 PM CST Mon Sep 23 2024
 
John has continued to strengthen this evening with a small tight 
inner core, which was well depicted in SSMIS microwave images around 
00z. Infrared imagery depicts an eye with cold cloud tops near -80 C 
wrapping around the core. Subjective intensity estimates have 
continued to increase this evening with data-T values of T5.5 from 
both SAB and TAFB, with final-T values constrained due to the rapid 
intensification. Given the most recent satellite depiction and using 
the data-T values, the intensity for this advisory is increased to 
105 kt. John is now a major category 3 hurricane.
 
The hurricane could still strengthen some more over the next couple 
of hours before it makes landfall along the coast of southern 
Mexico. After John moves inland, rapid weakening is forecast over 
the higher terrain with the small inner core quickly deteriorating. 
The rate of weakening could occur faster than what is currently 
forecast and the 24 h forecast point is held for continuity inland 
as it is possible the system could dissipate sooner.
 
John continues to move northward around 7 kt.  This current motion 
should continue as John nears the coast, making landfall in the next 
couple of hours and will continue to move inland on Tuesday. The 
cyclone is forecast to slow its forward motion as it moves inland 
and dissipates.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. John is expected to be a major hurricane as it reaches the coast 
of southern Mexico within the Hurricane Warning area in the next 
couple of hours. Damaging hurricane-force winds and a 
life-threatening storm surge are expected within portions of the 
hurricane warning area.
 
2. Slow-moving Hurricane John will bring very heavy rainfall to 
coastal portions of southwest Mexico through the upcoming week. This 
heavy rainfall will likely cause significant and possibly 
catastrophic, life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides to the 
Mexican States of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and southeast Guerrero, 
particularly in areas near the coast.
