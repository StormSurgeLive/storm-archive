DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM CST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm John was
located near latitude 17.9 North, longitude 103.2 West. John is
moving toward the northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h) and this motion is
expected to continue through early Friday morning.  On the forecast 
track, the center of John is forecast to approach and move along the 
coast of southwestern Mexico or just inland later tonight or early 
Friday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is expected tonight, with faster 
weakening forecast on Friday while the center interacts more with 
the topography of Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 984 mb (29.06 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Through Friday, Tropical Storm John is expected to produce
rainfall amounts of 10 to 20 inches across portions of the Mexican
States of Guerrero and Michoacán. Additional rainfall of 2 to 4
inches with locally up to 6 inches is expected across the Mexican
states of Colima and western Oaxaca.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with John,
please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall
Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge is likely to produce coastal flooding near
and to the east of where the center makes landfall.  Near the coast,
the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue across
coastal portions of the Tropical Storm Warning area through Friday
afternoon.
 
SURF: Swells associated with John are forecast to continue to
affect the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico through Friday
night or Saturday, with the potential for dangerous surf and rip
currents. Please see local statements for more information.

<title>Tropical Storm John Forecast Discussion Number 17</title>

Tropical Storm John Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102024
900 PM CST Thu Sep 26 2024

The convection near the center of John has weakened significantly 
over the past 12 hours.  A curved band off to the southwest and west 
of John's center is producing a continuous large area of deep 
convection.  Subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates from TAFB 
and SAB range from 65 to 77 kt, but the objective intensity 
estimates from UW-CIMSS range from 49 to 56 kt. Since the convection 
over the center has warmed on infrared imagery and appears to be 
less organized over the past 12 hours, the initial intensity is 
being lowered to 60 kt for this advisory.

John has been moving northwestward, or 315/4 kt, which is a bit 
faster than before.  This slow motion is forecast to continue for 
another 12 to 24 h, as John moves near the coastline or just inland 
late tonight and early tomorrow.  After that, a turn to the 
west-northwest with some acceleration is forecast, if John survives 
its interaction with the higher topography in this part of Mexico.  
The latest track forecast is a little to the left and slightly 
faster than the previous forecast, and is very near the lastest HCCA 
corrected consensus aid.

It seems unlikely that John will be able to restrengthen since the 
center is now just 20 miles from the coastline and is forecast to 
move even closer to the coast over the next several hours.  Since 
John's core has been disrupted by the topography today, it is 
unlikely to recover, despite relatively favorable environmental 
conditions.  Little change in strength, or perhaps slow weakening, 
is likely over the next 12 hours until the center reaches the 
coastline. Thereafter, faster weakening is expected on Friday as the 
center moves near or along the coastline.  The latest NHC intensity 
forecast is near the middle of the intensity guidance suite.  It is 
quite possible that John could weaken to a remnant low and dissipate 
sooner than forecast. 
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical Storm John will bring additional very heavy rainfall to
coastal portions of southwest Mexico through Friday. The additional
rainfall totals will be falling across areas that have received very
heavy rainfall amounts over the past few days. This heavy rainfall
will likely cause significant and catastrophic life-threatening
flash flooding and mudslides to the Mexican States of Guerrero and
Michoacán.
 
2. John is forecast to continue bringing tropical storm conditions 
across portions of the Tropical Storm Warnings area through Friday.
