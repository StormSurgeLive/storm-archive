hours.  Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed
to completion.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within 12

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM CST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane John was located 
near latitude 17.3 North, longitude 102.6 West. John is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 4 mph (7 km/h) and this motion is 
expected to continue today, followed by a gradual turn to the 
northwest by this evening.  On the forecast track, the center of 
John is forecast to approach and move along the coast of 
southwestern Mexico or just inland on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is expected until the 
center moves along the coast or inland on Friday, which should 
cause John to quickly weaken to a depression Friday night.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (15 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles 
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Through Friday, Hurricane John is expected to produce
additional rainfall amounts of 10 to 20 inches with isolated totals
around 30 inches across portions of the Mexican States of Guerrero,
Oaxaca and Michoacan.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with John,
please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall
Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding near and to the east of where the center makes landfall.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected along the coast within the
hurricane warning area by tonight or early Friday.  Winds are
expected to first reach tropical storm strength later this morning,
making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations
to protect life and property should be rushed to completion.
 
Tropical storm conditions are currently occurring over portions of
the coast within the tropical storm warning area, and should
continue through today.
 
SURF: Swells associated with John are forecast to continue to
affect the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico through the
week, with the potential for dangerous surf and rip currents.
Please see local statements for more information.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM CST.

Tropical Storm John Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102024
300 AM CST Thu Sep 26 2024
 
Recent TROPICS/TMS and SSMIS microwave passes indicated
an improved inner core with a 70 percent closed small eye feature.
The UW-CIMSS objective intensity guidance ranges from 56 to 65 kt, 
and the latest SATCON analysis indicated an intensity of 61 kt. The 
subjective satellite estimates from TAFB and SAB are 65 and 55 kt, 
respectively. The initial intensity is set at 60 kt using a blend 
of these data.
 
The ocean sea surface temperatures are very warm, and the shear is
low, and there is ample moisture in the low to mid-portions of the
atmosphere for John to quickly strengthen before the cyclone moves
over the coast on Friday.  The UW-CIMSS AI RI index and the SHIPS
statistical-dynamical RI model both continue to show increasing
chances of John quickly strengthening during the next 24 hrs and
the NHC intensity forecast follows suit and shows a peak of 85 kt 
before landfall.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be west-northwestward, or   
285/3 kt and is being steered by a mid-tropospheric ridge centered 
over Northern Mexico.  John should continue in this general motion 
through today, followed by a gradual turn to the northwest by this 
evening.  On the forecast track, the center of John is forecast to 
approach and move along the coast of southwestern Mexico or just 
inland on Friday.  The official track forecast is adjusted a little 
to the left of the previous one and follows a compromise of the 
skilled HCCA consensus model and the ECMWF global model, which has 
been performing the best with this system.
 
The wind radii have been adjusted for this advisory, and was based
on a 0426 UTC METOP-C scatterometer overpass.
 
It cannot be emphasized enough that catastrophic life-threatening
flash flooding and mudslides are expected to continue through the
end of the week for portions of the Mexican States of Guerrero,
Oaxaca and Michoacan.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical Storm John will bring additional very heavy rainfall to
coastal portions of southwest Mexico through Friday.  The additional
rainfall totals will be falling across areas that have received very
heavy rainfall amounts over the past few days.  This heavy rainfall
will likely cause significant and catastrophic life-threatening
flash flooding and mudslides to the Mexican States of Guerrero,
Oaxaca and Michoacan.
 
2. John is forecast to strengthen to a hurricane before landfall,
and a Hurricane Warning is in effect along the coastline of 
southwestern Mexico, where tropical storm conditions could begin 
during the next few hours.  Tropical Storm Warnings are also 
in effect for portions of the area and has been extended westward 
to Manzanillo.
