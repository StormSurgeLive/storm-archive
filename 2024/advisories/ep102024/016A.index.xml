DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM CST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane John was located
near latitude 17.8 North, longitude 103.0 West. John is moving
toward the northwest near 3 mph (5 km/h) and this motion is expected
to continue through the next day or so. On the forecast track, the
center of John is forecast to approach and move along the coast of
southwestern Mexico or just inland later tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts. John is expected to remain a hurricane until the center 
reaches the coast tonight.  John is forecast to begin weakening 
quickly on Friday as the center moves along the coast or just 
inland.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150
miles (240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Through Friday, Hurricane John is expected to produce
additional rainfall amounts of 10 to 20 inches across portions of
the Mexican States of Guerrero and Michoacán. Additional rainfall of
2 to 4 inches with locally up to 6 inches is expected across the
Mexican States of Colima and western Oaxaca.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with John,
please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall
Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding near and to the east of where the center makes landfall.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected along the coast within the
Hurricane Warning area later tonight into early Friday. Winds to
tropical storm strength are already ongoing along the coast and will
continue to spread inland. Wind speeds atop and on the windward
sides of hills and mountains are often up to 30 percent stronger
than the near-surface winds indicated in this advisory, and in some
elevated locations could be even greater.

Hurricane conditions are possible within the Hurricane Watch area 
on Friday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are currently occurring over portions of
the coast within the Tropical Storm Warning area, and should
continue through the night.
 
SURF: Swells associated with John are forecast to continue to
affect the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico through the
week, with the potential for dangerous surf and rip currents.
Please see local statements for more information.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 900 PM CST.

Hurricane John Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102024
300 PM CST Thu Sep 26 2024
 
John has slowed its forward motion this afternoon. A scatterometer 
pass late this morning confirmed that the motion had slowed and the 
center is lingering offshore. The inner core of convection has 
become less pronounced and the circulation may be feeling the 
orographic effects of the mountainous terrain of southwestern 
Mexico. However, a strong convective curved band extends in the 
southwest semi-circle. Dvorak satellite intensity estimates have 
remained fairly steady this afternoon between 65 to 75 kt. Given the 
current satellite intensity estimates, the initial intensity for 
this advisory remains at 65 kt.
 
The hurricane has not been moving much since the previous advisory 
and the estimated motion is 325/ 2 kt. This slow motion is forecast 
to continue as John approaches the coastline, moving along the 
coast or just inland later tonight or early tomorrow. Some of the 
global model fields keep the system offshore near the coast a 
little longer. In the long term, a turn back to the west-northwest 
is anticipated as the system weakens and is steered by a high 
pressure ridge located over northern Mexico.
 
The overall environment remains favorable for John to strengthen 
with very warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear. 
However, John's proximity to the coastline may continue to disrupt 
the circulation and not allow for much additional strengthening. The 
latest NHC intensity forecast shows some slight strengthening over 
the next 12 h. Models are in fairly good agreement that steady 
weakening will begin Friday, with the system becoming a depression 
on Friday night.
 
John has a very large rain shield, and flooding impacts will extend
well outside where the system makes landfall. It cannot be
emphasized enough that catastrophic life-threatening flash flooding
and mudslides are expected to continue through the end of the week
for portions of the Mexican States of Guerrero and Michoacan.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Hurricane John will bring additional very heavy rainfall to
coastal portions of southwest Mexico through Friday. The additional
rainfall totals will be falling across areas that have received very
heavy rainfall amounts over the past few days. This heavy rainfall
will likely cause significant and catastrophic life-threatening
flash flooding and mudslides to the Mexican States of Guerrero and
Michoacán.
 
2. John is forecast to continue strengthening up until landfall, and 
a Hurricane Warning is in effect along the coastline of southwestern 
Mexico, where hurricane conditions are imminent.  Tropical Storm 
Warnings are also in effect for portions of the area, where 
tropical storm conditions are ongoing or imminent.
