HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for John can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP5.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Through Thursday, Tropical Storm John is expected to
produce 6 to 12 inches of rain with isolated totals around 15 inches
across the coastal areas of Chiapas. In areas along and near the
Oaxaca coast to southeast Guerrero, between 10 and 20 inches of rain
with isolated totals near 30 inches can be expected through
Thursday.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm John, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are ongoing within portions of the
tropical storm warning area and should continue for the next couple 
of hours. Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and
mountains are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface
winds indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations
could be even greater.
 
SURF:  Swells associated with John are forecast to continue
affecting the coast of southern Mexico during the next day or so,
with the potential for dangerous surf and rip currents.  Please see
local statements for more information.

Tropical Storm John Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102024
900 AM CST Tue Sep 24 2024
 
John has been rapidly weakening since it moved inland last night,
and the maximum sustained winds are now estimated to be around 35
kt.  The storm still has a well-defined mid-level center, but
surface observations suggest that the low-level circulation is
less defined and could be opening into a trough.  A strong band of
thunderstorms to the east of the estimated center continues to
produce heavy rains across portions of southern Mexico.
 
There is quite a bit of uncertainty in the future of John.  One 
possibility is that the storm dissipates over Mexico, with a trough 
or low reforming back offshore and lingering in that location for 
much of the rest of the week.  The other possibility is that John 
itself hangs on as a tropical depression or storm.  For now, the 
official forecast generally follows the previous scenario and shows 
John weakening to a tropical depression later today and lingering 
near the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico until the end of 
the week. It is hoped that additional data and model runs later 
today will help provide some clarity on the system's future.
 
Even though the future of John is uncertain, there is high 
confidence that heavy rains will continue in portions of southern 
and southwestern Mexico during the next couple of days.  See the Key 
Messages below for additional information on that hazard.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Slow-moving John will continue to bring very heavy rainfall to 
coastal portions of southern and southwestern Mexico through the 
upcoming week. This heavy rainfall will likely cause significant and 
possibly catastrophic, life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides 
to the Mexican States of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and southeast Guerrero, 
particularly in areas near the coast and along the up-slope portion 
of areas of higher terrain.

2. John could still produce tropical storm conditions for the next 
couple of hours in the tropical storm warning area.
