DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM CST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane John was located
near latitude 17.5 North, longitude 102.7 West. John is moving
toward the northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h), and this motion should
continue through the remainder of today.  On the forecast track,
the center of John is forecast to approach and move along the coast
of southwestern Mexico or just inland on later today.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts. Additional strengthening is expected until the center moves
along the coast or inland later today, which should cause John to
quickly weaken to a depression Friday
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Through Friday, Hurricane John is expected to produce
additional rainfall amounts of 10 to 20 inches across portions of
the Mexican States of Guerrero and Michoac√°n. Additional rainfall o
2 to 4 inches with locally up to 6 inches expected across the
Mexican States of Colima and western Oaxaca.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with John,
please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall
Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding near and to the east of where the center makes landfall.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected along the coast within the
hurricane warning area by tonight or early Friday. Winds are
expected to first reach tropical storm strength later within a few
hours. Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and
mountains are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface
winds indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations
could be even greater.
 
Tropical storm conditions are currently occurring over portions of
the coast within the tropical storm warning area, and should
continue through today.
 
SURF: Swells associated with John are forecast to continue to
affect the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico through the
week, with the potential for dangerous surf and rip currents.
Please see local statements for more information.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1200 PM CST.
Next complete advisory at 300 PM CST.

<title>Hurricane John Forecast Discussion Number 15</title>

Hurricane John Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102024
900 AM CST Thu Sep 26 2024
 
John continues to depict a small inner core, with earlier microwave 
images depicting a small eye feature. Since that microwave pass, the 
eye feature has become more prevalent on infrared imagery. The 
UW-CIMSS objective intensity guidance ranges from 65 to 75 kt. The 
subjective satellite estimates from TAFB and SAB are both 65 kt, 
respectively. Using a blend of the intensity estimates and the 
continued improved satellite depiction, the intensity is set at 65 
kt for this advisory.
 
The hurricane is estimated to be moving northwestward at 310/5 kt.
The official forecast is shifted slightly to the right in the near
term, which follows recent satellite trends and lies near the latest
HCCA consensus aid. On the forecast track, the center of John is
forecast to approach and move along the coast of southwestern Mexico
or just inland later today. However, some of the global model fields
do linger the system offshore near the coast a little longer,
particularly the ECMWF global model. In the long term, a turn back
to the west-northwest is anticipated as the system weakens and is
steered by the ridge over northern Mexico.
 
The overall environment remains favorable for John to continue to 
strengthen until landfall with very warm sea surface temperatures, 
low wind shear, abundant moisture throughout all levels of the 
atmosphere. The latest NHC intensity forecast continues to call for 
strengthening up until landfall and shows a peak intensity of 75 kt, 
which is slightly lower than previous intensity peak due to the 
latest forecast showing the system moving inland a little faster 
than the previous forecast.
 
John has very large rain shield and flooding impacts will extend
well outside where the system makes landfall. It cannot be
emphasized enough that catastrophic life-threatening flash flooding
and mudslides are expected to continue through the end of the week
for portions of the Mexican States of Guerrero, Oaxaca and
Michoacan.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Hurricane John will bring additional very heavy rainfall to
coastal portions of southwest Mexico through Friday. The additional
rainfall totals will be falling across areas that have received very
heavy rainfall amounts over the past few days. This heavy rainfall
will likely cause significant and catastrophic life-threatening
flash flooding and mudslides to the Mexican States of Guerrero and
Michoac√°n.
 
2. John is forecast to continue strengthening up until landfall, and
a Hurricane Warning is in effect along the coastline of southwestern
Mexico, where tropical storm conditions are imminent.  Tropical
Storm Warnings are also in effect for portions of the area and
tropical storm are ongoing.
