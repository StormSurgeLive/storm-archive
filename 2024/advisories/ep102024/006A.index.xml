DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM CST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane John was located
near latitude 15.9 North, longitude 98.6 West. John is moving toward
the north near 8 mph (15 km/h). A slow motion to the north or
north-northwest is expected during the next 24 hours. On the
forecast track, the center of John is forecast to move inland along
the coast of southern Mexico late tonight or early Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 105 mph (165 km/h) 
with higher gusts. John is a category 2 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Additional strengthening is 
possible over the next few hours and John could become a major 
hurricane before making landfall along the coast of southern Mexico.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45
miles (75 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 970 mb (28.64 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for John can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP5.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Through Thursday, John is expected to produce 6 to 12
inches of rain with isolated totals around 15 inches across the
coastal areas of Chiapas.  In areas along and near the Oaxaca coast
to southeast Guerrero, between 10 and 20 inches of rain with
isolated totals near 30 inches can be expected through Thursday.
This heavy rainfall will likely cause significant and possibly
catastrophic, life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides to the
Mexican States of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and southeast Guerrero,
particularly in areas near the coast.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane John, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE:  A life-threatening storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the east of where the
center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are imminent within portions of
the hurricane warning area. Tropical-storm-force winds are already 
occuring within the warning area. 
 
 SURF:  Swells associated with John are forecast to continue
affecting the coast of southern Mexico during the next couple of
days, with the potential for dangerous surf and rip currents much of
the week.  Please see local statements for more information.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 900 PM CST.

Hurricane John Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102024
300 PM CST Mon Sep 23 2024
 
John continues to rapidly strengthen.  The latest subjective Dvorak 
intensity estimates range from 65 to 77 kt, while the latest 
objective intensity estimates are a little higher, in the 79 to 90 
kt range.  On infrared satellite imagery, the area of cold cloud 
tops continues to grow, and the inner core is becoming more 
symmetric.  The latest visible images have shown hints of a small 
eye, that has become a little more apparent in the last few hours.  
Based on the above data and recent satellite trends, the initial 
intensity is increased to 85 kt, making John a category 2 hurricane.

Environmental parameters continue to be ripe for additional rapid 
intensification, with very warm ocean temperatures, weak vertical 
wind shear and a moist atmosphere.  The only potential limiting 
factor could be how John might interact with the mountainous 
topography of Mexico as the hurricane approaches the coastline.  The 
DSHIPS and LGEM statistical intensity models remain at the higher 
end of the guidance envelope and show John becoming a major 
hurricane as it approaches the coast.  The EC SHIPS Rapid Intensity 
Index is depicting a high likelihood of continued rapid 
intensification over next 12 hours.  The latest NHC forecast is near 
the high end of the intensity guidance and continues to show John 
strengthening to a 105-kt hurricane.  It is possible that John could 
peak even higher than shown below between the 12 h forecast point 
and when it reaches the coast.

John continues to move due northward, now at 5 kt.  The current 
motion and the latest model guidance has again necessitated a 
westward track shift to the NHC forecast. Given the updated track 
forecast, the government of Mexico has extended the hurricane 
warning westward.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. John is expected to continue rapidly intensifying, and is 
forecast to become a major hurricane before the center reaches the 
coast of southern Mexico within the Hurricane Warning area tonight 
or early Tuesday. Damaging hurricane-force winds and a 
life-threatening storm surge are expected within portions of the 
hurricane warning area.

2. John will bring very heavy rainfall to coastal portions of
southern Mexico through this week.  This heavy rainfall will likely
cause significant and possibly catastrophic, life-threatening flash
flooding and mudslides to the Mexican States of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and
southeast Guerrero, particularly in areas near the coast.
