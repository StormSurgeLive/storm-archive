----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.3N 86.4W
ABOUT 120 MI...190 KM E OF BELIZE CITY
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 270 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Belize has issued a Tropical Storm Warning from 
Belize City northward to the border with Mexico.

The government of Mexico has issued a Tropical Storm Warning from 
Tulum southward to the border with Belize, including Cozumel.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Belize City, Belize to Tulum, Mexico, including Cozumel
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within the 
next 12 to 24 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico
should monitor the progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products 
issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
Recent satellite-derived wind data indicate that the disturbance 
over the northwestern Caribbean Sea has become a tropical storm.  
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nadine was 
centered near latitude 17.3 North, longitude 86.4 West.  Nadine is 
moving toward the west near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this general motion 
should continue through tonight.  On the forecast track, Nadine is
expected to move inland along the coast of Belize later today.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some additional slight strengthening is possible before Nadine makes 
landfall later today.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles (315 km) 
north of the center.  A WeatherFlow station at Xel-Ha Park near 
Tulum, Mexico, recently measured a wind gust to 40 mph (65 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nadine can be found in the Tropical Cyclone 
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC 
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Widespread 4 to 8 inch rainfall amounts are expected 
across northern Belize, northern Guatemala, and the southern states 
of Mexico from Quintana Roo westward to Veracruz. Isolated areas of
amounts exceeding 12 inches are also possible through late Tuesday.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Nadine, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning area
today.
 
STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding is possible in areas of onshore
winds near and to the north of where the center moves inland.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

Potential Tropical Cyclone Fifteen Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152024
1000 PM CDT Fri Oct 18 2024
 
The satellite presentation of the disturbance has improved this 
evening. Curved bands of deep convection have developed closer to 
the estimated center position, although it is unclear from recent 
passive microwave imagery whether a well-defined surface center 
exists yet. The strongest winds are occurring within the convective 
bands to the north of the center, where NOAA buoy 42056 has reported 
sustained winds of 25-30 kt and gusts to tropical storm force. Based 
on these observations and available satellite data, the system will 
remain a 30-kt potential tropical cyclone for this advisory. Data 
from an ASCAT-C overpass will arrive within the next couple of 
hours, which should provide some clarity about the current intensity 
of the system and whether it has a well-defined center.

The disturbance appears to be moving westward at about 7 kt to the 
south of a high pressure ridge over the eastern United States. The 
latest track guidance agrees that the system should continue on a 
westward heading through Saturday night and cross the coast of 
Belize between 12-24 h from now. The latest NHC track forecast is 
very similar to the previous prediction and remains close to the 
multi-model consensus aids.

Despite limited time remaining over water, warm SSTs and relatively 
low shear in a moist environment should allow the system to 
consolidate and strengthen into a tropical storm before it moves 
ashore. The strongest winds are forecast to occur within the 
northern semicircle, and a Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect 
from Belize City northward to Tulum, Mexico. Weakening is expected 
once the system moves inland, and it is forecast to dissipate over 
southern Mexico by early Sunday.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Potential Tropical Cyclone Fifteen is expected to bring impacts 
from heavy rain, coastal flooding, and high surf to portions of 
Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico this weekend. Localized 
areas of flash flooding are possible as the system moves westward 
through southern Mexico, northern Guatemala, and northern Belize.

2. Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the 
coasts of Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico within the 
Tropical Storm Watch area by early Saturday.
