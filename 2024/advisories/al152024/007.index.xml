DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Oscar was located
near latitude 21.3 North, longitude 72.6 West. Oscar is moving
toward the west near 10 mph (17 km/h). A turn to the west-southwest
is forecast later today, and the center of Oscar is forecast to 
reach the coast of Cuba tonight. A turn toward the north and
northeast is expected in a couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts. Small intensity fluctuations are possible during the next day
or so, but weakening is anticipated tonight and Monday after the 
center crosses the coast.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 5 miles (10 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles
(75 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Hurricane Oscar Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162024
1100 PM EDT Sat Oct 19 2024
 
Satellite images indicate the center of Oscar passed very near Grand 
Turk Island earlier this evening. Passive microwave data show the 
tiny hurricane has a compact inner core with a small curved band 
that wraps around much of its circulation. In the past several 
hours, the cloud pattern has become a little less symmetric, with a 
sharp edge to the cloud pattern on the northwest side. The 
conventional satellite intensity estimates remain too low relative 
to what the aircraft found this afternoon, and without any new 
observations, the initial intensity is held at 75 kt. The Air Force 
Hurricane Hunters are scheduled to investigate Oscar on Sunday.

Oscar continues moving westward at about 10 kt, but it is forecast 
to turn slightly south of due west during the next day or so while 
moving on the southeastern side of a mid-level ridge centered over 
the eastern Gulf of Mexico. This should bring the center of Oscar 
very near or over Great Inagua in the southeastern Bahamas early 
Sunday, then toward the northeastern coast of Cuba through Sunday 
night. There has been a southward shift in the latest track 
guidance, with more models indicating Oscar could make landfall and 
move inland over eastern Cuba in 24-36 h. The latest NHC prediction 
has been adjusted to reflect this and lies closest to the simple 
consensus TVCN and GFEX aids. Thereafter, the track forecast becomes 
more uncertain, as the extent and duration of land interaction will 
dictate the depth of the vortex and how it is steered. For now, the 
longer-range forecast still follows the ECMWF, which shows Oscar 
turning northward and accelerating northeastward through midweek 
ahead of an amplifying upper trough.  

The intensity forecast for Oscar remains challenging, since its 
compact size makes it susceptible to more rapid intensity 
fluctuations. While some near-term intensification cannot be ruled 
out, satellite trends indicate the hurricane could be starting to 
feel the effects of northwesterly shear, which the global models 
insist will increase during the next 12-24 h. The NHC forecast still 
shows Oscar reaching the coast of Cuba as a hurricane on Sunday 
night, and the government of Cuba has issued a Hurricane Warning 
for a portion of the northern coast. Afterwards, land interaction 
and stronger shear should induce weakening, which could occur even 
faster than forecast if the center of the small cyclone remains 
inland as long as some of the guidance suggests.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. A Hurricane Warning remains in effect for the Turks and Caicos 
and southeastern Bahamas, and a Hurricane Warning has been issued 
for a portion of the northern coast of Cuba.
 
2. Oscar is expected to produce a dangerous storm surge on portions 
of the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas tonight 
and along the north shore of Cuba later on Sunday.
 
3. Heavy rainfall from Oscar will lead to areas of flash flooding 
along with the potential of mudslides across portions of eastern 
Cuba, especially within the Sierra Maestra.

Tropical Depression Nadine Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152024
1000 PM CDT Sat Oct 19 2024
 
Nadine has been moving farther inland over northern Guatemala, and 
there are no observations of tropical-storm-force winds.  Therefore, 
the system was downgraded to a tropical depression at the 
intermediate advisory.  Belize ground-based radar shows that 
Nadine has maintained a decent mid-level circulation and therefore, 
the initial intensity has been held at 30 kt for this advisory.  
Continued weakening is expected, and Nadine is forecast to 
dissipate over the rugged terrain of southern Mexico on Sunday.  

The depression is moving just south of west at 265/12 kt.  A 
slightly quicker west-southwestward motion is expected on Sunday.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Localized areas of flash flooding are possible along the track
of Nadine across southern Mexico, northern Guatemala, and northern
Belize.
