Hurricane Oscar Special Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162024
200 PM EDT Sat Oct 19 2024
 
This is a special advisory to update the initial and forecast 
intensity for Oscar and current watches and warnings. An Air Force 
Reserve Hurricane Hunter mission is currently flying through the 
system, and in their second southwest-to-northeast leg found 700 mb 
flight level winds of 76 kt, and a minimum central pressure of 989 
mb. The plane also reported a very small 3 n mi wide eye. A 
dropsonde recently launched in the northern quadrant also had a 150 
m boundary layer mean wind of 80 kt. A blend of these data supports 
upgrading Oscar to a hurricane this advisory with maximum sustained 
winds of 70 kt. The intensity forecast has been updated accordingly, 
and is substantially higher than the previous one.
 
Due to this unexpected higher intensity, the government of the
Bahamas has issued a Hurricane Warning for the Turks and Caicos
Islands and Southeastern Bahamas. The government of Cuba has also
issued a Hurricane Watch for the same area currently under a
Tropical Storm Warning.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Oscar is now expected to bring hurricane conditions to portions
of the southeastern Bahamas, Turks and Caicos Islands, and eastern
Cuba during the next day or so. A Hurricane Warning has now been
issued for those locations.
 
2. Oscar is expected to produce a dangerous storm surge on the
Turks and Caicos Islands beginning this evening.
 
3. Locally heavy rainfall is possible across the Turks and Caicos
Islands and the southeastern Bahamas later today and tonight. These
rains are expected to spread to eastern Cuba on Sunday.

westward motion is expected during the next day or so.  On the 
forecast track, Nadine is expected to move across Belize, northern 
Guatemala, and southern Mexico through Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Weakening is expected, and Nadine will likely dissipate by late 
Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles (315 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).

Tropical Storm Nadine Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152024
1000 AM CDT Sat Oct 19 2024
 
Nadine is very close to making landfall in Belize, near Belize City. 
The center is currently moving across the country's barrier islands 
of Turneffe Atoll and landfall on the mainland will likely occur 
within the next hour.  The sprawling tropical storm continues to 
slowly intensify, and a combination of objective and subjective 
satellite intensity estimates support increasing the maximum winds 
to 45 kt.  Furthermore, radar data indicate that the structure of 
Nadine has improved and there are curved bands surrounding the 
center.  The Air Force Hurricane Hunters are currently in the 
northern portion of the storm, and they will likely reach the center 
soon.  A Tropical Cyclone Update will be provided when the storm 
makes landfall.
 
The storm is moving due westward at 7 kt, and the system is expected 
to continue accelerating in that direction during the next day or 
so.  This motion should take Nadine across Belize, northern 
Guatemala, and southern Mexico later today through Sunday.
 
Nadine is expected to weaken after the core moves inland, and it
will likely dissipate over southern Mexico by late Sunday.  The
remnants have a high chance of reforming in the eastern Pacific
basin during the early to middle part of next week.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Localized areas of flash flooding are possible along the track
of Nadine across southern Mexico, northern Guatemala, and northern
Belize.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
coasts of Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico within the
warning area through this afternoon.
