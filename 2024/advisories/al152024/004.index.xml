The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Nadine, located just off the coast of Belize over the <br/>
northwestern Caribbean Sea.<br/>
<br/>
Near the Southeastern Bahamas (AL94):<br/>
Updated: Satellite data indicate that the low pressure system <br/>
located less than 100 miles east of the Turks and Caicos Islands has <br/>
developed a well-defined center and continues to produce a <br/>
concentrated area of showers and thunderstorms.  If the current <br/>
trends continue, advisories on a tropical depression or tropical <br/>
storm will likely be issued later this morning.  Interests in the <br/>
Turks and Caicos Islands, the southeastern Bahamas, and eastern <br/>
Cuba should closely monitor this system as tropical storm warnings <br/>
could be required later this morning.  <br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nadine was
located near latitude 17.3 North, longitude 87.9 West.  Nadine is
moving toward the west near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A faster westward 
motion is expected during the next day or so.  On the forecast 
track, Nadine is expected to make landfall near Belize City later 
this morning, and then move across Belize, northern Guatemala, and 
southern Mexico this afternoon through Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Weakening is expected after the storm moves 
inland, and it will likely dissipate by late Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles (315 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nadine can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Widespread 4 to 8 inch rainfall amounts are expected with
Nadine across northern Belize, northern Guatemala, and southern
Mexican states from Quintana Roo westward to Veracruz.  Isolated
areas of amounts exceeding 12 inches are also possible through late
Tuesday.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Nadine, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning area
through this afternoon.
 
STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding is possible in areas of onshore
winds near and to the north of where the center moves inland.

Tropical Storm Nadine Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152024
1000 AM CDT Sat Oct 19 2024
 
Nadine is very close to making landfall in Belize, near Belize City. 
The center is currently moving across the country's barrier islands 
of Turneffe Atoll and landfall on the mainland will likely occur 
within the next hour.  The sprawling tropical storm continues to 
slowly intensify, and a combination of objective and subjective 
satellite intensity estimates support increasing the maximum winds 
to 45 kt.  Furthermore, radar data indicate that the structure of 
Nadine has improved and there are curved bands surrounding the 
center.  The Air Force Hurricane Hunters are currently in the 
northern portion of the storm, and they will likely reach the center 
soon.  A Tropical Cyclone Update will be provided when the storm 
makes landfall.
 
The storm is moving due westward at 7 kt, and the system is expected 
to continue accelerating in that direction during the next day or 
so.  This motion should take Nadine across Belize, northern 
Guatemala, and southern Mexico later today through Sunday.
 
Nadine is expected to weaken after the core moves inland, and it
will likely dissipate over southern Mexico by late Sunday.  The
remnants have a high chance of reforming in the eastern Pacific
basin during the early to middle part of next week.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Localized areas of flash flooding are possible along the track
of Nadine across southern Mexico, northern Guatemala, and northern
Belize.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
coasts of Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico within the
warning area through this afternoon.
