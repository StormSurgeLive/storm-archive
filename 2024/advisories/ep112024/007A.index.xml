For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Eleven-E, located near the coast of southeastern <br/>
Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Western Portion of the East Pacific:<br/>
A low pressure system located well to the west-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula is producing <br/>
disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity.  Some limited <br/>
development is possible while the low moves slowly northward or <br/>
north-northeastward during the next couple of days.  Atmospheric <br/>
conditions should become less conducive and prevent further <br/>
development by the weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southwestern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure could form off the coast of southwestern <br/>
Mexico during the early to middle part of next week. Thereafter, <br/>
some slow development is possible while the system drifts <br/>
northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within the
next 24 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in southeastern Mexico should monitor the
progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM CST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Eleven-E
was located near latitude 15.0 North, longitude 95.7 West. The
depression is moving toward the northeast near 4 mph (6 km/h), and a
slightly faster northeastward to northward motion is forecast
through Friday. On the forecast track, the system is expected to
move toward southern Mexico and make landfall within the warning
area tonight or early Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts. Slight strengthening is possible, and the system is forecast
to be a tropical storm when it reaches the coast of Mexico.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Eleven-E can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO
header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within portions of
the warning area beginning later today and continuing into early
Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Eleven-E is expected to produce 4 to 8
inches of rainfall, with localized amounts up to 12 inches, across
portions of western Guatemala and the Mexican states of Chiapas,
Oaxaca, Veracruz, Tabasco, and coastal Guerrero. This rainfall may
lead to areas of flooding and mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Depression Eleven-E, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are affecting portions of
the coast of southern and southeastern Mexico. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM CST.

Tropical Depression Eleven-E Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112024
300 AM CST Thu Oct 03 2024
 
The depression still has a disheveled satellite appearance, with a 
few clusters of deep convection but no clear signs of improved 
organization since the previous advisory. This is consistent with 
the latest TAFB and SAB Dvorak estimates (T2.0/30-kt), and the 
initial intensity remains 30 kt. The center position of the system 
is very uncertain given the lack of recent microwave or 
scatterometer data. Based on recent fixes, satellite trends, and 
earlier scatterometer data, the center has been nudged slightly 
north and east of previous estimates. A partial scatterometer pass 
shows the depression is likely interacting with a larger trough that 
extends northward across the southwestern Gulf of Mexico.

The uncertain initial motion of the system is northeastward at 2 kt. 
In general, the global models show a northeastward to northward 
motion through Friday while the system approaches and moves across 
the coast of southern Mexico within the Tropical Storm Warning area. 
Once again, the NHC track forecast has been adjusted eastward based 
on the latest guidance. But, the forecast still might require future 
adjustments if it is determined that the center is located farther 
east than currently estimated.
 
Significant intensification appears unlikely given the broad, 
disorganized convective structure of the depression and continued 
northeasterly shear over the system. However, the warm SSTs and 
moist environment in which it is embedded could allow for the 
depression to become a tropical storm before it reaches the coast of 
Mexico, and this is reflected in the NHC intensity forecast. 
Regardless, the primary threat remains heavy rainfall that will 
continue over portions of southern Mexico for the next day or two.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The depression is forecast to become a tropical storm before it
reaches the coast of southern Mexico. A Tropical Storm Warning
remains in effect for portions of the southern coast of Mexico.
 
2. Tropical Depression Eleven-E will likely bring heavy rainfall to 
portions of southern Mexico and Guatemala this week. Flooding and 
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain, are possible, 
especially from western Guatemala into portions of the Mexican 
states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, Veracruz, Tabasco, and coastal Guerrero.
