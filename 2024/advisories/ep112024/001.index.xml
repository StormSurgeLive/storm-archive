Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 AM PDT Tue Oct 1 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
South of the Gulf of Tehuantepec (EP96):<br/>
Satellite images indicate that showers and thunderstorms associated <br/>
with an area of low pressure near the Gulf of Tehuantepec have <br/>
become better organized since yesterday.  If current trends <br/>
continue, advisories could be initiated on a tropical depression <br/>
this afternoon, and watches or warnings could be required for a <br/>
portion of the southeastern coast of Mexico.  Additionally, heavy <br/>
rain is likely along portions of the coast of southern Mexico and <br/>
northern Central America throughout this week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southern Mexico (EP97):<br/>
An area of low pressure located a few hundred miles south-southeast <br/>
of Acapulco continues to produce disorganized shower and <br/>
thunderstorm activity.  While environmental conditions are <br/>
generally conducive for development, the proximity of this system <br/>
to the low pressure area near the Gulf of Tehuantepec (EP96) could <br/>
limit development chances during the first couple of days. Later <br/>
this week, the system is forecast to begin moving slowly west- <br/>
northwestward, parallel to the coast of Mexico, with development <br/>
chances increasing by this weekend. This system is expected to <br/>
contribute to heavy rainfall across portions of the southwestern <br/>
coast of Mexico that were already adversely affected by <br/>
substantial rainfall last week, and interests there should monitor <br/>
the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Eleven-E
was located near latitude 15.1 North, longitude 94.6 West. The
depression is moving toward the north near 5 mph (7 km/h), and this 
general motion should continue for the next couple of days. On the 
forecast track, the depression is likely to approach the coast of 
Mexico within the warning area through tonight and move inland on 
Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
The depression is expected to become a tropical storm this evening 
or overnight, with further intensification possible until landfall.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Eleven-E can be found in the 
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO 
header WTPZ41 KNHC. 

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the 
warning area on Wednesday morning and are possible in the watch 
area on Wednesday afternoon. 

RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Eleven-E is expected to produce 4 to 8 
inches of rainfall, with localized amounts up to 12 inches, across 
portions of western Guatemala and the Mexican states of Chiapas, 
Oaxaca, Veracruz, and Tabasco. This rainfall may lead to areas of 
flooding and mudslides. 

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
this system, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total 
Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf 

SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are affecting portions of
the coast of southeastern Mexico.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 600 PM CST.
Next complete advisory at 900 PM CST.

Tropical Depression Eleven-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112024
300 PM CST Tue Oct 01 2024

The small area of low pressure we have been monitoring for the past 
couple of days has become well-defined on satellite imagery this 
afternoon and was confirmed with recent scatterometer data.  There 
has been enough organized deep convection today to consider this a 
tropical depression, as suggested by the Data-T estimate from 
TAFB, and the initial wind speed is set to 30 kt in accordance with 
the max believable scatterometer values.

The initial motion is an uncertain 360/4 kt.  The depression has 
been moving northward on the eastern end of the monsoon trough, and 
this general track is anticipated through landfall with little 
change seen in the steering flow for the next day or two.  However, 
the model guidance is all over the place, owing to differences in 
the initial depth of the tropical depression and strength of the 
circulation associated with the monsoon trough and Invest 97E.  The 
ECMWF model seems to have the best representation of the initial 
vortex, and the track forecast heavily leans on that model 
solution, especially given its recent successes with cyclones in 
that area.  However, there is considerable spread in the guidance, 
and the tropical storm warning is larger than typical based on that 
uncertainty.

Northeasterly shear is expected to continue to affect the 
depression through landfall, though very warm SSTs and a moist 
mid-level environment should promote some strengthening.  These 
conditions would seem to favor intensification through landfall, 
and the first forecast shows a mid-range tropical storm, above most 
of the model guidance.  At this point, extreme rainfall and flash 
flooding seem to be the biggest threats from this system.

 
KEY MESSAGES:

1. The depression is forecast to become a tropical storm later 
tonight or on Wednesday.   A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect 
for a portion of the coastline of southern Mexico, where tropical 
storm conditions are expected to begin on Wednesday.

2. Tropical Depression Eleven-E will likely bring heavy rainfall to 
portions of southern Mexico and Guatemala this week. Flooding and 
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain, are possible, 
especially from western Guatemala into portions of the Mexican 
states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, Veracruz, and Tabasco.
