For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Eleven-E, located near the coast of southeastern <br/>
Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Western Portion of the East Pacific (EP98):<br/>
A low pressure system located well to the west-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula is producing <br/>
disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity.  Some limited <br/>
development is possible while the low moves slowly northward or <br/>
north-northeastward during the next couple of days.  Atmospheric <br/>
conditions should become less conducive and prevent further <br/>
development by the weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent. <br/>

<br/>
Offshore of Southwestern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure could form off the coast of southwestern <br/>
Mexico during the early to middle part of next week. Thereafter, <br/>
some slow development is possible while the system drifts <br/>
northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

Warning west of Puerto Angel.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Puerto Angel to Boca de Pijijiapan
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within the
next 24 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in southeastern Mexico should monitor the
progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 PM CST (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression
Eleven-E was located near latitude 15.6 North, longitude 95.1 West.
The depression is moving toward the northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h),
and a northeastward to northward motion is forecast through Friday.
On the forecast track, the system is expected to move toward
southern Mexico and make landfall within the warning area tonight or
early Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts. Slight strengthening is possible, and the system could be 
a tropical storm when it reaches the coast of Mexico. Weakening is 
expected after landfall, and the system is forecast to dissipate on 
Saturday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Eleven-E can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO
header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within portions of
the warning area beginning later today and continuing into early
Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Eleven-E is expected to produce an
additional 3 to 6 inches of rainfall, with localized amounts up to 8
inches, across portions of the Mexican states of Chiapas, Oaxaca,
Veracruz Tabasco and coastal Guerrero. This rainfall may lead to
areas of flooding and mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Depression Eleven-E, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding from storm surge is possible in
areas of onshore flow.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are affecting portions of
the coast of southern and southeastern Mexico. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM CST.

<title>Tropical Depression Eleven-E Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>
<description>Issued at 900 AM CST Thu Oct 03 2024  <![CDATA[<pre>

WTPZ41 KNHC 031435
TCDEP1
 
Tropical Depression Eleven-E Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112024
900 AM CST Thu Oct 03 2024

The depression continues to produce a large, but poorly organized, 
area of convection, with the low-level center most likely in the 
northern portion of the convective mass.  Satellite intensity
estimates from SAB and TAFB remain 30 kt, and this is the initial 
intensity for this advisory.

The center position has a larger than normal amount of uncertainty, 
and the initial motion is also a bit uncertain at 045/5.  The track 
forecast guidance suggests a generally northward motion should occur 
during the next 24-36 h, and the new track forecast follows this in 
bringing the center to the coast of Mexico in 12-24 hours and inland 
over the Isthmus of Tehuantepec after that.  It is possible that 
some adjustments to the forecast may occur if data that better shows 
the center position becomes available.

While the environment does not favor significant strengthening 
before landfall, any intensification at all would bring the system 
to tropical storm strength, and the new intensity forecast continues 
to show this occurring. After landfall, the system should quickly 
weaken, with the remnants eventually becoming absorbed into the 
large area of disturbed weather that is forming over the western 
Gulf of Mexico.  While the forecast shows the system lasting through 
36 h, it could dissipate at any time as it crosses the mountains of 
Mexico.

Regardless of whether intensification occurs, the primary threat 
remains heavy rainfall that will continue over portions of southern 
Mexico for the next day or two.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The depression is forecast to become a tropical storm before it
reaches the coast of southern Mexico. A Tropical Storm Warning
remains in effect for portions of the southern coast of Mexico.
 
2. Tropical Depression Eleven-E will likely bring heavy rainfall to 
portions of southern Mexico this week. Flooding and mudslides, 
especially in areas of steep terrain, are possible, especially 
across portions of the Mexican states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, Veracruz, 
Tabasco and coastal Guerrero.
