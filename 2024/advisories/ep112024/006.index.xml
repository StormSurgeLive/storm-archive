DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM CST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Eleven-E
was located near latitude 14.2 North, longitude 96.7 West. The
depression is moving toward the southwest near 2 mph (4 km/h).  A 
turn to the north is expected on Thursday with that motion 
continuing through Friday.  On the forecast track, the system is 
expected to move toward southern Mexico and make landfall there 
Thursday night or Friday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is possible until the system reaches the 
coast of Mexico.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Eleven-E can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO
header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the Tropical
Storm Warning area late Thursday and Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Eleven-E is expected to produce 4 to 8
inches of rainfall, with localized amounts up to 12 inches, across
portions of western Guatemala and the Mexican states of Chiapas,
Oaxaca, Veracruz, Tabasco and coastal Guerrero. This rainfall may
lead to areas of flooding and mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Depression Eleven-E, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are affecting portions of
the coast of southern and southeastern Mexico.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1200 AM CST.
Next complete advisory at 300 AM CST.

Tropical Depression Eleven-E Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112024
900 PM CST Wed Oct 02 2024

The depression has changed little during the past several hours, 
and it remains embedded in a larger-scale trough that extends from 
offshore of Manzanillo northeastward to the central Gulf of Mexico.  
The system itself continues to produce patches of deep convection, 
and the initial intensity is held at 30 kt in agreement with 2.0 
Dvorak classifications from TAFB and SAB.

The depression has been drifting southwestward, but the models 
generally agree that an abrupt turn to the north should occur on 
Thursday, with that motion bringing the system to the coast of 
southern Mexico Thursday night or Friday.  The NHC track forecast 
has been adjusted to the east to be in better agreement with the 
latest models, but this prediction still lies to the west of most of 
the model solutions.

Strengthening is possible before the cyclone reaches the coast, but 
since the system remains disorganized and embedded in a larger 
trough, significant intensification seems unlikely.  The official 
intensity forecast is near the high end of the model guidance.  The 
main threat from this system is expected to be heavy rainfall that 
will likely continue in portions of southern Mexico during the next 
day or two.  
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The depression is forecast to become a tropical storm before it
reaches the coast of southern Mexico.  A Tropical Storm Warning 
remains in effect for portions of the southern coast of Mexico.
 
2. Tropical Depression Eleven-E will likely bring heavy rainfall to
portions of southern Mexico and Guatemala this week. Flooding and
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain, are possible,
especially from western Guatemala into portions of the Mexican
states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, Veracruz, Tabasco and coastal Guerrero.
