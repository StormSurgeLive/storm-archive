<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Eleven-E, located near the coast of southeastern <br/>
Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Western Portion of the East Pacific (EP98):<br/>
A low pressure system located well to the west-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula is producing <br/>
disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity.  Some limited <br/>
development is possible while the low moves slowly northward or <br/>
north-northeastward during the next couple of days.  Atmospheric <br/>
conditions should become less conducive and prevent further <br/>
development by the weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southwestern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure could form off the coast of southwestern <br/>
Mexico during the early to middle part of next week. Thereafter, <br/>
some slow development is possible while the system drifts <br/>
northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

...DEPRESSION DEGENERATES TO A TROUGH...
...REMNANTS TO PRODUCE HEAVY RAINS WITH FLOODING AND MUDSLIDES
IN PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM CST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.7N 94.6W
ABOUT 55 MI...85 KM SE OF SALINA CRUZ MEXICO
ABOUT 125 MI...205 KM E OF PUERTO ANGEL MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 360 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1006 MB...29.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warning for the coast of Mexico.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
Ther are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Although the warnings have been discontinued, interests in
southeastern Mexico should continue monitor the progress of this
system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the remnants of Eleven-E were located near
latitude 15.7 North, longitude 94.6 West. The remnants are moving
toward the north near 7 mph (11 km/h), and a northeastward to
northward motion is forecast through Friday. On the forecast track,
the remnants of the depression should move inland over the Isthmus
of Tehuantepec later today or tonight.
 
Satellite wind data indicate that maximum sustained winds are near
40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.  Weakening is expected, and the
remnants are forecast to dissipate over Mexico on Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center, mainly in offshore flow to the north and west of
the remnants.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for the Remnants of Eleven-E can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO
header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Gusts to tropical-storm force are possible along portions of
the coast of the Gulf of Tehuantepec this afternoon and tonight.
 
RAINFALL: Additional rainfall of 3 to 6 inches, with localized 
amounts up to 8 inches, is expected across portions of the Mexican 
states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, Veracruz Tabasco and coastal Guerrero. 
This rainfall may lead to areas of flooding and mudslides. 

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
the Remnants of Eleven-E, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding from storm surge is possible in
areas of onshore flow.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the Remnants of Eleven-E are affecting 
portions of the coast of southern and southeastern Mexico. These 
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system. For additional information on the remnants 
please see forecasts issued by the Meteorological Service of Mexico 
and High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, 
under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web

Remnants Of Eleven-E Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112024
300 PM CST Thu Oct 03 2024
 
A recent ASCAT overpass shows that a Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind
event has interacted with the depression and disrupted the
circulation.  The scatterometer data indicate that there is no
longer a well-defined closed circulation. although tropical-storm
force winds are occurring to the northwest of the remains of the
center.  Based on this, the depression has degenerated to an open
trough even though there are now stronger winds associated with the
system than earlier.  Thus, advisories and the Tropical Storm
Warnings are being discontinued, and the current winds will be
handled in marine gale warnings.
 
The remnants of the center are near a cluster of convection over
the Gulf of Tehuantepec, and they should move northward over
southeastern Mexico in the next 6-12 h.  The remnants are expected
to dissipate over Mexico on Friday.
 
Although the depression has degenerated, the threat of heavy
rainfall will continue over portions of southern Mexico for the
next day or two.
 
For additional information on the remnant low please see forecasts
from the Meteorological Service of Mexico and High Seas Forecasts
issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header
NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Although the Tropical Storm Warnings have been discontinued,
wind gusts to tropical-storm force are possible for the next
several hours along the coast of the Gulf of Tehuantepec,
particularly in areas of onshore winds.
 
2. Due to the remnants of Tropical Depression Eleven-E, additional 
heavy rainfall is likely across portions of southern Mexico this 
week. Flooding and mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain, 
are possible, especially across portions of the Mexican states of 
Chiapas, Oaxaca, Veracruz, Tabasco and coastal Guerrero.
