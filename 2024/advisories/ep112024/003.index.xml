Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 PM PDT Tue Oct 1 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Eleven-E, located near the coast of southeastern <br/>
Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southern Mexico (EP97):<br/>
An area of low pressure located a few hundred miles south-southeast <br/>
of Acapulco, Mexico continues to produce disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms.  While environmental conditions are generally <br/>
conducive for development, the close proximity of Tropical <br/>
Depression Eleven-E could limit development during the next day or <br/>
two. Late this week, the system is forecast to begin moving slowly <br/>
west-northwestward, parallel to the coast of Mexico, and gradual <br/>
development seems likely. This system is expected to add to heavy <br/>
rainfall across portions of the southwestern coast of Mexico that <br/>
were already adversely affected by substantial rainfall last week, <br/>
and interests there should monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
Public Advisories on Tropical Depression Eleven-E are issued under <br/>
WMO header WTPZ31 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCPEP1. <br/>

...DEPRESSION FARTHER WEST THAN PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED...
...TROPICAL STORM WARNING EXTENDED WESTWARD ALONG THE SOUTHERN
COAST OF MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM CST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.4N 95.8W
ABOUT 50 MI...80 KM ESE OF PUERTO ANGEL MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 6 MPH...9 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1005 MB...29.68 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has extended the Tropical Storm Warning
westward along the southern coast of Mexico to Lagunas de Chacahua,
and discontinued the Tropical Storm Watch east of Boca de
Pijijiapan to the Mexico/Guatemala border.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Lagunas de Chacahua to Boca de Pijijiapan
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within the next 36 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in southeastern Mexico should monitor the
progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
Satellite-derived wind data indicate that the depression is located
farther west than previously estimated.  At 300 AM CST (0900 UTC),
the center of Tropical Depression Eleven-E was located near latitude
15.4 North, longitude 95.8 West.  The depression is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this general motion is
expected to continue for the next day or so.  On the forecast
track, the center of the depression will be near the coast of
Mexico in the Tropical Storm Warning area late tonight or early 
Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is possible before the center reaches the
coast, and the system could become a tropical storm later today.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Eleven-E can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO
header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the Tropical 
Storm Warning area today and tonight.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Eleven-E is expected to produce 4 to 8
inches of rainfall, with localized amounts up to 12 inches, across
portions of western Guatemala and the Mexican states of Chiapas,
Oaxaca, Veracruz, and Tabasco. This rainfall may lead to areas of
flooding and mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Depression Eleven-E, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are affecting portions of
the coast of southern and southeastern Mexico.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 600 AM CST.
Next complete advisory at 900 AM CST.

<title>Tropical Depression Eleven-E Forecast Discussion Number 3</title>

Tropical Depression Eleven-E Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112024
300 AM CST Wed Oct 02 2024

Data from both ASCAT-B and ASCAT-C scatterometers show that the 
center of the small circulation is located somewhat west to 
west-southwest of the earlier track.  There were a couple of 
scatterometer vectors showing minimal tropical-storm-force winds, 
but these appear to be rain-inflated.  The advisory intensity is 
kept at 30 kt based on subjective and objective satellite 
estimates, and the unimpressive appearance of the system.

With the re-positioning of the estimated center, the motion is 
highly uncertain but my best guess is around 290/5 kt.  The track 
forecast is also quite uncertain, but needs to be shifted westward 
from the previous one.  The new official forecast is a compromise 
between the previous NHC prediction, the trajectory model 
forecasts, and the dynamical models which are farther south.

The cyclone continues to have the potential for a little 
strengthening before it reaches the coast, although fairly strong 
northeasterly vertical wind shear will likely limit its 
intensification.  The official intensity forecast is near the upper 
end of the model guidance.  The main impact from this system
is expected to be heavy rainfall, which could lead to flooding and
mudslides over portions of southern Mexico and western Guatemala.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The depression is forecast to become a tropical storm before it
reaches the coast of southern or southeastern Mexico.  Since the 
system is now farther west than earlier indicated, the Tropical 
Storm Warning has been extended westward along the southern coast 
of Mexico.
 
2. Tropical Depression Eleven-E will likely bring heavy rainfall to 
portions of southern Mexico and Guatemala this week. Flooding and 
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain, are possible, 
especially from western Guatemala into portions of the Mexican 
states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, Veracruz, and Tabasco.
