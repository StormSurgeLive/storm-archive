Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 PM PDT Tue Oct 1 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on newly formed <br/>
Tropical Depression Eleven-E, located near the coast of southeastern <br/>
Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southern Mexico (EP97):<br/>
An area of low pressure located a few hundred miles south-southeast <br/>
of Acapulco continues to produce disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms.  While environmental conditions are generally <br/>
conducive for development, the close proximity of Tropical <br/>
Depression Eleven-E could limit development during the next day or <br/>
two. Late this week, the system is forecast to begin moving slowly <br/>
west-northwestward, parallel to the coast of Mexico, and gradual <br/>
development seems likely. This system is expected to contribute to <br/>
heavy rainfall across portions of the southwestern coast of Mexico <br/>
that were already adversely affected by substantial rainfall last <br/>
week, and interests there should monitor the progress of this <br/>
system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
Public Advisories on Tropical Depression Eleven-E are issued under <br/>
WMO header WTPZ31 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCPEP1. <br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM CST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Eleven-E
was located near latitude 15.3 North, longitude 94.6 West. The
depression is moving toward the north near 5 mph (7 km/h), and this
general motion should continue during the next couple of days. On 
the forecast track, the depression is likely to approach the coast 
of Mexico within the warning area through tonight and move inland on
Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts. The depression is expected to become a tropical storm 
later tonight, with further intensification possible until
landfall.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Eleven-E can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO
header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the
warning area Wednesday morning and are possible in the watch area 
on Wednesday afternoon.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Eleven-E is expected to produce 4 to 8
inches of rainfall, with localized amounts up to 12 inches, across
portions of western Guatemala and the Mexican states of Chiapas,
Oaxaca, Veracruz, and Tabasco. This rainfall may lead to areas of
flooding and mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
this system, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are affecting portions of
the coast of southern and southeastern Mexico.  These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 900 PM CST.

Tropical Depression Eleven-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112024
300 PM CST Tue Oct 01 2024

The small area of low pressure we have been monitoring for the past 
couple of days has become well-defined on satellite imagery this 
afternoon and was confirmed with recent scatterometer data.  There 
has been enough organized deep convection today to consider this a 
tropical depression, as suggested by the Data-T estimate from 
TAFB, and the initial wind speed is set to 30 kt in accordance with 
the max believable scatterometer values.

The initial motion is an uncertain 360/4 kt.  The depression has 
been moving northward on the eastern end of the monsoon trough, and 
this general track is anticipated through landfall with little 
change seen in the steering flow for the next day or two.  However, 
the model guidance is all over the place, owing to differences in 
the initial depth of the tropical depression and strength of the 
circulation associated with the monsoon trough and Invest 97E.  The 
ECMWF model seems to have the best representation of the initial 
vortex, and the track forecast heavily leans on that model 
solution, especially given its recent successes with cyclones in 
that area.  However, there is considerable spread in the guidance, 
and the tropical storm warning is larger than typical based on that 
uncertainty.

Northeasterly shear is expected to continue to affect the 
depression through landfall, though very warm SSTs and a moist 
mid-level environment should promote some strengthening.  These 
conditions would seem to favor intensification through landfall, 
and the first forecast shows a mid-range tropical storm, above most 
of the model guidance.  At this point, extreme rainfall and flash 
flooding seem to be the biggest threats from this system.

 
KEY MESSAGES:

1. The depression is forecast to become a tropical storm later 
tonight or on Wednesday.   A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect 
for a portion of the coastline of southern Mexico, where tropical 
storm conditions are expected to begin on Wednesday.

2. Tropical Depression Eleven-E will likely bring heavy rainfall to 
portions of southern Mexico and Guatemala this week. Flooding and 
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain, are possible, 
especially from western Guatemala into portions of the Mexican 
states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, Veracruz, and Tabasco.
