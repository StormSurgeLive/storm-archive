Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 PM PDT Tue Oct 1 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Eleven-E, located near the coast of southeastern <br/>
Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southern Mexico (EP97):<br/>
An area of low pressure located a few hundred miles south-southeast <br/>
of Acapulco, Mexico continues to produce disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms.  While environmental conditions are generally <br/>
conducive for development, the close proximity of Tropical <br/>
Depression Eleven-E could limit development during the next day or <br/>
two. Late this week, the system is forecast to begin moving slowly <br/>
west-northwestward, parallel to the coast of Mexico, and gradual <br/>
development seems likely. This system is expected to add to heavy <br/>
rainfall across portions of the southwestern coast of Mexico that <br/>
were already adversely affected by substantial rainfall last week, <br/>
and interests there should monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
Public Advisories on Tropical Depression Eleven-E are issued under <br/>
WMO header WTPZ31 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCPEP1. <br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 AM CST (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression
Eleven-E was located near latitude 15.7 North, longitude 94.7 West.
The depression is moving toward the north near 6 mph (9 km/h) and
this general motion is expected to continue during the next day or 
two.  On the forecast track, the depression will likely move inland 
later today.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some slow strengthening is possible before the system
reaches the coast, and it could become a tropical storm this 
morning.  Weakening is expected after landfall.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Eleven-E can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO
header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the
warning later this morning and are possible in the watch area this 
afternoon.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Eleven-E is expected to produce 4 to 8
inches of rainfall, with localized amounts up to 12 inches, across
portions of western Guatemala and the Mexican states of Chiapas,
Oaxaca, Veracruz, and Tabasco. This rainfall may lead to areas of
flooding and mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
this system, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are affecting portions of
the coast of southern and southeastern Mexico.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 300 AM CST.

<title>Tropical Depression Eleven-E Forecast Discussion Number 2</title>

Tropical Depression Eleven-E Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112024
900 PM CST Tue Oct 01 2024

The depression has not become better organized this evening.  Deep 
convection has been separating from the low-level center, which is 
now exposed to the east of the thunderstorms.  The initial 
intensity is held at 30 kt, near the high end of the satellite 
estimates.  

The system is close to the coast, currently over the Gulf of 
Tehuantepec, and appears to be moving northward at about 5 kt.  
The models don't have a good handle on this system, likely because 
it is weak and relatively small.  The official track forecast 
continues to lean heavily on the ECMWF solution, taking the system 
inland over southern Mexico on Wednesday.

There could be a little strengthening before the depression reaches 
the coast, but given its current structure, significant 
intensification is not expected.  The main impact from the system 
is expected to be heavy rainfall, which could lead to flooding and 
mudslides over portions of southern Mexico and western Guatemala. 

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The depression is forecast to become a tropical storm before it
moves inland over southern or southeastern Mexico on Wednesday.   A
Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect for that area.
 
2. Tropical Depression Eleven-E will likely bring heavy rainfall to
portions of southern Mexico and Guatemala this week. Flooding and
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain, are possible,
especially from western Guatemala into portions of the Mexican
states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, Veracruz, and Tabasco.
