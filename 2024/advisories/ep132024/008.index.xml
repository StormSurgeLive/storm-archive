Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
400 AM PST Sun Nov 3 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Lane, located over the western portion of the eastern <br/>
Pacific basin. <br/>
<br/>
Southwest of Southwestern Mexico (EP93):<br/>
An area of low pressure located well to the south of the southern <br/>
tip of Baja California is producing some disorganized shower and <br/>
thunderstorm activity.  Environmental conditions appear marginally <br/>
conducive for some additional development of this slow-moving small <br/>
system, and a tropical depression could form over the next several <br/>
days.  The low is expected to begin an eastward drift in a few days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

Post-Tropical Cyclone Lane Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP132024
700 AM PST Sun Nov 03 2024
 
Lane has degenerated into a remnant low.  The exposed low-level 
circulation is well separated from deep convection associated with 
the monsoon trough based on geostationary satellite imagery.  The 
low is expected to move just south of west for the next couple of 
days in the near surface flow.  Lane should open into a trough by 
mid-week, however this could occur sooner.  This is the last NHC 
advisory on this system.
