Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 PM PDT Sat Nov 2 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Lane, located over the western portion of the eastern Pacific <br/>
basin. <br/>
<br/>
Southwest of Southwestern Mexico (EP93):<br/>
An area of low pressure located well to the south of the southern <br/>
tip of Baja California is producing some disorganized shower <br/>
and thunderstorm activity.  Environmental conditions appear <br/>
marginally conducive for some additional development of this <br/>
slow-moving system, and a tropical depression could form over the <br/>
next several days.  The low is expected to begin an eastward drift <br/>
in a few days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Lane Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP132024
100 AM PST Sun Nov 03 2024
 
Lane is fading fast.  Strong southwesterly shear associated with the 
flow on the southern side of a broad upper-level trough has 
disrupted the circulation of the tropical cyclone.  Recent 
scatterometer data show that the low-level circulation center is 
losing definition, and the maximum winds have decreased to 30 kt at 
most.  Enhanced infrared satellite imagery shows that most of the 
associated deep convection, which was displaced well to the 
northeast of the estimated center, is dissipating.  Given the 
current degradation of circulation and convection, the system is now 
expected to degenerate into a remnant low in about 12 hours.
 
The initial motion is slightly south of west at around 5 kt.  This
general motion should continue for the next couple of days while
the system is steered by the shallow low-level easterlies.  The
official track forecast has again been shifted slightly southward
to conform to the latest numerical guidance.
