Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 PM PDT Sat Nov 2 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Lane, located over the western portion of the eastern Pacific <br/>
basin. <br/>
<br/>
Southwest of Southwestern Mexico (EP93):<br/>
Recent visible satellite imagery indicates that the area of low <br/>
pressure located well offshore of the southwestern coast of Mexico <br/>
has a well-defined circulation, although shower and thunderstorm <br/>
activity is currently limited and disorganized. Environmental <br/>
conditions appear marginally conducive for some additional <br/>
development of this system, and a tropical depression could form <br/>
over the next several days as the system continues to move slowly. <br/>
The low is expected to begin an eastward drift by the early to <br/>
middle part of the upcoming week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

...LANE QUICKLY LOSING ORGANIZATION...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 PM PDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...11.3N 130.7W
ABOUT 1585 MI...2555 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 270 DEGREES AT 6 MPH...9 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1007 MB...29.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM PDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lane was
located near latitude 11.3 North, longitude 130.7 West. Lane is
moving toward the west near 6 mph (9 km/h) and a general westward
to west-southwestward motion is expected for the next several days
before the cyclone dissipates.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Weakening is forecast to continue, and Lane could 
become a remnant low tomorrow and open up into a trough by Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).

Tropical Storm Lane Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP132024
200 PM PDT Sat Nov 02 2024
 
Satellite imagery depicts that Lane has been struggling the last 
several hours, and appears more disorganized. The overall convective 
canopy has deteriorated with warming cloud tops. Southwesterly shear 
is starting to increase based on the latest visible images, and the 
low-level center is located on the southwest edge of the convection. 
Objective and subjective satellite intensity estimates have remained 
steady throughout the day around 35 to 45 kt. Given the current 
satellite presentation and using a blend of these satellite 
estimates, the initial intensity is held at 40 kt for this advisory.
 
Lane continues to move generally westward at 270/6 kt, and this 
general motion should continue over the next few days as the storm 
is steered by a a subtropical ridge to the north. The latest NHC 
forecast is very similar to the previous one, with a slight nudge to 
the left.
 
Some intensity fluctuations are possible through today, though 
southwesterly shear is starting to increase over the system. This 
shear combined with a drier airmass along the forecast track will 
lead to a steady weakening trend beginning on Sunday. Lane is 
forecast to degenerate to a post-tropical remnant low in about 36 h, 
although given the small size of the system it could dissipate even 
sooner than forecast.
