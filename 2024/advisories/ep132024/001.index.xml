1100 AM PDT Fri Nov 1 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Central East Pacific (EP92):<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity associated with an area of low <br/>
pressure located more than 1000 miles southwest of the southern tip <br/>
of the Baja California peninsula has become better organized today. <br/>
A tropical depression could form during the next couple of days <br/>
while the low moves slowly westward.  By late this weekend, however, <br/>
environmental conditions are expected to become less conducive for <br/>
development.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Southwest of Southwestern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure could form well offshore of southwestern <br/>
Mexico during the early to middle part of next week.  Afterward, <br/>
some slow development is possible while the system drifts slowly <br/>
east-northeastward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Thirteen-E Discussion Number   1...Corrected
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP132024
200 PM PDT Fri Nov 01 2024

Correct storm to cyclone in the second paragraph

The area of low pressure located more than 1000 miles southwest of 
the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula has continued to 
become better organized this afternoon. An ASCAT pass early this 
morning indicated a well-defined circulation, and deep convection 
near the center has persisted throughout the day. A subjective 
Dvorak estimate from TAFB at 18Z was T2.5, and objective satellite 
intensity estimates suggest that the winds have increased to near 30 
kt. Based on these data, advisories are initiated on Tropical 
Depression Thirteen, with an initial intensity of 30 kt.

The initial motion of this tropical cyclone is westward at 270/6 
kt. The depression is expected to continue on a generally westward 
trajectory during the next day or two as it is steered by a broad 
mid-level ridge to the north of the system. The track guidance is in 
good agreement for the next several days, and the official forecast 
track represents a blend of the HCCA and TVCN consensus models.

The depression is expected to be a short-lived system. The intensity 
forecast indicates that the depression will remain below tropical 
storm status through the weekend, though a low-end tropical storm 
cannot be ruled out. By late this weekend, vertical wind shear is 
expected to increase significantly, and the system is expected to 
dissipate into a remnant low after about two days. The NHC intensity 
forecast is in the middle of the guidance envelope and is similar to 
the IVCN consensus model.
