Tropical Storm Leslie Discussion Number  34
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 PM AST Thu Oct 10 2024

The center of Leslie has been exposed for the past 6 h, thanks to 
strong northerly wind shear.  The center has continued to move 
farther away from the convection as the afternoon has progressed.  
The initial intensity is brought down to 60 kt, which agrees with a 
blend of the various objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS.
 
Leslie continues to plow through a zone of strong northerly shear, 
and the SHIPS guidance and model fields indicate Leslie will 
continue to experience 40 kt of northerly to northeasterly shear for 
another 12 to 24 h.  In addition, Leslie is forecast to continue 
moving through a relatively dry environment.  Rapid weakening is 
expected to continue over the next 12 to 24 h, and the latest NHC 
intensity forecast is lower than the previous one due to the weaker 
initial intensity.  If Leslie survives as a tropical cyclone for 
another two days, which is not guaranteed, it will approach a 
frontal zone in 2 to 3 days and could take on some frontal 
characteristics.  While all of the models show Leslie dissipating 
by 4 to 5 days, there is significant uncertainty on whether Leslie 
will become extratropical or just dissipate.
 
Leslie is moving northwestward, or 315/7 kt.  Model guidance is in 
good agreement that a northward turn will happen very soon as 
Leslie moves around the southwestern periphery of a subtropical 
ridge over the eastern Atlantic.  On Friday and Friday night, the 
hurricane should speed up and turn to the northeast, followed by an 
east-northeastward turn as it accelerates further over the weekend.  
There is a bit of along-track spread in the guidance after 48 h, as 
some of the models show Leslie accelerating faster toward the 
east-northeast.  Only minor changes are made to the previous NHC 
track to account for the models being slightly farther west during 
the first 36 h of the forecast.

inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline in
the indicated locations. For a depiction of areas at risk, please
see the National Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone 
Milton was located near latitude 29.3 North, longitude 77.5 West.  
Milton is moving toward the east-northeast near 21 mph (33 km/h).  
A turn toward the east is expected later today, with that motion 
forecast to continue over the western Atlantic for the next few 
days.  On the forecast track, the center of Milton will continue to 
move away from the east coast of Florida and pass north of the 
northwestern Bahamas this afternoon.
 
Satellite-derived wind data indicate Milton has become a powerful 
post-tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds near 75 mph (120 
km/h) with higher gusts.  Gradual weakening is expected during the 
next several days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) 
northwest of the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend 
outward up to 310 miles (500 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 983 mb (29.03 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Milton can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL to Altamaha Sound, GA...3-5 ft
St. Johns River...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Additional rainfall amounts around an inch are possible
along the northeastern coast of Florida through today.  In the wake
of heavy rainfall from Milton, the risk of considerable urban
flooding will linger through this morning across east central
Florida.  Moderate to major river flooding is ongoing and forecast
throughout central Florida.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Post-Tropical Cyclone Milton, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions will continue within the tropical 
storm warning areas in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina for the 
next few hours.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Milton are expected to continue to
affect portions of the southeast U.S. and the Bahamas during the
next couple of days.  These swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.

Hurricane Milton Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
1100 AM EDT Thu Oct 10 2024
 
Milton is quickly taking on extratropical characteristics, with
convection more closely aligned along a warm frontal boundary to
the northeast than the center itself.  Due to the structure
evolution, it is likely that the strongest winds are located to the
northwest of the center.  The intensity is lowered to 70 kt, based
on continuity from the previous forecast.  Scatterometer passes are
expected in a few hours and should allow us to get a better handle
on Milton's intensity and structure.
 
The hurricane has turned east-northeastward (065/17 kt).  Milton is
located within the base of a deep-layer trough located over the
western Atlantic, and this feature should steer the storm eastward
later today, with that motion continuing for the next 3 days.  The
NHC forecast is a little faster than the previous prediction to
follow the recent trends in the model guidance.
 
Global model fields show low-level thickness contours packing
closer together on the northwest side through the day, and it is
therefore likely that Milton will complete extratropical transition
by this afternoon or evening.  Milton will still be a powerful
post-tropical cyclone, but its maximum winds are expected to
gradually decrease during the next few days.  The post-tropical low
is expected to become diffuse and will likely dissipate in about 4
days.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. A Storm Surge Warning remains in effect for portions of the east
coast of Florida and southern coast of Georgia.  Storm surge
inundation will continue in these areas through this afternoon.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions will continue along portions of the
southeast U.S. coast through this afternoon and over the extreme
northwestern Bahamas through this evening.
 
3. In the wake of heavy rainfall from Milton, the risk of
considerable urban flooding will linger through this afternoon
across east central Florida.  Moderate to major river flooding is
ongoing and forecast throughout central Florida.
 
4. Use caution after the storm as deadly hazards remain including
downed power lines and flooded areas.  Ensure generators are
properly ventilated and placed outside at least 20 feet away from
doors, windows, and garages to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.
If you are cleaning up storm damage, be careful when using
chainsaws and power tools, and drink plenty of water to avoid heat
exhaustion.
