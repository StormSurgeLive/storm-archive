Near the Cabo Verde Islands (AL94):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms remain disorganized in association with an <br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the Azores should monitor the progress of Leslie.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Leslie was
located near latitude 29.3 North, longitude 47.9 West. Leslie is
moving toward the northeast near 22 mph (35 km/h) and a 
northeastward to east-northeastward motion with an increase in
forward speed is expected during the next couple of days.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Leslie is expected to pass south of 
the Azores late Sunday or Sunday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is expected through Saturday.  After 
that, Leslie is likely to weaken and become extratropical Saturday 
night or Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
mainly to the southeast of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Tropical Storm Leslie Discussion Number  39
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
1100 PM AST Fri Oct 11 2024

Convection associated with Leslie has been increasing during the 
past several hours as the cyclone moves into an area of temporarily 
decreased shear. A recent ASCAT overpass showed winds of 40-45 kt in 
the southeastern quadrant, and based on these data the initial 
intensity is held at 45 kt.  The scatterometer data also suggest 
that the circulation is becoming somewhat distorted due to the rapid 
northeastward motion.

The initial motion is now 035/19 kt.  The cyclone is accelerating 
northeastward as it moves into the mid-latitude southwesterly flow 
to the east of a deep-layer trough over the northwestern Atlantic.  
This general motion should continue for 24 h or so.  After that, 
Leslie or its remnants should turn eastward and east-southeastward 
on the southwestern side of another deep-layer trough located over 
the northeastern Atlantic, with this motion continuing until the 
system dissipates.  There are no significant changes in the track 
guidance since the previous advisory, and the new forecast track is 
similar to the previous track.

Shear over Leslie should remain relatively low for the next    12-18 
h, allowing the current convection to continue and the system to 
maintain tropical cyclone status during that time.  The global 
models have come into good agreement that Leslie will merge with a 
frontal system to become extratropical between 24-36 h, and thus the 
intensity forecast status has been adjusted accordingly.  The 
extratropical cyclone should subsequently weaken and be absorbed 
into the larger system over the eastern Atlantic by 96 h. It should 
be noted that while the models show a closed low pressure area 
through 72 h, the circulation could degenerate into an open trough 
before then due to the fast forward speed.
