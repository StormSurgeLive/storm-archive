Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Sat Oct 12 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Leslie, located over the central Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
The circulation associated with an area of low pressure located a <br/>
couple of hundred miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands appears to <br/>
have become slightly better defined this morning. However, the <br/>
associated shower and thunderstorm activity is only marginally <br/>
well-organized, and environmental conditions are expected to become <br/>
less conducive for further development later today. A short-lived <br/>
tropical depression could still form at any time today while the <br/>
system moves generally westward. After that time, the system is <br/>
forecast to continue moving westward across the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic, but further development is not anticipated through at <br/>
least the middle of next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>

Remnants Of Leslie Advisory Number  41
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
300 PM GMT Sat Oct 12 2024
 
...LESLIE DEGENERATES INTO A TROUGH...
...THIS IS THE LAST NHC ADVISORY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM GMT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...33.3N 43.4W
ABOUT 975 MI...1570 KM WSW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 50 DEGREES AT 31 MPH...50 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the remnants of Leslie were located near
latitude 33.3 North, longitude 43.4 West. The remnants are moving
quickly toward the northeast near 31 mph (50 km/h). A gradual turn 
toward the east at a fast forward speed is expected starting 
tonight, with a continued eastward motion expected into early next 
week. The remnants of Leslie are expected to move over or very near 
the Azores Sunday and early Monday.
 
Recent satellite-derived wind data indicate that Leslie has 
degenerated into a trough, but maximum sustained winds remain near 
50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. The remnants of Leslie are 
expected to gradually weaken during the next couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane 
Center on this system. Additional information on this system can be 
found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, 
under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at

Remnants Of Leslie Discussion Number  41
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
300 PM GMT Sat Oct 12 2024
 
ASCAT-B data valid near 1300 UTC indicated that Leslie's fast 
forward motion has caused it to open into a trough. Therefore, this 
will be the last NHC advisory on Leslie. The ASCAT data indicated 
that winds of 40-45 kt are still present on the east side of 
Leslie's remnants, where it continues to produce limited deep 
convection.
 
A mid-latitude frontal system is nearing the remnants of Leslie, and 
the two systems are expected to merge within the next 12 h or so, 
marking Leslie's full transition to a post-tropical cyclone. It is 
possible that Leslie will redevelop a closed circulation as a 
non-tropical low at that point. The cyclone is expected to turn 
eastward on Sunday, bringing it very near or over the Azores late 
Sunday and through early Monday. By Monday afternoon, Leslie's 
center is expected to become poorly defined again as it interacts 
with another weaker mid-latitude cyclone to the east of the Azores.

Additional information on this system can be found in High Seas 
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header 
NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
