800 PM EDT Thu Oct 3 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Kirk, located over the central subtropical Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
Tropical Storm Leslie, located over the eastern tropical Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
A trough of low pressure is producing a large area of disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms over portions of the central and western <br/>
Gulf of Mexico.  A broad area of low pressure is expected to form <br/>
over the south-central or southwestern Gulf of Mexico this weekend. <br/>
Gradual development is possible after the low develops, and a <br/>
tropical or subtropical depression or storm could form during the <br/>
early or middle portions of next week while the low moves slowly <br/>
eastward.  Regardless of development, locally heavy rains could <br/>
occur over portions of Mexico during the next few days and over <br/>
portions of the Florida Peninsula from late this weekend into next <br/>
week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>

1100 PM AST Thu Oct 03 2024
 
...KIRK IS A POWERFUL CATEGORY 4 HURRICANE...
...LARGE SWELLS COULD REACH THE U.S. EAST COAST BY SUNDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.5N 47.5W
ABOUT 1040 MI...1670 KM ENE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 1670 MI...2685 KM SW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...145 MPH...230 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...935 MB...27.61 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Kirk was located
near latitude 21.5 North, longitude 47.5 West. Kirk is moving toward
the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h) and this general motion is
expected to continue through Friday. A turn toward the north and
north-northeast at a faster forward speed is forecast over the
weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 145 mph (230 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Kirk is a category 4 hurricane on the
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some additional strengthening
is possible through early Friday, but steady weakening is expected
after that.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 935 mb (27.61 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are spreading westward and are
expected to reach portions of the Leeward Islands on Friday,
Bermuda and the Greater Antilles on Saturday, and the east
coast of the United States, Atlantic Canada, and the Bahamas on
Sunday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

<title>Hurricane Kirk Forecast Discussion Number 19</title>

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
1100 PM AST Thu Oct 03 2024
 
Kirk continues to prosper.  The earlier eyewall replacement cycle
appears to have completed, and Kirk is back on a strengthening
trend.  Satellite images indicate that Kirk has a circular and
clear 15 n mi eye surrounded by a solid ring of intense deep
convection.  The latest satellite intensity estimates range from
115 to 135 kt, and based on that data, the initial wind speed is
increased to 125 kt.
 
The hurricane is moving northwestward at 9 kt, and this general
motion should continue through Friday as Kirk continues to move
along the southwestern periphery of a high pressure ridge over the
central and eastern subtropical Atlantic.  A turn to the north is
expected on Saturday when Kirk reaches the western periphery of the
ridge and as a shortwave trough approaches the system.  This trough
and a reinforcing one should cause the hurricane to accelerate
northeastward on Sunday and early next week.  The models are in
fairly good agreement on this overall scenario, and the NHC track
forecast has been nudged westward to be in better agreement with
the latest model runs.
 
Kirk could strengthen a little more during the next 12 hours or so,
but increasing vertical wind shear and intrusions of dry air should
cause a steady weakening trend to begin shortly after that.  Kirk
will likely complete extratropical transition when it moves
over cool waters sometime between day 4 and day 5, but it is
expected to remain a powerful system throughout the forecast
period.  The NHC track forecast is in best agreement with the HCCA
and IVCN consensus models.
 
Even though Kirk is expected to stay over the open Atlantic, its
strong intensity and increasing size will cause large ocean swells
to propagate far away from the hurricane.   These swells will likely
increase the risk of dangerous surf and rip currents across the
Leeward Islands beginning Friday, Bermuda and the Greater Antilles
by Saturday, and much of the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic Canada, and
the Bahamas by Sunday.  For more information on this hazard, see
products issued by your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Leslie Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 PM AST Thu Oct 03 2024
 
Leslie is becoming better organized this afternoon, but continues to 
battle wind shear due to the outflow from Hurricane Kirk. The center 
is becoming more well-defined on visible satellite imagery and 
convection is increasing along the southern semi-circle. Subjective 
Dvorak satellite estimates from TAFB and SAB show a Data-T number of 
3.0, corresponding with the initial intensity of 45 kt.
 
The tropical storm is drifting westward at 270/5 kt along the 
southern periphery of a subtropical ridge in the eastern Atlantic. 
Leslie is forecast to move slowly westward over the next day or so 
before gradually turning west-northwestward, then accelerating to 
the northwest this weekend. Model guidance has shifted slightly 
westward, and the official NHC track forecast has followed suit and 
lies near the simple consensus aids.

Leslie has been slowly strengthening today. Steady strengthening is 
expected over the next 36-48 hr as the shear from Hurricane Kirk 
lessen, and Leslie moves through a more favorable atmospheric and 
oceanic environment. The spread in model intensity guidance has 
increased this afternoon, and the hurricane models have suggested 
the potential for rapid strengthening. The official NHC intensity 
forecast lies near the simple consensus aids, although it still 
lies below some of the regional hurricane models and HCCA. The 
intensity forecast will plateau by the end of the forecast period 
as Leslie moves into the cold wake of Kirk.
