Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Tue Oct 8 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Leslie, located over the central tropical Atlantic Ocean, and <br/>
on Hurricane Milton, located over the southern Gulf of Mexico. <br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
A non-tropical area of low pressure located just northeast of the <br/>
northwestern Bahamas is producing gale-force winds.  This system <br/>
could acquire some tropical or subtropical characteristics over the <br/>
next day or so while the low moves northeastward to east- <br/>
northeastward around 15 mph.  Upper-level winds are likely to <br/>
increase by Wednesday night, which should end any chances for <br/>
further development.  Additional information on this system, <br/>
including gale warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued <br/>
by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa in <br/>
a day or two.  Afterward, environmental conditions appear only <br/>
marginally favorable for some limited development of this system <br/>
while it moves westward or west-northwestward across the eastern <br/>
tropical Atlantic, moving near the Cabo Verde Islands late Thursday <br/>
through Friday. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
<br/>
High Seas Forecasts are issued by the National Weather Service <br/>
under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1 and WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online <br/>

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 PM AST Tue Oct 08 2024

Leslie appears to have made a bit of a comeback today.  A couple of 
fortuitous microwave images from the past few hours show a closed 
eyewall.  The latest subjective Dvorak classifications from TAFB and 
SAB range from 55-77 kt, and recent objective estimates range from 
65-74 kt.  The microwave passes, the objective intensity estimates, 
and the TAFB current intensity number all suggest that Leslie is a 
hurricane.  Therefore, the initial intensity is bumped back up to 
65 kt.

The initial motion estimate is northwestward, or 305/12.  A gradual 
turn to the north is expected in a day or two as Leslie rounds the 
southwestern and western side of a subtropical ridge.  After that, 
as Leslie gains latitude late this week, the cyclone will 
increasingly come under the influence of the mid-latitude 
westerlies, causing a turn toward the northeast.  Very minor changes 
have been made to the official track forecast, which lies near the 
various consensus guidance.

Leslie is forecast to remain in an environment of very weak vertical 
wind shear for another 24-36 h.  Given the closed eyewall observed 
on recent microwave images, Leslie may be able to prevent dry 
environmental air from entraining into its inner-core during that 
time.  Leslie will be traveling over Kirk's cold wake over the next 
day or so, which will limit the instability.  The hurricane should 
remain fairly steady during this time, and the NHC forecast is near 
the high end of the intensity guidance during the first 24 h.  By 36 
h, models show Leslie running into a wall of strong northerly wind 
shear, which is forecast to cause Leslie to decouple and degenerate 
to a post-tropical cyclone by this weekend.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Milton was located
near latitude 22.5 North, longitude 88.2 West.  Although Milton has 
been wobbling during the past few hours, its longer-term motion is 
toward the east-northeast near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A turn toward the
northeast with an increase in forward speed is expected to begin
later today and continue through Thursday.  On the forecast track,
the center of Milton will move across the eastern Gulf of Mexico and
approach the west-central coast of Florida through Wednesday.  The
center is likely to make landfall along the west-central coast of
Florida on Wednesday night, and move east-northeastward across
central Florida through Thursday.
 
Aircraft reconnaissance data and satellite images indicate that 
maximum sustained winds have increased to near 155 mph (250 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Milton is a category 4 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  While fluctuations in 
intensity are expected, Milton is forecast to remain an extremely 
dangerous hurricane through landfall in Florida.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105
miles (165 km).
 
The minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data is 923 mb
(27.26 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Milton can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 2
to 4 feet above ground level along the northern coast of the
Yucatan Peninsula in areas of onshore winds.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Anclote River, FL to Englewood, FL...10-15 ft
Tampa Bay...10-15 ft
Englewood, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...6-10 ft
Charlotte Harbor...6-10 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Anclote River, FL...5-10 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...4-7 ft
Suwannee River, FL to Yankeetown, FL...3-5 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Port Canaveral, FL to Altamaha Sound, GA...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the south of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 5 to 12 inches, with localized totals
up to 18 inches, are expected across central to northern portions of
the Florida Peninsula through Thursday.  This rainfall brings the
risk of life-threatening flash and urban flooding, along with
moderate to major river flooding.
 
Milton will also produce rainfall totals 2 to 4 inches across the
Florida Keys through Thursday.
 
Additional rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches, with isolated totals
around 6 inches, are expected across northern portions of the
Yucatan Peninsula.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
WIND:  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions will continue in the
warning areas in Mexico today.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area
across Florida beginning late Wednesday through early Thursday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the warning area
on the west coast of Florida Wednesday morning, spreading across
the peninsula and reaching the east coast Wednesday evening.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
on the Georgia and South Carolina coasts on Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the extreme northwestern
Bahamas on Thursday.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible over central and southern
Florida beginning late tonight and continuing through Wednesday
night.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Milton are expected to continue to
affect much of the Gulf Coast within the next day or two, and are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Milton Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
1000 AM CDT Tue Oct 08 2024
 
Sequences of microwave images and recent Hurricane Hunter
observations suggest that Milton completed an eyewall replacement
overnight, and the new eyewall has contracted down from 22 n mi to
12 nm in diameter.  However, it does not appear that the hurricane
weakened much after the eyewall replacement, and it could have
rebounded with the outer eyewall contraction.  A dropsonde released
by the NOAA P-3 in the northeastern eyewall recently measured an
average wind of 156 kt in the lowest 150 m of the sounding, which
equates to an intensity of 130 kt.  The latest pressure reported by
the planes is 929 mb.
 
The recent aircraft fixes show that Milton has turned a bit
leftward and is moving toward the east-northeast (065/8 kt).  
Milton is forecast to turn northeastward and begin accelerating 
later today as it moves between a trough digging into the Gulf of 
Mexico and a ridge near the Greater Antilles.  The track guidance 
is honed in on a landfall along the west-central coast of Florida 
sometime Wednesday night.  However, it is critical to remember that 
even at 36-48 hours away, NHC's track forecasts can be off by an 
average of 60-70 n mi, which means we still can't pinpoint an exact 
landfall location, especially if the hurricane wobbles as it 
approaches the coast.  After landfall, Milton is forecast to cross 
Florida and emerge over the Atlantic waters on Thursday.
 
Milton is expected to maintain major hurricane strength while it 
moves across the Gulf of Mexico and approaches the west coast of 
Florida.  Stronger vertical shear is expected to set in about 24 
hours, but even if this causes some weakening, it will not be 
enough to keep Milton from being an extremely dangerous hurricane 
when it reaches shore.  Additionally, the first stages of 
extratropical transition may be just underway as Milton is reaching 
the coast, which could impart some baroclinic energy and slow the 
rate of weakening.  The NHC intensity forecast is close to the top 
end of the model envelope, which includes the GFS and ECMWF models, 
since these models should have a better handle on a potential 
positive trough interaction.
 
Milton's wind field is expected to expand as it approaches Florida.
In fact, the official forecast shows the hurricane and
tropical-storm-force winds roughly doubling in size by the time it
makes landfall.  Therefore, damaging winds, life-threatening storm
surge, and heavy rainfall will extend well outside the forecast
cone. It is worth emphasizing that this is a very serious situation
and residents in Florida should closely follow orders from their
local emergency management officials.  Evacuations and other 
preparations should be completed today.  Milton has the potential to
be one of the most destructive hurricanes on record for west-central
Florida.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Damaging hurricane-force winds and a life-threatening storm 
surge with destructive waves are expected across portions of the 
northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula today.

2. A large area of destructive storm surge,  with highest 
inundations of 10 ft or greater, is expected along a portion of the 
west-central coast of the Florida Peninsula.  If you are in the 
Storm Surge Warning area, this is an extremely life-threatening 
situation, and you should evacuate today if ordered by local 
officials.  There will likely not be enough time to wait to leave on 
Wednesday. 

3. Devastating hurricane-force winds are expected along portions of 
the west coast of Florida, where a Hurricane Warning is in effect. 
Milton is forecast to remain a hurricane as it crosses the Florida
Peninsula and life-threatening hurricane-force winds, especially in 
gusts, are expected to spread inland across the peninsula.  
Preparations to protect life and property, and to be ready for 
long-duration power outages, should be complete by tonight.

4. Heavy rainfall across the Florida Peninsula through Thursday 
brings the risk of life-threatening flash and urban flooding along 
with moderate to major river flooding, especially in areas where 
coastal and inland flooding combine to increase the overall flood 
threat.
