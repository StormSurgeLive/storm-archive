Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Fri Oct 4 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Kirk, located over the central subtropical Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
Tropical Storm Leslie, located over the eastern tropical Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located over the southwestern Gulf of <br/>
Mexico is producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  <br/>
Gradual development of this system is expected, and a tropical or <br/>
subtropical depression or storm is likely to form late this weekend <br/>
or early next week while the system moves eastward or northeastward <br/>
across the Gulf of Mexico.  Interests in the Florida Peninsula and <br/>
the Florida Keys should monitor the progress of this system.   <br/>
Regardless of tropical or subtropical development, locally heavy <br/>
rains could occur over portions of Mexico during the next day or <br/>
two, and over much of Florida late this weekend through the middle <br/>
of next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Far Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of  <br/>
Africa on Monday or Tuesday.  Some development of this system is <br/>
possible thereafter while it moves westward or west-northwestward <br/>
across the eastern tropical Atlantic. Interests in the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands should monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

...KIRK REMAINS A POWERFUL CATEGORY 4 HURRICANE OVER THE OPEN
ATLANTIC...
...LARGE SWELLS FROM KIRK EXPECTED TO REACH THE U.S. EAST COAST BY
SUNDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...25.0N 49.8W
ABOUT 975 MI...1565 KM ENE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 1610 MI...2585 KM WSW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...130 MPH...215 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 330 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...943 MB...27.85 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the Azores should monitor the progress of Kirk.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Kirk was located
near latitude 25.0 North, longitude 49.8 West. Kirk is moving toward
the north-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A turn to the north is 
expected on Saturday, followed by a faster northeastward motion 
Sunday and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Kirk is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Small intensity fluctuations are possible 
overnight, but steady weakening should begin on Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles
(350 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 943 mb (27.85 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Bermuda, and the Greater Antilles.  These swells are expected to
spread westward to the east coast of the United States, Atlantic
Canada, and the Bahamas Saturday night and Sunday, and the Azores on
Monday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Hurricane Kirk Forecast Discussion Number 23</title>

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
1100 PM AST Fri Oct 04 2024
 
Microwave images indicate that Kirk is going through another eyewall
replacement cycle.  The inner eyewall is still closed while a larger
second eyewall wraps about 75 percent of the way around the eye and
inner eyewall.  The satellite intensity estimates have held mostly
steady, and therefore, the initial intensity remains 115 kt.
Hurricanes that go through these eyewall replacement cycles often
get larger, and Kirk appears to be doing the same.  The 34- and
50-kt wind radii have been expanded a little on the system's east
side based on a partial ASCAT-B pass.
 
Kirk is moving northwestward at 11 kt.  A turn to the north is
expected on Saturday when Kirk reaches the western periphery of the
ridge, followed by a much faster northeastward and
east-northeastward motion Sunday and early next week when Kirk moves
in the strong mid-latitude flow.  This track should take the core of
the system to the north of the Azores on Monday and then across
portions of western Europe by the middle of next week,  Models are
in good agreement, and no significant changes were made to the
previous track forecast.
 
Fluctuations in intensity are likely in the short term, however, a
pronounced increase in shear, intrusions of drier air, and
progressively cooler waters should cause steady weakening beginning
on Saturday.  Kirk is expected to become an extratropical cyclone by
day 3 when it is forecast to be over water temperatures in low 20's
C and embedded in the strong mid-latitude westerlies.  The NHC
intensity forecast follows the trend in the model guidance, and is
in best agreement with the HCCA and IVCN consensus aids.
 
Even though Kirk is expected to recurve over the open Atlantic, its
strong intensity and increasing size will result in large ocean
swells that will propagate far away from the hurricane. These swells
will likely increase the risk of dangerous surf and rip currents
across the Leeward Islands, Bermuda, and the Greater Antilles
through Saturday, much of the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic Canada, and
the Bahamas by Sunday, and the Azores by Monday. For more
information on this hazard, see products issued by your local
weather office.

Tropical Storm Leslie Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 PM AST Fri Oct 04 2024
 
The convective structure of Leslie has become better organized this 
afternoon with a more symmetrical convective shield. There have not 
been any helpful microwave or scatterometer passes the last several 
hours to help evaluate the structure further. The latest subjective 
Dvorak satellite intensity estimates were T/3.5 and T/4.0, from TAFB 
and SAB respectively. Using a blend of these estimates, the initial 
intensity is set to 60 kt for this advisory.
 
Leslie is moving slowly west-northwestward at 290/6 kt, and this 
motion is expected to continue as the storm rounds the subtropical 
ridge anchored over the east Atlantic. Leslie should continue 
west-northwestward then turn more northwestward by the end of the 
weekend with a slight increase in forward speed through the end of 
the forecast period. The track guidance is fairly well clustered and 
the NHC track lies near the consensus aids.
 
The intensity forecast has become a little more uncertain with 
varying model solutions the last few model cycles, especially with 
the peak intensity and potential weakening towards the middle to end 
of the period. Northeasterly shear from Kirk has started to weaken 
over the system this afternoon, and that has likely aided the 
improved convective pattern. Leslie will be within a favorable 
atmospheric and oceanic environment for steady strengthening over 
the next 2 days or so. Beyond that time models begin to plateau the 
strengthening or start a weakening trend, as Leslie encounters some 
westerly shear and a drier air mass.  There is a notable difference 
between the GFS and ECMWF in how hostile the environment will be by 
five days, with the ECMWF showing more shear, a much drier air 
mass, and a much weaker Leslie.  One other issue is that the 
forecast track is expected to take Leslie over the cold wake left 
behind from Hurricane Kirk. Given the lowering intensity guidance 
and varying model solutions, the NHC intensity forecast has been 
adjusted downward, but still lies at the higher end of the guidance 
envelope. Additional adjustments to the intensity forecast may be 
needed on later advisories.
