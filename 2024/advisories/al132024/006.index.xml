Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Thu Oct 3 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Kirk, located over the central tropical Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
Tropical Storm Leslie, located over the eastern tropical Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms over portions of the Gulf of <br/>
Mexico are associated with a surface trough.  A broad area of low <br/>
pressure is likely to develop over the Gulf of Mexico this weekend <br/>
or early next week, but subsequent tropical or subtropical <br/>
development could be limited by the system's potential interaction <br/>
with a frontal boundary.  Regardless of development, locally heavy <br/>
rains could occur over portions of Mexico during the next few days <br/>
and over portions of the Florida Peninsula from late this weekend <br/>
into next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

1100 AM AST Thu Oct 03 2024
 
...KIRK STRENGTHENING OVER THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC...
...LARGE SWELLS COULD REACH THE U.S. EAST COAST BY SUNDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.4N 45.9W
ABOUT 1130 MI...1820 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 1660 MI...2670 KM SW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...125 MPH...205 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...948 MB...28.00 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located 
near latitude 20.4 North, longitude 45.9 West. Kirk is moving toward 
the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this general motion is 
expected to continue through early Friday. A turn toward the north 
and north-northeast at a faster forward speed is forecast over the 
weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 125 mph (205 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Kirk is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Some strengthening is forecast 
the next day or so.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 948 mb (28.00 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are spreading westward and are
expected to reach portions of the Leeward Islands on Friday,
Bermuda and the Greater Antilles on Saturday, and the east coast
of the United States and the Bahamas on Sunday.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
1100 AM AST Thu Oct 03 2024
 
Kirk's satellite depiction has improved this morning after some dry 
air entrainment occurred overnight. The inner core has become 
re-established with cold cloud tops wrapping around the center. 
The eye has become more pronounced and rounded on infrared and 
visible imagery. Subjective data-T numbers have increased from the 
previous advisory to T5.5, from both TAFB and SAB. UW-CIMSS 
objective intensity estimates have increased as well and range from 
100-117 kt. Using a blend of these estimates and the improving 
satellite trends the initial intensity is set at 110 kt.
 
The hurricane is moving northwestward at 310/9 kt.  This motion 
should continue over the next day or so as Kirk moves around the 
edge of a subtropical ridge located over the eastern Atlantic. An 
approaching trough moving into the central Atlantic this weekend, 
will then cause Kirk to curve and turn northeastward between the 
aforementioned ridge and the trough to the west. Models are tightly 
clustered and the latest NHC forecast track is near the previous 
and lies near the consensus aids.

The system is embedded in a favorable environment with low vertical 
wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. Additional 
strengthening is forecast, with only internal organizational eyewall 
replacement cycles or dry air intrusion limiting further 
strengthening over the next day or so. By late weekend, wind shear 
is forecast to increase over the system and gradual weakening is 
likely to occur. However, additional baroclinic energy is likely to 
allow Kirk to maintain hurricane-force winds along with a growing 
tropical-storm-force wind field through the end of the forecast 
period. Latest global guidance has Kirk becoming extra-tropical by 
Day 5, which is depicted in the NHC forecast. The NHC intensity 
forecast is near the previous and lies near the HFIP 
corrected-consensus aid.
 
Kirk is expected to grow in size and send out ocean swells across
the central and western Atlantic.  These swells will likely increase
the risk of dangerous surf and rip currents along the Leeward
Islands by Friday, Bermuda and the Greater Antilles by Saturday, and
the U.S. East Coast and the Bahamas by Sunday.

Tropical Storm Leslie Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
1100 AM AST Thu Oct 03 2024
 
Leslie is becoming better organized this morning. An earlier 
microwave pass depicted a more well-defined center with better 
defined curved banding features. Recent satellite-derived wind data 
depicts max winds around 38-40 kt. Subjective and objective Dvorak 
satellite intensity estimates range from 35-40 kt. Given the 
improved organizational structure and satellite trends will lean 
towards the higher end of these estimates with an initial intensity 
of 40 kt.
 
The tropical storm is moving slowly westward at an estimated motion 
of 260/4 kt to the south of a subtropical ridge over the eastern 
Atlantic. As we move into Friday and this weekend the system will 
gradually turn west-northwestward then northwestward increasing its
forward speed rounding the subtropical ridge. Model guidance is 
tightly clustered and in fairly good agreement. The NHC track 
forecast is very near the previous, and lies near the simple and 
corrected consensus aids.

The system is still feeling some of the effects of the outflow of 
Kirk, however as Kirk begins to move further away shear is forecast 
to weaken. The oceanic and atmospheric environmental conditions are 
conducive for steady strengthening with warm sea surface temperature 
and plenty of moisture. The NHC intensity forecast lies near the 
upper-end of the guidance envelope given the improved structure and 
favorable environment, and lies near the HCCA corrected consensus. 
Towards the end of the forecast period the intensity forecast 
plateaus given the system is forecast to track behind the cold wake 
of Hurricane Kirk.
