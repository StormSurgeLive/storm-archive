Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Mon Oct 7 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Leslie, located over the central tropical Atlantic Ocean, on <br/>
Hurricane Milton, located over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, and <br/>
has issued the final advisory on Post-Tropical Cyclone Kirk, <br/>
located over the North Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
An area of disturbed weather located across portions of South <br/>
Florida, the Florida Straits and the northwestern Bahamas is <br/>
expected to move northeastward, where an area of low pressure could <br/>
form near the northwestern Bahamas.  Some limited tropical or <br/>
subtropical development is possible while the low moves <br/>
northeastward to east-northeastward around 15 mph.  However,<br/>
upper-level winds are likely to increase in a couple days, which <br/>
should prevent any further development. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Far Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa in <br/>
a couple days.  Afterward, environmental conditions appear <br/>
marginally favorable for some slow development of this system while <br/>
it moves westward or west-northwestward across the eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic.  The system is expected to move near or over the Cabo <br/>
Verde Islands on Thursday or early Friday, and interests there <br/>
should monitor its progress.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Kirk
was located near latitude 41.7 North, longitude 38.4 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the northeast near 29 mph (46
km/h). An even faster east-northeastward motion is expected during 
the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Although gradual weakening is expected, Kirk is forecast to
remain a large and strong extratropical low during the next couple
of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310
miles (500 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 963 mb (28.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,
the east coast of the United States, portions of Atlantic Canada,
and the Azores. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Kirk Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
300 PM GMT Mon Oct 07 2024
 
Satellite imagery and model analyses indicate that Kirk has  
completed its transition to an extratropical cyclone.  Therefore, 
this will be the final NHC advisory.  Kirk is expected to remain a 
large and powerful extratropical cyclone over the next couple of 
days as it moves east-northeastward across the northeastern Atlantic 
Ocean toward western Europe.  Gradual weakening is forecast, and the 
intensity forecast best matches the GFS and ECMWF global models.  
Very little change has been made to the previous NHC track forecast. 
The track forecast is near the consensus models.

Kirk will be passing north of the Azores over the next 24 hours.  
Large breaking waves are likely along portions of the coasts of the 
Azores, along with gusty winds.  Swells from Kirk may continue to 
induce a high rip current risk along portions of the U.S. East 
Coast for another day or so.  These swells will affect Bermuda, 
Atlantic Canada and the Azores for a few more days.  Kirk will move 
over western Europe by late Wednesday.

Future information on this system can be found in High Seas
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 PM AST Mon Oct 07 2024
 
Leslie's convective organization continues to become a little less 
organized this afternoon, although deep convection has persisted 
over the center with cloud tops near -80C. A recent AMSR2 microwave 
pass shows that the inner core has deteriorated from imagery earlier 
today. Subjective and objective Dvorak estimates range from 60 to 75 
kt. Using a blend of these estimates, the initial intensity for this 
advisory is set to 70 kt.
 
The system is moving northwestward, or 315/12 kt. The hurricane is 
rounding the edge of a subtropical ridge over the central/east 
Atlantic. The system should continue to move northwestward with a 
gradual turn more north-northwestward then northward by the end of 
the forecast period. The NHC track forecast is slightly faster than 
the previous forecast and was adjusted slightly to the right towards 
the latest consensus aids.
 
Leslie will remain in a marginal environment for the next day or 
two, with warm sea surface temperatures and low to moderate wind 
shear. However, the system is entering a much drier air mass. Beyond 
48 h, shear will also increase as the mid-levels will continue to be 
dry. Intensity guidance is in fairly good agreement with gradual 
then steady weakening throughout the forecast period. The NHC 
intensity forecast follows these weakening trends and lies near the 
model consensus. Model simulated satellite imagery depicts that by 
day 4, the shear and drier air will cause Leslie to lose convection 
and the system is forecast to become a post-tropical remnant low at 
that time.

A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Milton was located 
by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 
21.7 North, longitude 91.3 West. Milton is moving toward the east 
near 9 mph (15 km/h). This general motion is expected today followed 
by a turn toward the east-northeast and northeast on Tuesday and 
Wednesday. On the forecast track, Milton is forecast to move near or 
just north of the Yucatan Peninsula today and Tuesday, then cross 
the eastern Gulf of Mexico and approach the west coast of the 
Florida Peninsula by Wednesday.
 
Data from NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft
indicate that the maximum sustained winds have increased to near 
175 mph (280 km/h) with higher gusts.  Milton is a potentially 
catastrophic category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane 
Wind Scale.  While fluctuations in intensity are expected, Milton is 
forecast to remain an extremely dangerous hurricane through landfall 
in Florida.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80
miles (130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 911 mb (26.90 inches)
based on Air Force Reserve dropsonde data.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Hurricane Milton can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 4
to 6 feet above ground level along the northern coast of the
Yucatan Peninsula in areas of onshore winds.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Anclote River, FL to Englewood, FL...8-12 ft
Tampa Bay...8-12 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Anclote River, FL...5-10 ft
Englewood, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...5-10 ft
Charlotte Harbor...5-10 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...4-7 ft
Suwannee River, FL to Yankeetown, FL...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the south of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches, with localized totals
up to 15 inches, are expected across portions of the Florida
Peninsula and the Keys through Wednesday night. This rainfall brings
the risk of considerable flash, urban, and areal flooding, along
with the potential for moderate to major river flooding.
 
Milton will also produce rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with
isolated totals around 6 inches across northern portions of the
Yucatan Peninsula.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the warning area in
Mexico beginning late today or tonight, with tropical storm
conditions expected to begin this afternoon. Hurricane conditions 
are possible in the watch areas in Mexico beginning tonight and 
Tuesday, and tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical 
storm warning area beginning later today. Hurricane conditions are 
possible in the Hurricane Watch area in Florida on Wednesday, and 
tropical storm conditions are possible in the Tropical Storm Watch 
area on Wednesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the system are expected to continue
to affect much of the whole Gulf Coast within the next day or two,
and are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Hurricane Milton Forecast Discussion Number 10</title>

Hurricane Milton Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
1000 AM CDT Mon Oct 07 2024
 
Milton's remarkable rapid intensification is continuing.  Satellite
images show a small eye within the very cold central cloud cover,
and the eye is becoming better defined.  Data from the Mexican 
radar at Sabancuy show a small, closed eye with an intense eyewall
presentation. The Hurricane Hunter aircraft earlier reported a peak 
flight-level wind of 146 kt, and dropsonde data show that the 
pressure has fallen to around 933 mb, which is down about 22 mb in 
4 hours.  The initial wind speed is set to 135 kt, which is an 
80-kt increase in 24 hours (only eclipsed by Wilma 2005 and Felix 
2007 in our records).
 
The hurricane is still moving east-southeastward, now about 8 kt.
Global models continue to insist that Milton will turn eastward
soon as the frontal low pressure area over the northeastern Gulf of
Mexico departs.  The new forecast near Mexico is about the same as 
the previous one, but is close enough to bring hurricane-force 
winds to the northern portion of Yucatan Peninsula.  Later, a new 
mid-level trough dropping into the northwestern Gulf of Mexico 
should then cause Milton to move east-northeastward to northeastward 
at a faster forward speed.  The latest model fields are a bit left 
of the previous runs, and the official NHC track forecast is shifted 
to the north.  This forecast is close to a consensus of the latest 
GFS, ECMWF and regional hurricane models. Note that this track is 
closer to the model fields rather than the model trackers which 
appear to be too far south. 
 
Milton is likely to become a category 5 hurricane later today
with light shear and very warm waters in its path. By tomorrow,
its intensity should be dictated by any eyewall replacement
cycles, which will likely cause the system to gradually weaken 
but grow larger.  After 36 h, Milton is expected to encounter a 
much less favorable environment with strong shear and dry air 
entrainment. Therefore, some weakening is anticipated before the 
hurricane reaches the Florida Gulf coast.  However, the system is 
still likely to be a large and powerful hurricane at landfall in 
Florida, with life-threatening hazards at the coastline and well 
inland. After landfall, Milton should weaken and start extratropical
transition, which should be complete by 96 h.  
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Damaging hurricane-force winds are expected across portions of
the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula.  A life-threatening
storm surge with damaging waves is also likely along portions of
the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
2. There is an increasing risk of life-threatening storm surge and
damaging winds for portions of the west coast of the Florida
Peninsula beginning Tuesday night or early Wednesday.  Storm Surge
and Hurricane Watches are now in effect for portions of the west
coast of the Florida Peninsula and residents in that area should
follow any advice given by local officials and evacuate if told to
do so.
 
3. Areas of heavy rainfall will impact portions of Florida today
well ahead of Milton, with heavy rainfall more directly related to
the system expected later on Tuesday through Wednesday night. This
rainfall will bring the risk of considerable flash, urban, and
areal flooding, along with the potential for moderate to major
river flooding.
