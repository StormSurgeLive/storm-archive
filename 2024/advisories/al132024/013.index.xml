Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Sat Oct 5 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Kirk, located over the central subtropical Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
Hurricane Leslie, located over the eastern tropical Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Gulf of Mexico (AL92):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a broad area of low <br/>
pressure located over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico are gradually <br/>
becoming better organized.  Development of this system is expected, <br/>
and a tropical depression or storm is likely to form later today or <br/>
on Sunday while it moves slowly eastward over the southwestern Gulf <br/>
of Mexico.  By early next week, the system is forecast to move <br/>
faster eastward or northeastward across the central and eastern Gulf <br/>
of Mexico where additional strengthening is likely.  Interests on <br/>
the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, the  Florida Peninsula, the Florida <br/>
Keys, and the northwestern Bahamas should monitor the progress of <br/>
this system. Regardless of development, locally heavy rains could <br/>
occur over portions of Mexico during the next day or two, and over <br/>
much of Florida late this weekend through the middle of next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Far Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa on <br/>
Monday or Tuesday.  Some development of this system is possible <br/>
thereafter while it moves westward or west-northwestward across the <br/>
eastern tropical Atlantic.  The system is expected to move near or <br/>
over the Cabo Verde Islands on Wednesday and Thursday, and interests <br/>
there should monitor its progress.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

...KIRK REMAINS A POWERFUL MAJOR HURRICANE OVER THE OPEN ATLANTIC...
...LARGE SWELLS FROM KIRK EXPECTED TO REACH THE U.S. EAST COAST BY
SUNDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...26.2N 50.2W
ABOUT 990 MI...1595 KM NE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 1575 MI...2535 KM WSW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...125 MPH...205 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 340 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...945 MB...27.91 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the Azores should monitor the progress of Kirk.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located 
near latitude 26.2 North, longitude 50.2 West. Kirk is moving toward 
the north-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). A turn to the north is 
expected today, followed by a faster northeastward motion on Sunday 
and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Kirk is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Weakening is forecast through early next week, 
but Kirk will remain a large hurricane for the next couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles
(350 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 945 mb (27.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Bermuda, and the Greater Antilles. These swells are expected to
spread westward to the east coast of the United States, Atlantic
Canada, and the Bahamas Saturday night and Sunday, and to the Azores
on Monday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Hurricane Kirk Forecast Discussion Number 24</title>

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
500 AM AST Sat Oct 05 2024
 
The eye of Kirk has become ragged and cloud filled during the past 
several hours. The satellite presentation suggests that 
southwesterly shear and intrusions of dry air are negatively 
affecting the hurricane, as a pronounced dry slot is noted on the 
western side of Kirk. As a result of these structural changes, the 
satellite intensity estimates have decreased overnight. Based on a 
blend of the latest subjective Dvorak Current Intensity estimates 
from TAFB and SAB with recent UW-CIMSS objective estimates, the 
initial intensity is lowered to 110 kt.
 
Kirk continues to turn more northward (340/11 kt) within the flow 
between a shortwave trough over the west-central Atlantic and a 
subtropical ridge to the east of the hurricane. The track models 
agree that Kirk should keep recurving to the northeast and 
east-northeast through early next week while accelerating within 
strong mid-latitude flow. The NHC forecast track shows the center of 
Kirk passing to the north of the Azores on Monday as an 
extratropical cyclone, and then moving across the northeastern 
Atlantic and over western Europe by the middle of next week. No 
significant changes were made to the updated NHC prediction.
 
The environmental conditions are expected to become increasingly 
hostile over the coming days, with a marked increase in shear and a 
drier environment surrounding the hurricane while it moves over 
progressively cooler waters. Therefore, steady weakening is forecast 
through early next week. Kirk should lose tropical characteristics 
and transition to a strong extratropical cyclone between 60-72 h, 
which is supported by the global model fields and simulated 
satellite imagery. The updated NHC intensity forecast shows a 
slightly faster rate of weakening, close to or slightly above the 
latest HCCA aid. However, note that the wind field of the cyclone is 
forecast to remain quite large through the 5-day forecast period. 

Large and powerful Kirk is producing ocean swells that are 
propagating far away from the hurricane. These large swells will 
likely increase the risk of dangerous surf and rip currents across 
the Leeward Islands, Bermuda, and the Greater Antilles beginning 
later today, much of the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic Canada, and the 
Bahamas by Sunday, and the Azores by Monday. For more information on 
this hazard, see products issued by your local weather office.

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 AM AST Sat Oct 05 2024
 
A 0552 UTC SSMIS microwave pass showed that Leslie still has a 
well-defined mid-level eye, and deep convection continues to burst 
over the center.  Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB are both 
T4.0/65 kt, while objective numbers are overall a bit higher than 
that.  Therefore, Leslie's intensity is now estimated to be 70 kt.

Leslie continues to move slowly west-northwestward (290/6 kt), with 
the cyclone still located along the southern periphery of the 
subtropical ridge.  The ridge is expected to remain entrenched and 
strengthen over the eastern Atlantic during the next several days, 
which should cause Leslie to move northwestward and accelerate a 
bit by Tuesday and Wednesday.  The NHC forecast is close to a blend 
of the TVCA and HCCA consensus aids, and nearly lies on top of the 
previous prediction.

The intensity forecast is the most challenging part of this 
advisory.  Deep-layer shear is relatively low at the moment and 
should remain so for the next 24 hours or so.  This is the period 
where the NHC forecast shows additional strengthening, and is close 
to the statistical-dynamical models near the top end of the 
guidance.  Increased shear, combined with Leslie potentially moving 
over Kirk's cold wake, could cause some weakening after 24 hours.  
All of the intensity models support this scenario, however they 
differ significantly in how much weakening will occur.  The NHC 
forecast continues to show Leslie maintaining hurricane status 
through day 5, mainly following the SHIPS model.  However, the IVCN 
and HCCA consensus aids, as well as several of the hurricane 
regional models, suggest that Leslie could weaken below hurricane 
intensity by 48 hours.  Downward adjustments to the intensity 
forecast may be required in future advisories if this trend 
continues.
