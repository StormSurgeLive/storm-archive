...KIRK BECOMES A POWERFUL EXTRATROPICAL CYCLONE...
...STILL CAUSING LARGE SWELLS AND RIP CURRENT RISK ALONG THE U.S.
EAST COAST...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM GMT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...41.7N 38.4W
ABOUT 655 MI...1055 KM WNW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 45 DEGREES AT 29 MPH...46 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...963 MB...28.44 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Kirk
was located near latitude 41.7 North, longitude 38.4 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the northeast near 29 mph (46
km/h). An even faster east-northeastward motion is expected during 
the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Although gradual weakening is expected, Kirk is forecast to
remain a large and strong extratropical low during the next couple
of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310
miles (500 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 963 mb (28.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,
the east coast of the United States, portions of Atlantic Canada,
and the Azores. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Post-Tropical Cyclone Kirk Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
300 PM GMT Mon Oct 07 2024
 
Satellite imagery and model analyses indicate that Kirk has  
completed its transition to an extratropical cyclone.  Therefore, 
this will be the final NHC advisory.  Kirk is expected to remain a 
large and powerful extratropical cyclone over the next couple of 
days as it moves east-northeastward across the northeastern Atlantic 
Ocean toward western Europe.  Gradual weakening is forecast, and the 
intensity forecast best matches the GFS and ECMWF global models.  
Very little change has been made to the previous NHC track forecast. 
The track forecast is near the consensus models.

Kirk will be passing north of the Azores over the next 24 hours.  
Large breaking waves are likely along portions of the coasts of the 
Azores, along with gusty winds.  Swells from Kirk may continue to 
induce a high rip current risk along portions of the U.S. East 
Coast for another day or so.  These swells will affect Bermuda, 
Atlantic Canada and the Azores for a few more days.  Kirk will move 
over western Europe by late Wednesday.

Future information on this system can be found in High Seas
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 AM AST Mon Oct 07 2024
 
Conventional satellite imagery indicates that Leslie's cloud
pattern has changed little during the past few hours.  A fortuitous
SSMIS microwave image revealed a compact inner core with the
eyewall partially open in the south side.  Most of the
convective curve bands remain confined to the north side of the
cyclone.  The TAFB and SAB subjective and the UW-CIMSS objective
satellite intensity estimates support holding the initial intensity
at 80 kt for this advisory.
 
Although the statistical GFS/ECMWF SHIPS intensity models
indicate a low-shear surrounding environment through the 60 hr 
period, the global model forecast sounding reveals 15-20 kt of 
400-250 mb mid-tropospheric westerly shear undercutting the 
diffluent flow aloft.  This mid-level disrupting flow could force 
the drier, stable air identified in the water vapor imagery into 
Leslie's deep convective core.  This negative thermodynamic 
contribution, along with gradually decreasing oceanic surface 
temperatures ahead of the cyclone's predicted path should cause 
Leslie to weaken through the period.  The ECMWF and GFS model 
simulated infrared forecast now indicates that Leslie will lose its 
organized convection within inhibiting environmental conditions and 
become a post-tropical cyclone by day 5, and the NHC intensity 
forecast follows suit.
 
Based on the above-mentioned microwave pass, the initial motion is 
estimated to be northwestward, or 315/11 kt, just a little left of 
the previous track.  Leslie is expected to move around the
southwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge to the northeast of
the cyclone and turn gradually north-northwestward to northward 
toward the end of the week.  The official forecast is an update of 
the previous one and closely follows the various consensus aids.
 
Leslie's wind radii were adjusted based on an earlier CSA/RCM-3 SAR
overpass.

A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests in the remainder of the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, the
Florida Peninsula, the Florida Keys, and the northwestern Bahamas
should monitor the progress of this system. Additional watches and
warnings will likely be issued later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area
outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by
your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Milton was located
near latitude 21.8 North, longitude 92.2 West. Milton is moving
toward the east-southeast near 8 mph (13 km/h). An eastward to
east-southeastward motion is forecast through tonight, followed by a
turn toward the east and northeast on Tuesday and Wednesday.  On the
forecast track, Milton is forecast to move near or just north of
the Yucatan Peninsula today and Tuesday, then cross the eastern
Gulf of Mexico and approach the west coast of the Florida Peninsula
by Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 125 mph (205 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Milton is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Further strengthening is 
expected, and Milton is forecast to become an extremely dangerous 
category 4 hurricane later today and maintain that intensity for 
the next couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Hurricane Milton can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 3
to 5 feet above ground level along the northern coast of the
Yucatan Peninsula in areas of onshore winds.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Anclote River, FL to Englewood, FL...8-12 ft
Tampa Bay...8-12 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Anclote River, FL...5-10 ft
Englewood, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...5-10 ft
Charlotte Harbor...5-10 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...4-7 ft
Suwannee River, FL to Yankeetown, FL...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the south of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches, with localized totals
up to 15 inches, are expected across portions of the Florida
Peninsula and the Keys through Wednesday night. This rainfall brings
the risk of considerable flash, urban, and areal flooding, along
with the potential for moderate to major river flooding.
 
Milton will also produce rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches across
portions of the northern Yucatan Peninsula.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the warning area in
Mexico beginning late today or tonight, with tropical storm
conditions expected to begin as early as this morning. Hurricane
conditions are possible in the watch area in Mexico beginning
tonight and Tuesday, and tropical storm conditions are expected in
the tropical storm warning area beginning later today. Hurricane
conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch area in Florida on
Wednesday, and tropical storm conditions are possible in the
Tropical Storm Watch area on Wednesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the system are affecting the coast of the
southwestern Gulf of Mexico.  These swells are expected to spread
northward and eastward along much of the Gulf Coast within the next
day or two, and are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.

<title>Hurricane Milton Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Hurricane Milton Special Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
700 AM CDT Mon Oct 07 2024
 
Recent data from both NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that Milton continues to rapidly strengthen.  The Air 
Force aircraft very recently reported a peak flight-level wind of 
120 kt, and dropsonde data show that the pressure has fallen to 
around 945 mb, which is down about 9 mb from a previous dropsonde 
report from the NOAA aircraft about an hour ago. This special 
advisory is being issued to increase the initial intensity to 
110 kt, and to increase the short term intensity forecast that now 
shows a peak wind speed of 135 kt in 24 hours.
 
The aircraft fixes were also a little south of the previous 
forecast track and a southward adjustment to the official track 
forecast has been made through 36 hours.  Hurricane-force winds 
are explicitly forecast to affect the northern coast of Yucatan, 
and residents in that area should rush preparations to completion.  
The updated track forecast has necessitated the government of Mexico 
to issue a Tropical Storm Warning and Hurricane Watch from Celestun 
southward to Campeche.  The storm surge forecast has been increased 
to 3 to 5 feet above ground level for portions of the northern coast 
of the Yucatan Peninsula. 

No changes to the NHC track or intensity forecast were made after 
36 hours.  

This special advisory was issued in lieu of the normal intermediate 
advisory.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Dangerous hurricane-force winds are expected across portions of 
the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula.  A life-threatening 
storm surge with damaging waves is also likely along portions of 
the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
2. There is an increasing risk of life-threatening storm surge and
damaging winds for portions of the west coast of the Florida
Peninsula beginning Tuesday night or early Wednesday.  Storm Surge
and Hurricane Watches are now in effect for portions of the west
coast of the Florida Peninsula and residents in that area should
follow any advice given by local officials and evacuate if told to
do so.
 
3. Areas of heavy rainfall will impact portions of Florida today
well ahead of Milton, with heavy rainfall more directly related to
the system expected later on Tuesday through Wednesday night. This
rainfall will bring the risk of considerable flash, urban, and
areal flooding, along with the potential for moderate to major
river flooding.
