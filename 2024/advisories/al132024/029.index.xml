Leslie, located over the central subtropical Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
Hurricane Milton, located over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. <br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic (AL93):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a gale-force non-tropical <br/>
low pressure system located about 375 miles west-southwest of <br/>
Bermuda have become less organized during the last several hours.  <br/>
Although environmental conditions are becoming less favorable for <br/>
development, a short-lived tropical or subtropical storm could <br/>
still form today or this evening while the low moves northeastward <br/>
to east-northeastward at around 15 mph.  Upper-level winds are <br/>
forecast to become too strong for further development later tonight. <br/>
Additional information on this system, including gale warnings, <br/>
can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather <br/>

<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa <br/>
tonight or early Thursday.  Afterward, environmental conditions <br/>
appear only marginally favorable for some limited development of <br/>
this system while it moves westward or west-northwestward across <br/>
the eastern tropical Atlantic and through the Cabo Verde Islands on <br/>
Friday. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
1100 AM AST Wed Oct 09 2024
 
Visible, infrared and some recent microwave images suggest that the
center of the small tropical cyclone continues to be located
underneath the middle of the central dense overcast.  In fact, some 
of the recent frames have hinted at a ragged eye feature.  The TAFB 
and SAB subjective Dvorak estimates are a consensus T-4.5/77 kt.  
The initial intensity is increased to 75 kt, in best agreement with 
the Dvorak estimates.
 
Leslie's initial motion is estimated to be northwestward, or 305/9
kt.  A gradual turn to the north is expected in about 36 h as
Leslie rounds the southwestern and western periphery of a
subtropical ridge to the east.  Afterward, Leslie should accelerate
toward the northeast in response to a strong trough approaching the
cyclone from the northwest.  The NHC forecast is nearly identical
to the previous one and lies near the TVCN and HCCA consensus
models.
 
Leslie is forecast to remain in a favorable environment for another
12-18 h.  The intensity forecast has been increased to an 85-kt
peak at hour 12 and 24, and it is possible that it could strengthen
a bit more than that, as suggested by the HAFS-B model.  By hour
24, Leslie is expected to run into a wall of strong northerly
shear caused by a strengthening upper-level anticyclone in between
Milton and Leslie.  The shear is expected to cause Leslie to
rapidly weaken during the 24 to 48 h period.  While it is possible
that Leslie could lose most of its convection in 2 to 3 days, the
latest GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite imagery show periodic 
bursts of convection continuing into Day 4.  However, Leslie is 
likely to merge with a front and become extratropical in 3 to 4 
days, and a transition to an extratropical cyclone is 
forecast at the end of that period.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Milton was located
near latitude 25.0 North, longitude 84.8 West. Milton is moving
toward the northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h).  A northeastward motion
is expected through tonight.  A turn toward the east-northeast and 
east is expected on Thursday and Friday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Milton will move across the eastern Gulf of Mexico today, 
make landfall along the west-central coast of Florida late tonight 
or early Thursday morning, and move off the east coast of Florida 
over the western Atlantic Ocean Thursday afternoon.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 155 mph (250 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Milton is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Milton is expected to remain an extremely
dangerous major hurricane when it reaches the west-central coast of
Florida tonight.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125
miles (205 km).
 
The minimum central pressure based on NOAA and Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter data is 915 mb (27.02 inches).

Key Messages for Milton can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Anna Maria Island, FL to Boca Grande, FL...10-15 ft
Anclote River, FL to Anna Maria Island, FL...8-12 ft
Tampa Bay...8-12 ft
Boca Grande, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...8-12 ft
Charlotte Harbor...8-12 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...5-8 ft
Aripeka, FL to Anclote River, FL...4-7 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Sebastian Inlet, FL to Altamaha Sound, GA...3-5 ft
Altamaha Sound, GA to Edisto Beach, SC...2-4 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Aripeka, FL...2-4 ft
Dry Tortugas...2-4 ft
St. Johns River...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the south of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 6 to 12 inches, with localized totals
up to 18 inches, are expected across central to northern portions of
the Florida Peninsula through Thursday.  This rainfall brings the
risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding,
along with moderate to major river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area across Florida beginning this evening through early Thursday
and are possible in the hurricane watch area on Thursday. Tropical
storm conditions are expected to begin in the warning area on the
west coast of Florida around midday, spreading across the peninsula
and reaching the east coast tonight. Tropical storm conditions are
expected to begin in the warning area on the east coast of Florida
tonight and along the Georgia coast on Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the
northwestern Bahamas on Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
on the South Carolina coast on Thursday.
 
TORNADOES: Several tornadoes are likely today and tonight across
parts of central and southern Florida.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Milton are expected to continue to affect 
much of the Gulf Coast and will increase along the southeastern U.S. 
coast during the next day or two.  These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Milton Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
400 AM CDT Wed Oct 09 2024
 
Milton has been maintaining its strength as a catastrophic category
5 hurricane over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico.  Satellite and
Doppler radar images indicate that the major hurricane has a
compact, symmetric, and very powerful inner core.  Based on
aircraft data, the minimum pressure has dropped to 907 mb and the
maximum sustained winds remain near 140 kt.  The wind field of
Milton is gradually expanding, and the wind radii have been adjusted
based on a combination of the Hurricane Hunter data and ASCAT
passes.  There is an area of heavy rain beginning to spread across
portions of southwestern and west-central Florida out ahead of
Milton, and weather conditions will steadily deteriorate across
portions of the Florida Gulf Coast throughout the day.
 
Milton is moving northeastward at 12 kt in the flow between a mid-
to upper-level trough over the northern Gulf and a ridge located
over the Greater Antilles.  This motion should generally continue
until Milton makes landfall in Florida, which is likely to occur
late tonight or early Thursday morning.  After the hurricane reaches
the coast, a turn to the east-northeast is expected as another
trough approaches the system from the west.  Milton should exit
Florida and move over the Atlantic waters Thursday afternoon and
accelerate eastward after that.  The NHC track forecast is nudged a
little to the north of the previous one to be in better agreement
with the latest models.  It should be noted that this forecast is
based on the model fields, not the interpolated models which
appear to be too far south.  Users are urged not to focus on the
exact landfall point as the average error at 24 hours is about 40
miles.
 
The global models agree that vertical wind shear is expected begin 
to increase over Milton later today, and that should cause some
weakening.  However, there is high confidence that Milton will 
remain a very dangerous hurricane when it reaches Florida, and 
maintain hurricane status as it moves across the state.  The 
cyclone is expected to become extratropical over the Atlantic on 
Friday and gradually weaken.  The NHC intensity forecast is similar 
to the previous one and near the high end of the model guidance.
 
Milton's wind field is expected to grow considerably in size while 
it moves across Florida.  Additionally, a large region of tropical 
storm and hurricane-force winds could occur on the northwest/back 
side of the storm since Milton will be interacting with a frontal 
boundary and beginning extratropical transition.  Damaging winds,
life-threatening storm surge, and heavy rainfall will extend well
outside the forecast cone.  This is a very serious situation and
residents in Florida should closely follow orders from their local
emergency management officials.  Evacuations and other preparations
should be rushed to completion.  Milton has the potential to be one
of the most destructive hurricanes on record for west-central
Florida.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. A large area of destructive storm surge, with highest inundations
of 10 ft or greater, is expected along a portion of the west-central
coast of the Florida Peninsula.  If you are in the Storm Surge
Warning area, this is an extremely life-threatening situation, and
you should evacuate as soon as possible if ordered by local
officials.
 
2. Devastating hurricane-force winds are expected along portions of
the west coast of Florida, where a Hurricane Warning is in effect.
Milton is forecast to remain a hurricane while it crosses the
Florida Peninsula and life-threatening hurricane-force winds,
especially in gusts, are expected to spread inland across the
peninsula.  Preparations to protect life and property, including
being ready for long-duration power outages, should be rushed to
completion.
 
3. Heavy rainfall across the Florida Peninsula through Thursday
brings the risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban
flooding along with moderate to major river flooding, especially in
areas where coastal and inland flooding combine to increase the
overall flood threat.
