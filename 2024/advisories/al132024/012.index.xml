Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Sat Oct 5 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Kirk, located over the central subtropical Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
Tropical Storm Leslie, located over the eastern tropical Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Gulf of Mexico (AL92):<br/>
Recent satellite-derived wind data indicate that an area of low <br/>
pressure located over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico is broad and <br/>
ill defined, but it is producing winds just below gale force.  <br/>
Development of this system is expected, and a tropical or <br/>
subtropical depression or storm is likely to form this weekend or <br/>
early next week while moving eastward or northeastward across the <br/>
Gulf of Mexico.  Interests on the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, the <br/>
Florida Peninsula, the Florida Keys, and the northwestern Bahamas <br/>
should monitor the progress of this system.  Regardless of tropical <br/>
or subtropical development, locally heavy rains could occur over <br/>
portions of Mexico during the next day or two, and over much of <br/>
Florida late this weekend through the middle of next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Far Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa on <br/>
Monday or Tuesday.  Some development of this system is possible <br/>
thereafter while it moves westward or west-northwestward across the <br/>
eastern tropical Atlantic.  The system is expected to move near or <br/>
over the Cabo Verde Islands on Wednesday and Thursday, and interests <br/>
there should monitor its progress.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

...KIRK REMAINS A POWERFUL MAJOR HURRICANE OVER THE OPEN ATLANTIC...
...LARGE SWELLS FROM KIRK EXPECTED TO REACH THE U.S. EAST COAST BY
SUNDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...26.2N 50.2W
ABOUT 990 MI...1595 KM NE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 1575 MI...2535 KM WSW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...125 MPH...205 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 340 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...945 MB...27.91 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the Azores should monitor the progress of Kirk.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located 
near latitude 26.2 North, longitude 50.2 West. Kirk is moving toward 
the north-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). A turn to the north is 
expected today, followed by a faster northeastward motion on Sunday 
and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Kirk is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Weakening is forecast through early next week, 
but Kirk will remain a large hurricane for the next couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles
(350 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 945 mb (27.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Bermuda, and the Greater Antilles. These swells are expected to
spread westward to the east coast of the United States, Atlantic
Canada, and the Bahamas Saturday night and Sunday, and to the Azores
on Monday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Hurricane Kirk Forecast Discussion Number 23</title>

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
1100 PM AST Fri Oct 04 2024
 
Microwave images indicate that Kirk is going through another eyewall
replacement cycle.  The inner eyewall is still closed while a larger
second eyewall wraps about 75 percent of the way around the eye and
inner eyewall.  The satellite intensity estimates have held mostly
steady, and therefore, the initial intensity remains 115 kt.
Hurricanes that go through these eyewall replacement cycles often
get larger, and Kirk appears to be doing the same.  The 34- and
50-kt wind radii have been expanded a little on the system's east
side based on a partial ASCAT-B pass.
 
Kirk is moving northwestward at 11 kt.  A turn to the north is
expected on Saturday when Kirk reaches the western periphery of the
ridge, followed by a much faster northeastward and
east-northeastward motion Sunday and early next week when Kirk moves
in the strong mid-latitude flow.  This track should take the core of
the system to the north of the Azores on Monday and then across
portions of western Europe by the middle of next week,  Models are
in good agreement, and no significant changes were made to the
previous track forecast.
 
Fluctuations in intensity are likely in the short term, however, a
pronounced increase in shear, intrusions of drier air, and
progressively cooler waters should cause steady weakening beginning
on Saturday.  Kirk is expected to become an extratropical cyclone by
day 3 when it is forecast to be over water temperatures in low 20's
C and embedded in the strong mid-latitude westerlies.  The NHC
intensity forecast follows the trend in the model guidance, and is
in best agreement with the HCCA and IVCN consensus aids.
 
Even though Kirk is expected to recurve over the open Atlantic, its
strong intensity and increasing size will result in large ocean
swells that will propagate far away from the hurricane. These swells
will likely increase the risk of dangerous surf and rip currents
across the Leeward Islands, Bermuda, and the Greater Antilles
through Saturday, much of the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic Canada, and
the Bahamas by Sunday, and the Azores by Monday. For more
information on this hazard, see products issued by your local
weather office.

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 AM AST Sat Oct 05 2024
 
A 0552 UTC SSMIS microwave pass showed that Leslie still has a 
well-defined mid-level eye, and deep convection continues to burst 
over the center.  Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB are both 
T4.0/65 kt, while objective numbers are overall a bit higher than 
that.  Therefore, Leslie's intensity is now estimated to be 70 kt.

Leslie continues to move slowly west-northwestward (290/6 kt), with 
the cyclone still located along the southern periphery of the 
subtropical ridge.  The ridge is expected to remain entrenched and 
strengthen over the eastern Atlantic during the next several days, 
which should cause Leslie to move northwestward and accelerate a 
bit by Tuesday and Wednesday.  The NHC forecast is close to a blend 
of the TVCA and HCCA consensus aids, and nearly lies on top of the 
previous prediction.

The intensity forecast is the most challenging part of this 
advisory.  Deep-layer shear is relatively low at the moment and 
should remain so for the next 24 hours or so.  This is the period 
where the NHC forecast shows additional strengthening, and is close 
to the statistical-dynamical models near the top end of the 
guidance.  Increased shear, combined with Leslie potentially moving 
over Kirk's cold wake, could cause some weakening after 24 hours.  
All of the intensity models support this scenario, however they 
differ significantly in how much weakening will occur.  The NHC 
forecast continues to show Leslie maintaining hurricane status 
through day 5, mainly following the SHIPS model.  However, the IVCN 
and HCCA consensus aids, as well as several of the hurricane 
regional models, suggest that Leslie could weaken below hurricane 
intensity by 48 hours.  Downward adjustments to the intensity 
forecast may be required in future advisories if this trend 
continues.
