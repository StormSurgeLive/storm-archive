Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 PM AST Wed Oct 09 2024

Leslie continues to take advantage of the little time it has left 
under favorable environmental conditions.  Although an eye is not 
currently seen on visible or infrared imagery, a 1611 UTC AMSR2 
image shows that an eye exists on microwave imagery, and it is 
located underneath the middle of the central dense overcast.  
Subjective Dvorak numbers from TAFB and SAB are a unanimous T-4.5/77 
kt, whereas recent objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS have 
been averaging in the 78-85 kt range for the past several hours.  
The initial intensity is bumped up to 80 kt, using a blend of the 
subjective and objective estimates.

Leslie's initial motion estimate is northwestward, or 310/8 kt. 
There has been no change to the track forecast reasoning.  Leslie is 
expected to turn northward in 24-36 h as it rounds the southwestern 
and western periphery of a subtropical ridge to the east.  
Afterward, Leslie should accelerate toward the northeast in response 
to a strong trough approaching the cyclone from the northwest.  The 
guidance is a bit farther west this cycle, and the new NHC forecast 
has shifted west of the previous one.

Saildrone data from the last several hours indicates that Leslie is 
over sea-surface temperatures approximately 1 to 2 degrees warmer 
than other data sources are indicating, and this could be the main 
reason why Leslie has strengthened a bit more than anticipated over 
the past 12 to 24 h.  A bit more strengthening is forecast during 
the next 12 h while the vertical wind shear remains relatively 
low.  In about 12 to 18 h, Leslie is expected to run into a wall of 
strong northerly shear caused by a strengthening upper-level 
anticyclone in between Milton and Leslie.  The shear is expected to 
cause Leslie to rapidly weaken during the 24 to 48 h period.  While 
it is possible that Leslie could lose most of its convection in 2 to 
3 days, the latest GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite imagery now 
show several periodic bursts of convection continuing into Day 4.  
Leslie might also merge with a front and become extratropical in 3 
to 4 days.  Regardless, Leslie will be traveling over much colder 
water by that time, and the official forecast calls for Leslie to 
become post-tropical in 3 to 4 days.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Milton was located
near latitude 26.3 North, longitude 84.0 West.  Milton is moving
toward the north-northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h).  A turn toward the 
northeast with a decrease in forward speed is expected this evening 
and tonight.  A turn toward the east-northeast and east is expected 
on Thursday and Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of Milton
will make landfall along the west-central coast of Florida tonight, 
cross the Florida peninsula overnight and early Thursday, and move 
off the east coast of Florida over the western Atlantic Ocean on 
Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Milton is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Milton is expected to remain an extremely
dangerous major hurricane when it reaches the west-central coast of
Florida tonight, and remain at hurricane strength while it moves
across the Florida peninsula through Thursday.  Gradual weakening is
forecast while Milton moves eastward over the western Atlantic, and
it is likely to become an extratropical storm by early Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 250 miles 
(280 km), especially to the north. A NOAA saildrone (SD-1083) 
located about 50 miles east of the center recently reported a 
sustained wind of 52 mph (84 km/h) and a wind gust of 70 mph (112 
km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure based on Air Force Reserve Hurricane
Hunter data is 944 mb (27.88 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Milton can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Anna Maria Island, FL to Boca Grande, FL...9-13 ft
Anclote River, FL to Anna Maria Island, FL...8-12 ft
Tampa Bay...8-12 ft
Boca Grande, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...8-12 ft
Charlotte Harbor...8-12 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...5-8 ft
Aripeka, FL to Anclote River, FL...3-5 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Sebastian Inlet, FL to Altamaha Sound, GA...3-5 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Aripeka, FL...2-4 ft
Dry Tortugas...2-4 ft
St. Johns River...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the south of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 6 to 12 inches, with localized totals
up to 18 inches, are expected across central to northern portions of
the Florida Peninsula through Thursday.  This rainfall brings the
risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding,
along with moderate to major river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area across Florida beginning this evening through Thursday morning
and are possible in the hurricane watch area on Thursday.  Tropical
storm conditions are expected to begin in the warning area on the
west coast of Florida in a few hours, spreading across the peninsula
and reaching the east coast tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected to begin in the warning area along the Georgia coast on
Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the
northwestern Bahamas on Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
on the South Carolina coast on Thursday.
 
TORNADOES: Several tornadoes are likely today and tonight across
parts of central and southern Florida.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Milton are expected to continue to affect
much of the Gulf Coast and will increase along the southeastern U.S.
coast during the next day or two.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Milton Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
1100 AM EDT Wed Oct 09 2024
 
Milton's structure has begun to change due to the onset of strong
southwesterly shear, which UW-CIMSS is analyzing to be 30-35 kt.
The cloud canopy has become more asymmetric with dry air
infiltrating the western side of the circulation, and the eye has
also become cloud filled.  The NOAA and Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunters observed that the eye is open to the south, and a 
very recent dropsonde indicates that the minimum pressure is up to 
931 mb.  Milton's intensity is therefore set at 125 kt on this 
advisory.
 
Deep-layer shear is expected to increase further today and this
evening, and continued weakening is anticipated.  However, since
Milton only has another 12 hours or so over water, it is expected
to still be a major hurricane when it makes landfall tonight.  The
NHC intensity forecast lies between the statistical-dynamical models
and the consensus aids at 12 hours, meaning that Milton is likely
to be a category 3 or 4 strength at landfall.  A slow decay in the
winds is expected after landfall, but Milton is anticipated to move
off the east coast of Florida on Thursday still as a hurricane.  On
another note, Milton is expected to begin interacting with a front
later this evening, which is likely to cause the wind field to
expand on the hurricane's northwestern side.  This will likely
cause very strong, gusty winds to occur even to the north of where
Milton makes landfall.
 
Milton is moving quickly toward the northeast (035/15 kt).  The
track models insist that the hurricane will continue to move
northeastward but slow down through the rest of today, with a turn
toward the east-northeast occurring overnight.  The NHC track
forecast maintains continuity with the previous predictions, lying
near the northern boundary of the guidance envelope and close to
where the raw model fields bring the center onshore.
 
We would like to emphasize that Milton's exact landfall location is
not possible to predict even at this time, particularly if the
hurricane wobbles during the day and into this evening.  Even at
12-24 hours, NHC's track forecasts can be off by an average of 20-30
nm.  Since storm surge forecasts are highly sensitive to the exact
track, this means that the realized storm surge heights across the
Tampa Bay region and south may vary widely, and there will likely be
a noticeable gradient of surge heights to the north of the landfall
location.  However, the risk of devastating storm surge still exists
across much of the west-central and southwest coast of Florida given
the size of the storm and the uncertainties in exactly where
landfall will occur.
 
Finally, damaging winds, life-threatening storm surge, and heavy
rainfall will extend well outside the forecast cone.  This is a very
serious situation and residents in Florida should closely follow
orders from their local emergency management officials.  Evacuations
and other preparations should be completed over the next couple of
hours.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. A large area of destructive storm surge, with highest inundations
of 10 ft or greater, is expected along a portion of the west-central
coast of the Florida Peninsula.  If you are in the Storm Surge
Warning area, this is an extremely life-threatening situation.  The
time to evacuate, if told to do so by local officials, is quickly
coming to a close.
 
2. Devastating hurricane-force winds are expected along portions of
the west coast of Florida, where a Hurricane Warning is in effect.
Milton is forecast to remain a hurricane while it crosses the
Florida Peninsula and life-threatening hurricane-force winds,
especially in gusts, are expected to spread inland across the
peninsula.  Preparations to protect life and property, including
being ready for long-duration power outages, should be rushed to
completion.
 
3. Heavy rainfall across the Florida Peninsula through Thursday
brings the risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban
flooding along with moderate to major river flooding, especially in
areas where coastal and inland flooding combine to increase the
overall flood threat.
