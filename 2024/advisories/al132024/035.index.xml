Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Thu Oct 10 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
downgraded Tropical Storm Leslie, located over the central <br/>
subtropical Atlantic Ocean, and has issued the last advisory on <br/>
Post-Tropical Cyclone Milton, located off the east coast of central <br/>
Florida.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
Recent satellite wind data show that a broad low pressure area with <br/>
winds of 30 to 35 mph has formed in association with a tropical <br/>
wave located southeast of the Cabo Verde Islands. However, the <br/>
system's shower and thunderstorm activity is currently poorly <br/>
organized.  Some additional development could occur while it moves <br/>
westward or west-northwestward across the eastern tropical Atlantic <br/>
and the Cabo Verde Islands tonight and  Friday.  By Saturday, <br/>
upper-level winds are forecast to become less favorable, and further <br/>
development is unlikely after that time.  Regardless of development, <br/>
localized areas of heavy rain and gusty winds are possible across <br/>
portions of the Cabo Verde Islands tonight through Friday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Leslie Discussion Number  35
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
1100 PM AST Thu Oct 10 2024
 
Leslie's center continues to be well exposed to the north of the 
convection, as northerly wind shear continues to impact the system. 
A recent scatterometer pass depicted winds of 50-55 kt. Satellite 
intensity estimates from TAFB, SAB and UW-CIMSS have come down this 
cycle and range from 45-55 kt which is in good agreement with the 
scatterometer pass. Therefore, the initial intensity for this 
advisory is lowered to 55 kt.
 
The storm is within a rather hostile environment with strong 
northerly shear displacing the convection from the center, and this 
shear is expected to persist over the next few days. Leslie is also 
dealing with very dry mid-levels as is depicted on GOES-16 water 
vapor imagery and the drier airmass continues along the forecast 
track. Models differ on the type of post-tropical system Leslie will 
eventually become, with the possibilities being either a remnant low 
or an extra-tropical low. The NHC forecast calls for the system to 
become a remnant low  in 48 h with model simulated satellite 
depicting Leslie will fail to produce organized deep convection 
within the harsh environment.  However, if the system is able to 
continue to produce convection for the next 36- 48 h, Leslie will 
approach a frontal zone and take on some frontal characteristics and 
become extratropical at that time. Either way, by day 4, the 
post-tropical low is forecast to dissipate into a open trough.
 
Leslie is moving north-northwestward, or 345/8 kt. Models are in 
fairly good agreement that a turn to the north will occur early 
Friday as the storm rounds the edge of the subtropical ridge located 
over the eastern Atlantic. The system will then turn northeastward 
with an increase in forward speed through the weekend. There was a 
slight left shift in the latest forecast guidance, as well as some 
along track spread. The latest NHC forecast was nudged left and is a 
little faster than the previous, near the simple consensus aids.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Milton
was located near latitude 29.5 North, longitude 76.3 West.  Milton

post-tropical cyclone will pass to the south of Bermuda late Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast during the 
next several days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310 miles (500 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 983 mb (29.03 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Milton can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: Coastal flooding is expected to continue along 
portions of the southeastern U.S. coast through tonight.  The water 
could reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the 
indicated areas...
 
Altamaha Sound, GA to Port Canaveral, FL...1-3 ft

inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Additional rainfall amounts up to an inch are possible 
along the northeastern coast of Florida through this evening. In the 
wake of heavy rainfall from Milton, the risk of considerable urban 
flooding will linger through this evening across east central 
Florida. Moderate to major river flooding is ongoing and forecast 
throughout central Florida.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall 
Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and 
the Flash Flood Risk graphic at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero. 
 
WIND: Gusty winds will likely continue along portions of the
southeastern U.S. coast through tonight.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Milton are expected to continue to
affect portions of the southeast U.S. and the Bahamas during the
next couple of days.  These swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Milton Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
500 PM EDT Thu Oct 10 2024
 
Milton's satellite appearance has continued to take on an 
extratropical appearance, and ASCAT data from a few hours ago 
confirmed that the cyclone has become frontal.  Based on that 
information, Milton was declared post tropical in the 2 pm 
intermediate advisory.  The ASCAT passes showed maximum winds of 
55-60 kt to the northwest of the center, so the initial intensity 
is set to 60 kt.

Milton has turned eastward and sped up a bit (080/18 kt).  A 
general eastward motion with an increase in forward speed is 
expected during the next several days, with the extratropical low 
forecast to pass south of Bermuda in 24-36 hours.  Global model 
fields and intensity models indicate that the intensity should 
gradually decrease during the next several days, and this is 
reflected in the official forecast.  Dissipation is shown by day 4, 
although there is still some uncertainty if Milton will become 
absorbed by the frontal zone before that time, or retain its 
identity beyond 4 days.

Since all storm surge and tropical storm warnings have been 
discontinued, this will be the last advisory on Milton.  Additional 
information on this system can be found in High Seas Forecasts 
issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header 
NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Gusty winds and coastal flooding will gradually diminish along
portions of the southeastern U.S. coast through tonight.
 
2. In the wake of heavy rainfall from Milton, the risk of 
considerable urban flooding will linger through this evening across 
east central Florida. Moderate to major river flooding is ongoing 
and forecast throughout central Florida.
 
3. In Florida, continue to use caution since deadly hazards remain, 
including downed power lines and flooded areas.  Ensure generators 
are properly ventilated and placed outside at least 20 feet away 
from doors, windows, and garages to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.
If you are cleaning up storm damage, be careful when using
chainsaws and power tools, and drink plenty of water to avoid heat
exhaustion.
