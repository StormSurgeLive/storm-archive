Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Fri Oct 4 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Kirk, located over the central subtropical Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
Tropical Storm Leslie, located over the eastern tropical Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms located over the western Gulf <br/>
of Mexico are associated with a trough of low pressure. A broad area <br/>
of low pressure is expected to form over the southwestern or <br/>
south-central Gulf of Mexico this weekend, and thereafter some <br/>
gradual development is possible while the low moves slowly eastward <br/>
or northeastward. A tropical or subtropical depression or storm <br/>
could form during the early to middle part of next week if the low <br/>
remains separate from a frontal boundary that is forecast to extend <br/>
across the Gulf of Mexico next week. Regardless of tropical or <br/>
subtropical development, locally heavy rains could occur over <br/>
portions of Mexico during the next few days and over portions of the <br/>
Florida Peninsula late this weekend into next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>

...LARGE SWELLS FROM KIRK COULD REACH THE U.S. EAST COAST BY
SUNDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...23.0N 48.9W
ABOUT 975 MI...1570 KM ENE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 1655 MI...2665 KM WSW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...140 MPH...220 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 315 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...939 MB...27.73 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located 
near latitude 23.0 North, longitude 48.9 West. Kirk is moving toward 
the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general motion is 
expected to continue today. A turn toward the north and 
north-northeast at a faster forward speed is anticipated over the 
weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 140 mph (220 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Kirk is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Small intensity fluctuations are possible
today and tonight. Weakening is forecast to begin on Saturday and 
continue through early next week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles
(315 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 939 mb (27.73 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are spreading westward and are
expected to reach the Leeward Islands later today, Bermuda and the
Greater Antilles on Saturday, the east coast of the United States,
Atlantic Canada, and the Bahamas on Sunday, and the Azores on
Monday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

<title>Hurricane Kirk Forecast Discussion Number 21</title>

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
1100 AM AST Fri Oct 04 2024

The satellite appearance of Kirk is a little less impressive than 
it was six hours ago, as the eye has become somewhat cloud-filled 
and the convective cloud tops have warmed a little.  Recent 
microwave imagery suggests that the hurricane may be starting an 
eyewall replacement cycle, with an outer convective band wrapped 
about three-quarters of the way around the eyewall.  The various 
objective and subjective satellite intensity estimates have trended 
downward, and based on a combination of these estimates the initial 
intensity is reduced to 120 kt.  The wind radii have been tweaked 
based on a recent ASCAT overpass.

The initial motion is 315/10.  Kirk is currently approaching a large 
break in the subtropical ridge caused by a deep-layer low centered 
near 33N 60W.  During the next 48-60 h, the hurricane should recurve 
through this break and accelerate northeastward into the 
mid-latitude westerlies.   After that time, the cyclone should move 
quickly east-northeastward across the northern and northeastern 
Atlantic.  There has been little change in the track guidance since 
the previous advisory, and the new forecast track has only minor 
adjustments from the previous track.

Fluctuations in intensity are likely during the next 24 h due to the 
expected eyewall replacement cycle.  After that, Kirk should 
encounter increasing southwesterly shear and move over cooler sea 
surface temperatures, which should cause a steady weakening.  
Extratropical transition is likely to begin between 60-72 h and be 
complete by 96 h, with Kirk becoming a strong extratropical cyclone 
over the northeastern Atlantic.  The new intensity forecast follows 
the general trends of the intensity guidance, and is closest to the 
GFS model during the extratropical stage.
 
Even though Kirk is expected to recurve over the open Atlantic, its
strong intensity and increasing size will result in large ocean
swells that will propagate far away from the hurricane. These swells
will likely increase the risk of dangerous surf and rip currents
across the Leeward Islands beginning later today, Bermuda and the
Greater Antilles by Saturday, much of the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic
Canada, and the Bahamas by Sunday, and the Azores by Monday. For
more information on this hazard, see products issued by your local
weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Leslie Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Tropical Storm Leslie Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
1100 AM AST Fri Oct 04 2024
 
A recent SSMIS microwave pass depicted that Leslie is continuing to
become better organized and is trying to develop an inner core.
Burst of deep convection have continued to develop mainly on the
southern semi-circle as the system is still battling some deep-layer
northeasterly wind shear. Given the improved convective pattern the
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates have increased this cycle with
a data-T 3.5/55 kt, from both TAFB and SAB. Using these estimates
and the improving structure, the initial intensity is set to 55 kt
for this advisory.
 
Leslie is moving slowly westward at 280/5 kt, along the southern
periphery of the subtropical ridge.  The ridge will continue to
steer Leslie, with a gradual turn west-northwestward then
northwestward as it rounds the ridge. Leslie should continue
north-westward with a slight increase in forward speed through the
end of the forecast period. The NHC track forecast is very near the
previous forecast track, which lies between the HCCA HFIP-corrected
consensus and simple consensus aids.
 
Northeasterly shear should begin to decrease later today as
Hurricane Kirk continues to pull further away from the system.
Strengthening is then forecast over the next 2-3 days with warm sea
surface temperatures, upper-level divergence and low deep-layer
shear. The intensity guidance, especially the peak has come down
this cycle, and that is a combination of a few factors. In about 3
days, Leslie is forecast to move over the cold wake of Kirk, and
encounter increasing dry air, mid-level shear, and the upper-level
pattern also become a little less diffluent. This should cause the
intensity of Leslie to plateau through the end of the forecast
period. The NHC intensity forecast follows these trends and is
slightly lower than the previous forecast, but lies near the higher
end of the intensity guidance.
