near latitude 37.0 North, longitude 46.2 West. Kirk is moving toward
the north-northeast near 23 mph (37 km/h). A turn toward the 
northeast is expected tonight. An acceleration toward the 
east-northeast or east is expected by Monday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Although gradual weakening is expected over the next few 
days and Kirk is expected to become post-tropical on Monday, it will 
remain a large cyclone with a large wind field through the early 
part of this week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 300
miles (480 km).

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
500 PM AST Sun Oct 06 2024

Satellite imagery suggests that Kirk has begun the process 
of extratropical transition.  Most of the convection is 
located on the north side of the low-level center due to strong 
south-southwesterly wind shear.  Subjective Dvorak estimates from 
SAB and TAFB range from 65-75 kt, while the latest objective 
intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS range from 65-80 kt.  The 
intensity has been lowered to 75 kt for this advisory.  ASCAT data 
from earlier this morning necessitated an increase in the initial 
wind radii, showing that Kirk is a very large hurricane.

There have been no significant changes to the track reasoning.  A 
narrow mid- to upper-level ridge east of Kirk will weaken over the 
next 24-36 h, allowing Kirk to turn east-northeastward or eastward 
within the zonal mid-latitude westerly flow.  The new NHC track 
forecast lies nearly on top of the previous NHC track, although the 
new track is a bit slower.  This track is relatively close to the 
TVCA and a bit slower than the HCCA corrected consensus guidance.  
The NHC forecast shows Kirk passing north of the Azores Monday night 
and Tuesday as an extratropical cyclone, and should reach western 
Europe late Wednesday, where it could bring gale force winds.

Kirk is forecast to continue to gradually weaken as it reaches 
cooler waters by tonight.  Additionally, the southwesterly vertical 
wind shear is forecast to increase significantly over the system by 
early Monday morning.  Global models show the development of frontal 
features on Monday, and extratropical transition has been moved up 
to 24 h in the latest official forecast.  Despite gradual weakening 
as Kirk becomes post-tropical, the cyclone is expected to remain a 
large and powerful cyclone until it reaches the coast of western 
Europe.  Therefore, the system will continue to spread very large 
swells across a large portion of the North Atlantic Ocean for a few 
more days.  The latest NHC intensity forecast is at the high end of 
the guidance during the extratropical portion of the forecast, in 
best agreement with the GFS and ECMWF global models.  By early 
Thursday, the cyclone will become elongated over western Europe, and 
the latest NHC forecast shows dissipation in 96 h.

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 PM AST Sun Oct 06 2024
 
Leslie's satellite imagery has become a little more ragged as 
southwesterly shear has disrupted the overall convective pattern. 
The deep inner core convection has become a little more broken the 
last few hours. Subjective and objective estimates range from 75 to 
85 kt, with a T4.5 from both TAFB and SAB. Based on these 
satellite estimates, the initial intensity is held at 80 kt.
 
Leslie is moving northwestward (310/8 kt) while being steered by a 
subtropical ridge over the eastern Atlantic. The ridge will continue 
to build to the northeast of the system, which should steer the 
hurricane northwestward throughout the forecast period. Models 
continue to be in good agreement, the NHC track forecast is very 
similar to the previous which remains near the latest consensus 
aids.
 
The hurricane has started to enter a more hostile environment. 
Southwesterly shear has started to increase, with drier mid-levels, 
and upper-level convergence along the forecast path. The latest NHC 
forecast follows the latest model trends with gradual weakening 
beginning on Monday. Since Leslie is a relatively small tropical 
cyclone, it could be more susceptible to these negative factors and 
weaken even faster than the NHC forecast later in the period, as 
suggested by some of the global and hurricane regional models.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Milton was
located by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near 
latitude 22.5 North, longitude 94.0 West. Milton is moving toward 
the east near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this general motion is expected 
today. An eastward to east-northeastward motion is forecast on 
Monday, followed by a faster northeastward motion on Tuesday and 
Wednesday.  On the forecast track, Milton is forecast to move north 
of the Yucatan Peninsula and to move across the Gulf of Mexico and 
approach the west coast of the Florida Peninsula by midweek.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 80 mph (130 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Milton is forecast to rapidly intensify during
the next couple of days and become a major hurricane on Monday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 20 miles (30 km) from 
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 
miles (130 km) from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 988 mb (29.18 inches)
based on Air Force dropsonde data.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Warning area in the Yucatan Peninsula Monday night and Tuesday and
possible in the watch area on Tuesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the system are affecting the coast
of the southwestern Gulf of Mexico today.  These swells are expected
to spread northward and eastward along much of the Gulf Coast by
early next week, and could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Minor coastal flooding could also occur along 
the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula from large swells. 
Please consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Hurricane Milton Forecast Discussion Number 5</title>

Tropical Storm Milton Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
1000 AM CDT Sun Oct 06 2024
 
Satellite and aircraft data indicate that Milton is strengthening.
A large burst of convection is occurring in the northern semicircle 
of the storm, with lots of expanding outflow.  The last fix from the
NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft showed a pressure down to 991 mb
with maximum 500m low-level winds of about 65 kt.  These winds 
reduce down to the surface to about 55 kt, and this value will be 
the initial intensity.
 
The fixes from the aircraft indicate that Milton is south of the
previously anticipated and has been moving east-southeastward or
105/5 kt.  Milton is forecast to move a little south of due east
today in westerly flow from a shortwave trough over the northern
Gulf of Mexico.  The storm should then turn northeastward and
accelerate on Tuesday and Wednesday toward the Florida Peninsula.  
As a result of this re-positioning and initial motion, there's been 
a southward change to most of the guidance this morning.  The new 
NHC forecast is adjusted south of the previous one, especially early
on, and further southward adjustments could be required if the
guidance trend continues.  The Mexican government has issued a
Tropical Storm Warning for the north coast of the Yucatan Peninsula
as a result of the forecast change. It should be noted that the
average NHC track error at day 3 is around 100 miles, and users
should not focus on the exact track.
 
The NOAA Hurricane Hunter crew reported that an eyewall has formed 
on the last center fix, suggesting that this system is ready to 
intensify quickly.  Given the track over the very deep warm waters 
of the Gulf of Mexico and little shear for the next couple of days, 
rapid intensification is explicitly forecast, and the new NHC 
prediction could still be conservative over the central Gulf of 
Mexico.  The biggest question actually seems to be the intensity as 
Milton approaches Florida, with much of the guidance showing a 
notable increase in shear.  While some weakening is anticipated, 
the shear could help transition Milton to be a large hurricane at 
landfall, with impacts spread out over a big area. Regardless of 
the details, there is increasing confidence that a powerful 
hurricane with life-threatening hazards will be affecting portions 
of the Florida west coast around the middle of this week. Residents 
there should closely monitor this system and listen to local 
officials.
 
 
Key Messages:

1. Milton is forecast to quickly intensify while it moves eastward 
to northeastward across the Gulf of Mexico and be a major hurricane 
when it reaches the west coast of the Florida Peninsula mid week. 
Users are reminded to not focus on the details of the forecast as 
there remains significant uncertainty in the eventual track and 
intensity of Milton. 

2. While it is too soon to specify the exact magnitude and location 
of the greatest impacts, there is an increasing risk of 
life-threatening storm surge and damaging winds for portions of the 
west coast of the Florida Peninsula beginning Tuesday night or early 
Wednesday.  Storm Surge and Hurricane Watches could be issued later 
today or tonight.  Residents in the Florida Peninsula should follow 
any advice given by local officials and check back for updates to 
the forecast. 

3.  Areas of heavy rainfall will impact portions of Florida today 
and Monday well ahead of Milton, with heavy rainfall more directly 
related to the system expected later on Tuesday through Wednesday 
night. This rainfall will bring the risk of flash, urban, and areal 
flooding, along with the potential of moderate to major river 
flooding. 

4. Tropical storm conditions are expected beginning Monday across 
portions of the northern Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico where a 
Tropical Storm Warning is in effect.
