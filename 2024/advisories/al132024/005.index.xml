Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Thu Oct 3 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Kirk, located over the central tropical Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
Tropical Storm Leslie, located over the eastern tropical Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms over portions of the Gulf of <br/>
Mexico are associated with a surface trough.  A broad area of low <br/>
pressure is likely to develop over the Gulf of Mexico late this <br/>
weekend or early next week, but subsequent tropical or subtropical <br/>
development could be limited by the system's potential interaction <br/>
with a frontal boundary.  Regardless of development, locally heavy <br/>
rains could occur over portions of Mexico during the next few days <br/>
and over portions of the Florida Peninsula next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
Public Advisories on Leslie are issued under WMO header WTNT33 KNHC <br/>
and under AWIPS header MIATCPAT3.  Forecast/Advisories on Leslie <br/>
are issued under WMO header WTNT23 KNHC and under AWIPS header <br/>

500 AM AST Thu Oct 03 2024
 
...KIRK FORECAST TO STRENGTHEN WHILE MOVING NORTHWESTWARD OVER THE
CENTRAL ATLANTIC...
...LARGE SWELLS COULD REACH THE U.S. EAST COAST BY SUNDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.0N 45.0W
ABOUT 1185 MI...1910 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 1645 MI...2645 KM SW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...120 MPH...195 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 315 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...955 MB...28.20 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located
near latitude 20.0 North, longitude 45.0 West.  Kirk is moving 
toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this general motion 
is expected to continue through early Friday.  A turn toward the 
north and north-northeast at a faster forward speed is forecast 
over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Kirk is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some strengthening is forecast during the
next day or so.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 955 mb (28.20 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are spreading westward and are
expected to reach portions of the Leeward Islands on Friday,
Bermuda and the Greater Antilles on Saturday, and the east coast
of the United States and the Bahamas on Sunday.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Hurricane Kirk Forecast Discussion Number 16</title>

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
500 AM AST Thu Oct 03 2024
 
After going through a period of rapid intensification, Kirk appears
to have stopped intensifying, at least temporarily, and there are
signs in satellite imagery that a dry slot has wrapped into the
circulation.  Subjective final-T numbers have decreased slightly
from TAFB and SAB, and the initial intensity is set at 105 kt, near
the CI numbers.
 
Kirk continues to move northwestward (315/9 kt), which should 
continue for the next 36 hours while the hurricane moves along the 
southwestern periphery of the subtropical high.  After 36 hours, 
Kirk is forecast to recurve between the high and a deep-layer trough 
over the western/central Atlantic, eventually moving northeastward 
by late Sunday or Monday.  There is lower-than-normal spread among 
the track guidance, including the global model ensembles, and 
overall the new NHC track prediction is not changed much from the 
previous advisory.
 
The hurricane is expected to move through a moist, low-shear 
environment for the next 36 hours or so, with sea surface 
temperatures actually warming by a degree or two up to 30 deg 
Celsius.  If Kirk can avoid further intrusions of dry air into the 
eye, then the environment should be able to support strengthening to 
category 4 strength.  The NHC intensity forecast is near the top end 
of the guidance during the short term.  After 36 hours, increasing 
deep-layer shear is likely to induce a gradual weakening trend, but 
interaction with a baroclinic energy source should help the storm to 
maintain hurricane-force winds through the end of the forecast 
period.  Based on thickness fields from the global models, Kirk is 
now forecast to be extratropical by day 5.
 
Kirk is expected to grow in size and send out ocean swells across 
the central and western Atlantic.  These swells will likely increase 
the risk of dangerous surf and rip currents along the Leeward 
Islands by Friday, Bermuda and the Greater Antilles by Saturday, and 
the U.S. East Coast and the Bahamas by Sunday.

Tropical Storm Leslie Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
1100 AM AST Thu Oct 03 2024
 
Leslie is becoming better organized this morning. An earlier 
microwave pass depicted a more well-defined center with better 
defined curved banding features. Recent satellite-derived wind data 
depicts max winds around 38-40 kt. Subjective and objective Dvorak 
satellite intensity estimates range from 35-40 kt. Given the 
improved organizational structure and satellite trends will lean 
towards the higher end of these estimates with an initial intensity 
of 40 kt.
 
The tropical storm is moving slowly westward at an estimated motion 
of 260/4 kt to the south of a subtropical ridge over the eastern 
Atlantic. As we move into Friday and this weekend the system will 
gradually turn west-northwestward then northwestward increasing its
forward speed rounding the subtropical ridge. Model guidance is 
tightly clustered and in fairly good agreement. The NHC track 
forecast is very near the previous, and lies near the simple and 
corrected consensus aids.

The system is still feeling some of the effects of the outflow of 
Kirk, however as Kirk begins to move further away shear is forecast 
to weaken. The oceanic and atmospheric environmental conditions are 
conducive for steady strengthening with warm sea surface temperature 
and plenty of moisture. The NHC intensity forecast lies near the 
upper-end of the guidance envelope given the improved structure and 
favorable environment, and lies near the HCCA corrected consensus. 
Towards the end of the forecast period the intensity forecast 
plateaus given the system is forecast to track behind the cold wake 
of Hurricane Kirk.
