Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
100 PM EST Wed Nov 13 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Central and Western Caribbean Sea (AL99):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure over the central Caribbean Sea <br/>
continues to produce a large area of disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions are conducive for <br/>
development, and a tropical depression is likely to form within the <br/>
next day or two while the system moves slowly westward into the <br/>
western Caribbean Sea.  Afterward, further development is likely <br/>
while the disturbance meanders over the western Caribbean Sea <br/>
through the weekend.  The system is expected to turn slowly <br/>
northwestward by early next week. Interests across the western and <br/>
northwestern Caribbean Sea should monitor the progress of this <br/>
system.  Regardless of development, heavy rains are expected over <br/>
Jamaica and the Cayman Islands during the next day or so. For more <br/>
information on this system, including gale warnings, see High Seas <br/>
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service. An Air Force <br/>
Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate this system <br/>
tomorrow morning.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

At 700 PM EST (0000 UTC), the disturbance was centered near latitude
16.1 North, longitude 79.5 West. The system is moving toward the
west near 6 mph (9 km/h). A slow westward motion should continue 
for another day or two, taking the system across the western 
Caribbean Sea. The disturbance is expected to stall and meander 
near the north coast of Honduras late Friday and through the 
weekend. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher
gusts. The system is forecast to become a tropical storm on 
Thursday and continue strengthening, if it remains over water.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone Nineteen can be found in
the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Through early next week, rainfall amounts of 10 to 20
inches with isolated storm totals around 30 inches area expected
over northern Honduras. This rainfall will lead to widespread areas
of life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding and
mudslides, especially along and near the Sierra La Esperanza.
 
Elsewhere across the rest of Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, eastern
Guatemala, and western Nicaragua, Potential Tropical Cyclone
Nineteen is expected to produce 5 to 10 inches of rain with
localized totals around 15 inches through early next week. This will
result in areas of flash flooding, perhaps significant, along with
the potential of mudslides.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area by
Friday, with tropical storm conditions possible by late Thursday.
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area by 
late Thursday.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast near in
areas of onshore winds along the northern coast of Honduras.  Near
the coast,the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive
waves.

Potential Tropical Cyclone Nineteen Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192024
400 PM EST Wed Nov 13 2024
 
Showers and thunderstorms associated with the broad area of low 
pressure over the central Caribbean Sea that the National Hurricane 
Center has been monitoring have increased and are showing signs 
of organization. While some mid-level rotation is evident in 
visible satellite images near a recent burst of convection, the 
low-level circulation remains broad and elongated. However, the 
system is expected to become a tropical storm within the next day or 
so and it is likely to bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions 
to land areas within the next 36 to 48 hours. Therefore, the 
National Hurricane Center is initiating Potential Tropical Cyclone 
advisories for this disturbance.
 
The initial motion is more uncertain than normal since the system is 
still in the formative stage, but the best estimate is westward at 
about 5 kt. A continued westward motion is anticipated during the 
next few days with a slower forward speed as the system moves into 
the western Caribbean Sea. As steering currents weaken, the system 
is forecast to meander just offshore, or along the coast of Central 
America for a couple of days late this week and over the weekend. 
Later in the period, the ridge to the north, begins to erode and 
slide eastward as a mid-level trough digs into the western Gulf of 
Mexico, which will induce a northwestward motion towards the end of 
the forecast period. Model guidance is in fairly good agreement with 
the overall track evolution, however they differ on potential land 
interaction in Central America, and if the system moves onshore and 
how long it remains inland. The NHC forecast lies near the consensus 
models, near HCCA and TVCA consensus aids. Since the disturbance 
currently lacks a well-defined center, users are reminded that the 
average forecast track uncertainty is larger in these situations, 
and future track adjustments may be required.
 
The models suggest a more well-defined center should develop during 
the next day or so. Once the system becomes better organized and 
develops an inner core, the environmental conditions appear 
favorable for strengthening. Thus, the NHC forecast shows 
strengthening while the system moves into the western Caribbean sea. 
However, there remains higher than normal uncertainty in the 
intensity forecast due to potential land interactions. If the system 
remains over water, it could be stronger than indicated below, but 
if it moves over Central America weakening would occur.  The NHC 
forecast lies near the consensus aids given this uncertainty. 
 
Based on the NHC forecast, Tropical Storm and Hurricane
Watches have been issued for portions Nicaragua and Honduras.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Through early next week, heavy rainfall will cause significant, 
life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides across portions of 
Central America, particularly Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, 
eastern Guatemala, and western Nicaragua.
 
2. The disturbance is forecast to be near hurricane strength when
it moves near the eastern coast of Honduras and northeastern
Nicaragua on Friday and Saturday.  Hurricane and tropical storm
conditions are possible over portions of that area.
 
3. The system is forecast to approach Belize and the Yucatan
Peninsula of Mexico at or near hurricane strength by early next week
where there is a risk of dangerous storm surge and damaging winds.
Residents in these areas should monitor the latest forecast updates
and ensure that they have their hurricane plan in place.
 
4. It is too soon to determine what impacts the system could bring
to portions of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, including Florida, the
Florida Keys, and Cuba during the middle portion of next week.
Residents in these areas should regularly monitor updates to the
forecast.
