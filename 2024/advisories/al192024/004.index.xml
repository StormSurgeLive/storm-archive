WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Honduras has discontinued the Hurricane Watch for
Honduras and the Bay Islands.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* The northern coast of Honduras form Punta Sal eastward to the 
Honduras/Nicaragua Border
* The Bay Islands of Honduras
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* The northeastern coast of Nicaragua from Puerto Cabezas northward 
to the Honduras/Nicaragua Border 
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Honduras, Guatemala, Belize and the
Yucatan Peninsula should monitor the progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM EST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression 
Nineteen was located near latitude 15.7 North, longitude 82.6 West. 
The depression is moving toward the west near 14 mph (22 km/h). This 
motion should continue through today, bringing the center near the 
coast of eastern Honduras. The system is expected to meander near 
the northern coast of Honduras late Friday and through the weekend.

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some strengthening is forecast and the system is forecast to become 
a tropical storm later today.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Tropical Depression Nineteen can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Through early next week, rainfall amounts of 10 
to 20 inches with isolated storm totals around 30 inches area 
expected over northern Honduras. This rainfall will lead to 
widespread areas of life-threatening and potentially catastrophic 
flash flooding and mudslides, especially along and near the Sierra 
La Esperanza.

Elsewhere across the rest of Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, eastern 
Guatemala, and western Nicaragua, Tropical Depression Nineteen is 
expected to produce 5 to 10 inches of rain with localized totals 
around 15 inches through early next week. This will result in areas 
of flash flooding, perhaps significant, along with the potential of 
mudslides.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Tropical Depression Nineteen, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/refresh/graphics_at4+shtml/205755.shtml?
rainqpf#contents
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area
and possible in the watch area beginning later today.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in
areas of onshore winds along the northern coast of Honduras. Near
the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive
waves.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 PM EST.
Next complete advisory at 400 PM EST.

Tropical Depression Nineteen Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192024
1000 AM EST Thu Nov 14 2024
 
Latest satellite imagery depicts that the system continues to become 
better organized this morning, with improved curved banding 
features, and deep convection consolidating near the low-level 
center. The latest subjective intensity estimates were T/2.5 from 
both TAFB and SAB. The initial intensity is set to 30 kt, and an Air 
Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft is about to enter the system which 
will provide more information on current intensity and structure.
 
The cyclone is moving westward with an estimated motion of 265/12 
kt. A strong mid-level ridge located to the north of the system will 
continue steer the system westward towards Central America. The 
ridge is expected to break down, and the cyclone will meander in 
weak steering currents, Friday through the weekend. This expected 
slow motion will cause the system to produce heavy rains over the 
same region, likely causing life-threatening flooding over portions 
of Central America. By early next week, the mid-level ridge should 
slide eastward over Florida, which should cause the system to move 
northwestward across Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula. The NHC track 
forecast is in good agreement with the various consensus models, and 
is nudged slightly left towards the latest model trends.
 
Environmental and oceanic conditions are conducive for some 
strengthening during the next day or so while the cyclone remains 
over water. There remains uncertainty in how much land interaction 
there will be with Honduras during the next several days, but the 
model trends have been southward showing more interaction. If the 
system remains along the coast or just offshore, it will likely 
maintain intensity or slightly strengthen. However, if the 
depression moves a little south of the forecast track, the system 
could be weaker than shown below. Given the slight leftward track 
adjustment with potentially more land interaction, the latest NHC 
intensity forecast is lower than the previous and is near the middle 
of the guidance envelope. However, it must be stressed that there is 
still a lot of uncertainty in the intensity forecast.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Through early next week, heavy rainfall will cause significant,
life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides across portions of
Central America, particularly Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, eastern
Guatemala, and western Nicaragua.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the 
northern coast of Honduras, and the adjacent Bay Islands where 
tropical storm warnings are in effect.
 
3. The system is forecast to approach Belize and the Yucatan
Peninsula of Mexico by early next week where there is a risk of
strong winds. Residents in these areas should monitor the latest
forecast updates.
 
4. It is too soon to determine what impacts, if any, the system
could bring to portions of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, including
Florida, during the middle portion of next week. Residents in these
areas should regularly monitor updates to the forecast.
