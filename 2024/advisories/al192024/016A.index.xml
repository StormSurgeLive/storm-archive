SUMMARY OF 1200 PM CST...1800 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.4N 89.0W
ABOUT 55 MI...85 KM W OF BELIZE CITY
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The governments of Guatemala, Belize, and Mexico have discontinued 
all Tropical Storm Warnings for their coastal regions. 
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches and warnings in effect.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 PM CST (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Sara 
was located near latitude 17.4 North, longitude 89.0 West. Sara is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A turn 
northwestward with some increase in forward speed is expected 
through tonight. On the forecast track, the center of Sara will move 
further inland over the Yucatan Peninsula today before it opens up 
into a trough by tonight or tomorrow.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Weakening is forecast to continue as the depression 
moves further inland, and Sara is expected to become a remnant low 
before it opens up into a trough over the southern portion of the 
Yucatan Peninsula tonight or on Monday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Tropical Depression Sara can be found in the 
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO 
header WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at 
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches are expected
over northern Honduras, with storm total amounts locally as high as
40 inches. The risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flooding
impacts will continue, especially along and near the Sierra La
Esperanza.
 
Across portions of Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala, western 
Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo, Tropical 
Depression Sara is expected to produce an additional 3 to 5 inches 
of rain with localized storm totals around 15 inches. This will 
result in areas of flash flooding, perhaps significant, along with 
the potential of mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Depression Sara, please see the National Weather Service 
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at

Tropical Storm Sara Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192024
900 AM CST Sun Nov 17 2024
 
Sara made landfall this morning at around 1400 UTC along the coast
of Belize, near Dangriga. Before landfall, Sara made a bit of a
convective resurgence near the center, with bursting deep convection
and some GLM lightning flashes occuring. Radar out of Belize City
also showed a modest attempt at banding on the southern side of the
tropical storm. With that said, the surface observations around the
circulation of Sara are unimpressive, with the highest sustained
wind at Calabash Caye near this convection of only 27 kt. A blend of
subjective and objective satellite estimates supported an intensity
of 35 kt at landfall and that remains the value for this advisory.
 
The tropical storm has been moving west-northwestward up until
landfall, estimated at 290/4 kt. The mid-level ridging that is now
steering the cyclone is pivoting more east, and this should result
in Sara turning more northwestward or north-northwestward as it
moves across the Yucatan, eventually emerging into the Gulf of
Mexico in about 24 hours. However, the system is expected to weaken
over land, ultimately degenerating into a trough of low pressure
before it moves back over water in the Gulf of Mexico. I will note
that track aids extend further north than the current NHC forecast
track into the Gulf of Mexico, mainly because these aids are
tracking the remnant vorticity of the system, even though it will no
longer be a tropical cyclone. As discussed yesterday, the moisture
plume associated with the remnants of Sara could aid in enhanced
rainfall along the U.S. Gulf coast from Louisiana to the Florida
Panhandle on Tuesday, where WPC currently has a slight risk for
excessive rainfall.
 
Sara has produced a tremendous amount of rain in Honduras. Data from
the country's government indicate reports of more than 40 inches of
rain at some locations. These heavy rains are now spreading westward
across portions of Belize, Guatemala, and the Yucatan Peninsula this
morning.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Across Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala, western
Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo, areas of heavy
rainfall will continue to cause significant and life-threatening
flash flooding and mudslides as Sara moves further inland.
 
2. The heavy rainfall from Tropical Storm Sara is winding down
across northern Honduras, however the risk of catastrophic flooding
impacts will continue.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions, especially in gusts, are expected
during the next several hours along portions of the Caribbean coast
of Guatemala, the coast of Belize, and portions of the coast of
Mexico where tropical storm warnings are in effect.
