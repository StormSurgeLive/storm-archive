For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM CST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Sara was
located near latitude 16.5 North, longitude 87.2 West. Sara is
moving toward the west near 5 mph (7 km/h), and a general westward
to west-northwestward motion is expected to continue until landfall.
On the forecast track, the center of Sara will approach Belize
tonight before moving onshore over Belize during the day on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts. Only minor fluctuations in intensity are expected before
landfall in Belize on Sunday, with weakening expected after
landfall. Sara is expected to open up into a trough on Sunday night
or Monday as its remnants move into the southern Gulf of Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Tropical Storm Sara can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Through early next week, rainfall amounts of 15 to 25
inches with isolated storm totals around 35 inches are expected
over northern Honduras. This rainfall will lead to widespread areas
of life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding and
mudslides, especially along and near the Sierra La Esperanza.
 
Elsewhere across the rest of Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, eastern
Guatemala, western Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo,
Tropical Storm Sara is expected to produce 5 to 10 inches of rain
with localized totals around 15 inches through early next week. This
will result in areas of flash flooding, perhaps significant, along
with the potential of mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Sara, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/refresh/graphics_at4+shtml/205755.shtml?
rainqpf#contents
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in 
portions of Honduras through early Sunday. Tropical storm conditions 
are expected in Guatemala, Belize, and portions of Mexico beginning 
late tonight.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to
3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas
of onshore winds along the northern coast of Honduras. Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
A storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet
above ground level near and to the north of where the center of Sara
crosses the coast of Belize.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM CST.

Tropical Storm Sara Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192024
300 PM CST Sat Nov 16 2024
 
Sara's center has been pretty easy to find this afternoon, with 
1-minute visible satellite imagery showing the low level center 
beginning to move westward away from the Bay Islands of Honduras and 
more into the Gulf of Honduras. An Air Force Reserve reconnaissance 
mission flew through the center this afternoon, indicating little 
change in Sara's intensity with a 1000 mb pressure, peak 850 mb 
flight-level winds of 44 kt, and a dropsonde launched in the 
southwestern side of the circulation also indicating a surface wind 
gust of 37 kt. The initial intensity is held at 40 kt for this 
advisory, though this could be a little generous based on the 
aircraft observations. 
 
The tropical storm now appears to be moving a bit faster to the 
west, with the motion estimated at 280/4 kt. Mid-level ridging is 
beginning to develop to the northeast of Sara and should help 
continue to move the system westward to west-northwestward until the 
tropical storm makes landfall in Belize at some point tomorrow 
morning. The NHC track forecast this cycle has been shifted a bit 
southward early on, partially related to initial position updates, 
but still lies near the center of the track guidance envelope.
 
Intensity-wise, Sara's circulation has been significantly disrupted 
despite remaining just offshore. The broader circulation of the 
tropical storm has been interacting with the mountainous terrain of 
northern Honduras, and I suspect that some of the drying downslope 
flow off this higher terrain is playing some role in why Sara is 
struggling to produce much deep convection near its center 
currently. In fact most of the remaining convection is organized in 
fragmented bands well to the north of the center. Despite the 
relatively favorable environmental conditions, the current structure 
of Sara argues against much intensification before it moves inland 
over Belize in about 18 h, and the latest forecast shows little 
change in strength before landfall. After moving inland, weakening 
should commence and the global and hurricane-regional model guidance 
continue to indicate Sara will open up into a trough as it emerges 
into the Gulf of Mexico. However its remnant moisture will continue 
to propagate northward and likely act as a focal point for enhanced 
precipitation ahead of the next frontal boundary along the northern 
Gulf coast by the middle of this week.
 
As stressed over the past couple of days, the primary hazard 
associated with Sara remains catastrophic flash flooding, with 
substantial rainfall continuing to occur near the north coast and 
in upslope regions of higher terrain in Honduras.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Through early next week, heavy rainfall from Tropical Storm Sara
will cause potentially catastrophic flash flooding and mudslides
over northern portions of Honduras.
 
2. Elsewhere across Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala, western
Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo, heavy rainfall 
will cause significant and life-threatening flash flooding and
mudslides.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
northern coast of Honduras, the Bay Islands, the Caribbean coast of
Guatemala, the coast of Belize, and portions of the coast of Mexico
where tropical storm warnings are in effect.
