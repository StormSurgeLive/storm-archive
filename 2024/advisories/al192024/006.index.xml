MUDSLIDES EXPECTED IN HONDURAS THROUGH THE WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1000 PM EST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.8N 84.5W
ABOUT 105 MI...170 KM ESE OF ISLA GUANAJA HONDURAS
ABOUT 105 MI...165 KM WNW OF CABO GRACIAS A DIOS ON NIC/HON BORDER

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Nicaragua has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Watch for the northeastern coast of Nicaragua.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* The northern coast of Honduras from Punta Sal eastward to the
Honduras/Nicaragua Border
* The Bay Islands of Honduras
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests elsewhere in Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, and the Yucatan
Peninsula should monitor the progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM EST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Sara was 
located near latitude 15.8 North, longitude 84.5 West. Sara is 
moving toward the west near 10 mph (17 km/h). A westward motion at a 
slower forward speed is expected during the next couple of days. A 
slow west-northwestward motion is forecast by late Saturday. On the 
forecast track, the center of Sara will move close to the northern 
coast of Honduras through early Saturday, then approach the coast of 
Belize on Sunday.
 
Data from the Air Force Hurricane Hunters indicate that maximum
sustained winds have increased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some further strengthening is possible during the next
couple of days if the center of Sara remains offshore of the
northern coast of Honduras.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Tropical Storm Sara can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Through early next week, rainfall amounts of 10 to 20
inches with isolated storm totals around 30 inches area expected
over northern Honduras. This rainfall will lead to widespread areas
of life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding and
mudslides, especially along and near the Sierra La Esperanza.
 
Elsewhere across the rest of Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, eastern
Guatemala, western Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo,
Sara is expected to produce 5 to 10 inches of rain with localized
totals around 15 inches through early next week. This will result in
areas of flash flooding, perhaps significant, along with the
potential of mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Sara, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/refresh/graphics_at4+shtml/205755.shtml?
rainqpf#contents
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in
Honduras during the next couple of days.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in
areas of onshore winds along the northern coast of Honduras. Near
the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive
waves.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 AM EST.
Next complete advisory at 400 AM EST.

<title>Tropical Storm Sara Forecast Discussion Number 5</title>

Tropical Storm Sara Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192024
400 PM EST Thu Nov 14 2024
 
Convective banding associated with the cyclone continued to improve
especially over the western semicircle of the system after the
release of the 1500 UTC advisory.  A couple of Air Force Reserve
reconnaissance aircraft that have flew through the system early
this afternoon reported dropsonde data that supported a minimum
pressure of 998 mb and peak 850-mb flight-level winds of 42 kt.
These data supported the upgrade of the system to Tropical Storm
Sara on the 1800 UTC intermediate advisory.  The latest Dvorak 
satellite intensity estimates from both SAB and TAFB also support 
35 kt, therefore the initial intensity for this advisory is at that 
value. 

The forward speed of Sara is beginning to decrease as expected.  
The cyclone is now moving westward or 270 degrees at 9 kt.  Sara 
should continue to move westward during the next couple of days to 
the south of a strong mid-level ridge, however a continued 
deceleration of Sara's forward speed is expected.  By Sunday, the 
center of the ridge is forecast to move eastward over Florida which 
should cause Sara to turn west-northwestward when it approaches 
Belize and the southern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula.  Most of 
the track guidance has nudged northward this cycle, and the NHC 
forecast has been adjusted accordingly.  The new track continues to 
be along or just north of the coast of northern Honduras and it is 
in good agreement with the latest consensus aids. 

Environmental conditions are conducive for some strengthening 
during the next couple of days, but the main inhibiting factor is 
the sprawling structure of the cyclone and its close proximity to 
land.  Given that the system is forecast to pass very close to the 
northern coast of Honduras, only modest strengthening is suggested 
by most of the guidance.  The NHC intensity forecast calls for some 
strengthening during the next couple of days, follow by little 
change in intensity until the system moves over the Yucatan 
peninsula.  It should be noted that a more northern track, could 
result in additional strengthening, but the global models and most 
of the intensity guidance does not favor that scenario.  The global 
models indicate that the system will weakening quickly while it 
moves over the Yucatan peninsula and that the circulation is not 
likely to survive the passage over the peninsula.  Therefore, the 
new forecast now calls for dissipation by day 5. 


 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Through early next week, heavy rainfall from Sara will cause 
potentially catastrophic flash flooding and mudslides over portions 
of northern Honduras. 

2. Elsewhere across Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala, 
western Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo heavy 
rainfall will cause significant and life-threatening flash flooding 
and mudslides. 
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
northern coast of Honduras, and the adjacent Bay Islands where
tropical storm warnings are in effect.
 
4. The system is forecast to approach Belize and the Yucatan
Peninsula of Mexico late this weekend where there is a risk of
strong winds.  Residents in these areas should monitor the latest
forecast updates.
