BULLETIN
Remnants Of Sara Advisory Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192024
300 AM CST Mon Nov 18 2024
 
...SARA DISSIPATES...
...THIS IS THE LAST NHC ADVISORY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM CST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.0N 91.5W
ABOUT 90 MI...145 KM SW OF CAMPECHE MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...30 MPH...45 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1005 MB...29.68 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM CST (0900 UTC), the remnants of Sara were located near
latitude 19.0 North, longitude 91.5 West. The remnants are moving
toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches are expected
over northern Honduras, with storm total amounts locally as high as
40 inches. The risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flooding
impacts will continue, especially along and near the Sierra La
Esperanza.
 
Across portions of Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala, western 
Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo, the remnants of 
Sara are expected to produce an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain 
with localized storm totals around 15 inches. This will result in 
areas of flash flooding, perhaps significant, along with the 
potential of mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Sara, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall 
Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/refresh/graphics_at4+shtml/205755.shtml?

Remnants Of Sara Discussion Number  19

300 AM CST Mon Nov 18 2024
 
Satellite images and surface observations indicate that Sara no 
longer has a well organized circulation, and therefore has 
degenerated into a trough of low pressure. The trough is beginning 
to emerge back over water in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. While 
strong upper-level winds are expected to inhibit tropical 
development, the remnant vorticity and moisture could interact with 
an approaching frontal system and contribute to heavy rainfall along 
the northern Gulf Coast during the next couple of days.
 
This is the last NHC advisory on Sara. For more information on the
ongoing rainfall threat in southern Mexico/Central America and the
expected heavy rainfall along the U.S. Gulf Coast, see products
issued by the Weather Prediction Center and your local weather
office.
