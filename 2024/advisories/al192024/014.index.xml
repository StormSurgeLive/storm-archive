DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM CST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Sara was
located near latitude 16.5 North, longitude 87.3 West. Sara is
moving toward the west-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h), and this 
general motion with some increase in forward speed is expected 
until landfall. On the forecast track, the center of Sara will 
move over Belize during the day on Sunday.
 
Air Force Reserve aircraft data indicate that the maximum sustained 
winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is anticipated until landfall on Sunday, 
with dissipation expected over the southern portion of the Yucatan 
Peninsula by early Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km), 
primarily north of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches) 
based on dropsonde data.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Tropical Storm Sara can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Through early next week, rainfall amounts of 15 to 25
inches with isolated storm totals around 40 inches are expected
over northern Honduras. This rainfall will lead to widespread areas
of life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding and
mudslides, especially along and near the Sierra La Esperanza.
 
Elsewhere across the rest of Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, eastern
Guatemala, western Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo,
Tropical Storm Sara is expected to produce 5 to 10 inches of rain
with localized totals around 15 inches through early next week. This
will result in areas of flash flooding, perhaps significant, along
with the potential of mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Sara, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/refresh/graphics_at4+shtml/205755.shtml?
rainqpf#contents
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in
portions of Honduras through early Sunday. Tropical storm conditions
are expected in Guatemala, Belize, and portions of Mexico beginning
overnight.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to
3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas
of onshore winds along the northern coast of Honduras. Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
A storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet
above ground level near and to the north of where the center of Sara
crosses the coast of Belize.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1200 AM CST.
Next complete advisory at 300 AM CST.

Tropical Storm Sara Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192024
900 PM CST Sat Nov 16 2024

Sara remains a poorly organized tropical storm, with the most 
significant banding features in the northern semicircle well away 
from the low-level center.  Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter 
flight-level and dropsonde data indicate that the central pressure 
has risen to 1001 mb and the winds have decreased.  The initial wind 
speed is set to 35 kt, which are mostly occurring in the rain bands 
well away from the center.
 
Aircraft fixes indicate the storm is moving slowly to the 
west-northwest.  Sara should slightly accelerate in that direction 
as mid-level ridging strengthens over the Gulf of Mexico through 
tomorrow.  The storm is expected to make landfall on Sunday on the 
coast of Belize, and very little change was made to the NHC forecast 
with guidance consistent from the last cycle.  Little change in 
intensity is expected before landfall due to the disorganized nature 
of Sara, and the new intensity forecast is slightly lower than the 
last one.  The weakened cyclone should dissipate over the southern 
portion of the Yucatan peninsula by early Monday.
 
The primary hazard associated with Sara continues to be potentially 
catastrophic flash flooding, with substantial rainfall continuing to 
occur near the north coast and in upslope regions of higher terrain 
in Honduras.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Through early next week, heavy rainfall from Tropical Storm Sara
will cause potentially catastrophic flash flooding and mudslides
over northern portions of Honduras.
 
2. Elsewhere across Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala, western
Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo, heavy rainfall
will cause significant and life-threatening flash flooding and
mudslides.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
northern coast of Honduras, the Bay Islands, the Caribbean coast of
Guatemala, the coast of Belize, and portions of the coast of Mexico
where tropical storm warnings are in effect.
