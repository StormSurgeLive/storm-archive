DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM CST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Sara was 
located near latitude 16.8 North, longitude 87.8 West. Sara is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h) and this 
general motion with some increase in forward speed is expected 
through tonight. On the forecast track, the center of Sara will make 
landfall in Belize late this morning or around midday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Little change in strength is anticipated until landfall. 
Weakening is forecast after the storm moves inland, and dissipation 
is expected over the southern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula 
tonight or Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Tropical Storm Sara can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Through early next week, rainfall amounts of 15 to 25 
inches with isolated storm totals around 40 inches area expected 
over northern Honduras. This rainfall will lead to widespread areas 
of life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding and 
mudslides, especially along and near the Sierra La Esperanza.

Elsewhere across the rest of Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, eastern 
Guatemala, western Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo, 
Tropical Storm Sara is expected to produce 5 to 10 inches of rain 
with localized totals around 15 inches through early next week. This 
will result in areas of flash flooding, perhaps significant, along 
with the potential of mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Sara, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/refresh/graphics_at4+shtml/205755.shtml?
rainqpf#contents
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions, especially in gusts, are expected
in the warning area in portions of Honduras, Guatemala, Belize,
and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico during the next several hours.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to
3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas
of onshore winds along the northern coast of Honduras. Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
A storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet
above ground level near and to the north of where the center of Sara
crosses the coast of Belize.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 600 AM CST.
Next complete advisory at 900 AM CST.

Tropical Storm Sara Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192024
300 AM CST Sun Nov 17 2024
 
The center of Sara is nearing the coast of Belize.  Satellite and
radar images indicate that the storm's convective pattern remains
ragged with patches of deep convection occurring to the north and
east of the center. The objective and subjective Dvorak estimates
range from 25 to about 40 kt, and based on that data, the initial
wind speed is held at 35 kt.
 
The storm is moving slowly west-northwestward at 4 kt. A building 
ridge over the eastern Gulf of Mexico should cause the system to 
move faster to the west-northwest during the next day or so.  This 
motion should bring the center of Sara to the Belize coast late 
this morning or around midday. Although a 24-hour forecast point 
is provided, most of the models show Sara opening into a trough 
by then over northern Guatemala and the Yucatan Peninsula. Sara 
is expected to hold steady in strength until it reaches the coast, 
but weakening is expected after the system moves inland.

Sara has produced a tremendous amount of rain in Honduras. Data
from the country's government indicate that there has been some
reports of around 40 inches of rain. These heavy rains are now
spreading westward across portions of Belize, Guatemala, and the
Yucatan Peninsula.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Through early next week, heavy rainfall from Tropical Storm Sara
will cause potentially catastrophic flash flooding and mudslides
over northern portions of Honduras.
 
2. Elsewhere across Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala, western
Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo, heavy rainfall
will cause significant and life-threatening flash flooding and
mudslides.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions, especially in gusts, are expected 
during the next several hours along portions of the northern coast 
of Honduras, the Bay Islands, the Caribbean coast of Guatemala, the 
coast of Belize, and portions of the coast of Mexico where tropical 
storm warnings are in effect.
