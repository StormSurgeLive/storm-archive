progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM CST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Sara was
located near latitude 16.1 North, longitude 86.3 West. Sara is
nearly stationary. A slow west-northwestward motion is
forecast to begin late today, with a faster motion toward the
west-northwest and northwest expected on Sunday and Sunday night. On
the forecast track, the center of Sara will continue to move near
the northern coast of Honduras during the next day or so before
approaching Belize, and then move onshore in Belize during the day
on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is likely today. Slight
strengthening is possible tonight and Sunday before landfall in
Belize, with weakening expected after landfall. Sara is expected to
dissipate Sunday night or Monday as it crosses the southern portion
of the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Tropical Storm Sara can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Through early next week, rainfall amounts of 15 to 25
inches with isolated storm totals around 35 inches area expected
over northern Honduras. This rainfall will lead to widespread areas
of life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding and
mudslides, especially along and near the Sierra La Esperanza.
 
Elsewhere across the rest of Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, eastern
Guatemala, western Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo,
Tropical Storm Sara is expected to produce 5 to 10 inches of rain
with localized totals around 15 inches through early next week. This
will result in areas of flash flooding, perhaps significant, along
with the potential of mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Sara, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/refresh/graphics_at4+shtml/205755.shtml?
rainqpf#contents
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in
Honduras through tonight. Tropical storm conditions are expected in
Guatemala, Belize, and portions of Mexico beginning later today.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to
3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas
of onshore winds along the northern coast of Honduras. Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
A storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet
above ground level near and to the north of where the center of Sara
crosses the coast of Belize.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM CST.

<title>Tropical Storm Sara Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Tropical Storm Sara Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192024
300 AM CST Sat Nov 16 2024

Satellite imagery and recent scatterometer data indicate that the 
center of Sara is located between the coast of mainland Honduras and 
the Bay Islands.  Compared to 24 h ago, the storm has become less 
organized with a decrease in the convection near the center.  The 
ASCAT data showed maximum winds of 35-40 kt in an area of 
convection to the west and northwest of the center, and based on 
this the initial intensity is lowered to 40 kt.

The cyclone remains stationary.  A mid-level ridge should 
strengthen to the north of Sara later today or tonight, which is 
forecast to cause the tropical cyclone to move slowly toward the 
west-northwest through Sunday. This motion should bring the center 
over Belize between the 24-36 h points.  After landfall, Sara or 
its remnants should turn northwestward as it moves across the 
southern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula.

The intensity guidance is in good agreement that not much change in 
strength should occur before Sara makes landfall in Belize.  The 
intensity forecast will show a little strengthening at 24 h when 
the system has the most room over water. The cyclone should weaken 
after landfall, and the dynamical models are in good agreement that 
it should decay to a open trough before reaching the Bay of 
Campeche or the Gulf of Mexico. Based on this guidance, the 
intensity forecast now shows dissipation by 60 h.  The global 
models suggest the possibility that the remnants of Sara could 
interact with a frontal system to form a non-tropical low near the 
northern Gulf coast in the early or middle part of next week.
 
The primary hazard associated with Sara will continue to be
catastrophic flash flooding, with preliminary reports already
suggesting substantial rainfall has occurred near the north coast
and in upslope regions of higher terrain in Honduras.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Through early next week, heavy rainfall from Tropical Storm Sara 
will cause potentially catastrophic flash flooding and mudslides 
over northern portions of Honduras.

2. Elsewhere across Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala, western 
Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo heavy rainfall will 
cause significant and life-threatening flash flooding and 
mudslides. 
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
northern coast of Honduras, the Bay Islands, the Caribbean coast of
Guatemala, the coast of Belize, and portions of the coast of Mexico
where tropical storm warnings are in effect.
