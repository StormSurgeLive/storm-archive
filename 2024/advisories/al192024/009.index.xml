DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Sara was 
located near latitude 16.2 North, longitude 86.2 West. Sara is 
moving toward the west near 2 mph (4 km/h). A continued slow 
westward motion is expected over the next day or so, followed by a 
more west-northwestward motion beginning late Saturday. On the 
forecast track, the center of Sara will continue to move near the 
northern coast of Honduras during the next day or so before 
approaching Belize, and then move onshore in Belize during the 
day on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some slight strengthening is possible over the next day or so, as 
long as the system remains offshore.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Tropical Storm Sara can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Through early next week, rainfall amounts of 15 to 25 
inches with isolated storm totals around 35 inches area expected 
over northern Honduras. This rainfall will lead to widespread areas 
of life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding and 
mudslides, especially along and near the Sierra La Esperanza.

Elsewhere across the rest of Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, eastern 
Guatemala, western Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo, 
Tropical Storm Sara is expected to produce 5 to 10 inches of rain 
with localized totals around 15 inches through early next week. This 
will result in areas of flash flooding, perhaps significant, along 
with the potential of mudslides.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Tropical Storm Sara, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/refresh/graphics_at4+shtml/205755.shtml?
rainqpf#contents
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in
Honduras during the next couple of days. Tropical storm conditions
are expected in Guatemala, Belize, and portions of Mexico beginning 
on Saturday.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to
3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas
of onshore winds along the northern coast of Honduras. Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
A storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet
above ground level near and to the north of where the center of Sara
crosses the coast of Belize.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 600 PM CST.
Next complete advisory at 900 PM CST.

Tropical Storm Sara Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192024
300 PM CST Fri Nov 15 2024
 
Satellite images depict a large convective band to the northwest of 
the center of Sara, which has been meandering just offshore between 
the northern coast of Honduras and the Bay Islands. The current 
intensity is uncertain. Subjective Dvorak satellite intensity 
estimates were T3.0/45 kt from both TAFB and SAB, though there was 
a recent partial scatterometer pass around 1430 UTC that depicted 
winds only around 30-33 kt in the northeastern semicircle. The 
initial intensity remains 45 kt for this advisory, which may be 
generous. An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 
scheduled to investigate the system later this evening which will 
help better determine the structure and intensity of the system.

Sara's forward motion has become sluggish today with a slow westward 
motion, estimated at 270/2 kt. This slow motion is anticipated to 
continue over the next 12 to 24 h. Afterwards, the mid-level ridge 
which has been steering Sara is forecast to shift northeastward, and 
Sara is then expected to resume a somewhat faster westward to 
west-northwestward motion later this weekend. Along the forecast 
track, the center of Sara is forecast to move through the Gulf of 
Honduras on Saturday and into Belize on Sunday. The NHC forecast 
track is near the previous, with a slightly slower forward motion in 
the near term.
 
The intensity forecast is largely dependent on the land interaction 
with Central America. The model trends and the track forecast keep 
the system's center just offshore through landfall in Belize, thus 
the latest NHC shows some slight strengthening. After landfall, the 
system is forecast to weaken rapidly. The current NHC forecast shows 
the system as a remnant low in the Bay of Campeche, however it is 
possible the system dissipates over the Yucatan peninsula sooner 
than forecast. The latest NHC intensity forecast is similar to the 
previous and lies near the consensus aids.
 
The primary hazard associated with Sara will continue to be
catastrophic flash flooding, with preliminary reports already
suggesting substantial rainfall has occurred near the north coast
and in upslope regions of higher terrain in Honduras.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Through early next week, heavy rainfall from Tropical Storm Sara
will cause catastrophic flash flooding and mudslides over northern
portions of Honduras.
 
2. Elsewhere across Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala, western
Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo, heavy rainfall 
will cause significant and life-threatening flash flooding and
mudslides.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the 
northern coast of Honduras, the Bay Islands, the Caribbean coast of 
Guatemala, the coast of Belize and portions of the coast of Mexico 
where tropical storm warnings are in effect.
