Tropical Depression Sara Advisory Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192024
900 PM CST Sun Nov 17 2024
 
...HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLASH FLOODING THREAT CONTINUES FOR PORTIONS
OF THE YUCATAN PENINSULA AND CENTRAL AMERICA...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM CST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.1N 90.7W
ABOUT 125 MI...200 KM S OF CAMPECHE MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...30 MPH...45 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1004 MB...29.65 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM CST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Sara was 
located inland near latitude 18.1 North, longitude 90.7 West. The 
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 
km/h), and this general motion should continue overnight. On the 
forecast track, the center of Sara will continue to move over the 
Yucatan Peninsula through Monday morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 30 mph (45 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Further weakening is expected, and Sara is forecast to 
become a remnant low or open into a trough of low pressure by Monday 
morning.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Tropical Depression Sara can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches are expected 
over northern Honduras, with storm total amounts locally as high as 
40 inches. The risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flooding 
impacts will continue, especially along and near the Sierra La 
Esperanza.

Across portions of Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala, western 
Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo, Tropical Storm 
Sara is expected to produce an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain with 
localized storm totals around 15 inches. This will result in areas 
of flash flooding, perhaps significant, along with the potential of 
mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Depression Sara, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at

Tropical Depression Sara Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192024
300 PM CST Sun Nov 17 2024
 
Since making landfall, Sara appears to be gradually weakening as it
straddles the area between Mexico and Guatemala this afternoon.
Convective activity has remained somewhat intact near the center,
though the low-level cloud motions from the GOES-16 1 minute
mesoscale sector suggest the circulation definition is already
becoming more diffuse. The initial intensity remains 30 kt this
advisory after the system was downgraded to a depression earlier at
1800 UTC.
 
As expected Sara has sped up a bit today, with its initial motion
now estimated at 300/10 kt. A turn more northwestward is expected
tonight before the depression opens up into a trough at some point
tonight or tomorrow, in good agreement with the bulk of the
forecast aids. As previously discussed, the track aids do extend
further north than the current NHC forecast track into the Gulf of
Mexico, mainly because they track the remnant vorticity of the
system, even though it will no longer be a tropical cyclone.
However, the moisture plume associated with the remnants of Sara is
anticipated to contribute to enhanced rainfall along the U.S. Gulf
coast from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle on Tuesday, where the
Weather Prediction Center currently has a slight risk for excessive
rainfall that day.
 
Sara has produced a tremendous amount of rain in Honduras. Data from 
the country's government indicate reports of more than 40 inches of 
rain at some locations. Heavy rainfall is continuing over portions 
of the Yucatan Peninsula and Central America this afternoon.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Across Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala, western
Nicaragua, and the Mexican State of Quintana Roo, areas of heavy
rainfall will continue to cause significant and life-threatening
flash flooding and mudslides as Sara moves further inland.
 
2. The heavy rainfall from Tropical Depression Sara is winding down
across northern Honduras, however the risk of catastrophic flooding
impacts will continue.
