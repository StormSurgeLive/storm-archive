Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  22
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Tue Aug 27 2024

Some bursts of deep convection have been occuring in the storm's 
circulation over the past few hours, with cloud tops colder than 
-70 deg C.  However, the system lacks well-defined banding features 
and the area of cold tops continues to exhibit a hard western edge 
indicative of westerly shear.  The advisory intensity estimate is 
held at 45 kt based on a blend of subjective Dvorak estimates from 
PHFO, JTWC, and SAB.  This is also in good agreement with objective 
estimates from UW-CIMSS.

Hone has been moving between west and west-northwest and the 
initial motion estimate is 285/10 kt.  There is little change to 
the track forecast philosophy from the previous advisory.  A low- 
to mid-level ridge is expected to remain in place to the north of 
the tropical cyclone for the next 2-3 days.  With this steering 
scenario, Hector should move on a west-northwestward to westward 
track through the period.  The official track forecast is just a 
tad to the north of the previous one, and in good agreement with 
the latest corrected dynamical model consensus, HCCA.

Global models show persistent and strong upper-level westerlies 
impacting Hone for the next few days.  The SHIPS output diagnoses 
vertical wind shear on the order of 40 kt during the ensuing 48-72 
hours along with dry low- to mid-tropospheric environmental air.  
So, even though the system should remain over fairly warm waters, 
the otherwise hostile conditions should lead to weakening.  The 
official intensity forecast is similar to the model consensus.  
Hone is likely to degenerate into a post-tropical remnant low in 
2-3 days and dissipate soon thereafter.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM HST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gilma was
located near latitude 18.5 North, longitude 142.1 West.  Gilma is
moving toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h).  A motion between 
west and west-northwest is expected for the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Weakening is expected during the next few days, 
and Gilma is forecast to weaken to a remnant low by Thursday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: The remnants of Gilma may bring heavy rainfall to 
portions of the Hawaiian Islands as early as Friday, lasting 
through Saturday.

SURF: Easterly swell generated by Gilma will build over waters 
around the Hawaiian Islands today and tonight. These swells may 
produce high surf along east-facing shores of some islands from 
Wednesday into Friday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM HST.

<title>Tropical Storm Gilma Forecast Discussion Number 39</title>

Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number  39
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP072024
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Tue Aug 27 2024

The low-level center of Gilma continues to run out ahead of the deep 
convection.  The center is now located more than 60 n mi outside of 
the convection, suggesting that Gilma is continuing to weaken 
rapidly.  The latest subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from 
SAB, JTWC, and PHFO range from 45 to 77 kt.  Recent objective 
intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS range from 41 to 51 kt.  The 
initial intensity is brought down to 55 kt for this advisory, and 
this could be generous.  Gilma has weakened by 40 kt over the past 
15 h or so.

Gilma should continue to weaken over the next 36 h as it remains 
located within an environment of 15 to 20 kt of westerly wind shear, 
dry air, and within sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) of 25 to 26C.  
The official intensity forecast has been reduced significantly 
during the short term due to the lower initial intensity, and lies 
at the high end of the intensity guidance for the first 24 h.  In 
about 48 h, Gilma should move into an area of even stronger westerly 
wind shear, which will lead to any remaining convection being 
stripped away.  Gilma is forecast to weaken to a remnant low by 
Thursday night, but it's possible the cyclone could become a remnant 
low sooner than that.  The global models are forecasting the 
remnant low to open up into a trough in about 4 days, and the 
official forecast calls for dissipation at that time.

Gilma continues moving due westward and has sped up a bit, with an 
initial motion estimate of 270/13 kt.  A ridge north of Gilma will 
continue to steer the cyclone westward to west-northwestward.  The 
official forecast has been adjusted slightly to the south and a bit 
faster than the previous prediction, and is in best agreement with 
the TCVE consensus aid.
