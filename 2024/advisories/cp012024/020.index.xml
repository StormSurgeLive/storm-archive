Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  20
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Mon Aug 26 2024
 
Deep convection continues to develop over the low-level circulation 
center of Tropical Storm Hone this evening. The latest subjective 
Dvorak intensity estimates came in at 3.0 from PHFO and JTWC, and at 
2.0 from SAB. Meanwhile, a couple of SATCON estimates from UW-CIMSS 
were around 50 knots close to 00z this afternoon. With little change 
in satellite presentation since the previous advisory package, the 
initial intensity has been held at 50 knots.

The initial motion estimate is 280/12 kt. Hone will continue 
slightly north of due west at a similar forward speed during the 
next 24 hours, steered by a subtropical ridge to the 
north-northeast. A similar motion with a slightly slower forward 
speed is expected thereafter, as the subtropical ridge weakens. The 
latest track forecast is similar to the previous advisory and 
closely follows the track consensus guidance.

Hone will remain in a rather hostile environment during the next few 
days with westerly vertical wind shear of 30 to 40 knots and dry 
mid-level air surrounding the system. Despite increasingly warm sea 
surface temperatures, the hostile conditions should lead to steady 
weakening during the next few days, and Hone is expected to become a 
post-tropical remnant low Thursday.  The intensity forecast has 
changed little and is closely aligned with the latest consensus 
guidance.
