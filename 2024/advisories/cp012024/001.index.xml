Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI<br/>
200 AM HST Thu Aug 22 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the central North Pacific...between 140W and 180W:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida is issuing <br/>
advisories on Hurricane Gilma, located more than one thousand miles <br/>
west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California <br/>
peninsula, or around two thousand miles east of Hilo, Hawaii. Gilma <br/>
is expected to move into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area <br/>
of responsibility early next week.<br/>
<br/>
Approximately 1000 miles east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii (EP91/CP90):<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity continues to shows signs of <br/>
organization with an area of low pressure well east-southeast of <br/>
the Hawaiian Islands. Only a slight improvement in organization <br/>
could result in the formation of a tropical depression or tropical <br/>
storm later today while it moves generally westward at 10 to 15 mph. <br/>
This system is currently crossing into the Central Pacific basin, <br/>
where it is then forecast to strengthen during the next couple of <br/>
days and move near the Hawaiian Islands late this weekend or early <br/>
next week. For marine forecasts, including gale warnings, see High <br/>
Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service. <br/>
<br/>
Interests in Hawaii should closely monitor this disturbance, though <br/>
it remains too early to determine the exact location and magnitude <br/>
of potential impacts. Now that the system is moving into the <br/>
Central Pacific basin, all future information on this system <br/>
will be found in the Tropical Weather Outlook for the Central <br/>
Pacific Basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, no tropical cyclones are expected during the next 7 days.<br/>
<br/>
&& <br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on <br/>
the web at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php<br/>

Tropical Depression One-C Discussion Number   1
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
500 AM HST Thu Aug 22 2024

The area of low pressure well east-southeast of the Hawaiian Islands 
has become better organized overnight, with persistent deep 
convection now over the low-level circulation center. As a result, 
the first Tropical Depression of the season has formed in the 
Central Pacific basin. Subjective Dvorak intensity estimates came in 
at 2.5 PHFO and 1.5 SAB. Taking a blend of these estimates, the 
initial intensity will be set at 30 knots. 

The initial motion of Tropical Depression One is set at 270/12 
knots. This general motion is expected to continue during the next 
several days as the system is steered by a large subtropical ridge 
to the north. A decrease in forward speed and a slight turn toward 
the west- northwest is forecast by days 4 and 5 as a weakness 
develops in the subtropical ridge to the north. The track forecast 
is closely aligned with the consensus guidance. 

Tropical Depression One is forecast to remain in a low to moderate 
vertical wind shear environment, with warm sea surface temperatures 
of 27 to 28C, and adequate deep layer moisture during the next 
several days. This should result in gradual strengthening of the 
system as it tracks steadily westward, and a tropical storm will 
likely form later today. By late in the weekend into early next 
week, the tropical cyclone will begin to see an increase in westerly 
vertical wind shear and the potential for some entrainment of drier 
mid-level air. This should lead to a gradual weakening of the 
system. The intensity forecast is close to the intensity consensus 
during the next several days, bringing the system up close to 
hurricane strength over the weekend, then is slightly lower than the 
consensus guidance by days 4 and 5.  

KEY MESSAGES:

1. Tropical Depression One is forecast to approach the Hawaiian 
Islands during the next few days, bringing the potential for heavy 
rainfall, along with dangerous surf and rip currents. A Tropical 
Storm Watch could be required for portions of the main Hawaiian 
Islands tonight or Friday.
