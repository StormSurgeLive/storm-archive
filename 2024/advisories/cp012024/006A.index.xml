Interests elsewhere in Hawaii should monitor the progress of Hone.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by the National Weather Service office in
Honolulu Hawaii.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM HST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Hone was
located by US Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft and 
satellite near latitude 16.8 North, longitude 148.6 West. Hone is 
moving toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h). This motion toward the 
west is expected to continue over the next several days as the 
forward speed gradually slows. On the forecast track, the center of 
Hone is expected to pass near or south of the Big Island Saturday 
night into early Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 to 72
hours.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Hone can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header TCDCP1 and WMO
header WTPA41 PHFO, and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/HFOTCDCP1.shtml.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area
late Saturday into Sunday. Winds are expected to be strongest
where they blow downslope from higher terrain, over headlands, and
through passes.
 
RAINFALL: Hone is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to
10 inches over mainly windward and southeast facing slopes of the
Big Island, with locally higher amounts. Rainfall totals of 2 to 4
inches will be possible over portions of the smaller islands,
mainly windward.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Hone are expected to
begin reaching the Hawaiian Islands over the weekend. These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Tropical Storm Hone Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number   6
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
1100 AM HST Fri Aug 23 2024
 
The U.S. Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters are flying into Hone 
this morning. In spite of the tropical storm's continued lack of 
persistent deep convection, it presents a well-developed low level 
cloud field on satellite imagery. A center dropsonde found a 
minimum sea level pressure of 1002 mb, and flight level wind 
reduction and SFMR in the northeast quadrant support raising the 
initial intensity to 45 kt. Based on the aircraft data, the wind 
radii were adjusted for most quadrants on this advisory. Additional 
aircraft missions are planned for today and tonight.

The initial motion is set at 280/14. This general motion toward 
slightly north of due west will continue during the next several 
days as Hone is steered by a deep subtropical ridge to the north. 
However, some slowing of the forward motion is anticipated as the 
deep ridge to the north of Hone weakens slightly. By the middle of 
next week, Hone will likely get increasingly shallow as vertical 
wind shear increases, allowing the low level trade wind flow to 
steer the system toward the west. The official forecast track is 
nearly identical to the previous advisory, and closely follows the 
tightly clustered consensus guidance. On this track, Hone will be 
passing near or just south of the Big Island of Hawaii late 
Saturday into early Sunday.

Little change in intensity is expected in the next 12 to 18 hours, 
followed intensification Saturday and Sunday. Easterly winds aloft, 
which have inhibited outflow in all but the south and southwest 
quadrants, will relax tonight and Saturday as a weakness develops 
in the upper level ridge north of the cyclone. Sea surface 
temperatures will remain around 26-27C, which will be sufficient 
for intensification, possibly to hurricane strength, later in the 
weekend. By Monday, westerly vertical wind shear increases sharply, 
and some drier mid-level air appears to begin entraining into the 
system. This should result in steady weakening. The intensity 
forecast was changed little from the prior package and lies near 
the IVCN between the stronger dynamical guidance and the weaker 
statistical guidance.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. There is the potential for excessive rainfall and flash flooding
on portions of the Big Island starting later Saturday, continuing
through Sunday and lingering into Monday as a large area of
moisture associated with Hone. The heaviest rainfall will likely
occur over windward and southeast facing slopes.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible on the Big Island later
Saturday into Sunday. Winds are expected to be strongest where they
blow downslope from higher terrain, over headlands, and through
passes.
 
3. Swell generated by Hone is expected to reach the Hawaiian
islands Saturday night into Sunday. This swell could cause
life-threatening surf and rip currents. Listen for later advisories
and possible warnings from the National Weather Service.
