DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM HST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Hone was
located near latitude 16.4 North, longitude 146.3 West. Hone is
moving toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h) and this general 
motion is expected to continue during the next couple of days.  On 
the forecast track, the center of Hone is expected to pass near or 
south of the Big Island Saturday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some gradual strengthening is forecast during the next couple of 
days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Hone can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header TCDCP1 and WMO
header WTPA41 PHFO, and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/HFOTCDCP1.shtml.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area
late Saturday into Sunday. Winds are expected to be strongest
where they blow downslope from higher terrain, over headlands, and
through passes.
 
RAINFALL: Hone is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 4 to
8 inches over mainly windward and southeast facing slopes of the
Big Island, with locally higher amounts. Rainfall totals of 2 to 4
inches will be possible over portions of the smaller islands,
mainly windward.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Hone are expected to
begin reaching the Hawaiian Islands over the weekend. These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM HST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM HST.

Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number   5
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
500 AM HST Fri Aug 23 2024
 
The satellite appearance of Hone has changed little since 
the previous advisory package, with only limited deep convection 
near the low level circulation center. The latest subjective Dvorak 
intensity estimates came in at 2.5 for PHFO and 2.0 for SAB and
JTWC. The objective intensity estimates ADT/AiDT from UW-CIMSS came 
in at 35 knots and 38 knots respectively. Considering that the 
ASCAT MetOp-B pass last evening sampled a large swath of 35 to 40 
knot winds in the eastern semicircle of Hone, the initial intensity 
will be held at 40 knots for this advisory. A U.S. Air Force 
Hurricane Hunter Aircraft is on it's way to sample Hone, and will 
give us valuable information on the intensity, structure, and 
size of the tropical cyclone later this morning.
 
The initial motion for this advisory is set at 280/14 knots. This
general motion is expected to continue during the next couple of 
days as Hone is steered by a large subtropical ridge to the north. A
decrease in forward speed and a slight turn towards the
west-northwest is expected early next week as a weakness develops in 
the subtropical ridge north of the system. By the middle of next 
week, Hone will likely get increasingly shallow as vertical wind 
shear increases, allowing the system to turn back toward the west 
as it becomes steered by the low level trade wind flow. The
official forecast track is nearly identical to the track from the 
previous advisory, and closely follows the tightly clustered 
consensus guidance.
 
Environmental conditions will change little during the next couple 
of days. Hone will remain in an environment characterized by low to
moderate vertical wind shear, marginal sea surface temperatures 
around 26-27C, and marginally sufficient deep layer moisture. 
As a result, only slow and gradual strengthening of the 
system is forecast during the next couple of days as it moves 
steadily west to west-northwestward. It appears that there remains 
a window for further intensification Sunday and Monday as the 
system tracks south of the Hawaiian Islands. Hone will be moving 
into an area with slightly warmer sea surface temperatures around 
27C and higher ocean heat content, while the westerly vertical
wind shear remains at light to moderate levels. This could allow
Hone to reach Hurricane strength and the current official forecast
continues to reflect this. Beyond day 3, westerly vertical wind 
shear increases sharply to 30 to 40 knots, and some drier mid-level 
air appears to begin entraining into the system. This should result 
in steady weakening for days 4 and 5. The intensity forecast is 
close to the intensity consensus during the next couple days, and is 
roughly a blend of the consensus and dynamical intensity guidance 
from days 3 through 5.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. There is the potential for excessive rainfall and flash flooding
on portions of the Big Island starting later Saturday, continuing
through Sunday and lingering into Monday as a large area of
moisture associated with Hone. The heaviest rainfall will likely
occur over windward and southeast facing slopes.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible on the Big Island later
Saturday into Sunday. Winds are expected to be strongest where they
blow downslope from higher terrain, over headlands, and through
passes.
 
3. Swell generated by Hone is expected to reach the Hawaiian
islands Saturday night into Sunday. This swell could cause
life-threatening surf and rip currents. Listen for later advisories
and possible warnings from the National Weather Service.
