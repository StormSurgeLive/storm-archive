<title>Tropical Storm Hone Forecast Discussion Number 28</title>

Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  28
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
1100 PM HST Wed Aug 28 2024
 
Deep convection continues to develop to the north and northeast of 
low-level circulation center of Hone this evening. The center had 
been fully exposed for most of the afternoon and early evening 
hours as the cyclone continues to get hammered by 40 to 45 kt 
of westerly vertical wind shear. The subjective Dvorak current 
intensity estimates from PHFO, JTWC, and SAB ranged from 2.0 (35 kt) 
to 3.0 (45 kt), while a 06z SATCON estimate from UW-CIMSS was 40 
kt. These estimates in combination with the ragged appearance of 
Hone support lowering the initial intensity to 40 kt for this 
advisory.

Hone continues to move west to west-northwest or 280/8 kt. This 
motion is expected to continue during the next 36 hours as the 
cyclone is steered by a low to mid-level ridge to the north. After 
36 hours, the cyclone will begin interacting with a developing mid- 
level low near the International Dateline. A turn toward the 
northwest with a decrease in forward speed is expected Friday and 
Friday night, followed by a more northerly motion and an increase in 
speed on Saturday. The cyclone is then expected to shift westerly 
Sunday through early next week as a mid-level ridge builds to the 
north of the system. The track forecast closely follows a blend of 
the multi-model consensus aids and is very close to the previous 
track forecast. This track takes Hone toward the northwest Hawaiian 
Islands over the weekend, where there is some potential for impacts 
to Kure, Midway, and Pearl and Hermes Atolls.

Hone will remain under the influence of strong westerly vertical 
wind shear of 35 to 45 knots and dry mid-level air during the next 
36 hours. This should lead to slight weakening of the cyclone with 
convection continuing to flare to the north and northeast of the 
low level center. Beyond 36 hours, vertical wind shear will 
gradually trend lower while mid-level moisture increases. This in 
combination with warm sea surface temperatures of 28 to 29 C and 
high ocean heat content should allow for some strengthening of the 
cyclone if it manages to survive the hostile environment it will be 
in through early Friday. The intensity forecast calls for little 
change in strength during the next 48 hours, followed by gradual 
strengthening through the end of the forecast period. This 
generally follows the intensity consensus guidance through the 
forecast period. Only minor adjustments were made to the previous 
intensity forecast through 48 hours, with a slight upward adjustment 
beyond due to the increasingly favorable environment expected 
around Hone.

SUMMARY OF 500 AM HST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.7N 150.7W
ABOUT 285 MI...460 KM E OF HILO HAWAII
ABOUT 480 MI...770 KM ESE OF HONOLULU HAWAII
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 280 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1009 MB...29.80 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM HST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Gilma
was located near latitude 19.7 North, longitude 150.7 West. The
depression is moving toward the west near 14 mph (22 km/h). A 
continued motion toward slightly north of due west will continue 
today, followed by a turn toward the west-northwest on Friday as the
remnant low of Gilma passes near the Hawaiian Islands. Gilma is
expected to dissipate near Kauai on Saturday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Continued gradual weakening is expected, and Gilma is expected to 
weaken to a remnant low by tonight.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1009 mb (29.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Depression Gilma Discussion Number  46
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP072024
500 AM HST Thu Aug 29 2024
 
Gilma's satellite presentation continues to degrade. A few strong 
thunderstorms developing north of Gilma's weakening low-level 
circulation center are doing little to sustain it as a tropical 
cyclone as they remain well removed from the center, and lack 
significant banding. 0643Z ASCAT and 0918Z Oceansat passes showed 
primarily 25-30 kt winds north of the center, and only isolated 
pockets of 32-34 kt winds, respectively. Given the degraded 
satellite appearance and assuming continued gradual spin-down, the 
initial intensity for this advisory is estimated to be 30 kt.

The initial motion estimate remains 280/12 kt, although the 
potentially elongating low-level circulation center is somewhat 
obscured, leading to a reduction in confidence. A low-level ridge 
to the north will continue to steer Gilma just north of due west 
today, with a turn toward the west-northwest expected Friday as the 
ridge weakens. The updated track forecast is similar to the 
previous forecast, as track guidance remains consistent and well 
clustered. 

Gilma is moving into an area of increasing westerly vertical wind 
shear on the order of 20-30 kt, associated with a trough aloft 
approaching from the west. GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite 
imagery indicate that Gilma will struggle to produce organized deep 
convection, and Gilma will likely become a post-tropical remnant 
low by tonight. The forecast indicates it will continue to gradually 
weaken as it passes just north of the Hawaiian Islands on Friday, 
and dissipate in the vicinity of Kauai on Saturday, in line with 
global model and SHIPS guidance.
