DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM HST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Hone was located 
near latitude 18.3 North, longitude 156.1 West. Hone is moving 
toward the west near 8 mph (13 km/h) and this motion is expected to 
continue through the middle of the week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Little change in strength is expected through the morning 
hours today, before a gradual weakening trend begins this afternoon 
onward. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 988 mb (29.18 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Hone can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header TCDCP1 and WMO header WTPA41
PHFO, and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/HFOTCDCP1.shtml.
 
WIND: Tropical Storm conditions will continue on the Big Island
through the morning hours. Winds are expected to be strongest
downslope of higher terrain, over headlands, and through passes.
 
RAINFALL: Hone is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 6 to
12 inches over mainly windward and southeast facing slopes of the
Big Island, with locally higher amounts possible. Rainfall totals
of 2 to 4 inches will be possible over portions of the smaller
islands, mainly windward.
 
SURF: Surf associated with large swells generated by Hone will
continue today as Hone tracks westward. Expect dangerous conditions 
with life-threatening surf and rip currents.

Hurricane Hone Discussion Number  13
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
500 AM HST Sun Aug 25 2024
 
Hone is passing by around 40 nautical miles south of South Point on 
the Big Island of Hawaii this morning, where it is within radar 
range. Combined radar, and data from an Air Force Reserve 
reconnaissance aircraft mission earlier this morning, support 
raising the initial intensity of Hone to 75 knots, keeping it a 
Category 1 Hurricane. Despite recent subjective Dvorak estimates 
suggesting a slightly lower intensity, the satellite presentation 
has evolved markedly overnight, with cold cloud tops near -75 C 
reinforcing the radar and aircraft-based intensities. The initial 
intensity is raised to 75 kt for this advisory.
 
The initial motion of Hone is set at 280/07. This westward 
trajectory is expected to persist over the coming days, influenced 
by a subtropical ridge to the north. However, as Hone remains near 
the Big Island through the early morning hours today, the 
mountainous terrain could influence local steering currents, 
potentially leading to localized and short-term deviations in the 
storm's motion and intensity. As we move into the early to mid 
portion of the week, Hone is projected to encounter increasing 
vertical wind shear, which is expected to weaken the storm and make 
it more shallow. This change in conditions will allow the low-level 
trade wind flow to steer the system toward the west-southwest. The 
official forecast track remains nearly identical to the previous 
advisory and is closely aligned with the tightly clustered consensus 
guidance.
 
Environmental conditions affecting Hone will remain steady over the 
next 12 to 24 h, with sea surface temperatures between 26 C and 27 
C, light to moderate vertical wind shear, and sufficient mid-level 
moisture. This supports maintaining a steady trend in intensity 
through the morning hours today. Although sea surface temperatures 
are forecast to rise to around 27 C tonight and beyond as Hone 
continues westward, increasing vertical wind shear will translate to 
a gradual weakening trend later today through the middle of the 
week. The intensity forecast closely follows dynamical consensus 
guidance.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical Storm conditions will continue on the Big Island through 
the morning hours. Winds are expected to be strongest downslope of 
higher terrain, over headlands, and through passes.
 
2. Hone is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 6 to 12
inches over mainly windward and southeast facing slopes of the Big
Island, with locally higher amounts possible. Rainfall totals of 2
to 4 inches will be possible over portions of the smaller islands,
mainly windward.
 
3. Swells generated by Hone will continue today as this system 
continues westward. Expect dangerous conditions with 
life-threatening surf and rip currents.
