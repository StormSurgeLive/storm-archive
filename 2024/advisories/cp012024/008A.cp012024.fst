DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM HST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Hone was
located near latitude 17.5 North, longitude 151.3 West. Hone is
moving toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h). This motion slightly 
north of due west is expected to continue over the next several days
with a gradual decrease in forward speed. On the forecast track, the
center of Hone is expected to pass near or south of the Big Island
tonight into early Sunday.

Maximum sustained winds measured by Hurricane Hunter Aircraft are 
near 65 mph (105 km/h) with higher gusts. Strengthening is forecast 
during the next 48 hours, and Hone is expected to be a hurricane 
Sunday through Monday southwest of the Big Island of Hawaii.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Hone can be found in the Tropical 
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header TCDCP1 and WMO header WTPA41 
PHFO, and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/HFOTCDCP1.shtml.

WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area as
early as Saturday afternoon and continuing into Sunday. Winds are
expected to be strongest where they blow downslope from higher
terrain, over headlands, and through passes.

RAINFALL: Hone is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to
10 inches over mainly windward and southeast facing slopes of the
Big Island, with locally higher amounts possible. Rainfall totals
of 2 to 4 inches will be possible over portions of the smaller
islands, mainly windward.

SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Hone will begin
impact eastern portions of the Hawaiian Islands later tonight,
then spread to the remainder of the state through the rest of
the weekend. These swells will produce life-threatening surf and
rip currents.
