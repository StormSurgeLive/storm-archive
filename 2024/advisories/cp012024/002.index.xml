DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM HST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Hone was
located near latitude 15.9 North, longitude 142.2 West. Hone is
moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this

forecast track, the center of Hone is expected to pass near or 
south of the Big Island this weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Hone can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header TCDCP1 and WMO
header WTPA41 PHFO, and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/HFOTCDCP1.shtml.
 
RAINFALL: From Saturday through Monday, storm total rainfall
amounts of 4 to 8 inches, with locally higher amounts, are possible 
along windward areas of the Big Island of Hawaii, with 2 to 4 
inches possible over windward sections of the smaller islands.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Hone are expected to
begin reaching the Hawaiian Islands over the weekend. These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents. Please
consult products issued by the National Weather Service in
Honolulu, Hawaii.

Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number   2
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
1100 AM HST Thu Aug 22 2024
 
Subjective Dvorak intensity estimates ranged from 1.5 to 2.5 from 
PHFO, SAB and JTWC. The automated Dvorak techniques also show 
maximum winds of 30 to 35 kt. The Multi-Platform Tropical Cyclone 
Surface Wind analysis shows a small area 35 kts on the north side 
of the center. Combined with additional development and improved 
curved band structure of the convection over the past few hours, the 
system has been upgraded to Tropical Storm Hone.
 
The initial motion of Tropical Storm Hone is 290/12 knots, and this
general motion is expected to continue over the next several days
as it is steered by a subtropical ridge to the north.  A decrease
in forward speed, coupled with a slight turn towards the west-
northwest is expected around days 4 and 5 when the subtropical ridge
is forecast to start to weaken. The track forecast follows along
closely to the tightly clustered guidance consensus.
 
Hone is expected to remain in an environment of low to moderate
vertical wind shear, warm sea surface temperatures between 27 and
28C,  and in a sufficient area of deep layer moisture over the next
several days. This should support gradual strengthening as the
system moves in a steady westward direction. Late in the weekend
into early next week, the system will begin to encounter an increase
in westerly vertical wind shear, and possibly some drier mid-level 
air. This should lead to the gradual weakening of the system. The 
intensity forecast is close to the intensity consensus during the 
next several days, bringing the system up close to hurricane 
strength over the weekend, with the forecast lower than the 
consensus guidance by days 4 and 5.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Interests in the main Hawaiian Islands should monitor the 
progress of Tropical Storm Hone. Hone is forecast to pass near or 
south of the Big Island over the weekend, bringing the potential for 
heavy rainfall, gusty winds, and dangerous surf and rip currents. A 
Tropical Storm Watch may be required for portions of the main 
Hawaiian Islands tonight or Friday.
