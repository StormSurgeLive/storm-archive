Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  25
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
500 AM HST Wed Aug 28 2024
 
Convection redeveloped over the low-level circulation center 
(LLCC) of Hone shortly after the previous advisory, then collapsed a 
couple hours later allowing the LLCC to become exposed once again. 
It is clear the strong westerly vertical wind shear in excess 
of 40 knots is impeding any chance for intensification of this 
system at the moment. The  latest subjective Dvorak current 
intensity estimates remain between 2.5 (35 kt) and 3.5 (55 kt). 
In addition a 0845Z ASCAT pass showed several 40 to 45 kt wind 
barbs. As a result, the initial intensity has been held at 45 kt for 
this advisory.
 
Hone continues to move just north of due west or 280/8 kt. This
general motion is expected to continue during the next couple of
days as the cyclone is steered by a low to mid-level ridge to the
north. The motion is a bit more uncertain by the weekend as the
system begins to interact with a mid-level low near the
International Date Line. The track forecast calls for a slowing in
forward speed and a turn toward the northwest as a result of this
interaction. Little change was made to the official track forecast 
which closely follows a blend of the FSSE, TVCE, and HCCA consensus 
track guidance.
 
Strong westerly vertical wind shear of around 40 kt is forecast to
affect Hone during the next few days. This combined with dry
mid-level air surrounding the system should result in gradual
weakening despite the cyclone moving over increasingly warm sea
surface temperatures and higher ocean heat content. The intensity
forecast calls for slow weakening of the system, with Hone
forecast to become a post-tropical low on Friday, and dissipate by
Sunday. Little change was made to the intensity forecast which
remains closely aligned with a blend of the statistical and 
dynamical consensus aids.

Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number  43
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP072024
1100 AM HST Wed Aug 28 2024
 
The satellite presentation of Gilma has changed little since 
yesterday evening. Deep convection continues to pulse within the 
northern semicircle, periodically revealing an exposed low-level 
circulation. Subjective Dvorak estimates ranged from 2.0/30 kt from 
JTWC to 3.0/45 kt out of HFO, and CIMSS ADT recently came in at 33 
kt. Given an overnight ASCAT pass with many 40 kt wind retrievals 
and the pulsing nature of the convection, the initial intensity of 
Gilma for this advisory has been held at 40 kt, which could be 
generous.

Gilma's motion estimate remains unchanged at 280/12 kt. A low-level 
ridge north of Gilma will continue to steer the increasingly 
shallow cyclone toward the west to west-northwest until it 
dissipates near the Hawaiian Islands this weekend. The track 
forecast was changed very little from the prior advisory and lies in 
the middle of a tightly clustered guidance envelope near TVCN and 
HCCA.

Gilma is expected to gradually degenerate to a remnant low as it 
passes close to the Hawaiian Islands Friday and Saturday. With the 
system traversing under a broad col region aloft today, vertical 
wind shear is expected to relax by around 5 kt. Though SSTs along 
the track will remain marginal, around 25.5 to 26C, the reduced 
vertical wind shear could cause deep convection to briefly 
redevelop around the center in the short term. As Gilma approaches 
an upper level trough parked over Hawaii, vertical wind shear will 
increase tonight through Friday, which should cause the cyclone to 
weaken to a tropical depression sometime Thursday and a remnant low 
on Friday. The intensity forecast has been changed little from 
recent advisories, and is near HCCA and SHIPS on the weaker side of 
the guidance envelope beyond Thursday.
