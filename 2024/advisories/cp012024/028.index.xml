Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  28
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
1100 PM HST Wed Aug 28 2024
 
Deep convection continues to develop to the north and northeast of 
low-level circulation center of Hone this evening. The center had 
been fully exposed for most of the afternoon and early evening 
hours as the cyclone continues to get hammered by 40 to 45 kt 
of westerly vertical wind shear. The subjective Dvorak current 
intensity estimates from PHFO, JTWC, and SAB ranged from 2.0 (35 kt) 
to 3.0 (45 kt), while a 06z SATCON estimate from UW-CIMSS was 40 
kt. These estimates in combination with the ragged appearance of 
Hone support lowering the initial intensity to 40 kt for this 
advisory.

Hone continues to move west to west-northwest or 280/8 kt. This 
motion is expected to continue during the next 36 hours as the 
cyclone is steered by a low to mid-level ridge to the north. After 
36 hours, the cyclone will begin interacting with a developing mid- 
level low near the International Dateline. A turn toward the 
northwest with a decrease in forward speed is expected Friday and 
Friday night, followed by a more northerly motion and an increase in 
speed on Saturday. The cyclone is then expected to shift westerly 
Sunday through early next week as a mid-level ridge builds to the 
north of the system. The track forecast closely follows a blend of 
the multi-model consensus aids and is very close to the previous 
track forecast. This track takes Hone toward the northwest Hawaiian 
Islands over the weekend, where there is some potential for impacts 
to Kure, Midway, and Pearl and Hermes Atolls.

Hone will remain under the influence of strong westerly vertical 
wind shear of 35 to 45 knots and dry mid-level air during the next 
36 hours. This should lead to slight weakening of the cyclone with 
convection continuing to flare to the north and northeast of the 
low level center. Beyond 36 hours, vertical wind shear will 
gradually trend lower while mid-level moisture increases. This in 
combination with warm sea surface temperatures of 28 to 29 C and 
high ocean heat content should allow for some strengthening of the 
cyclone if it manages to survive the hostile environment it will be 
in through early Friday. The intensity forecast calls for little 
change in strength during the next 48 hours, followed by gradual 
strengthening through the end of the forecast period. This 
generally follows the intensity consensus guidance through the 
forecast period. Only minor adjustments were made to the previous 
intensity forecast through 48 hours, with a slight upward adjustment 
beyond due to the increasingly favorable environment expected 
around Hone.

...EXPECTED TO DISSIPATE NEAR KAUAI OVER THE WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM HST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.5N 149.5W
ABOUT 365 MI...585 KM E OF HILO HAWAII
ABOUT 560 MI...895 KM E OF HONOLULU HAWAII
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 280 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1007 MB...29.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM HST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gilma was
located near latitude 19.5 North, longitude 149.5 West. Gilma is
moving toward the west near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A continued motion
toward slightly north of due west will continue into Thursday,
followed by a turn toward the west-northwest on Friday as the
remnant low of Gilma passes near the Hawaiian Islands. Gilma is
expected to dissipate near Kauai on Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Continued weakening is expected, and Gilma is expected to weaken to
a remnant low late Thursday or Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center, mainly to the north of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number  45
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP072024
1100 PM HST Wed Aug 28 2024
 
A few thunderstorms have been able to develop in association with 
Gilma's circulation this evening, but they have been unable to 
either wrap around, or move over, the center. This pulsing 
disorganized convection is doing little to sustain Gilma as a 
tropical cyclone, while also leading to lowering subjective and 
objective Dvorak intensity estimates that range from 1.5/25 kt to 
2.5/35 kt. The initial intensity estimate for this advisory is 
maintained at 35 kt, primarily based on a 0643Z ASCAT pass that 
showed maximum winds of 32 kt. 

Gilma's forward motion remains a steady 280/12 kt. A low-level 
ridge north of the cyclone will continue to steer it just north of 
due west over the next day or so, with a turn toward the 
west-northwest expected Friday as the ridge weakens. Little change 
to the previous forecast track was made, as consensus track guidance 
remains well clustered. 

Water vapor imagery and shear analyses indicate that Gilma is 
moving into an area of increasing westerly vertical wind shear on 
the order of 20-30 kt, associated with a trough aloft approaching 
from the west. GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite imagery indicate 
that Gilma will only produce brief periods of deep convection over 
the next day or two, with Gilma gradually spinning down from its 
peak that occurred just a few days ago. Gilma will likely become a 
post-tropical remnant low on Thursday, continue gradually weakening 
as it moves close to Hawaii on Friday, then dissipate in the 
vicinity of Kauai early Saturday.
