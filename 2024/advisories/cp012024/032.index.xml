Tropical Depression Hone Discussion Number  32
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
1100 PM HST Thu Aug 29 2024
 
The low level circulation center (LLCC) of Hone remains exposed 
this evening, with sporadic deep convection occurring 60 to 120 nm 
northeast of it. Deep convection near the LLCC may develop later 
tonight as cloud tops cool, but the overall satellite presentation 
is of a system in decline. Subjective Dvorak satellite current 
intensity estimates were 2.0/30 kt from all three fix centers. The 
objective Dvorak estimate from UW/CIMSS of 32 kt aligns with these 
subjective estimates, and the intensity is set at 30 kt for this 
advisory, keeping Hone a tropical depression.
 
Hone's track shows signs of a slight jog northward, with a short-
term motion of 285 degrees at 6 kt. However, this system is still a 
bit to the left of the previous forecast track. As before, the 
forecast track philosophy revolves around likely interaction of the 
LLCC with an upper low north of Midway Atoll. This upper low is 
forecast to dig southward over the next couple of days and Hone is 
expected to be pulled northwestward toward it. After Hone's LLCC 
and the upper low become aligned, the tropical cyclone is expected 
to resume a west-northwest motion over the western Pacific. The 
track guidance envelope through 72 hours remains rather tight, which 
is a bit surprising given the complexity of the philosophy involved. 
The forecast track for this cycle has been adjusted a bit to the 
left of the previous one to account for 12 hour movement and to keep 
it within the guidance envelope, which has also been nudged a bit 
to the left. That said, the final track mirrors the previous 
track's north northwest turn through 48 hours followed by a 
resumption of west northwest motion afterwards.

Hone needs a healthy nocturnal convective bloom to begin 
reintensification. A very late-for-this-cycle surge seems to be 
starting along the northern flank of the LLCC. If Hone manages to 
survive its current battle with 45 kt of westerly shear, there may 
be an opportunity for reintensification. However, intensity models 
have become bearish on this possibility, with IVCN and HWRF showing 
modest intensification at best. As such, the intensity forecast 
has been lowered a bit beyond 60 hours while still allowing 
strengthening to a tropical storm again at 36 hours. It goes 
without saying that uncertainty remains high for track beyond 72 
hours and for intensity beyond 60 hours. Hone should cross the 
International Dateline as a mid-range tropical storm on Sunday, 
Hawaii time.

Remnants Of Gilma Discussion Number  48
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP072024
500 PM HST Thu Aug 29 2024
 
Convection that was once associated with Gilma is moving to the 
northeast in response to the westerly vertical wind shear in the 
region. Meanwhile, the surface remnants of Gilma continue to move 
to the west-northwest due to the low-level ridge to the north. A 
1958Z ASCAT pass showed the low-level center opening up to a trough, 
with subsequent satellite imagery supporting this analysis. The 
initial intensity has been lowered to 25 kt. The remnants of Gilma 
should continue to move to the west-northwest for the next couple of 
days.

This will be the final CPHC Advisory on this system. For additional 
information on this system, please see the National Weather 
Service's High Seas Forecast issued under AWIPS header HFOHSFNP and 
WMO header FZPN40 PHFO, and Offshore Forecast issued under AWIPS 
header HFOOFFHFO and WMO header FZHW60 PHFO.
