Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  23
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
500 PM HST Tue Aug 27 2024
 
Despite moderate to strong westerly shear, Hone continues to 
produce a cluster of strong convection just northeast of the 
low-level center.  The various subjective and objective satellite 
intensity estimates are currently ranging from 35-55 kt, and the 
initial intensity is kept at a possibly conservative 45 kt.

The cyclone continues to move west-northwestward of 285/9 kt. There 
is again little change to the track forecast philosophy, as flow 
around a low- to mid-level ridge to the north of the tropical 
cyclone should maintain this general motion for the next 2-3 days. 
There is little change to the track guidance from the previous 
advisory, and there is also little change to the forecast track.

Strong westerly shear of 40 kt should affect Hone for the next few 
days, and that combined with dry air entrainment should cause 
weakening.  Based on this and the intensity guidance, the new 
intensity forecast is similar to the previous forecast in calling 
for the cyclone to degenerate to a remnant low pressure area around 
60-72 h.  One change in the intensity forecast was to add a day as a 
remnant low in agreement with the global models.  It should be noted 
that Hone or its remnants could become involved with a large mid- to 
upper-level low near the International Dateline at about 120 h, with 
the global models showing a surface low in the area. Currently, it 
is not clear whether if this low is Hone or a new formation, and 
until there is more clarity, the forecast continues to show Hone 
dissipating by this time.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM HST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gilma was
located near latitude 18.5 North, longitude 144.5 West. Gilma is
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). A motion
between west and west-northwest is expected for the next few days,
and on the forecast track the remnants of Gilma should approach the
Hawaiian Islands on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Continued weakening is expected, and Gilma is expected to weaken to
a remnant low by Friday. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: The remnants of Gilma may bring heavy rainfall to
portions of the Hawaiian Islands as early as Friday, lasting

Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number  40
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP072024
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
500 PM HST Tue Aug 27 2024

Deep convection associated with Gilma has continued to decrease, 
with only a small cluster currently remaining in the southeastern 
quadrant.  The various subjective and objective satellite intensity 
estimates thus continue to indicate rapid weakening, with the range 
of intensities now from 35-55 kt.  Based on these estimates, the 
initial intensity is reduced to 45 kt in best agreement with the 
CIMSS satellite consensus.

Gilma should cross a tongue of colder sea surface temperatures 
during the next 12 h, and that, combined with increasing shear, 
should continue the current weakening. After that time, while the 
sea surface temperatures increase a little along the forecast track, 
even stronger shear and dry air entrainment should keep Gilma 
weakening.  The new intensity forecast calls for the system to 
degenerate to a remnant low by 48 h and to weaken to a trough 
between 72-96 h.

The initial motion is now 270/11 kt.  A ridge north of Gilma will
continue to steer the cyclone westward to west-northwestward until 
it dissipates.  There has been little change in the track guidance, 
and the new forecast track is similar to the previous track.
