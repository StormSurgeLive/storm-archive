DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM HST (1800 UTC), US Air Force weather reconnaisance 
aircraft determined the center of Tropical Storm Hone was
located near latitude 17.6 North, longitude 152.6 West. Hone is
moving toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h) and this motion is
expected to continue over the next several days with a gradual
decrease in forward speed. On this track, the center of Hone is
expected to pass near or south of the Big Island tonight into early
Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and
Hone is expected to be a hurricane Sunday through Monday southwest
of the Big Island of Hawaii.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Hone can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header TCDCP1 and WMO header WTPA41
PHFO, and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/HFOTCDCP1.shtml.
 
WIND: Tropical Storm conditions are expected on the Big Island,
beginning as early as this evening and continuing through early
Sunday. Winds are expected to be strongest downslope of higher
terrain, over headlands, and through passes.
 
RAINFALL: Hone is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to
10 inches over mainly windward and southeast facing slopes of the
Big Island, with locally higher amounts possible. Rainfall totals
of 2 to 4 inches will be possible over portions of the smaller
islands, mainly windward.
 
SURF: Surf associated with large swells generated by Hone will
quickly build today through Sunday as Hone continues westward.
Expect dangerous conditions with life-threatening surf and rip
currents.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Tropical Storm Hone Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number   9
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
500 AM HST Sat Aug 24 2024
 
Satellite imagery indicates that the appearance of Tropical Storm
Hone remains steady, with minimal changes in track or intensity
over the past 6 h. Deep convection and convective banding continue
to present a well-organized structure. Recent data from a U.S. Air
Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft showed maximum sustained
flight-level winds of 64 knots, which, after adjustment, reduces to
51 knots at the surface. SFMR winds were recorded at 59 knots.
Considering these observations, the initial intensity will be
maintained at 55 knots. The central pressure remains at 998 mb as
confirmed by dropsonde data.
 
The initial motion is set at 280/13. This general motion, slightly
north of due west, is expected to continue over the next several
days under the influence of a subtropical ridge to the north. Some
slowing of forward motion is anticipated as the ridge weakens
slightly. Hone is expected to pass near or just south of the Big
Island of Hawaii later today through early Sunday, where a Tropical
Storm Warning remains in effect. By the middle of next week, Hone
will likely become increasingly shallow as vertical wind shear
increases, allowing the low-level trade wind flow to steer the
system toward the west-southwest. The official forecast track is
nearly identical to the previous advisory, and closely follows the
tightly clustered consensus guidance.
 
Environmental conditions are expected to remain steady over the next
24 h, with sea surface temperatures between 26C and 27C, light to
moderate vertical wind shear, and marginally sufficient mid-level
moisture. Slow strengthening is expected to continue. Sea surface
temperatures are forecast to rise to around 27C beyond 24 h, and
oceanic heat content will become more favorable. This supports the
potential for Hone to reach hurricane strength from Sunday through
Monday. As Hone continues westward, increasing vertical wind shear
is likely to weaken the system later Monday through the middle of
next week. The intensity forecast is aligned with dynamical
consensus guidance.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. There is the potential for excessive rainfall and flash flooding
on portions of the Big Island of Hawaii starting this afternoon and
continuing through Sunday as a large area of moisture associated
with Hone moves through. The heaviest rainfall will likely occur
over windward and southeast facing slopes.
 
2. Tropical Storm conditions are expected on the Big Island,
beginning as early as this evening and continuing through early
Sunday. Winds are expected to be strongest downslope of higher
terrain, over headlands, and through passes.
 
3. Surf associated with large swells generated by Hone will quickly
build today through Sunday as Hone continues westward. Expect
dangerous conditions with life-threatening surf and rip currents.
