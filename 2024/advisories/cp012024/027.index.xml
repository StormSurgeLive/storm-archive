Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  27
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
500 PM HST Wed Aug 28 2024
 
This morning's burst of deep convection near the center of Hone has 
faded, and the low-level circulation center has become fully 
exposed again. Strong vertical shear continues to keep the tropical 
cyclone asymmetric with deep convection confined to the 
northeastern quadrant. The latest subjective Dvorak intensity 
estimates from PHFO, JTWC, and SAB again came in at 30 to 55 kt. The 
objective estimates were 28 to 40 kt. A nice ASCAT pass from late 
this morning showed several 45 kt wind barbs. The initial intensity 
for this advisory will be kept at 45 kt, and the 34 kt radii were 
also expanded slightly based on the scatterometer data.

Hone will remain over warm SSTs through the forecast period. 
Vertical shear will remain strong over the next 2 to 3 days. The 
main question will be whether or not the strong shear will result in 
post-tropical cyclone status within that time frame. GFS simulated 
IR data seems to favor the post-tropical scenario. The high-res 
hurricane models favor maintenance as a tropical cyclone. The ECMWF 
has pulsing but generally decreasing deep convection that could 
result in post-tropical cyclone status between 24 and 72 hours. For 
this advisory, Hone is now forecast to remain as a tropical cyclone 
through the forecast period in deference to the high-res models and 
considering that its current deep convection is stronger than the 
GFS/post-tropical solution valid for the current time. In terms of 
intensity, the forecast generally follows the consensus of the 
objective aids and shows slight initial weakening, then keeps Hone 
as a 40 kt system until 96 hours. This forecast of relatively 
steady intensity reflects the possibility that despite the strong 
shear, deep convection will continue to pulse enough to maintain 
its strength. At the end of the forecast period, Hone is forecast 
to intensify, with several models showing an increase to typhoon 
strength beyond 120 hours west of the International Date Line.

For this advisory, Hone's initial movement is 280/8 kt. The tropical 
cyclone is being steered by a weak low- to mid-level ridge to the 
north. This general motion is expected to continue over the next 
couple of days based on the tight clustering of the objective 
guidance. As Hone approaches the International Date Line, the 
tropical cyclone is forecast to interact with a developing low 
pressure system aloft, which will result in a turn toward the 
northwest. The various global models handle this interaction 
differently, resulting in greater spread in the objective guidance 
and greater uncertainty beyond 72 hours. Toward the end of the 
forecast period, there is a potential risk of impacts to Midway, 
Kure, and Pearl and Hermes Atolls.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM HST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gilma was
located near latitude 19.5 North, longitude 148.3 West. Gilma is
moving toward the west near 14 mph (22 km/h). A continued motion
toward slightly north of due west will continue into Thursday, 
followed by a turn toward the west-northwest on Friday as the 
remnant low of Gilma passes near the Hawaiian Islands.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Continued weakening is expected, and Gilma is expected to weaken to
a remnant low late Thursday or Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).

<title>Tropical Storm Gilma Forecast Discussion Number 44</title>

Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number  44
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP072024
500 PM HST Wed Aug 28 2024
 
Even though Gilma is in a low to moderate vertical wind shear 
environment, organized deep convection has failed to redevelop 
today, with only isolated thunderstorms forming in the northern 
semicircle. Subjective Dvorak estimates are down to 35 kt from HFO, 
30 kt from JTWC, and 25 kt from SAB, while CIMSS ADT came in at 33 
kt. Based on expected weakening due to a lack of convection and a 
blend of these inputs, the initial intensity has been lowered to 35 
kt for this advisory.

The forward motion of Gilma remains nearly unchanged during the 
last day at 280/12 kt. A low-level ridge north of Gilma will 
continue to steer the increasingly shallow cyclone toward slightly 
north of due west into Thursday, followed by a turn toward the 
west-northwest Friday until dissipation near the Hawaiian Islands 
this weekend. The official forecast track was nudged slightly north 
from the prior advisory due to an adjustment in center position and 
remains near the middle of a tightly clustered guidance envelope 
near the TVCE.

Gilma is expected to pass close to the Hawaiian Islands as it 
slowly degenerates to a remnant low late Thursday night or Friday. 
For the next 6 to 12 hours, Gilma will remain under a broad col 
aloft that will produce a low to moderate vertical wind shear 
environment of around 15 kt. This will likely be the only window for 
redevelopment of organized convection and for Gilma to maintain 
tropical storm intensity, even though SSTs will remain marginal, 
around 25.5 to 26C. As Gilma approaches an upper level trough 
building over Hawaii, vertical wind shear will increase late tonight 
through Friday, which should cause the cyclone to weaken to a 
tropical depression sometime Thursday and a remnant low Thursday 
night or Friday. The intensity forecast has been changed little from 
recent advisories, and is near the statistical guidance and ICON 
near the middle of the guidance envelope.
