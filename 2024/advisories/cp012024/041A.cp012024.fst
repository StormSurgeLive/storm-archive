At 800 AM HST (1800 UTC), the broad mean center of elongating 
Tropical Storm Hone and an extratropical low was located near 
latitude 25.3 North, longitude 178.3 West. Hone is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). This general motion with 
a decrease in forward speed is expected today as Hone merges with

forward speed is expected to resume on Monday. On the forecast 
track, Hone, or the extratropical low associated with Hone, will be 
passing near or just west of Kure Atoll near the International Date 
Line late Monday or Monday night.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast during the next 48
hours.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
