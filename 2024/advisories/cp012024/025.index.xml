<title>Tropical Storm Hone Forecast Discussion Number 24</title>

Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  24
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
1100 PM HST Tue Aug 27 2024
 
The low-level circulation center of Hone became exposed earlier
this evening, due to increasingly strong westerly vertical wind
shear of around 35 knots. Even though the LLCC is displaced to the
west of the persistent deep convection, the latest subjective
Dvorak current intensity estimates remain between 2.5 (35 kt) and
3.5 (55 kt). As a result, the initial intensity has been held at 45
kt for this advisory.
 
Hone continues to move just north of due west or 280/9 kt. This 
general motion is expected to continue during the next couple of 
days as the cyclone is steered by a low to mid-level ridge to the 
north. The motion is a bit more uncertain by the weekend as the
system begins to interact with a mid-level low near the
International Date Line. The track forecast calls for a slowing in
forward speed and a turn toward the northwest as a result of this
interaction. Little change was made to the track forecast during
the next couple days, followed by a nudge to the north over the
weekend to better align with the latest dynamical and consensus 
guidance.
 
Strong westerly vertical wind shear of around 40 kt is forecast to
affect Hone during the next few days. This combined with dry
mid-level air surrounding the system should result in gradual
weakening despite the cyclone moving over increasingly warm sea
surface temperatures and higher ocean heat content. The intensity 
forecast calls for slow weakening of the system, with Hone 
forecast to become a post-tropical low by Friday, and dissipate on 
Sunday. Little change was made to the intensity forecast which 
remains closely aligned with the latest intensity consensus 
guidance.

Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number  41
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP072024
1100 PM HST Tue Aug 27 2024
 
 
Infrared satellite imagery shows new deep convection in Gilma's 
northeast quadrant this evening, with cloud tops colder than -70 
deg C. These thunderstorms have been unable to wrap around the 
center of the cyclone due to strong westerly winds aloft. The 
advisory intensity estimate is held at 45 kt based on a consensus 
of subjective Dvorak estimates of 3.0/45 kt from PHFO, JTWC and 
SAB. 

Gilma continues to move almost due west, and the initial motion 
estimate is 275/11 kt. A low-level ridge north of Gilma will 
steer the shallow cyclone westward to west-northwestward until it 
dissipates. There has been little change in the track guidance, and 
the new forecast track is similar to the previous track, and lies 
close to HCCA and FSSE guidance.

Although Gilma's recent rapid weakening trend has eased this 
evening, it is still expected to degenerate to a remnant low as it 
passes close to the Hawaiian Islands Friday and Saturday. Only 
slight changes to the intensity forecast have been made, mainly to 
keep Gilma at minimal tropical storm strength for a bit longer than 
previously indicated. Guidance indicates the strong westerly 
vertical wind shear currently impacting Gilma's circulation may 
briefly ease Wednesday as a passing trough aloft lifts north. 
Another trough aloft approaching from the west is expected to bring 
even stronger vertical wind shear Thursday and Friday, eventually 
leading to dissipation near Hawaii this weekend. The new intensity 
forecast follows trends presented by regional hurricane guidance and 
SHIPS guidance.
