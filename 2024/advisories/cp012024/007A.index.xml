Interests elsewhere in Hawaii should monitor the progress of Hone.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by the National Weather Service office in
Honolulu Hawaii.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM HST (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Hone was
located near latitude 17.2 North, longitude 149.9 West. Hone is
moving toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h). This motion toward the
west is expected to continue over the next several days as the
forward speed gradually slows. On the forecast track, the center of
Hone is expected to pass near or south of the Big Island Saturday
night into early Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and may
become a hurricane by Sunday, followed by weakening late Sunday and
beyond.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Hone can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header TCDCP1 and WMO
header WTPA41 PHFO, and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/HFOTCDCP1.shtml.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area as
early as Saturday afternoon and continuing into Sunday. Winds are
expected to be strongest where they blow downslope from higher
terrain, over headlands, and through passes.
 
RAINFALL: Hone is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to
10 inches over mainly windward and southeast facing slopes of the
Big Island, with locally higher amounts possible. Rainfall totals
of 2 to 4 inches will be possible over portions of the smaller
islands, mainly windward.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Hone will move across
waters around the eastern end of the Hawaiian Islands on Saturday,
mainly near the Big Island of Hawaii. The large swells will spread
across the other portions of the island chain Saturday night and
Sunday, producing life-threatening surf and rip currents.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 1100 PM HST.

<title>Tropical Storm Hone Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number   7
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
500 PM HST Fri Aug 23 2024
 
The U.S. Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft sampled 
Tropical Storm Hone from this morning into early afternoon and 
provided valuable data. In spite of its lack of convection, Hone 
maintained a well-developed low cloud field and remained 
surprisingly intense through the morning, well above Dvorak inputs 
from the fix agencies. Late this afternoon, deep convection is 
redeveloping near the center as winds aloft ease. The latest data 
from the Hurricane Hunters came in just before 00Z and showed 
maximum sustained winds holding at 45 kt and a minimum sea level 
pressure of 1000 mb. Given the appearance of Hone, these values 
will be used for the initial intensity.

The initial motion is unchanged at 280/14. This general motion 
toward slightly north of due west will continue during the next 
several days as Hone is steered by a deep subtropical ridge to the 
north. However, some slowing of the forward motion is anticipated 
as the deep ridge to the north of Hone weakens slightly. Along this 
track, Hone will be passing near or just south of the state late 
Saturday into early Sunday, which necessitates the issuance of a 
Tropical Storm Warning for the Big Island of Hawaii. By the middle 
of next week, Hone will likely become increasingly shallow as 
vertical wind shear increases, allowing the low level trade wind 
flow to steer the system toward the west. The official forecast 
track is nearly identical to the previous advisory, and closely 
follows the tightly clustered consensus guidance near the TVCN.

Hone has a window for intensification during the next 36 to 48 
hours. Easterly winds aloft, which have inhibited outflow in all 
but the south and southwest quadrants, will relax tonight and 
Saturday as a weakness develops in the upper level ridge north of 
the cyclone. Sea surface temperatures will remain around 26-27C, 
which will be sufficient for intensification, possibly to hurricane 
strength, late Saturday or early Sunday. Late Sunday and Monday, 
west to northwest vertical wind shear will increase sharply, which 
should result in steady weakening. The intensity forecast remains 
on the higher side of the guidance envelope near the HCCA and 
slightly higher than the IVCN. Beyond 48 hours, the forecast closely 
follows the IVCN.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. There is the potential for excessive rainfall and flash flooding
on portions of the Big Island of Hawaii starting later Saturday 
and continuing through Sunday as a large area of moisture 
associated with Hone moves over parts of the Hawaiian Islands. The 
heaviest rainfall will likely occur over windward and southeast 
facing slopes.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible on the Big Island later
Saturday into Sunday. Winds are expected to be strongest where they
blow downslope from higher terrain, over headlands, and through
passes.
 
3. Swell generated by Hone is expected to reach the Hawaiian
islands Saturday night into Sunday. This swell could cause
life-threatening surf and rip currents. Listen for later advisories
and possible warnings from the National Weather Service.
