Remnants Of Hector Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082024
200 AM PDT Thu Aug 29 2024
 
An overnight scatterometer pass showed that the low-level center of 
Hector has opened up into a trough.  There remains a limited area 
of shallow convection displaced over 250 n mi from the remnants of 
the center.  The initial intensity has been reduced to 30 kt based 
on the ASCAT data.  The remnants of Hector should continue to move 
generally westward for the next couple of days.

This is the final NHC advisory for Hector.  For additional 
information on this system, please see High Seas Forecasts issued by 
the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO 
header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
