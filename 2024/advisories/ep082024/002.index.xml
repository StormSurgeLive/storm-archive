toward the west near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A westward to 
west-northwestward motion at a similar forward speed is expected
during the next several days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 105 mph (165 km/h)

the next couple of days, Gilma is forecast to remain a hurricane as 
it approaches the central Pacific basin.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles
(110 km).

Hurricane Gilma Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
500 PM HST Sun Aug 25 2024
 
Gilma is a compact hurricane with a small eye noted in both
infrared satellite imagery and a recent 0039 UTC SSMIS microwave
overpass. The microwave imagery showed that the convection
associated with Gilma has eroded over the southern semicircle,
likely due to an increase in shear and dry air intrusion.  The
initial intensity has been lowered to 90 kt, which is a blend of
the latest objective and subjective intensity estimates.  It should
be noted that the range of the satellite intensity estimates is
atypically large and is around 75 kt on the low side to around 
100 kt at the upper end.
 
Westerly shear over Gilma is forecast to increase to moderate
levels during the next 24 hours, and this along with nearby dry
mid-level air and slightly lower SSTs are expected to cause gradual
weakening during the next couple of days.  Around 72 hours a more
substantial increase in vertical wind shear is anticipated and this
should result in a faster rate of weakening.  The global models
suggest the system is likely to struggle to produce organized
deep convection by day 4, and Gilma is forecast to become a
post-tropical cyclone around that time.
 
Gilma has been moving just north of due west (275/8 kt) during the
past 12 hours.  A mid-level ridge to the north of Gilma should
continue to steer the storm on a westward to west-northwestward
heading throughout much of this week.  The track guidance is in
good agreement during the next 48-72 hours, but there is greater
spread in Gilma's forward speed at days 4 and 5.  This is related 
to how long Gilma remains vertically coherent.  The models that 
weaken the cyclone more quickly favor a faster forward speed later 
in the forecast period. The NHC track forecast is a little faster 
at 96 and 120 h to be closer to the latest consensus aids. 
Otherwise, the new track forecast is essentially an update of
the previous official forecast.

Tropical Storm Hector Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082024
500 PM HST Sun Aug 25 2024
 
Hector remains a sheared tropical storm this evening.  Recent
microwave imagery from AMSR2 and GMI showed the low-level
circulation on the northern edge of the deep convection, with a rain
band extending to the south.  Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB
were T3.0/45-kt and T2.5/35-kt, respectively.  The initial
intensity remains at 40 kt, representing a blend of these estimates.
 
The storm is moving along the southern side of mid-level ridge at an
estimated 275/10 kt.  The ridge should be the dominant steering
feature for the majority of the forecast period, and Hector should
generally move westward to west-northwestward through the end of
the week. There is a bit of along-track spread in the model
guidance, with the European model suggesting a faster forward
motion compare to the American global and regional models.  The
latest track forecast is slightly slower than the previous
prediction and close to the corrected consensus aid, HCCA.
 
Environmental conditions should allow for gradual strengthening over
the next couple of days.  The deep-layer vertical wind shear is
expected to be light-to-moderate with sufficiently warm sea surface
temperatures along the forecast track.  By mid-week, most global
models show drier mid-level air wrapping around the circulation and
increasing vertical wind shear. These conditions, and possibly the
cold wake of Hurricane Gilma, should lead to steady weakening and
most guidance shows Hector losing its deep convection by the end of
forecast period.  The NHC intensity prediction is similar to
earlier advisory, but now shows Hector as a remnant low by day 5.
The forecast lies near the high end of the model guidance envelope,
closest to the regional model HWRF.
