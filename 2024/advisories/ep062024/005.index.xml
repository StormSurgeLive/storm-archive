Tropical Storm Fabio Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
800 AM MST Tue Aug 06 2024
 
Fabio has remained steady this morning despite its close proximity 
to Tropical Storm Emilia. Cold cloud-top temperatures associated 
with the central dense overcast area that developed overnight have 
persisted this morning. Further, subjective and objective intensity 
estimates from TAFB and UW-CIMSS continue to suggest that Fabio is 
holding its own. Based on these estimates and recent satellite 
trends, the initial intensity estimate is held steady at 55 kt.

Fabio's initial motion is estimated to be west-northwestward or
300/15 kt. Uncertainty remains among the track guidance solutions, 
particularly related to the interaction between Fabio and Emilia. 
The current forecast favors the ECMWF solution that Emilia will 
absorb Fabio, and the current forecast shows this merger occurring 
in about 36 hours. However, the GFS shows two cyclones that remain 
distinct and rotate around each other during the next three to four 
days.  The current forecast leans toward a merger and is similar to 
the prior advisory and better-performing consensus aids.

While Fabio remains in a favorable shear and thermodynamic 
environment, the proximity to Emilia should preclude significant 
strengthening.  The new NHC intensity forecast now shows Fabio 
remaining steady for the next 24 h before weakening slightly and 
subsequently merging into Emilia. This is close to the IVCN and 
HCCA consensus aids. However, based on the divergent solutions in 
the global models, a change in the forecast philosophy could be
required in subsequent advisories.

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
800 AM PDT Tue Aug 06 2024
 
Following a burst of deep convection near the center of circulation 
overnight, Emilia has remained steady this morning. Scatterometer 
data overnight showed a well-organized circulation, and a 
combination of subjective Dvorak estimates and objective intensity 
estimates indicate that the intensity has not changed much since 
the prior advisory. Thus, the intensity is held at 55 kt for this 
advisory.
 
Emilia has begun a turn toward the west-northwest, but the 
motion remains an uncertain 300/5 kt. Emilia and Tropical 
Storm Fabio are in the midst of a complex interaction, which will 
determine the fate of both storms. The systems are forecast to 
rotate slightly around each other, prior to Emilia becoming the 
dominant storm. Of note is that the global GFS and ECMWF ensemble 
systems show different solutions, with the GFS solution keeping 
Emilia and Fabio more distinct. The current advisory leans toward 
Emilia becoming dominant, absorbing Fabio, and turning westward over 
the next several days. The current forecast is similar to the prior 
forecast and near the consensus models.
 
The interaction with Fabio makes the intensity forecast 
challenging. The current forecast favors the solution in which 
Emilia absorbs Fabio in a few days. Thus, steady intensification is 
forecast over the next 24 h, with Emilia reaching hurricane 
strength on Wednesday.  While the timing of the merger is uncertain, 
the storm is forecast to gradually weaken into a remnant low by the 
end of the forecast period as it moves over cooler ocean waters and 
into a generally less favorable environment.  Due to the 
uncertainty associated with the interaction with Tropical Storm 
Fabio, changes to Emilia's forecast could be necessary in later 
advisory packages.
