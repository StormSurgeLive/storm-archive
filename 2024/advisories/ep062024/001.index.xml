Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 AM PDT Mon Aug 5 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Carlotta, on Tropical Storm Daniel, and on Tropical Storm <br/>
Emilia, all located well offshore of the coast of Mexico.  <br/>
<br/>
South of Southwestern Mexico (EP96):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure <br/>
located a few hundred miles south of southwestern Mexico continue to <br/>
show signs of organization. Overnight satellite-derived wind data <br/>
indicated that the system did not yet have a well-defined <br/>
circulation.  However, satellite imagery since that time suggests <br/>
that the system may have become better organized since that time. A <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form today or tonight while the <br/>
system moves generally west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph, remaining <br/>
well offshore of the coast of Mexico. For more information on this <br/>
system, including Gale Warnings, see High Seas Forecasts issued by <br/>
the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
Public Advisories on Tropical Storm Emilia are issued under  <br/>
WMO header WTPZ35 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCPEP5. <br/>
Forecast/Advisories on Tropical Storm Emilia are issued under <br/>

Tropical Storm Fabio Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
800 AM MST Mon Aug 05 2024
 
Satellite imagery this morning indicates that the disturbance 
located well southwest of the southwestern coast of Mexico has 
continued to become better organized, and that it now has sufficient 
convection and a well-enough defined circulation to be considered a 
tropical cyclone.  With an initial intensity of 35 kt based on 
earlier scatterometer data, advisories are being initiated on 
Tropical Storm Fabio.

The initial motion is a somewhat uncertain 310/10.  Fabio's motion 
should be dominated by interaction with Tropical Storm Emilia to 
the west, with Fabio expected to move northwestward and westward at 
an increased forward speed around the north side of Emilia through 
the next 48 h.  

The intensity forecast is based on the global model forecasts 
that Fabio will wind up being absorbed into Emilia in the not 
too distant future.  Some strengthening is expected during the next 
12-24 h.  After that, the global models are forecasting that Fabio 
will dissipate as it is absorbed into Emilia by the 60 h point.  
The intensity forecast and dissipation time lean toward the GFS and 
Canadian model solutions, which keep Fabio separate from Emilia 
through about 48 h.  This forecast is low confidence due to the 
possibility that Fabio could try to absorb Emilia.

located near latitude 20.4 North, longitude 127.2 West. Carlotta is 
moving toward the west near 9 mph (15 km/h). This general motion 
with a slight decrease in forward speed is expected today. A 
west-southwestward motion is expected on Tuesday until Carlotta 
dissipates.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours. Weakening is 
expected. Carlotta could become a post-tropical low at any time and 
is forecast to dissipate near the middle of this week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).

Tropical Storm Carlotta Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024

If not for a recent small burst of convection nearly 60 n mi from 
its center, Carlotta would be devoid of organized deep convection. 
The intensity estimate remains 40 kt, close to a recent UW-CIMSS 
SATCON estimate. Deep convection may persist today, but could cease 
at just about any time due to cold waters beneath Carlotta and a 
surounding dry and stable environment. By this time tomorrow, 
Carlotta should be a post-tropical cyclone.

Carlotta's initial motion remains 280/8kt. This general motion 
should continue today as long as Carlotta maintains some deep 
convection. A slight left turn toward the west-southwest should 
begin once the last of Carlotta's convection is gone. No significant 
changes were made to the NHC track or intensity forecasts.

Tropical Storm Daniel Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042024
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024
 
Daniel's organization continues to decrease, and it has become 
difficult to distinguish Daniel from the surrounding ITCZ/Monsoon 
Trough convection. Subjective and objective intensity estimates 
vary around 30-35 kt, so the initial intensity remains 35 kt 
for this advisory. 

It is very hard to determine how well-defined Daniel's surface 
circulation is, so its possible that the cyclone is already near 
dissipation, but this will be easier to determine after the sun has 
been up over Daniel for longer. Regardless, the system should not 
be around as a tropical cyclone for much longer as it is quickly 
moving into a more hostile environment. Some intensity models, 
including the GFS, indicate Daniel could dissipate as soon as 
this afternoon. Even if it maintains its circulation for a few 
days, all models suggest it will lose deep convection by tomorrow 
evening and become a remnant low.

Daniel has accelerated slightly toward the east-northeast, and 
should continue heading in that direction today, within low- to 
mid-level southwesterly monsoonal flow. After that, dynamical models 
continue to indicate that Daniel or its remnants will bend 
northward, and then westward, around the outer circulation of 
Carlotta. The NHC forecast continues to closely follow the consensus 
models and is very similar to the previous advisory.

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
800 AM MST Mon Aug 05 2024

Satellite imagery shows that Emilia remains a sheared cyclone this 
morning, with the low-level center located near the northeastern 
edge of a large convective mass with cloud tops to near -85C.  The 
various subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates have 
nudged upward to the 35-40 kt range, and the initial intensity is 
set at 40 kt.

The latest global model runs continue to suggest that Emilia will be 
the survivor in interaction with the newly formed Tropical Storm 
Fabio to the east, and the intensity forecast is based on this 
scenario and the expectation of continued moderate easterly shear.  
The forecast follows the trend of the intensity guidance and 
forecasts a peak intensity of 60 kt in 48 h.  After that time, 
Emilia is expected to slowly weaken as it moves over decreasing sea 
surface temperatures.  The new forecast is basically an update of 
the previous forecast.  It should be noted that this forecast is low 
confidence due to the possibility that Fabio might still end up as 
the dominant cyclone.

Interaction with Fabio should steer Emilia south-southwestward to 
southward for the next 12 h or so.  After that, a turn toward the 
northwest or north-northwest with an increase in forward speed is 
expected as Emilia start to absorb Fabio.  After Fabio dissipates in 
about 60 h, Emilia should generally move west-northwestward on the 
south side of a low- to mid-level ridge to the north.  The first 96 
h of the forecast track have been adjusted somewhat based on the GFS 
and Canadian model forecasts of the interaction between Emilia and 
Fabio.
