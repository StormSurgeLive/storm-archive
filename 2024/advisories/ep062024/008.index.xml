Tropical Storm Fabio Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
200 AM PDT Wed Aug 07 2024
 
Thunderstorms associated with Fabio collapsed overnight and small 
bursts of convection are forming to the northeast of the exposed 
center.  Objective and subjective Dvorak estimates have trended 
weaker this cycle, and the initial intensity is lowered to 40 kt. 
The storm is racing off to the west at 280/21 kt.  Fabio should turn 
toward the west-southwest later today as the cyclone moves closer to 
Tropical Storm Emilia.  The official track forecast is unchanged 
from the previous advisory.
 
Vertical wind shear and cooling sea surface temperatures should
continue to weaken Fabio.  Global models are still showing the
vortex being absorbed into Emilia's circulation in a day or so.
The intensity forecast has been nudged downward slightly from the
earlier prediction due to the weaker initial intensity.
Dissipation is still expected on Thursday.

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
200 AM PDT Wed Aug 07 2024
 
Emilia has been holding steady tonight.  Deep convection continues 
to regularly pulse near the center, and a long curved band extends 
to the southwest.  Objective and subjective intensity estimates 
range between 48 and 65 kt.  The initial intensity is held at 55 kt 
for the advisory cycle to represent an average of the various 
estimates.

The storm is moving at an estimated 330/14 kt.  A gradual turn to 
the northwest and west-northwest with an increased forward speed is 
expected over the next day or so as Emilia moves along the southwest 
periphery of a mid-level ridge.  After Emilia absorbs Fabio, a 
slower forward motion to the west-northwest is forecast.  By the end 
of the forecast period, the weakened storm should turn westward in 
the low-level flow.  Only minor changes have been made to the latest 
track forecast, which lies between the various consensus aids.

Emilia is still embedded in an area of moderate deep-layer vertical 
wind shear.  While the shear is forecast to diminish over the next 
24 h, the tropical storm should be crossing the 26 degree Celsius 
isotherm later today.  By Thursday, Emilia is expected to absorb 
Tropical Storm Fabio, located to its north.  As Emilia moves over 
the cooling sea surface temperatures and into a dry and stable 
environment, the storm should steadily weaken and is now forecast to 
lose its organized, deep convection within 72 h.  The NHC prediction 
now shows Emilia becoming a remnant low by Saturday.
