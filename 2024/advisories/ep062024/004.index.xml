Tropical Storm Fabio Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
200 AM MST Tue Aug 06 2024
 
Fabio has become better organized this evening.  The satellite 
presentation reveals a developing deep convective band wrapping 
around the southern portion of the cyclone, and a small Central 
Dense Overcast (CDO) with cold cloud tops of -83C that appears to be 
forming over the surface center.  A blend of the Dvorak satellite 
and UW-CIMSS objective intensity estimates, and a recent SATCON 
intensity analysis yields 55 kt for this advisory.
 
A low shear and moist thermodynamic environment should allow Fabio 
to strengthen before the cyclone directly interacts and becomes 
absorbed by Emilia.  The deterministic guidance also shows an 
upper-level low moving toward Fabio from the northeast and producing 
favorable upper diffluent flow over the northeast portion of the 
cyclone.  The new NHC intensity forecast is a bit above the previous 
one and now shows Fabio's peak intensity at 60 kt, which is close to 
the IVCN and HCCA consensus aids.  It's worth noting, however, that 
the initialization of the two tropical cyclones in the GFS seems to 
be the most reasonable based on the structure and intensity of both 
cyclones.  Therefore, a change in the forecast philosophy may be 
deemed necessary in subsequent advisories.
 
Fabio's initial motion is estimated to be west-northwestward or 
295/15 kt.  The global models show that Fabio will move between 
Emilia to the west-southwest and a mid-tropospheric ridge extending 
from the west Gulf of Mexico to the southern Baja California 
Peninsula during the next couple of days.  The models also generally 
agree that Emilia will capture and absorb Fabio, but the exact 
timing for which this will occur is in some doubt. The 
ECMWF/CMC/UKMET and the COAMPS-TC show this evolution taking place 
within 36 hours, while the GFS run indicates the two tropical 
cyclones cyclonically orbiting around each other during the next 
three to four days.  The best solution at this time is to show a 
similar scenario to the previous advisory and hedge toward the 
better-performing consensus guidance with Fabio becoming absorbed by 
Emilia by mid-week.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Carlotta Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
Issued by NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI
800 PM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024

Remaining deep convection associated with Carlotta has been
intermittent and distant from the fully exposed circulation center.
This is not surprising considering that Carlotta is moving over sea
surface temperatures near 24C with vertical shear near 30 kt. 
Initial intensity estimates ranged from the ADT's 25 kt to CIMSS 
SATCON's 36 kt. The initial intensity for this advisory has been 
held at 35 kt based on the SATCON estimate.
 
While there may be intermittent flare-ups of deep convection over
the next day or so, reintensification under these environmental
conditions is not likely. As a result, Carlotta has been declared a
post-tropical cyclone. The remnant circulation of Carlotta
should continue to spin down and the global and hi-res hurricane
models open up the circulation into a trough around the middle of
the week.
 
This is the last advisory on this system. For additional information
on the post-tropical cyclone, please see the High Seas Forecasts
issued by the National Weather Service under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI,
WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php

Remnants Of Daniel Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042024
800 PM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024
 
Earlier today, GOES Proxy-Vis satellite imagery and microwave
overpasses had indicated that Daniel's surface circulation center
had become less defined, and this afternoon's scatterometer pass
showed a poorly defined surface swirl and possibly open in the
north quadrant.  Since that time, the satellite presentation shows
that the cyclone has opened up into a trough while embedded within
the persistent southwesterly monsoonal flow.  Accordingly, this is
the last NHC Advisory on this system.

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
800 PM MST Mon Aug 05 2024

Earlier ASCAT data showed that Emilia was likely a 45 kt tropical 
storm around 18Z, with an exposed low-level center located just 
outside of and to the northeast of the convective overcast area, 
due to moderate northeasterly shear.  Since that time, the 
low-level center appears to have moved toward the edge of the 
convective mass.  However infrared satellite imagery shows that some 
of the cloud tops in the convective area have warmed slightly during 
that time.  The latest subjective Dvorak estimates are 45 kt from 
TAFB and 35 kt from SAB.  Recent objective intensity estimates from 
CIMSS range from 34 to 42 kt.  Based on all the data and satellite 
imagery, the 45 kt intensity is unchanged from the previous NHC 
advisory.
 
The latest global model runs continue to forecast that Emilia will 
be the survivor in its interaction with Tropical Storm Fabio to the 
east, and the merger is forecast to happen on Wednesday or Wednesday 
night.  In the short term, moderate northeasterly shear is forecast 
to continue over Emilia.  Due to the moderate shear, only modest 
strengthening is forecast, and no change is made to the previous NHC 
peak intensity forecast of 55 kt.  After Emilia absorbs Fabio in 
about 48 h, Emilia is forecast to move over less than 26C SSTs, 
which should cause weakening.  Emilia is forecast to weaken below 
tropical storm strength by day 4, and will continue to spin down 
after that as it moves over progressively colder water.  Confidence 
in this forecast is increasing due to the more consistent model 
guidance that Emilia will absorb Fabio and not the other way around.

Emilia is currently moving very slowly toward the west-southwest.  
A turn toward the northwest or north-northwest with an increase in 
forward speed is expected Tuesday, and Emilia is expected to absorb 
Fabio on Wednesday.  After Fabio dissipates in about 48 h, Emilia 
should generally move west-northwestward on the south side of a low- 
to mid-level ridge to the north, with this general motion expected 
for the remainder of the forecast period.  Only very minor changes 
were made to the previous NHC track forecast.
