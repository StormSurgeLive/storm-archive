Post-Tropical Cyclone Fabio Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
200 PM PDT Wed Aug 07 2024
 
This afternoon's satellite presentation shows that Fabio has 
succumbed to the increasingly harsh surrounding environment.  Only a 
poorly defined surface circulation of low cloud elements is what 
remains of the tropical cyclone.  Therefore, Fabio no longer meets 
the definition of a tropical cyclone, and this will be the last NHC 
advisory.  The post-tropical cyclone's initial intensity is reduced 
to 35 kt, based on the TAFB and SAB satellite intensity estimates.  
Further weakening is forecast in the short term before merging with 
Emilia on Thursday.
 
Fabio's initial motion is estimated to be southwestward or
225/14 kt and this general motion is expected to continue through
tonight, while it moves around the western periphery of Emilia's
circulation and eventually merges with Emilia on Thursday, or
sooner.
 
For additional information on the post-tropical cyclone please see
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under
AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN03 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
800 AM PDT Wed Aug 07 2024
 
Conventional satellite imagery and a recent SSMI/S microwave 
overpass indicate that Emilia has become better organized this 
morning.  The northeasterly shear impeding the system's northeast 
quadrant has decreased, allowing for improved outflow aloft.  A 
Central Dense Overcast (CDO) with cloud tops of -88C has formed over 
the surface center, and the microwave image revealed a banding eye 
feature wrapping from the south side of the cyclone.  The satellite 
intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB are 65 kt and 55 kt, 
respectively, and a recent SATCON analysis indicated 57 kt.  Based 
on a blend of these data, the initial intensity is raised to 60 kt.
 
Although the northeasterly deep-layer shear that has been inhibiting 
Emilia's growth has subsided, the cyclone is expected to move over 
decreasing oceanic surface temperatures later today while the 
thermodynamic environment becomes less conducive.  Therefore, 
weakening is expected to commence by Thursday morning.  By the 
48-hour period, Emilia should spin down and degenerate into a 
post-tropical remnant low, and this is in agreement with the 
deterministic models and the statistical hurricane intensity 
guidance.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be northwestward, or 320/15 kt.  
A gradual turn to the west-northwest with a slower forward speed is 
expected on Thursday while the cyclone moves around the southwest 
periphery of a mid-tropospheric subtropical high.  Toward the end of 
the period, vertically shallow Emilia is expected to turn toward the 
west within the low-level trade wind flow and eventually open up 
into a trough around day 5.  Only slight along-track adjustments 
were made to this forecast, closely following the various consensus 
aids.
