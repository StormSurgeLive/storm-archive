Tropical Storm Fabio Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
200 PM MST Tue Aug 06 2024
 
Fabio is showing indications of slight weakening this afternoon, 
possibly associated with its continued close proximity to Tropical 
Storm Emilia. Cloud-top temperatures have warmed, and visible 
satellite imagery indicates that the center has become partially 
exposed on the west side of the storm. Subjective and objective 
intensity estimates from TAFB and UW-CIMSS, respectively, also 
suggest that Fabio has weakened slightly. Based on these estimates 
and recent satellite trends, the initial intensity estimate is 
decreased to 50 kt for this advisory. 

Fabio's initial motion is estimated to be west-northwestward or 
300/18 kt. The uncertainty in the track forecast remains higher than 
usual, due to the ongoing interaction between Fabio and Emilia. The 
current forecast favors that Emilia will absorb Fabio, as shown by 
the GFS and the ECMWF.  The forecast timing of Fabio's demise is in 
between the GFS and ECMWF solutions.  The GFS holds onto Fabio 
about a day longer than the ECMWF solution. The current forecast is 
slightly to the north of the prior forecast and similar to the 
best-performing consensus aids TVCN and HCCA. 

It appears that the upper-level outflow from Emilia is impacting 
Fabio, and this should preclude significant strengthening. None of 
the better performing intensity guidance aids indicate significant 
strengthening, and the new NHC forecast now shows Fabio weakening 
steadily before merging with Emilia. This solution is close to the 
IVCN and HCCA consensus models, as well as the prior forecast. 
However, given the track forecast uncertainty, a change in the 
forecast philosophy is not out of the question for subsequent 
advisories.

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
200 PM PDT Tue Aug 06 2024

Satellite imagery shows curved banding that has become slightly more 
impressive over the past 6 h, and there are signs that the RMW may 
have contracted a bit.  Emilia has a much healthier appearance on 
satellite imagery compared to Fabio, which is currently centered 
about 320 miles to the north-northeast of Emilia.  The latest 
subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB range from 55-65 kt, 
and the latest reliable objective intensity estimates from CIMSS 
range from 48 to 59 kt.  The intensity is held at 55 kt for this 
advisory, but this estimate could be slightly conservative.

Emilia is moving slowly northwestward, or 325/3-kt.  The northerly 
flow to the west of Fabio is keeping Emilia's forward speed slow for 
now.  However, as Fabio moves farther west over the next day or so, 
Emilia will accelerate to the northwest.  The confidence in the 
track forecast is below average due to the complex interaction with 
Fabio.  The latest forecast was adjusted slightly to the right and 
slightly slower than the previous official forecast for about the 
first 36 h, closer to the latest model consensus.  Emilia is 
forecast to absorb Fabio into its circulation by Thursday, but there 
are some timing differences among the various models.  The timing 
and location of the merger is a blend of the 12Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF 
model solutions.  After the merger, Emilia will turn toward the 
west-northwest as it is steered more by the lower-level flow.  The 
track forecast beyond 48 h is very close to the previous NHC 
forecast.  

The interaction with Fabio makes the intensity forecast challenging. 
The NHC forecast continues to favor the solution in which Emilia 
absorbs Fabio in 36 to 48 h.  Emilia has been able to fight off 
moderate northeasterly vertical wind shear so far, and it seems 
reasonable that the cyclone could intensify a bit more over the next 
24 h as it remains over warm ocean waters.  Emilia is forecast to 
cross the 26C isotherm by 36 h, and steady weakening is expected 
after that time.  Emilia should weaken below tropical storm strength 
on Friday and become a remnant low on Saturday.  The latest 
intensity forecast is near the middle of the intensity guidance and 
is similar to the previous forecast.
