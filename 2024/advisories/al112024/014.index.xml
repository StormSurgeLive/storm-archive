Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Mon Sep 30 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Joyce, located over the central Atlantic Ocean, on <br/>
newly formed Tropical Storm Kirk, located over the eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic Ocean and has issued the last advisory on Post-Tropical <br/>
Cyclone Isaac.<br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
A trough of low pressure located over the southwestern Caribbean Sea <br/>
continues to produce some disorganized shower and thunderstorm <br/>
activity.  Environmental conditions could become conducive for <br/>
gradual development, and a tropical depression could form in a few <br/>
days while the system is over the southern Gulf of Mexico or <br/>
northwestern Caribbean Sea.  Interests along the U.S. Gulf Coast <br/>
should continue to monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to increase in association with a <br/>
tropical wave located a few hundred miles south of the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands.  Upper-level winds appear conducive for further <br/>
development, and a tropical depression is very likely to form in a <br/>
few days while it moves slowly westward over the eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Joyce Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112024
500 PM AST Mon Sep 30 2024
 
Visible satellite imagery this afternoon depicts increasing bursts
of convection just east and especially just north of the
generally exposed low-level center of Joyce. This precludes
downgrading Joyce to a post-tropical remnant low with this
advisory, though that could happen as early as tonight if the burst 
does not organize. The intensity of the depression was held at 30 kt 
for this advisory based on continuity.
 
Joyce has moved very little over the past 12 to 24 hours, but the
current motion estimate was held at an uncertain 360/2 kt. The
official forecast track shows a slow northward motion until Joyce
fully dissipates within 48 h, with little change from the previous
track forecast.
 
Continued deep-layer shear and dry air encompassing Joyce
is forecast to inhibit additional convection and lead to the
cyclone becoming a remnant low soon. The intensity forecast remains
unchanged from the previous one, showing Joyce becoming a remnant
low in 12 h with dissipation in about 48 h.

<title>Tropical Storm Kirk Forecast Discussion Number 5</title>

Tropical Storm Kirk Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
500 PM AST Mon Sep 30 2024

Kirk is continuing to become better organized this afternoon on 
satellite imagery with a large burst of convection on the northern 
side of the center and an expanding outflow pattern aloft.  All 
intensity estimates are rising, and the initial wind speed is set to 
50 kt, near the CIMSS-AiDT and DMINT values.
 
The motion of Kirk is about the same as before, westward at about 
10 kt.  Very little change was made to the track forecast, with 
below-average model spread across the entire period due to
well-defined steering flow from the subtropical high over the 
east-central Atlantic.  Kirk should gradually move more 
west-northwestward by tomorrow and turn northwestward midweek, with 
a north-northwest turn likely by the end of the forecast period. 

Environmental conditions are forecast to be quite conducive for
strengthening during the next several days, with warm waters, a
moist mid-level environment and low shear in forecast.  Rapid 
intensification remains a notable possibility if this system can 
close off its inner core, though the latest microwave data shows 
that any formative eyewall is still open.  Later on, the exact peak 
intensity is a bit of a mystery, since sometimes these favorable 
conditions can result in most of the energy going toward producing a 
large, but not necessarily stronger hurricane.  Regardless, all 
signs point to Kirk becoming quite a large and powerful hurricane, 
possibly category 4, later this week and remaining intense for days. 
The new forecast is similar to the previous one and is between the 
dynamical model consensus and the statistical-dynamical models.

BULLETIN
Post-Tropical Cyclone Isaac Advisory Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
300 PM GMT Mon Sep 30 2024
 
...ISAAC BECOMES A POST-TROPICAL CYCLONE...
...THIS IS THE LAST ADVISORY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM GMT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...44.8N 29.1W
ABOUT 480 MI...775 KM NNW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 65 DEGREES AT 17 MPH...28 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...983 MB...29.03 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Isaac 
was located near latitude 44.8 North, longitude 29.1 West. The 
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east-northeast near 17 
mph (28 km/h) and a turn to the northeast is expected with a similar 
forward motion for the next several days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h)
with higher gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast over the next
several days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 983 mb (29.03 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac will affect the Azores over the
next few days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Center on this system. Additional information on this system can be

Post-Tropical Cyclone Isaac Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
300 PM GMT Mon Sep 30 2024
 
Geostationary satellite data this morning indicates that Isaac has 
completed its transition to a Post-Tropical Extratropical Low and 
this will be the last NHC advisory. The remaining moderate-to-deep 
convection has sheared off to the northeast as stable stratocumulus 
clouds have fully infiltrated its low-level circulation from the 
west. The initial intensity has been lowered to 50 kt blending the 
latest subjective and objective measurements.
 
The post-tropical cyclone is still moving east-northeastward at 
about 065/15 kt. A subtle turn to the northeast is still expected 
over the next couple of days as the cyclone remains embedded in the 
mid-latitude westerlies. The guidance has shifted a bit east of the 
prior forecast track, partially a reflection of the more eastward 
initial position, and the NHC track was nudged in that direction. 
Over the forecast period, the cyclone is expected to slowly weaken, 
lacking baroclinic support for much non-tropical development. The 
low should ultimately dissipate in the far North Atlantic to the 
west of Ireland before the end of the week.
