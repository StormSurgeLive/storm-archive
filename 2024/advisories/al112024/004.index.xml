Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Sat Sep 28 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Isaac, located over the central Subtropical Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
Tropical Storm Joyce, located over the central Tropical Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.  The Weather Prediction Center is issuing advisories on <br/>
Post-Tropical Cyclone Helene, located inland over the Ohio River <br/>
Valley.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A broad and elongated area of low pressure, associated with a <br/>
tropical wave, is producing limited shower activity near and to the <br/>
west of the Cabo Verde Islands.  Environmental conditions appear <br/>
conducive for gradual development of this system, and a tropical <br/>
depression could form next week while moving toward the west and <br/>
then northwest at about 10 mph across the eastern and central <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure could form over the western Caribbean Sea by <br/>
the early part of next week.  Environmental conditions are expected <br/>
to be conducive for additional development thereafter while the <br/>
system moves generally northwestward, and a tropical depression <br/>
could form by the middle of next week as the system enters the Gulf <br/>
of Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>

<title>Tropical Storm Joyce Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>

Tropical Storm Joyce Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112024
500 AM AST Sat Sep 28 2024

Satellite imagery this morning indicates that Joyce has changed 
little in organization since the last advisory, with the low-level 
center located on the southern edge of the convection due to 
southerly shear. Satellite intensity estimates are clustered near 
45 kt and have changed little during the past 6 h, and based on 
this the initial intensity remains 45 kt.

The initial motion is just a little to the right of the previous 
motion, 305/9 kt.  Joyce is on the south side of a narrow 
subtropical ridge, which is going to weaken and break as a 
deep-layer trough amplifies over the central Atlantic during the 
next few days.  This evolution should cause Joyce to move slowly to 
the west-northwest and northwest for a couple of days, followed by 
an even slower motion toward the north.  The track guidance is in 
generally good agreement through 48 h, but after that time there is 
some divergence due to a couple of the regional hurricane models 
forecasting a stronger Joyce to recurve into the aforementioned 
trough.  As with the previous advisory, the track forecast calls for 
a weaker Joyce to move slowly and not be fully picked up by the 
trough, and the new forecast track has no significant changes from 
the previous forecast.

Joyce is experiencing moderate southerly shear, and the global
models forecast this to continue for the next several days.  In 
addition, the storm will be moving into a gradually drier and 
subsident environment.  Thus, the new intensity forecast is similar 
to the previous forecast in calling for little change in strength 
during the next 12 hours, followed by gradual weakening. Simulated 
satellite imagery from the GFS and ECMWF models suggest that Joyce 
will lose its convection and become a remnant low by day 3, if not 
sooner.  The remnant low should degenerate into a trough by day 4 or 
5, with the remnants subsequently being absorbed by another system 
approaching from the east.

BULLETIN
Hurricane Isaac Advisory Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
300 AM GMT Sat Sep 28 2024
 
...ISAAC CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM GMT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...38.2N 43.4W
ABOUT 890 MI...1430 KM W OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 75 DEGREES AT 16 MPH...26 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...973 MB...28.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM GMT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Isaac was located
near latitude 38.2 North, longitude 43.4 West. Isaac is moving
toward the east-northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h). A gradual turn to 
the northeast is expected with a slight decrease in forward speed 
over the next day or so. The northeastward motion should then 
continue through Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is expected through Saturday 
morning, followed by gradual weakening through early next week. 
Isaac is expected to be a post-tropical cyclone on Monday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 973 mb (28.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a
deep-layer trough could spread into the Azores this weekend. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM GMT.

<title>Hurricane Isaac Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Hurricane Isaac Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
300 AM GMT Sat Sep 28 2024

Isaac has maintained a well-defined eye on both visible and infrared 
imagery for the past 12 hours or so.  The latest subjective Dvorak 
classifications are a consensus T-4.5/77 kt from TAFB and SAB.  The 
latest objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS range from 72 to 
92 kt.  The initial intensity is adjusted upward to 80 kt based on a 
blend of the subjective and objective estimates.

The hurricane is moving east-northeastward, or 075/14 kt.  Isaac is 
currently moving in the zonal flow with the mid-latitude westerlies. 
A powerful deep-layer trough over Atlantic Canada will approach 
Isaac by Saturday night as a narrow mid-level ridge builds to the 
north of Isaac.  These steering features will cause Isaac to bend a 
bit more toward the northeast while slowing down slightly.  On 
Monday, after Isaac becomes post-tropical, a turn more toward the 
north-northeast is expected, as the deep-layer trough moves 
eastward and the ridge moves northward.  No significant changes 
have been made to the official forecast track forecast through the 
first 60-72 h.  After that time, a sizable westward adjustment is 
made to the official forecast track, but the new NHC forecast track 
is well east of the latest consensus models beyond 72 h.

It is possible Isaac could strengthen a little more tonight, 
although the hurricane is likely near its peak intensity.  The 
cyclone is crossing the 26 degree C isotherm now, but is forecast to 
remain over 24-26 degree C sea-surface temperatures for another 36 h 
or so.  The cold upper-level temperatures that Isaac is forecast to 
traverse should help maintain enough instability such that only slow 
weakening is forecast through 36 h, and Isaac is expected to 
maintain hurricane strength through that time.  Also, although 
moderate southwesterly shear is forecast to increase slightly, the 
shear direction is the same as the direction of Isaac's motion, so 
this should not be too unfavorable.  Beyond 48 h, sea-surface 
temperatures decrease significantly and wind shear is forecast to 
become very strong.  This should cause the cyclone to lose its deep 
convection by Monday and then become extratropical. Little to no 
change was made to the previous official intensity forecast, while 
lies near the middle of the guidance envelope.
