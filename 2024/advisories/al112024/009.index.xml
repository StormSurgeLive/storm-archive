Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Sun Sep 29 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Isaac, located several hundred miles northwest of the Azores, and <br/>
on Tropical Storm Joyce, located over the central Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic (AL90):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an elongated area of low <br/>
pressure located a few hundred miles west-southwest of the Cabo <br/>
Verde Islands have become better organized since yesterday. <br/>
Environmental conditions are conducive for gradual development of <br/>
this system, and a tropical depression is likely to form during the <br/>
early or middle part of this week while the system initially moves <br/>
westward and then northwestward across the eastern and central <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located over the western Caribbean Sea <br/>
is producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Environmental <br/>
conditions appear to be conducive for gradual development, and a <br/>
tropical depression could form around the middle part of this week <br/>
while the disturbance meanders towards the west-northwest. This <br/>
system is then expected to move northwestward into the Gulf of <br/>
Mexico during the latter portion of this week, and interests in the <br/>
northwestern Caribbean Sea and along the U.S. Gulf Coast should <br/>
monitor its progress.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located near the coast of western Africa is <br/>
currently producing limited shower activity.  Some gradual <br/>
development of this system is possible during the next several days <br/>
while it moves slowly westward or west-northwestward over the <br/>
eastern Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Joyce Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112024
1100 AM AST Sun Sep 29 2024
 
The center of Joyce is exposed on the southern side of a small
area of deep convection due to continued strong south-southwesterly
vertical wind shear. The most recent scatterometer data from 1230
UTC indicates at least 35 kt winds are within the circulation, and
given the known low bias of the instrument, 40 kt is chosen as the
initial intensity, closest to a blend of the TAFB T- and CI-numbers.
 
The storm has been moving more slowly this morning, estimated to be
northwestward at about 5 kt.  Joyce should turn northward on Monday
due to a deep-layer trough over the north-central Atlantic.  The
only notable change to some of the guidance this cycle is that they
generally agree Joyce or its remnants will be less vertically deep
by mid-week. This evolution should result in less northward
acceleration as the circulation decays due to persistent shear and
dry air aloft.  Thus, the new NHC forecast is a bit to the left and
slower based on the latest aids.  The intensity guidance remains in
good agreement, and the only slight intensity change from the last
advisory is to show Joyce becoming a remnant low at 48 h.

At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Isaac was located

toward the northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this motion is 
expected to continue during the next couple of days, followed by a 
turn toward the north-northeast on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts, and continued weakening is forecast over the next 
few days. Isaac is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone on 
Monday. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles 
(335 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 971 mb (28.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and an upstream deep-layer trough 
will affect the Azores over the next few days. These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM GMT.

Hurricane Isaac Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
300 PM GMT Sun Sep 29 2024

Hurricane Isaac continues to maintain a small inner-core, which has 
proved resilient in an increasingly unfavorable environment  
characterized by strong deep-layer vertical wind shear near 30 kt 
and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) around 23C. The satellite 
appearance of the hurricane has been relatively steady this morning, 
with consistent bursts of deep convection near the center. The 
initial intensity is set to a possibly generous 65 kt, which is on 
the higher end of the subjective and objective intensity estimates.

The tropical cyclone is forecast to track over cooler SSTs and into 
increasing west-southwesterly vertical wind shear, which will induce 
steady weakening through the forecast period. The intensity forecast 
is similar to the previous forecast. There is evidence on visible 
satellite this morning that Isaac has begun to interact with a 
baroclinic zone to its north and east, in addition to wrapping dry 
air from the northwest around the southern side of the circulation. 
These factors are likely to result in Isaac becoming an 
extratropical cyclone by Monday.

Isaac's forward motion continues to be northeastward (045/10 kt) as 
it is steered by deep-layer southwesterly flow. This general motion 
should continue for the next day or so, with a turn toward the 
north-northeast expected by the middle part of this week in response 
to a mid- to upper-level trough approaching from the west. The 
cyclone is then forecast to turn back towards the northeast beyond 
72 hr as it tracks along the southeastern periphery of an 
upper-level trough. Once again, the track forecast is adjusted 
eastward from the previous advisory beyond the 24 hr period, in 
agreement with the latest consensus guidance.
