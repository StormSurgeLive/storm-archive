Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Mon Sep 30 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Joyce, located over the central Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
Tropical Storm Kirk, located over the eastern Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms located over the southwestern <br/>
Caribbean Sea are associated with a trough of low pressure. <br/>
Environmental conditions could support some gradual development of <br/>
this system, and a tropical depression could form over the next <br/>
several days while it moves generally northwestward over the <br/>
northwestern Caribbean Sea and the southern Gulf of Mexico. <br/>
Interests along the U.S. Gulf Coast should continue to monitor the <br/>
progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL91):<br/>
Satellite wind data indicate that a broad area of low pressure has <br/>
formed in association with a tropical wave located a few hundred <br/>
miles south of the Cabo Verde Islands. Showers and thunderstorms <br/>
continue to gradually increase in association with the system, and <br/>
environmental conditions appear conducive for further development. A <br/>
tropical depression is very likely to form during the next few days <br/>
while it moves slowly westward over the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

Remnants Of Joyce Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112024
1100 PM AST Mon Sep 30 2024
 
Recent CIRA ProxyVis GOES imagery, and an ASCAT-C overpass around 
00Z indicate that Joyce no longer has a well-defined center. 
Therefore, Joyce is no longer a tropical cyclone and this is the 
last NHC advisory.  The ASCAT data indicated that winds of 25-30 kt 
are still occuring near the remaining convection associated with the 
remnants of Joyce.

Joyce's remnants are expected to merge with a mid-latitude system 
and accelerate northeastward during the next couple of days. 
Additional information on this system can be found in High Seas 
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header 
NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at

<title>Tropical Storm Kirk Forecast Discussion Number 5</title>

Tropical Storm Kirk Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
500 PM AST Mon Sep 30 2024

Kirk is continuing to become better organized this afternoon on 
satellite imagery with a large burst of convection on the northern 
side of the center and an expanding outflow pattern aloft.  All 
intensity estimates are rising, and the initial wind speed is set to 
50 kt, near the CIMSS-AiDT and DMINT values.
 
The motion of Kirk is about the same as before, westward at about 
10 kt.  Very little change was made to the track forecast, with 
below-average model spread across the entire period due to
well-defined steering flow from the subtropical high over the 
east-central Atlantic.  Kirk should gradually move more 
west-northwestward by tomorrow and turn northwestward midweek, with 
a north-northwest turn likely by the end of the forecast period. 

Environmental conditions are forecast to be quite conducive for
strengthening during the next several days, with warm waters, a
moist mid-level environment and low shear in forecast.  Rapid 
intensification remains a notable possibility if this system can 
close off its inner core, though the latest microwave data shows 
that any formative eyewall is still open.  Later on, the exact peak 
intensity is a bit of a mystery, since sometimes these favorable 
conditions can result in most of the energy going toward producing a 
large, but not necessarily stronger hurricane.  Regardless, all 
signs point to Kirk becoming quite a large and powerful hurricane, 
possibly category 4, later this week and remaining intense for days. 
The new forecast is similar to the previous one and is between the 
dynamical model consensus and the statistical-dynamical models.
