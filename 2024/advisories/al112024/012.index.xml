Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Mon Sep 30 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Isaac, located several hundred miles northwest of the Azores, <br/>
on Tropical Depression Joyce, located over the central Atlantic <br/>
Ocean, and on Tropical Depression Twelve, located over the eastern <br/>
tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Western Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located over the western Caribbean Sea <br/>
is producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental <br/>
conditions appear to be conducive for gradual development, and a <br/>
tropical depression could form around the middle part of this week <br/>
while the disturbance moves slowly west-northwestward.  This system <br/>
is then expected to move northwestward into the Gulf of Mexico <br/>
during the latter portion of this week.  Interests in the <br/>
northwestern Caribbean Sea and along the U.S. Gulf Coast should <br/>
monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located a few hundred miles south-southeast of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands is producing limited shower and thunderstorm <br/>
activity.  Upper-level winds are forecast to become more conducive <br/>
for gradual development of this system during the next few days, and <br/>
a tropical depression could form during the middle or latter part of <br/>
this week while it moves slowly westward or west-northwestward over <br/>
the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>

Tropical Depression Joyce Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112024
500 AM AST Mon Sep 30 2024
 
Joyce's center is mostly exposed, with only a few cells of deep 
convection forming intermittently within the circulation.  Joyce 
continues to experience strong southwesterly vertical wind shear 
due to a large upper-level trough over the central Atlantic.  The 
current intensity is held at 30 kt which is similar to the objective 
AIDT and DPRINT estimates from UW-CIMSS.  This may be a generous 
estimate, however, given the current appearance of the system.
 
The cyclone has not moved much with only a slightly south of 
westward drift noted, and the current motion estimate is 260/2 kt. 
It seems that the weakened system is now being steered primarily by 
the low-level flow.  Therefore the official track forecast is 
slower than the previous predictions.  This is similar to the 
motion implied by the latest ECMWF forecast fields which show a 
very weak system drifting generally northward for the next day or 
two.

Given the lack of convection, the environment of dry air, and 
the expectation of persistent shear, Joyce should soon degenerate 
into a remnant low.  The official intensity forecast is similar to 
the previous one.  The remnant cyclone should dissipate in 48-60 
hours if not sooner.

<title>Tropical Depression Twelve Forecast Discussion Number 3</title>

Tropical Depression Twelve Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
500 AM AST Mon Sep 30 2024

Tropical Depression Twelve has become better organized overnight.  A 
29/2338 UTC ASCAT-B overpass showed a large area of 25 to 30 kt 
winds, and that the center was located near the northern edge of the 
large convective mass.  Although a 30/0334 UTC AMSR2 microwave image 
showed that the center was still located near the northern edge of 
the central convective area, curved banding has been increasing 
during the night, with a large area of cold cloud tops persisting.  
Subjective Dvorak intensity estimates are a consensus T-2.0/30 kt 
from both TAFB and SAB.  Objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS 
are rising and now range from 36 to 41 kt.  Based on the subjective 
Dvorak estimates, a 30 kt initial intensity is held for this 
advisory, but the depression is likely very near tropical storm 
strength.

The estimated initial motion of the depression is westward, or 275/7 
kt.  The cyclone will continue moving westward to west-northwestward 
for another couple days while a well-established subtropical ridge 
remains in place to the north of the system.  A gradual turn to the 
northwest is expected around mid-week as a deep-layer trough over 
the north-central Atlantic weakens the ridge.  At the end of the 
forecast period, an approaching upper-level trough near Bermuda will 
induce the cyclone to turn northward over the open waters of the 
central Atlantic Ocean.  Some along-track spread is noted in the 
various track model solutions, but the models are in good agreement 
on the northward turn, with little cross-track spread.  The latest 
NHC track forecast is nearly identical to the previous one, and is 
about halfway between the slower GFS solution and the faster ECMWF 
model.

Conditions are quite favorable along the path of the depression with 
29 degree C sea-surface temperatures, a moist environment, and weak 
vertical wind shear.  Given the weak shear and the gradually 
improving structure, the cyclone should begin to steadily intensify 
soon.  The depression is forecast to become a hurricane in 36 to 48 
hours and a major hurricane in about 4 days.  The NHC intensity 
forecast is similar to the previous one, and lies between the middle 
and upper end of the intensity guidance suite, near the HCCA and 
IVCN multi-model consensus aids.  It should be noted that most of 
the models indicate that the cyclone's wind and wave field will 
expand significantly over the next several days, and the system is 
forecast to become a large and powerful hurricane as it gains 
latitude later this week.

BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Isaac Advisory Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
900 AM GMT Mon Sep 30 2024
 
...ISAAC EXPECTED TO BECOME POST-TROPICAL LATER TODAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM GMT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...44.7N 31.3W
ABOUT 515 MI...825 KM NNW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 60 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...975 MB...28.80 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM GMT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Isaac was
located near latitude 44.7 North, longitude 31.3 West.  Isaac is
moving toward the east-northeast near 15 mph (24 km/h).  A turn
toward the northeast at a similar forward speed is expected on
Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Slow weakening is expected during the next several days.
Isaac is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone later today.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 975 mb (28.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac will affect the Azores over the 
next few days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening 
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your 
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM GMT.

Tropical Storm Isaac Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
900 AM GMT Mon Sep 30 2024

Isaac continues to show signs of transitioning into an extratropical 
cyclone.  The central convection has mostly dissipated, and the 
system is taking on more of a frontal appearance, with a 
zonally-oriented cloud and rain shield over the cyclone's northern 
semicircle.  The current intensity is kept at 55 kt in accordance 
with a Dvorak estimate from TAFB, although this is somewhat 
uncertain since Isaac no longer appears to be a true tropical 
cyclone.

The cyclone continues to move east-northeastward or at about 060/13 
kt within a southern branch of the mid-latitude westerlies.  Isaac 
is expected to turn toward the northeast during the next couple 
of days as it approaches a shortwave ridge just west of the 
British Isles.  The official track forecast has been nudged only 
slightly eastward in the 2-3 day time frame, towards the latest 
corrected dynamical model consensus.

Isaac is moving over cool waters and should complete its 
extratropical transition today.  The global models suggest that the 
system will gradually weaken during the next few days as it becomes 
absorbed within a larger low over the North Atlantic.  The official 
intensity forecast is similar to the previous NHC prediction.
