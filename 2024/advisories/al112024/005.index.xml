Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Sat Sep 28 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Isaac, located several hundred miles east of the Azores, and on <br/>
Tropical Storm Joyce, located over the central tropical Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.  The Weather Prediction Center is issuing advisories on <br/>
Post-Tropical Cyclone Helene, located inland over the Ohio River <br/>
Valley.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A broad and elongated area of low pressure, associated with a <br/>
tropical wave, is producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms <br/>
near and to the west of the Cabo Verde Islands.  Environmental <br/>
conditions appear conducive for gradual development of this system, <br/>
and a tropical depression could form during the early or middle <br/>
part of next week while the system moves toward the west and then <br/>
northwest across the eastern and central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure could form over the western Caribbean Sea in <br/>
a few days.  Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive <br/>
for additional development thereafter while the system moves <br/>
generally northwestward, and a tropical depression could form during <br/>
the middle to latter part of next week as the system enters the Gulf <br/>
of Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Joyce was
located near latitude 20.0 North, longitude 46.0 West. Joyce is
moving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and a
west-northwestward to northwestward motion with a decrease in
forward speed is expected through Sunday.  A slow turn toward the
northwest and north is forecast Sunday night and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is expected today.  Weakening is forecast
to begin tonight or on Sunday, and Joyce could degenerate into a
remnant low by early Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)

<title>Tropical Storm Joyce Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>

Tropical Storm Joyce Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112024
500 AM AST Sat Sep 28 2024

Satellite imagery this morning indicates that Joyce has changed 
little in organization since the last advisory, with the low-level 
center located on the southern edge of the convection due to 
southerly shear. Satellite intensity estimates are clustered near 
45 kt and have changed little during the past 6 h, and based on 
this the initial intensity remains 45 kt.

The initial motion is just a little to the right of the previous 
motion, 305/9 kt.  Joyce is on the south side of a narrow 
subtropical ridge, which is going to weaken and break as a 
deep-layer trough amplifies over the central Atlantic during the 
next few days.  This evolution should cause Joyce to move slowly to 
the west-northwest and northwest for a couple of days, followed by 
an even slower motion toward the north.  The track guidance is in 
generally good agreement through 48 h, but after that time there is 
some divergence due to a couple of the regional hurricane models 
forecasting a stronger Joyce to recurve into the aforementioned 
trough.  As with the previous advisory, the track forecast calls for 
a weaker Joyce to move slowly and not be fully picked up by the 
trough, and the new forecast track has no significant changes from 
the previous forecast.

Joyce is experiencing moderate southerly shear, and the global
models forecast this to continue for the next several days.  In 
addition, the storm will be moving into a gradually drier and 
subsident environment.  Thus, the new intensity forecast is similar 
to the previous forecast in calling for little change in strength 
during the next 12 hours, followed by gradual weakening. Simulated 
satellite imagery from the GFS and ECMWF models suggest that Joyce 
will lose its convection and become a remnant low by day 3, if not 
sooner.  The remnant low should degenerate into a trough by day 4 or 
5, with the remnants subsequently being absorbed by another system 
approaching from the east.

Hurricane Isaac Advisory Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
300 PM GMT Sat Sep 28 2024
 
...ISAAC REMAINS A CATEGORY TWO HURRICANE OVER THE CENTRAL
ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM GMT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...40.2N 39.7W
ABOUT 695 MI...1120 KM WNW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...105 MPH...165 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 60 DEGREES AT 20 MPH...31 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...968 MB...28.59 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Isaac was located
near latitude 40.2 North, longitude 39.7 West. Isaac is moving
toward the east-northeast near 20 mph (31 km/h) and a decrease in 
forward speed and a turn to the northeast is expected during the 
next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is expected, and Isaac is expected to be 
a post-tropical cyclone on Monday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles
(315 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 968 mb (28.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a
deep-layer trough will affect the Azores over the next few days.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM GMT.

Hurricane Isaac Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
300 PM GMT Sat Sep 28 2024
 
Isaac's strengthening trend from the past day or so appears to have
leveled off. Isaac still has a clear eye and a relatively symmetric
appearance, although some dry air entrainment is evident coming in
from the southwest. Intensity estimates range from 77 to 93 kt, and
initial intensity has been held at 90 kt, in agreement with TAFB's
Dvorak classification of 5.0. The wind radii have been modified to 
reflect values from 1245 UTC ASCAT-B pass.
 
Isaac is already over relatively cool water and will reach 
progressively lower SSTs in the coming day or two, all while 
encountering increasingly hostile shear. Thus, Isaac's intensity has 
most likely peaked, and gradual weakening today is forecast to 
accelerate through the weekend. This weakening will coincide with an 
extratropical transition, which based on global models, will 
complete in about 48 hours. The NHC intensity forecast remains 
unchanged from the previous forecast and is in close agreement with 
consensus aids through the forecast period.
 
Isaac is moving east-northeastward, 060/17 kt. Steering flow
should decrease as Isaac passes in the vicinity of a mid- to upper-
level ridge over the next day or so, which should lead to slower
forward motion through the remainder of its warm-core existence.  As
Isaac becomes extratropical, it should turn more northerly as a
shortwave trough digs to the west of the cyclone. The official track
forecast remains unchanged through 48 hours but has again trended to
the right of the previous forecast beyond 48 hours to adjust closer
to consensus models.
