A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area. A watch is typically issued 48 hours before
the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds,
conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.
 
Interests elsewhere in Florida and the southeastern coast of the
United States should monitor the progress of this system. Additional
warnings and watches will likely be required for a portion of this
area later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Four was 
located near latitude 22.0 North, longitude 80.7 West. The 
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 16 mph (26 
km/h). A turn toward the northwest is forecast today, followed by a 
northward motion on Sunday and then a slower northeastward motion  
Sunday night and Monday. On the forecast track, the center of the 
depression will move across western Cuba this morning, and then move 
over the eastern Gulf of Mexico later today and Sunday, reaching the 
Florida Gulf coast late Sunday or Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and the
depression is expected to become a tropical storm later today and
continue strengthening over the eastern Gulf of Mexico through the
weekend.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1009 mb (29.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for the depression can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area
by Sunday night, with tropical storm conditions possible by Sunday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread northward over the
warning areas beginning later today and continuing through Sunday.
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in the
Florida Keys later today or tonight, and in the Florida Panhandle
by late Sunday.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Chassahowitzka, FL to Aucilla River, FL...3-5 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...2-4 ft
Tampa Bay...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Four is expected to produce rainfall
totals of 5 to 10 inches, with maximum rainfall totals up to 15
inches, across portions of Florida and along the Southeast U.S.
coast this weekend through Thursday morning. This rainfall may
result in areas of locally considerable flash and urban flooding,
with isolated river flooding possible.
 
For Cuba, rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches, with localized higher
amounts, will be possible through today. This may result in isolated
to scattered areas of flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Depression Four, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf
 
TORNADOES: A tornado or two is possible across the Florida Keys and
the western Florida Peninsula tonight through Sunday morning.

SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are expected to affect 
much of the Gulf coast of Florida tonight through Monday and along 
the Southeast U.S. coast early next week. These swells are likely 
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.

<title>Tropical Depression Four Forecast Discussion Number 3</title>

Tropical Depression Four Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042024
1100 PM EDT Fri Aug 02 2024
 
Shortwave infrared satellite imagery, Cuban radar data, and surface 
observations from Cuba and the Cayman Islands suggest that the 
disturbance has developed a closed circulation, and the center is 
located just off the south coast of Cuba.  Deep convection is still 
a bit fragmented, but there has been a persistent burst near the 
estimated center since earlier this afternoon.  The wind and 
pressure field could still be a little elongated within the 
southern semicircle, but overall the system appears to have enough 
organization to now be designated as a tropical depression.  The 
initial intensity remains 25 kt based on earlier observations.

The depression has not begun to turn yet, and the initial motion is 
west-northwestward, or 285/15 kt.  A turn toward the northwest and 
then north is expected over the weekend due to a break in the 
subtropical ridge caused by a trough over the eastern United 
States.  Since the system has not started to turn yet, this has 
caused all of the track guidance to shift west, and the updated NHC 
forecast is a bit west of the previous forecast along the eastern 
edge of the main cluster of models.  It is important to note that 
because of the forecast track being parallel to the west coast of 
Florida, the location and timing of a potential landfall cannot be 
pinned down at this time.  One additional significant change to the 
forecast is that the models seem to be showing the aforementioned 
trough leaving the cyclone behind early next week, which causes a 
much slower motion while the system is near the coasts of Georgia 
and South Carolina.  As a result, the new NHC forecast is notably 
slower than the previous forecast, particularly on days 4 and 5.
 
The westward shift to the track forecast now also keeps the system 
over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico longer, giving the 
system additional time to potentially strengthen.  In fact, the 
SHIPS guidance and all of the regional hurricane models show the 
cyclone reaching hurricane strength before reaching land in the Big 
Bend region of Florida in 2 to 3 days.  As a result, the new NHC 
forecast brings the intensity to 60 kt at 60 hours as the system is 
reaching land, but if model trends continue, it's possible that 
future forecasts could explicit show the system becoming a 
hurricane before it reaches land.  The intensity forecast is more 
uncertain on days 3 through 5 due depending on if the center moves 
back offshore or stays inland over the southeastern United States.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall may result in locally considerable flash and urban 
flooding across portions of Florida and the coastal areas of the 
Southeast U.S. this weekend through Wednesday. Isolated river 
flooding will also be possible.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected Saturday night within the
Tropical Storm Warning area in southwest Florida from East Cape
Sable to Boca Grande and on the Dry Tortugas. Tropical storm 
conditions are possible in the remainder of the Florida Keys on 
Saturday and along the Florida west coast north of Boca Grande to 
Suwannee River Saturday night and Sunday where a Tropical Storm 
Watch is in effect.
 
3. There is a possibility of life-threatening inundation from storm
surge along portions of the west coast of Florida from Bonita Beach
to Suwannee River, including Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor, where a
Storm Surge Watch is in effect.
 
4. Impacts from storm surge, strong winds, and heavy rains are
possible elsewhere in Florida and along the southeast coast of the
United States from Georgia to North Carolina through the middle of
next week, and interests in those areas should continue to monitor
the progress of this system.  Additional watches and warnings will
likely be required on Saturday.
