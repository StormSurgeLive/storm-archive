DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Debby was 
located near latitude 27.0 North, longitude 84.3 West. Debby is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A turn 
toward the north is expected later today, followed by a slower 
motion toward the northeast on Monday and Tuesday.  On the forecast 
track, the center will move across the eastern Gulf of Mexico 
through tonight and reach the Florida Big Bend coast Monday morning. 
Debby is then expected to move slowly across northern Florida and 
southern Georgia Monday and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Rapid strengthening is forecast, and Debby is 
expected to become a hurricane by tonight before it reaches the 
Florida Big Bend coast. Weakening is expected on Monday and Tuesday 
after Debby moves inland.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area and possible in the hurricane watch areas early Monday, with
tropical storm conditions expected to arrive this evening. Tropical
storm conditions are expected to spread northward over the tropical
storm warning areas through tonight. Tropical storm conditions are
possible in the watch area in the Florida Panhandle on Monday, and
along the coast of Georgia and South Carolina Monday night.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Suwannee River to Ochlockonee River, FL...6-10 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Suwannee River, FL...4-7 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Indian Pass, FL...4-6 ft
Tampa Bay...3-5 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Yankeetown, FL...3-5 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...2-4 ft
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to South Santee River, SC...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce rainfall totals of 6 to 12
inches, with maximum amounts of 18 inches, across portions of
northern Florida through Friday morning.  This rainfall will likely
result in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with
significant river flooding expected.
 
Across portions of southeast Georgia and South Carolina, 10 to 20
inches of rainfall, with local amounts to 30 inches, are expected
through Friday morning.  This potentially historic rainfall may
result in areas of catastrophic flooding.
 
For western Cuba, additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches, with
localized higher amounts, will be possible through today. This will
result in isolated to scattered areas of flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Debby, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible through Monday morning,
mainly over western and northern Florida and southern Georgia.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Debby are expected to affect much of the
Gulf coast of Florida through Monday.  Swells will begin to affect
the Southeast U.S. coast on Monday and continue through the middle
of the week. These conditions are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.

TCDAT4
 
Tropical Storm Debby Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042024
500 AM EDT Sun Aug 04 2024
 
Debby continues to slowly strengthen over the southeastern Gulf of
Mexico.  Deep convection is gradually expanding over the center and
in fragmented bands on the system's east side.  Some of the outer
bands are moving through portions of the Lower Florida Keys and
southwestern Florida, producing tropical-storm-force gusts.  The
initial wind speed is nudged upward to 45 kt, in agreement with the
Dvorak classification from TAFB.  Both the NOAA and Air Force
Hurricane Hunter aircraft are scheduled to investigate the storm
today, and that data will provide very helpful information to
evaluate Debby's strength and structure.
 
Debby continues to gradually turn to the right, with the initial 
motion now estimated to be north-northwestward at 11 kt.  The storm 
is currently located on the southwestern periphery of an Atlantic 
mid-level ridge, and it is headed toward a weakness caused by a mid- 
to upper-level trough over the eastern U.S.  This steering pattern 
should cause Debby to turn northward and then north-northeastward 
during the next day or so, taking the core of the cyclone to the Big 
Bend region of Florida early Monday.  There is high confidence on 
this scenario, and little change has been made to that portion of 
the track forecast.  While Debby moves across the very warm waters 
of the eastern Gulf of Mexico and remains in a relatively low wind 
shear environment, the storm will have an opportunity to strengthen 
rapidly before reaching the coast.  The reliable intensity models 
all suggest significant strengthening, and the degree of 
intensification will be most related to how quickly Debby develops 
an inner core.  The NHC intensity forecast remains near the high end 
of the intensity guidance through landfall, and shows Debby becoming 
a hurricane by tonight prior to landfall.
 
After Debby makes landfall in Florida, the system is expected to 
slow down and turn northeastward across northern Florida and 
southeastern Georgia on Monday and Tuesday as the steering currents 
weaken significantly. There is a lot of model disagreement in 
whether or not the center of Debby stays inland or moves off the 
coast of the southeast U.S. by the middle of the week. But, a 
building ridge should cause it to turn northward or northwestward 
and likely back inland during the middle and latter portions of the 
week.  Although confidence is low in the details of this portion of 
the track forecast, the complex and weak steering pattern suggests 
that Debby will be moving quite slowly and likely erratically while 
near or over the southeastern U.S., resulting in a potentially 
significant flooding event.  Since it is not clear if the center 
will remain inland or move offshore for a period of time, the 
intensity forecast is also of low confidence.  For now, little 
overall change to the intensity forecast was made, and it shows 
Debby remaining a tropical storm while meandering near the southeast 
U.S.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall will likely result in considerable flash and urban 
flooding across portions of northern Florida through Friday morning. 
Potentially historic heavy rainfall across southeast Georgia and 
South Carolina through Friday morning will likely result in areas of 
severe and widespread flash and urban flooding. Significant river 
flooding is also expected.
 
2.  Hurricane conditions are expected on Monday along portions of
the Florida Big Bend region where a Hurricane Warning is in effect,
with tropical storm conditions beginning this evening. Tropical
storm conditions are expected through Monday farther south within
the Tropical Storm Warning along Florida's west coast, including the
Tampa Bay area and the Lower Florida Keys.
 
3. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation
along portions of the Gulf coast of Florida from Aripeka to Indian
Pass. Life-threatening storm surge is possible south of Aripeka to
Bonita Beach, including Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor.
 
4. Impacts from storm surge and strong winds are possible elsewhere 
in Florida and along the southeast coast of the United States from 
Georgia to North Carolina through the middle of the week, and 
interests in those areas should continue to monitor the progress of 
this system. Additional watches and warnings will likely be required 
later today.
