Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD<br/>
200 PM EDT Thu Aug 8 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Debby, centered inland near the border of North Carolina <br/>
and South Carolina.<br/>
<br/>
Near the Lesser and Greater Antilles:<br/>
A tropical wave located over the eastern tropical Atlantic is <br/>
producing widespread disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Any <br/>
development of the wave should be slow to occur during the next few <br/>
days while it moves westward across the central tropical Atlantic. <br/>
Conditions are expected to become more conducive for development <br/>
early next week, and a tropical depression could form while it <br/>
approaches the Lesser Antilles. The system is then forecast to move <br/>
generally west-northwestward and could approach the Greater Antilles <br/>
by the middle part of next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Debby
was located inland near latitude 35.1 North, longitude 80.2 West. 
The depression is moving toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17
km/h).  A faster northward or north-northeastward motion is 
expected during the next day or two.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next couple of 
days, but Debby is expected to become a post-tropical cyclone on 
Friday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface 
observations is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Wind gusts to tropical-storm-force could occur for a few more
hours along portions of the North Carolina coast.
 
STORM SURGE: Coastal flooding is possible in the Cape Fear, Neuse, 
and Pamlico Rivers...1 to 3 ft.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce an additional 3 to 6 inches 
of rainfall with locally higher amounts, across portions of 
southeastern North Carolina leading to maximum storm total amounts 
as high as 15 inches.  Additional rainfall of 1 to 3 inches over 
portions of eastern South Carolina will bring maximum storm total 
amounts as high as 20 to 25 inches. Considerable flooding is 
expected across portions of eastern South Carolina and southeast 
North Carolina through Friday.

From central North Carolina northward across portions of Virginia, 3 
to 7 inches with local amounts to 10 inches, are expected through 
Friday. This rainfall will likely result in areas of considerable to 
locally catastrophic flash and urban flooding, especially in the 
terrain of western Virginia, with river flooding also possible.

From portions of Maryland north through Upstate New York and 
Vermont, 2 to 4 inches, with local amounts to 6 inches, are expected 
through Friday night. This will likely result in areas of 
considerable flash and urban flooding as well as river flooding.

For the remainder of northern New England, 1 to 3 inches, with 
local amounts to 4 inches, are expected into Saturday.  Scattered 
instances of flash flooding are possible.
  
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with  Debby, please see the National Weather Service 
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.  For a list of 
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see 
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the WMO header ACUS44 
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html. 
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes may occur through tonight from central
and eastern North Carolina into central and southeast Virginia.  
The threat for tornadoes will shift northward into parts of New 
Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania on Friday.
 
SURF:  Large swells will continue to affect the Southeast U.S.
coast for another day or so. These conditions are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Depression Debby Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042024
500 PM EDT Thu Aug 08 2024
 
Debby continues to move farther inland and the center is now
located over south-central North Carolina.  The storm continues to
produce heavy rains across portions of the Carolinas and Virginia,
with the major flood threat continuing in those areas. Surface
observations indicate that winds along the North Carolina coast and
offshore have decreased, and based on that data, the initial
intensity is lowered to 30 kt, making Debby a tropical depression.  
Although the sustained winds have decreased, there could still be 
some gusts to tropical-storm-force along portions of the North 
Carolina coast for a few more hours.
 
The system is moving north-northwestward at 9 kt.  A turn to the
north or north-northeast and a significant increase in forward
speed are expected.  This motion will take Debby, or its
remnants, across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast States during the
next day or so.  Debby is likely to complete extratropical
transition tonight or on Friday and dissipate in a couple of days.
 
This is the last tropical cyclone discussion issued by the
National Hurricane Center on Debby.  Future information on
this system can be found in discussions issued by the Weather
Prediction Center beginning at 1100 PM EDT, under AWIPS header
TCDAT4, WMO header WTNT44 KWNH, and on the web at
<a href="http://www.hurricanes.gov.">www.hurricanes.gov.</a>
 
Rainfall forecasts for the United States can always be found at
https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/qpf/qpf2.shtml
and outlooks of flash flood risks can be found at
https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/qpf/excessive_rainfall_outlook_ero.php

Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall across portions of the Carolinas is expected to
persist through today along with areas of considerable flooding.
Heavy rainfall will also result in considerable to locally
catastrophic flooding impacts across portions of the Mid-Atlantic
States and Northeast through Saturday morning.
