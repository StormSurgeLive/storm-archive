DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Debby was
located near latitude 32.1 North, longitude 80.8 West.  Debby is
moving toward the east-northeast near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A slow 
motion toward the east and then north is expected through Thursday 
night.  On the forecast track, the center of Debby is expected to 
move offshore the coast of Georgia and South Carolina later today 
and tonight, continue to drift offshore through early Thursday, and 
then move inland over South Carolina on Thursday morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast on Wednesday while Debby
drifts offshore.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
tropical storm warning area along the Georgia coast for the next
few hours.  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue along
the coast of South Carolina within the tropical storm warning area
through Thursday night.  Tropical storm conditions are expected
within the tropical storm warning area in North Carolina beginning
early Wednesday.  Tropical Storm conditions are possible within the
Tropical Storm Watch area in North Carolina beginning Wednesday.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
South Santee River, SC to Cape Fear, NC...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce potentially historic rainfall 
totals of 10 to 20 inches, with maximum amounts of 25 inches, 
bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of the 
eastern half of South Carolina, and southeast North Carolina through 
Friday.

From central South Carolina to the Update of South Carolina, 
northward into Southwest Virginia,  portions of the Mid-Atlantic 
States, western and northern New York State into Northern New 
England, 3 to 6 inches with local amounts to 8 inches, are expected 
through Saturday. This rainfall will likely result in areas of 
considerable flash and urban flooding, with river flooding possible. 

An additional scattered 1 to 3 inches of rainfall is possible across 
southeast Georgia through Tuesday night, which may aggravate any 
ongoing flooding conditions across that vicinity.  
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with  Debby, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.  For a list of
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the WMO header ACUS44
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible over portions of coastal 
South Carolina and North Carolina this afternoon through Wednesday 
morning.
 
SURF:  Large swells will continue to affect the Southeast U.S.
coast through the end of the week. These conditions are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.

Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM EDT.

Tropical Storm Debby Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042024
500 PM EDT Tue Aug 06 2024

Surface, satellite, and radar data show that Debby continues to 
linger near the coastline in the vicinity of the Georgia/South 
Carolina border.  The cyclone lacks strong convection near its 
center and the tropical-storm-force winds are mainly occurring in 
some bands well to the northeast and east of the center.  This was 
also shown by an earlier ASCAT pass.  The central pressure 
remains essentially unchanged, and the intensity is kept at 35 
kt for this advisory.

Debby remains trapped in a zone of weak steering currents within 
the subtropical ridge, and the current motion estimate is a very 
slow 070/3 kt.  The track guidance shows a generally eastward 
motion for the next day or so, taking the center temporarily 
offshore.  In 24-36 hours, a building mid-level ridge should cause 
the system to turn northward and move back inland early Thursday.  
After that, Debby is likely to accelerate northeastward over the 
eastern and northeastern U.S. ahead of an approaching mid-level 
trough.  The official track forecast has been adjusted toward the 
latest consensus model guidance, and is somewhat to the left and 
faster than the previous one. 

Assuming that Debby moves back over water tonight and Wednesday, 
some re-strengthening is anticipated.  However since the cyclone 
lacks an inner core and is not likely to move far enough east to 
interact with the  high oceanic heat content of the Gulf Stream, 
re-intensification is likely to be limited.  The official intensity 
forecast is at the high end of the model guidance. 

Key Messages:
 
1. Potentially historic heavy rainfall across eastern South 
Carolina through Friday will likely result in areas of catastrophic 
flooding.  Heavy rainfall will likely result in considerable 
flooding impacts from central to the Upstate of South Carolina, 
western North Carolina, Southwest Virginia through portions of 
Mid-Atlantic States, western and northern New York State and 
northern New England through Saturday. 
 
2 Tropical storm conditions will spread northward along the 
southeast U.S. coast from northeastern Georgia to North Carolina 
through Thursday.  Tropical storm warnings and watches are in effect 
for portions of that area. 

3. A dangerous storm surge is possible along the coast of South 
Carolina and southeastern North Carolina from South Santee River to 
Cape Fear.  Residents in that area should follow any advice given by 
local officials.
