SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* North of South Santee River, South Carolina to Ocracoke Inlet,
North Carolina
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case during the
next 12 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Debby was
located inland over South Carolina near latitude 33.2 North,
longitude 79.7 West.  Debby is moving toward the northwest near 5
mph (7 km/h) but is expected to accelerate toward the
north-northwest and north across eastern South Carolina and central
North Carolina through tonight.  Debby is then expected to move
faster toward the northeast across the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast on Friday and Atlantic Canada on Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast during the next day or so, and Debby is
likely to become a tropical depression by this afternoon or
evening.  Debby should then merge with a front and become
extratropical on Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
to the east of the center.  A sustained wind of 36 mph (57 km/h) 
and a gust to 39 mph (63 km/h) was recently reported at Cape 
Lookout, North Carolina.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue along the
coasts of South Carolina and North Carolina within the tropical
storm warning area through today.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
South Santee River to Ocracoke Inlet including the Neuse and
Pamlico Rivers...1 to 3 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce an additional 3 to 6 inches
of rainfall with locally higher amounts, across portions of
southeastern North Carolina leading to maximum storm total amounts
as high as 15 inches.  Additional rainfall of 1 to 3 inches over
portions of eastern South Carolina will bring maximum storm total
amounts as high as 20 to 25 inches. Considerable flooding is
expected across portions of eastern South Carolina and southeast
North Carolina through Friday.
 
From central North Carolina northward across portions of Virginia, 3
to 7 inches with local amounts to 10 inches, are expected through
Friday. This rainfall will likely result in areas of considerable
flash and urban flooding, with river flooding possible.
 
From portions of Maryland north through Upstate New York and
Vermont, 2 to 4 inches, with local amounts to 6 inches, are expected
through Friday night. This will likely result in areas of
considerable flash and urban flooding as well as river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with  Debby, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.  For a list of
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the WMO header ACUS44
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes may occur over parts of eastern North
Carolina this morning.  The tornado threat will shift northward
today into central North Carolina and southern to central Virginia.
 
SURF:  Large swells will continue to affect the Southeast U.S.
coast through the end of the week. These conditions are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Debby Forecast Discussion Number 23</title>

Tropical Storm Debby Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042024
1100 PM EDT Wed Aug 07 2024
 
Satellite imagery and surface observations indicate that Debby has
a large central area of light and variable winds, with bands of
deep convection well removed from the center in both the northern
and southern semicircles.  The initial intensity is held at 50 kt
for this advisory, with these winds likely confined to the area of
stronger convection to the southeast of the center.  The central
pressure based on surface observations is near 994 mb.
 
Debby has been drifting just west of due north for the past several 
hours with an initial motion of 345/3.  This has brought the center 
near the South Carolina coast, and it is expected to move inland 
during the next few hours.  A continued slow north-northwestward 
motion is expected for the next 24 h, with the center crossing 
eastern South Carolina moving into North Carolina.  After that, the 
cyclone should recurve to the north and northeast on the east side 
of a mid-latitude trough near the Great Lakes.  The latest track 
guidance has shifted a little to the west of the previous guidance, 
and the new forecast track is also shifted a little westward.

Little change in strength is expected before the center moves 
inland.  After that, Debby is expected to weaken, with the system 
dropping below tropical-storm strength after 24 h.  As Debby 
crosses through the mid-Atlantic States, the cyclone is expected 
to merge with a frontal system and become an extratropical low by 
60 h. However, it is important to note that none of these changes 
will diminish the threat of heavy rainfall and flooding across 
portions of the Carolinas, Mid-Atlantic, and northeastern United 
States during the next few days.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall across portions of the Carolinas is expected to
persist through Thursday along with areas of considerable flooding.
Expected heavy rainfall will also result in considerable flooding
impacts across portions of the Mid-Atlantic States and Northeast
through Saturday morning.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions will affect portions of the South
Carolina and North Carolina coast through Thursday. Tropical storm
warnings and watches are in effect for portions of that area.
 
3. Coastal flooding due to storm surge is likely along portions of
the South Carolina and North Carolina coastline through Thursday.
