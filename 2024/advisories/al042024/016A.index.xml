DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Debby was
located inland over southeastern Georgia near latitude 31.9 North,
longitude 81.3 West. Debby is moving toward the northeast near 6 mph
(9 km/h).  A slow motion toward the east and then north is expected 
through Thursday night.  On the forecast track, the center of Debby 
is expected to move offshore the coast of Georgia later today, drift 
offshore through early Thursday, and then move inland over South 
Carolina on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some strengthening is forecast on Wednesday and Thursday
while Debby drifts offshore.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
to the east of the center.  Sustained winds of 39 mph (63 km/h)  
and a gust to 48 mph (78 km/h) were recently reported at Winyah Bay 
Light near Georgetown, South Carolina.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
tropical storm warning area along the Georgia coast through this 
morning.  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue along 
the coast of South Carolina within the tropical storm warning area 
through Thursday night.  Tropical storm conditions are possible 
within the tropical storm watch area in North Carolina beginning 
Wednesday night.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Altamaha Sound, GA to Cape Fear, NC...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce potentially historic rainfall
totals of 10 to 20 inches, with maximum amounts of 25 inches,
bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of southeast
Georgia, the eastern half of South Carolina, and southeast North
Carolina through Friday.
 
From northern North Carolina through portions of the Mid-Atlantic
States, 4 to 8 inches of rainfall, with local amounts to 12 inches,
are expected through Sunday morning. This rainfall will likely
result in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with river
flooding possible.
 
An additional scattered 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, with maximum
amounts of 4 inches is possible across western portion of the
Central Florida Peninsula today which may aggravate any ongoing
flooding conditions across that vicinity.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with  Debby, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.  For a list of
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the WMO header ACUS44
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible over coastal South Carolina
tonight through early Wednesday morning.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Debby are expected to affect much of the
Gulf coast of Florida through tonight.  Swells will continue to
affect the Southeast U.S. coast through the end of the week.
These conditions are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.

<title>Tropical Storm Debby Forecast Discussion Number 16</title>

Tropical Storm Debby Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042024
500 AM EDT Tue Aug 06 2024
 
Debby's center is just inland of the Georgia coast while most of
the deep convection is oriented in a couple of bands over the
Atlantic waters feeding northwestward into South Carolina.
Scatterometer data from late last evening indicated that the
tropical-storm-force wind field had expanded eastward over the
Atlantic waters, and that the maximum sustained winds were near 40
kt.  This was confirmed by a few observations of 35-40 kt sustained
winds along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina.  The initial
intensity is therefore held at 40 kt.
 
Debby continues to move northeastward, or 050/6 kt, but the storm
will be trapped in a weak steering regime for the next couple of
days.  The center is likely to move offshore the Georgia coast
later today, but then meander off the coast of South Carolina
through early Thursday.  After that time, a strengthening ridge
over the western Atlantic and an approaching mid-latitude trough
over the upper Midwest should cause Debby to move faster toward the
north across the Carolinas and then into the Mid-Atlantic region
late this week.  The updated NHC track forecast is a bit west of
the previous forecast starting at about 48 hours, trending in the
direction of the HCCA and TVCA consensus aids.
 
Little change in Debby's intensity is expected today and tonight as
the center moves offshore.  However, some strengthening is forecast
beginning on Wednesday due to the storm being in a low-shear
environment and over very warm waters of about 29 degrees Celsius.
The NHC intensity forecast continues to show a peak intensity of 50
kt in 48 hours, just before the center reaches the coast again,
which is near the top end of the guidance.  Weakening is expected
to begin in 60 hours once the center moves inland.  The cyclone is
likely to merge with a front over the eastern United States in 4 to
5 days.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Potentially historic heavy rainfall across southeast Georgia and
eastern South Carolina through Friday will likely result in areas of
catastrophic flooding. Heavy rainfall will likely result in flooding
impacts from northern North Carolina through portions of
Mid-Atlantic States and southern New England through Sunday
morning.
 
2. Dangerous storm surge and tropical storm conditions will spread
northward along the southeast U.S. coast from northeastern Florida
to North Carolina through the middle of the week. Storm surge and
tropical storm watches and warnings have been issued for portions of
these areas. Residents in the storm surge watch and warning area
should follow any advice given by local officials.
 
3. In portions of Florida where Debby has passed, deadly hazards
remain, including downed power lines and flooded areas. Ensure
generators are properly ventilated to avoid carbon monoxide
poisoning.  Exercise caution when using chainsaws and power tools,
and drink plenty of water to avoid heat exhaustion.
