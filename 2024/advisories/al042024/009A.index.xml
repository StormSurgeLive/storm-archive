Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Debby, located over the eastern Gulf of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
East of the Windward Islands:<br/>
A tropical wave located a few hundred miles to the east of the <br/>
Windward Islands continues to produce an area of showers and <br/>
thunderstorms, and earlier satellite wind data showed winds of 30-35 <br/>
mph just north of the wave axis. Environmental conditions appear <br/>
generally favorable for some slow development of this system over <br/>
the next week as the system moves quickly westward at around 20 mph, <br/>
crossing the Windward Islands early this week and moving into the <br/>
central and western Caribbean by the mid to latter part of this <br/>
week. <br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Debby was
located near latitude 27.3 North, longitude 84.4 West.  Debby is
moving toward the north-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A turn
toward the north is expected later today, followed by a slower
motion toward the northeast on Monday and Tuesday.  On the forecast
track, the center will move across the northeastern Gulf of Mexico
through tonight and reach the Florida Big Bend coast Monday morning.
Debby is then expected to move slowly across northern Florida and
southern Georgia Monday and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Rapid strengthening is forecast, and Debby is expected to 
become a hurricane by tonight before it reaches the Florida Big 
Bend coast.  Weakening is expected on Monday and Tuesday
after Debby moves inland.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Hurricane Hunter 
observations is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area and possible in the hurricane watch areas early Monday, with
tropical storm conditions expected to arrive this evening. Tropical
storm conditions are expected to spread northward over the tropical
storm warning areas through tonight. Tropical storm conditions are
possible in the watch area in the Florida Panhandle on Monday, and
along the coast of Georgia and South Carolina Monday night.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Suwannee River to Ochlockonee River, FL...6-10 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Suwannee River, FL...5-8 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Indian Pass, FL...4-6 ft
Tampa Bay...3-5 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Yankeetown, FL...3-5 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...2-4 ft
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to South Santee River, SC...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce rainfall totals of 6 to 12
inches, with maximum amounts of 18 inches, across portions of
northern Florida through Friday morning.  This rainfall will likely
result in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding.
 
Across portions of southeast Georgia and South Carolina, 10 to 20
inches of rainfall, with local amounts to 30 inches, are expected
through Friday morning.  This potentially historic rainfall may
result in areas of catastrophic flooding.
 
For western Cuba, additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches, with
localized higher amounts, will be possible through today. This will
result in isolated to scattered areas of flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Debby, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible through Monday morning,
mainly over western and northern Florida and southern Georgia.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Debby are expected to affect much of the
Gulf coast of Florida through Monday.  Swells will begin to affect
the Southeast U.S. coast on Monday and continue through the middle
of the week. These conditions are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Tropical Storm Debby Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

WTNT44 KNHC 041457
TCDAT4
 
Tropical Storm Debby Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042024
1100 AM EDT Sun Aug 04 2024
 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft observations indicate that Debby
continues to intensify over the eastern Gulf of Mexico.  Satellite
imagery shows that the cloud pattern is becoming better developed
with increasing deep convection near the center of circulation, and
WSR-88D radar data indicate that an eyewall is beginning to form.
The current intensity estimate is estimated to be 55 kt based on a
significant drop in central pressure reported the aircraft. 
 
The cyclone has been turning gradually to the right and the initial 
motion is north-northwestward or 330/11 kt.  Over the next day or 
so, Debby should move through a weakness in the mid-level 
subtropical ridge over the southeastern United States and reach the 
northeast Gulf of Mexico coast in the Florida Big Bend region on 
Monday.  After the system makes landfall, the steering currents are 
likely to weaken as a trough over the northeastern U.S. moves 
eastward from the area, which should result in a decrease in forward 
speed.  There is significant uncertainty in the track of Debby in 
the 2-5 day time frame.  Much of the track guidance keeps the center 
over the southeastern U.S. for the next several days as a ridge 
builds in over the Carolinas.  The official track forecast is 
similar to the previous one and close to the HFIP corrected 
consensus prediction.  This keeps the slow-moving center near the 
Georgia and South Carolina coast in the 3 to 5 day time-frame. 
 
Debby will be moving over very warm waters and in a low-vertical 
shear environment prior to landfall.  Therefore significant 
strengthening is likely through tonight, especially if the cyclone 
forms a well-defined inner core The official forecast is near the 
high side of the objective guidance and calls for the system to 
become a hurricane within 12 hours.  The cyclone will weaken after 
it moves inland, but since the system will not be far from the 
coastline for the next few days, it is not predicted to fall below 
tropical storm strength through 72 hours.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall will likely result in considerable flooding
impacts from the Florida Big Bend region through southeast GA and
the Coastal Plain of the Carolinas through Friday. Potentially
historic heavy rainfall across southeast Georgia and South Carolina
through Friday morning may result in areas of catastrophic 
flooding. Significant river flooding is also expected. 
 
2. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge along portions
of the Gulf Coast of Florida, with 6 to 10 feet of inundation above
ground level expected somewhere between Ochlockonee River and
Suwannee River on Monday. Residents in the Storm Surge Warning area
should follow any advice given by local officials.
 
3.  Hurricane conditions are expected Monday along portions of the 
Florida Big Bend region where a Hurricane Warning is in effect, with 
tropical storm conditions beginning this evening. Tropical storm 
conditions are expected through Monday farther south within the 
Tropical Storm Warning along Florida's west coast, including the 
Tampa Bay area.
 
4. Impacts from storm surge and strong winds are possible along the
southeast coast from Georgia to North Carolina through the middle of
the week, and storm surge watches and tropical storm watches have
been issued for portions of these areas. Additional watches and
warnings will likely be required later today.
