DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Debby was
located by an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 
32.2 North, longitude 79.4 West.  Debby is moving toward the 
northeast near 4 mph (6 km/h).  A turn toward the north and 
north-northwest is expected today, bringing the center of Debby to 
the South Carolina coast by tonight or early Thursday.  A faster 
motion toward the north and north-northeast across the Carolinas and 
the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region is expected on Thursday and Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is possible today or tonight before the
center of Debby reaches the coast of South Carolina.  Weakening is
forecast to begin on Thursday after the center moves inland.  Debby
is expected to merge with a frontal boundary over the U.S.
Mid-Atlantic states on Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.  A wind gust to 44 mph (70 km/h) was recently 
reported at Murells Inlet South Carolina.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue along the
coast of South Carolina within the tropical storm warning area
through Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected
within the tropical storm warning area and possible within the
tropical storm watch area in North Carolina today and continuing 
through Thursday.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
South Santee River, SC to Cape Fear, NC...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce an additional 3 to 9 inches
of rainfall with locally higher amounts, leading to maximum storm
total amounts as high as 25 inches in South Carolina and 15 inches
in southeast North Carolina, broadening the area of considerable
flooding across portions of South Carolina and southeast North
Carolina through Friday.
 
An additional 1 to 2 inches of rainfall with locally higher amounts
is possible across southeast Georgia through Thursday, bringing
overall storm total amounts as high as 15 inches, which may
aggravate any ongoing flooding conditions.
 
From the Piedmont of South Carolina northward across portions of
Virginia, 3 to 7 inches with local amounts to 10 inches, are
expected through Friday. This rainfall will likely result in areas
of considerable flash and urban flooding, with river flooding
possible.
 
From Maryland north through Upstate New York and Vermont, 2 to 4
inches, with local amounts to 6 inches, are expected through
Saturday morning. This will likely produce considerable flash and
urban flooding as well as river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with  Debby, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.  For a list of
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the WMO header ACUS44
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.
 
TORNADOES: A tornado or two may occur over eastern North Carolina
and extreme eastern South Carolina through tonight.
 
SURF:  Large swells will continue to affect the Southeast U.S.
coast through the end of the week. These conditions are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Debby Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042024
500 AM EDT Wed Aug 07 2024
 
Debby's circulation consists of a nearly 60 nm wide convection-free
region near the center, which is drifting eastward off the coast of
South Carolina.  Moderate to deep convection is organized in broken
bands well away from the center, with the strongest band currently
feeding into eastern North Carolina.  The storm appears to have
strengthened slightly now that a greater proportion of the
circulation is back over water, and the initial intensity is set at
40 kt based on a 0143 UTC ASCAT-B pass.
 
The longer-term motion is slowly eastward, or 085/4 kt.  Although
Debby is expected to maintain a slow motion for the next 24 hours or
so, a mid-level ridge over the western and central Atlantic should
cause the storm to turn northward today, with the center reaching
the coast of South Carolina by tonight.  Debby should then
accelerate toward the north and northeast beginning on Thursday over
the eastern United States and eastern Canada, ahead of a deep-layer
trough moving across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes region.  No
changes were required to the new NHC track forecast, which lies on
top of the previous forecast and down the middle of the guidance
envelope.
 
Debby's structure does not argue for any type of significant
strengthening, but warm ocean waters of 29 degrees Celsius and low
shear could allow the wind field to strengthen a bit over the next
24 hours while the circulation remains over water.  A peak intensity
of 45 kt is shown at 12 and 24 hours, which is generally in line
with the bulk of the intensity guidance.  Weakening is forecast to
begin by 36 hours once the center moves inland, and global model
fields and phase-space diagrams indicate that Debby is likely to be
absorbed by a front and become extratropical by 60 hours over the
Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall across portions of eastern South Carolina and
southeast North Carolina is expected to persist through Thursday
which would broaden areas of considerable flooding. Expected heavy
rainfall will likely result in considerable flooding impacts from
the Piedmont of the Carolinas, portions of the Mid-Atlantic States,
and Vermont through Saturday morning.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions will spread northward along the
southeast U.S. coast from South Carolina to North Carolina through
Thursday.  Tropical storm warnings and watches are in effect
for portions of that area.
 
3. A dangerous storm surge is possible along the coast of South
Carolina and southeastern North Carolina from South Santee River to
Cape Fear.  Residents in that area should follow any advice given by
local officials.
