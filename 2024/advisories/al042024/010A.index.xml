DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Debby was
located near latitude 28.1 North, longitude 84.1 West.  Debby is
moving toward the north near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A gradual decrease
in forward speed with a turn toward the northeast and east is
expected on Monday and Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center
will move across the northeastern Gulf of Mexico through tonight and
reach the Florida Big Bend coast around midday Monday.  Debby is
then expected to move slowly across northern Florida and southern
Georgia Monday and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Rapid strengthening is forecast, and Debby is 
expected to become a hurricane tonight, with additional 
strengthening likely before it reaches the Florida Big Bend coast 
on Monday.  Weakening is expected on Monday and Tuesday after Debby 
moves inland.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center. NOAA Buoy 42036 recently reported sustained winds 
of 45 mph (72 km/h) with a gust to 56 mph (90 km/h).  A wind gust 
to 60 mph (96 km/h) has been reported at Sarasota, Florida, within 
the past hour and a wind gust to 56 mph (90 km/h) was recently 
reported at Albert Whitted Airport in St. Petersburg, Florida. 
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from data from a NOAA 
reconnaissance aircraft is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area and are possible in the hurricane watch area by early Monday, 
with tropical storm conditions expected to arrive later this 
evening and overnight. Tropical storm conditions will continue 
to spread northward over the tropical storm warning area along the 
Florida Gulf coast through tonight, and begin along portions of the 
tropical storm warning area along the Atlantic coast by late 
Monday. Tropical storm conditions are possible along the coast of 
South Carolina within the tropical storm watch area late Monday 
night.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Suwannee River to Ochlockonee River, FL...6-10 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Suwannee River, FL...5-8 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Indian Pass, FL...4-6 ft
Tampa Bay...3-5 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Yankeetown, FL...3-5 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...2-4 ft
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to South Santee River, SC...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce rainfall totals of 6 to 12
inches, with maximum amounts of 18 inches, across portions of
northern Florida and southeastern North Carolina through Friday
morning.  This rainfall will likely result in areas of considerable
flash and urban flooding, with significant river flooding expected.
 
Across portions of southeast Georgia and South Carolina, 10 to 20
inches of rainfall, with local amounts to 30 inches, are expected
through Friday morning.  This potentially historic rainfall will
likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding.
 
For western Cuba, additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches, with
localized higher amounts, will be possible through today. This will
result in isolated to scattered areas of flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Debby, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible over central and northern
Florida and southern Georgia tonight and Monday.  The threat will
spread northeastward into coastal Georgia and parts of South
Carolina on Monday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Debby are expected to affect much of the
Gulf coast of Florida through Monday.  Swells will begin to affect
the Southeast U.S. coast on Monday and continue through the middle
of the week. These conditions are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.

Tropical Storm Debby Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042024
500 PM EDT Sun Aug 04 2024
 
Debby's cloud pattern continues to show increasing organization on
satellite images although there is limited deep convection over the
southwest quadrant of the circulation.  The upper-level
anticyclonic outflow pattern is well-defined.  The latest Air Force
Hurricane Hunter aircraft observations indicated that the central
pressure hadn't changed much and the wind data from the aircraft
continued to support an intensity of near 55 kt.  WSR-88D radar
imagery shows that an eyewall may be trying to close off, and 
another Hurricane Hunter aircraft will be investigating Debby in a 
few hours to assess the strength of the cyclone.

The cyclone has turned toward the north and is now moving at around 
360/10 kt.  Debby should continue to move through a break in the 
subtropical ridge due to a trough over the eastern United States 
for the next day or so, and this motion should bring the center of 
the system to the northeast Gulf of Mexico coast around midday 
tomorrow.  Thereafter, the trough moves eastward, leaving Debby in 
weak steering currents for a few days.  The track guidance shows 
decreasing forward speed and a turn to the east in 24-48 hours.  
Some of the track models show the cyclone moving temporarily over 
the Atlantic in the 72-hour time frame, and so does the official 
forecast.
 
Debby will continue to move over waters of high heat content 
and remain in an environment of low vertical wind shear into Monday 
morning.  Some dry air intrusion over the southwestern portion of 
the circulation may have temporarily interrupted the intensification 
process.  However, given the favorable oceanic and shear 
conditions, significant strengthening is expected before landfall.
Rapid intensification is especially likely if Debby acquires a 
well-defined inner core.  The official intensity forecast is at the 
high end of the model guidance.  Although weakening will occur 
after landfall, the longer-term strength of the system is 
largely dependent on how long it remains over land.  Currently the 
official forecast shows some re-intensification with Debby moving 
into the Atlantic, but how much the system will restrengthen is 
highly uncertain.


Key Messages:
 
1. Potentially historic heavy rainfall across southeast Georgia and 
South Carolina through Friday morning will likely result in areas of 
catastrophic flooding.  Heavy rainfall will likely result in 
considerable flooding impacts from the Florida Big Bend region 
through southeast GA and the Coastal Plain of the Carolinas through 
Friday.
 
2. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge along portions 
of the Gulf Coast of Florida, with 6 to 10 feet of inundation above 
ground level expected somewhere between Ochlockonee River and 
Suwannee River on Monday. Residents in the Storm Surge Warning area 
should follow any advice given by local officials. 

3.  Hurricane conditions are expected Monday along portions of the 
Florida Big Bend region where a Hurricane Warning is in effect, with 
tropical storm conditions beginning this evening. Tropical storm 
conditions are expected through Monday farther south within the 
Tropical Storm Warning along Florida's west coast, including the 
Tampa Bay area.

4. Dangerous storm surge and wind impacts are expected along 
portions of the southeast U.S. coast from northeastern Florida to 
North Carolina through the middle of the week, and storm surge 
warnings and tropical storm watches and warnings have been issued 
for portions of these areas.
