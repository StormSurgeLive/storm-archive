discontinued.
 
The Tropical Storm Warning south of the middle of Longboat Key is
discontinued.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Storm Surge Warning is in effect for...
* Florida coast from the middle of Longboat Key northward to the 
Ochlockonee River

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
A Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening
inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline. For
a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at

This is a life-threatening situation.  Persons located within these
areas should take all necessary actions to protect life and property
from rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions.
Promptly follow evacuation and other instructions from local

Interests elsewhere along the southeastern coast of the United
States should monitor the progress of this system. Additional
watches and warnings will likely be required later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Debby was
located near latitude 30.2 North, longitude 83.2 West. Debby is
moving toward the north-northeast near 8 mph (13 km/h). A gradual
decrease in forward speed with a turn toward the east is expected 
later today and Tuesday. On the forecast track, the center will 
move across southeastern Georgia tonight and Tuesday, and move 
offshore of the South Carolina coast by late Tuesday and Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional weakening is forecast during the 
next 48 hours.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center. An observing station at Live Oak East recently 
reported a wind gust to 54 mph (87 km/h). A WeatherFlow site near 
the entrance to the St. Johns River in Jacksonville reported a wind 
gust to 48 mph (77 km/h) during the last hour.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 983 mb (29.03 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue over portions of the 
tropical storm warning area along the Florida Gulf coast today, and 
begin along portions of the tropical storm warning area along the 
Atlantic coast this afternoon. Tropical storm conditions are 
expected along the coast of South Carolina within the tropical storm 
warning area by late tonight or early Tuesday.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Yankeetown, FL to Aucilla River, FL...4-6 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Yankeetown, FL...3-5 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...2-4 ft
Aucilla River, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...2-4 ft
Tampa Bay...2-4 ft
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to South Santee River, SC...2-4 ft

For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce rainfall totals of 6 to 12
inches, with maximum amounts of 18 inches, across portions of
central and northern Florida as well as central and northeast North
Carolina through Wednesday morning.  This rainfall will likely
result in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with
significant river flooding expected.
 
Across portions of southeast Georgia, the coastal plain of South
Carolina, and southeast North Carolina, 10 to 20 inches of rainfall,
with local amounts to 30 inches, are expected through Saturday
morning.  This potentially historic rainfall will likely result in
areas of catastrophic flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Debby, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.  For a list of
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the WMO header ACUS44
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible over central and northern
Florida and southeastern Georgia today.  The threat will spread
northeastward into parts of South Carolina later today and tonight.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Debby are expected to affect much of the
Gulf coast of Florida through tonight.  Swells will begin to affect
the Southeast U.S. coast later today and continue through the
middle of the week. These conditions are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Debby Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042024
1100 AM EDT Mon Aug 05 2024

Debby's center made landfall in the Florida Big Bend region earlier 
today around 1100 UTC with an estimated intensity of 70 kt.  Since 
landfall, the system has moved over northern Florida while gradually 
weakening below hurricane intensity.  Assuming a typical rate of 
weakening over land, the current intensity is set at 60 kt.  WSR-88D 
Doppler velocities still show hurricane-force winds aloft, at an 
elevation of about 3500 ft, over the northeastern quadrant of the 
cyclone.  Therefore, some damaging winds could still be brought down 
to the surface in the more vigorous convection near the inland path 
of Debby.  

Debby has been moving through a break in the subtropical ridge with 
an estimated initial motion of 030/7 kt.  Steering currents are 
expected to weaken some more, resulting in a further decrease in 
forward speed.  Most of the track guidance turns Debby eastward, 
with the center moving off the coast near the Georgia/South 
Carolina border in about 36 hours.  Debby should move very slowly 
near the South Carolina coast through 60 hours or so.  Then, a 
mid-level ridge builds slightly to the northeast of the cyclone, 
which should push the system back inland over the latter part of 
the forecast period.  The official forecast track is a blend of the 
simple and corrected dynamical consensus models, TVCA and HCCA.

Continued weakening is expected while the center of Debby remains 
over land tonight and Tuesday.  By late Tuesday and thereafter, 
some restrengthening is anticipated as the center moves offshore. 
However the amount that the cyclone re-intensifies is dependent on 
how far out over the Atlantic the system moves and how long it 
remains over water.  The current official forecast shows only 
modest restrengthening, given the uncertainties.

Going forward, the biggest threat from this slow-moving system 
system is extreme precipitation and flooding over the southeastern 
United States.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Potentially historic heavy rainfall across southeast Georgia and 
the coastal plain of South Carolina through Saturday morning will 
likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding. Heavy rainfall will 
likely result in considerable flooding impacts from portions of 
central and northern Florida and across portions of central and 
northeast North Carolina through Saturday morning.
 
2. Dangerous storm surge inundation will continue in the Storm Surge 
warning area along the Gulf Coast of Florida, including the Tampa 
Bay area, through this afternoon. 

3. Tropical storm conditions will continue along portions of the 
Gulf Coast of Florida today within the Tropical Storm warning area. 

4. Dangerous storm surge and tropical storm conditions will spread 
northward along the southeast U.S. coast from northeastern Florida 
to North Carolina through the middle of the week. Storm Surge and 
Tropical Storm warnings have been issued for portions of these 
areas, and additional watches and warnings will likely be issued 
later today. Residents in the Storm Surge Warning area should follow 
any advice given by local officials.
