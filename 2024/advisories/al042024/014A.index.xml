DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Debby was
located near latitude 30.7 North, longitude 82.4 West.  Debby is
moving toward the northeast near 6 mph (9 km/h).  A turn toward the
east is expected on Tuesday, followed by a turn to the north at a
slow forward speed on Wednesday. On the forecast track, the center
will move across southeastern Georgia tonight and Tuesday, move
offshore of the South Carolina coast by late Tuesday and Wednesday,
and approach the South Carolina coast on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Some slight additional weakening is forecast 
tonight and Tuesday.  Some re-strengthening is possible on Wednesday 
and Thursday when Debby moves off the southeastern U.S. coast.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
tropical storm warning area along the Florida and Georgia Atlantic
coast through tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are expected along
the coast of South Carolina within the tropical storm warning area
by late tonight or early Tuesday. Tropical storm conditions are 
possible within the tropical storm watch area in South and North 
Carolina beginning Wednesday. 
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to Cape Fear, NC...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce rainfall totals of 6 to 12
inches, with maximum amounts of 18 inches, across portions of
central and northern Florida as well as central and northeast North
Carolina through Wednesday morning.  This rainfall will likely
result in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with
significant river flooding expected.
 
Across portions of southeast Georgia, the coastal plain of South
Carolina, and southeast North Carolina, 10 to 20 inches of rainfall,
with local amounts to 30 inches, are expected through Saturday
morning.  This potentially historic rainfall will likely result in
areas of catastrophic flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Debby, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.  For a list of
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the WMO header ACUS44
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible over southeastern Georgia
and coastal South Carolina this evening through Tuesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Debby are expected to affect much of the
Gulf coast of Florida through tonight.  Swells will continue to
affect the Southeast U.S. coast through the middle of the week.
These conditions are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 1100 PM EDT.

Tropical Storm Debby Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042024
500 PM EDT Mon Aug 05 2024

Debby continues to move over land, and based on surface synoptic 
and radar observations the center is estimated to be near the 
Florida/Georgia border.  Assuming a continued weakening since 
landfall, the intensity estimate has been reduced to 45 kt, which is 
reasonably consistent with the latest WSR-88D radar velocities 
aloft.

Debby continues to move through a weakness in the subtropical high, 
and the forward motion has slowed to about 035/6 kt.  The cyclone 
is expected to turn eastward, while moving quite slowly, in a 
region of weak steering currents for the next couple of days.  This 
motion should bring the center of the system back over water by 
late Tuesday.  In around 72 hours, a mid-level ridge to the east 
of Debby is forecast to build somewhat, and as a result, the center 
should move inland over South Carolina and turn northward and 
northeastward over the eastern U.S. for the remainder of the 
forecast period.  The NHC track forecast is similar to the previous 
one and is in good agreement with the corrected model consensus, 
HCCA, guidance.

The tropical cyclone should continue to weaken while it moves over 
land for the next day or so.  By late Tuesday, assuming the center 
of the system moves back over water, some re-intensification is 
forecast.  The NHC forecast continues to show only modest 
restrengthening due to the uncertainties, although this may be 
conservative.

Given the sluggish forward motion of Debby, extremely large amounts 
of rainfall over the Southeastern U.S. is anticipated.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Potentially historic heavy rainfall across southeast Georgia and 
the coastal plain of South Carolina through Saturday morning will 
likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding. Heavy rainfall will 
likely result in considerable flooding impacts from portions of 
central and northern Florida and across portions of central and 
northeast North Carolina through Saturday morning. 
 
2. Dangerous storm surge and tropical storm conditions will spread 
northward along the southeast U.S. coast from northeastern Florida 
to North Carolina through the middle of the week. Storm Surge and 
Tropical Storm watches and warnings have been issued for portions of 
these areas. Residents in the Storm Surge watch and warning area 
should follow any advice given by local officials. 

3. In portions of Florida where Debby has passed, deadly hazards 
remain, including downed power lines and flooded areas. Ensure 
generators are properly ventilated to avoid carbon monoxide 
poisoning.  Exercise caution when using chainsaws and power tools, 
and drink plenty of water to avoid heat exhaustion.
