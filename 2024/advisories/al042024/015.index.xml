DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Debby was
located near latitude 31.1 North, longitude 82.1 West. Debby is
moving toward the northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A turn toward 
the east is expected on Tuesday, followed by a turn to the north at 
a slow forward speed on Wednesday. On the forecast track, the center
will move across southeastern Georgia tonight, and then off the 
Georgia coast Tuesday and Wednesday, and approach the South 
Carolina coast on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some slight weakening is forecast tonight or early Tuesday.  Some 
re-strengthening is possible on Wednesday and Thursday when Debby 
is off the southeastern U.S. coast.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
tropical storm warning area along the Florida and Georgia Atlantic
coast through early Tuesday.  Tropical storm conditions are 
expected along the coast of South Carolina within the tropical 
storm warning area by late tonight or early Tuesday.  Tropical 
storm conditions are possible within the tropical storm watch area 
in North Carolina beginning Wednesday night.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to Cape Fear, NC...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce potentially historic 
rainfall totals of 10 to 20 inches, with maximum amounts of 30 
inches, bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of 
eastern Georgia, the coastal plain of South Carolina, and southeast 
North Carolina through Wednesday.  Across portions of central and 
northeast North Carolina, 6 to 12 inches of rainfall, with local 
amounts to 18 inches, are expected through Saturday morning. This 
rainfall will likely result in areas of considerable flash and urban 
flooding, with significant river flooding expected.  

An additional scattered 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, with maximum 
amounts of 4 inches is possible across western portions of the 
Central Florida Peninsula which may aggravate any ongoing flooding 
conditions across that area.  
  
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with  Debby, please see the National Weather Service 
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.  For a list of 
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see 
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the WMO header ACUS44 
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html. 
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible over southeastern Georgia 
and coastal South Carolina tonight through Tuesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Debby are expected to affect much of the
Gulf coast of Florida through tonight.  Swells will continue to
affect the Southeast U.S. coast through the middle of the week.
These conditions are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.

Tropical Storm Debby Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042024
1100 PM EDT Mon Aug 05 2024
 
The center of Debby has continued to move northeastward over
southeastern Georgia this evening. Earlier in the evening, there
were a few reports of sustained winds of 34-36 kt along portions of
the Georgia coast, which supported the 40-kt intensity on the
intermediate advisory at 0000 UTC.  Although there have not been
reports that high in the past hour or two, the initial intensity is
maintained at 40 kt as the strongest winds are likely occuring in
bands offshore.
 
The initial motion estimate is 050/5 kt. The steering currents are
forecast to weaken further over the next couple of days, and
a slow eastward motion should begin on Tuesday when Debby is near
the Georgia coast.  An even slower northward motion is expected on
Wednesday, which should bring the center toward the coast of South
Carolina Wednesday night or Thursday. Toward the end of the week,
most of the track guidance suggests that Debby may begin to move a
little faster toward the north in southerly flow between a
building ridge over the western Atlantic and a mid-level trough
over the Great Lakes and southern Canada.  Although there is still
low confidence in the specifics of the track forecast, there is high
confidence that Debby will be meandering near the southeastern U.S.
coast for the next few days.  The latest NHC track forecast is
similar to the HFIP corrected consensus model (HCCA) through 72
hours and lies between that model and the simple multi-model
consensus (TVCA) at the longer range.
 
Debby is likely to weaken a little more while it moves over land
through early Tuesday.  After that, the center is forecast to move
offshore, which should allow for some gradual re-intensification.
The NHC intensity forecast follows the bulk of the guidance and
shows only modest strengthening before the center moves back
onshore.
 
Given the sluggish forward motion of Debby, extremely large rainfall
amounts are expected over portions of the Southeastern United
States.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Potentially historic heavy rainfall across southeast Georgia and 
the coastal plain of South Carolina through Saturday morning will 
likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding. Heavy rainfall will 
likely result in considerable flooding impacts for portions of 
central and northern Florida and across portions of central and 
northeast North Carolina through Saturday morning. 
 
2. Dangerous storm surge and tropical storm conditions will spread
northward along the southeast U.S. coast from northeastern Florida
to North Carolina through the middle of the week. Storm surge and
tropical storm watches and warnings have been issued for portions of
these areas. Residents in the storm surge watch and warning area
should follow any advice given by local officials.
 
3. In portions of Florida where Debby has passed, deadly hazards
remain, including downed power lines and flooded areas. Ensure
generators are properly ventilated to avoid carbon monoxide
poisoning.  Exercise caution when using chainsaws and power tools,
and drink plenty of water to avoid heat exhaustion.
