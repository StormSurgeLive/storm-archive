DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Debby was
located near latitude 32.9 North, longitude 79.5 West. Debby is
moving toward the north-northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h). This 
general motion is expected to continue through Thursday, bringing 
the center across the South Carolina coast during the next several 
hours. A faster motion toward the north and north-northeast across 
the Carolinas and the U.S. Mid-Atlantic states is expected later on 
Thursday and on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast to begin on Thursday after the center moves 
inland. Debby is expected to merge with a frontal boundary over the 
U.S. Mid-Atlantic states on Friday or Friday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
mainly to the east of the center. NOAA buoy 41013 near Frying Pan 
Shoals, North Carolina, recently reported sustained winds of 38 
mph (61 km/h) and a wind gust of 45 mph (72 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface 
observations and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft data 
is 994 mb (29.36 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue along the
coast of South Carolina within the tropical storm warning area
through Thursday. Tropical storm conditions are expected within the
tropical storm warning area and possible within the tropical storm
watch area in North Carolina tonight through Thursday.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
South Santee River to Ocracoke Inlet including the Neuse and
Pamlico Rivers...1 to 3 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce an additional 3 to 9 inches
of rainfall with locally higher amounts, leading to maximum storm
total amounts as high as 25 inches in eastern South Carolina and 15
inches in southeast North Carolina with considerable flooding
expected across portions of eastern South Carolina and southeast
North Carolina through Friday.
 
An additional 1 to 2 inches of rainfall with locally higher amounts
is possible across southeast Georgia through Thursday, bringing
overall storm total amounts as high as 15 inches, which may
aggravate any ongoing flooding conditions.
 
From the piedmont of South Carolina northward across portions of
Virginia, 3 to 7 inches with local amounts to 10 inches, are
expected through Friday. This rainfall will likely result in areas
of considerable flash and urban flooding, with river flooding
possible.
 
From Maryland north through Upstate New York and Vermont, 2 to 4
inches, with local amounts to 6 inches, are expected through
Saturday morning. This will likely produce considerable flash and
urban flooding as well as river flooding.
 
For Long Island and the remainder of New England, 1 to 2 inches,
with local amounts to 4 inches, are expected into Saturday.
Scattered instances of flash flooding are possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with  Debby, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
For a list of rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated
this storm, see the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the
WMO header ACUS44 KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes may occur over parts of eastern North 
Carolina overnight. The risk of tornadoes will shift northward on 
Thursday into central North Carolina and central Virginia.
 
SURF:  Large swells will continue to affect the Southeast U.S.
coast through the end of the week. These conditions are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Debby Forecast Discussion Number 22</title>

Tropical Storm Debby Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042024
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
500 PM EDT Wed Aug 07 2024

Debby is producing small, broken bands of convection around its
center this afternoon. The storm continues to meander around NOAA
buoy 41004, and data from that station indicate the central pressure
remains around 995 mb. The Air Force Hurricane Hunters reported peak
SFMR winds of 47 kt within convection to the northeast of the center
during their last pass through the storm a few hours ago. Based on
these data and the earlier flight-level winds, the initial intensity
is held at 50 kt.
 
Although the storm is moving over warm waters, it lacks an inner
core and has a large radius of maximum wind. Therefore, only modest
strengthening is forecast during the next 12 h while the system
approaches South Carolina, in best agreement with some of the
statistical guidance. Once inland, Debby is expected to quickly lose
tropical characteristics and weaken. The interaction of Debby with
the upper trough will lead to a baroclinic transition as the low
merges with a frontal zone and becomes extratropical. The NHC
forecast shows this occurring by Friday. However, it is important to
note that these changes do not diminish the threat of heavy rainfall
and flooding across portions of the Carolinas, Mid-Atlantic, and
northeastern United States during the next few days.
 
The long-term motion of Debby is a north-northeastward drift within 
weak steering currents between two subtropical high pressure areas. 
However, more recent fixes suggest the system may be turning 
northward as expected, with a ridge beginning to build to the east 
of Debby over the western Atlantic. Thus, a north-northwestward to 
northward motion is expected through tonight while Debby approaches 
the coast of South Carolina. After landfall, Debby will become 
caught in southerly to southwesterly flow ahead of a mid-latitude 
trough near the Great Lakes region. This will cause the storm to 
accelerate north-northeastward to northeastward on Friday and into 
the weekend. With the guidance in good agreement on this scenario, 
little change was made to the updated NHC track forecast.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall across portions of the Carolinas is expected to
persist through Thursday along with areas of considerable flooding.
Expected heavy rainfall will also result in considerable flooding
impacts across portions of the Mid-Atlantic States and Northeast
through Saturday morning.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions will affect portions of the South
Carolina and North Carolina coast through Thursday. Tropical storm
warnings and watches are in effect for portions of that area.
 
3. Coastal flooding due to storm surge is likely along portions of
the South Carolina and North Carolina coastline through Thursday.
