DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Debby was
located near latitude 24.9 North, longitude 83.9 West.  Debby is
moving toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A turn toward
the north is expected later today, followed by a slower motion 
toward the northeast on Monday and Tuesday.  On the forecast track, 
the center will move across the eastern Gulf of Mexico through 
tonight and reach the Florida Big Bend coast Monday morning.  The
center is then expected to move slowly across northern Florida and
southern Georgia Monday and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Strengthening is forecast, and Debby is expected to become a 
hurricane by tonight before it reaches the Florida Big Bend coast.  
Weakening is expected on Monday and Tuesday after Debby moves 
inland.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.  Wind gusts of 45 mph (72 km/h) and 41 mph (67
km/h) were recently reported at Sand Key and the Key West Naval Air 
Station in the Florida Keys, respectively.
 
The minimum central pressure is estimated to be 1003 mb (29.62 
inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area and possible in the hurricane watch areas on Monday, with
tropical storm conditions expected to arrive this evening.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread northward over the
tropical storm warning areas through tonight. Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the watch area in the Florida Keys
during the next several hours, and in the Florida Panhandle on 
Monday.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Suwannee River to Aucilla River, FL...6-10 ft
Yankeetown to Suwannee River, FL ...4-7 ft
Aucilla River to Ochlockonee River, FL...4-6 ft
Aripeka to Yankeetown, FL...3-5 ft
Ochlockonee River to Indian Pass, FL...3-5 ft
Bonita Beach to Aripeka, FL...2-4 ft
Tampa Bay...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Debby is expected to produce rainfall 
totals of 10 to 20 inches, with maximum rainfall totals towards 30 
inches, across portions of northern Florida and along the Southeast 
U.S. coast through Friday morning. This rainfall will likely result 
in areas of severe and widespread  flash and urban flooding, with 
significant river flooding expected.

For Cuba, additional rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches, with 
localized higher amounts, will be possible through Sunday morning. 
This will result in isolated to scattered areas of flooding.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Tropical Storm Debby, please see the National 
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Debby, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero
 
TORNADOES: A tornado or two is possible across the Florida Keys and
the southern and western parts of the Florida Peninsula overnight, 
expanding across much of northern and central Florida later today.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Debby are expected to affect much of the 
Gulf coast of Florida through Monday.  Swells will begin to affect 
the Southeast U.S. coast on Monday and continue through the middle 
of the week. These conditions are likely to cause life-threatening 
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your 
local weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Debby Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>
<description>Issued at 1100 PM EDT Sat Aug 03 2024  <![CDATA[<pre>

WTNT44 KNHC 040249
TCDAT4
 
Tropical Storm Debby Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042024
1100 PM EDT Sat Aug 03 2024
 
NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft have been 
investigating Debby during the past few hours and have found that 
the winds have increased slightly and the central pressure has 
fallen.  The NOAA P-3 plane reported SFMR measurements of 35-40 kt 
east of the center over the Straits of Florida, and dropsonde data 
indicate that the central pressure has fallen to 1003 mb.  The 
initial intensity is therefore raised to 40 kt.

Debby is gradually turning toward the right and slowing down, and 
the initial motion is northwestward, or 320/12 kt.  A large mid- to 
upper-level trough over the eastern United States has created a 
break in the subtropical ridge, which will cause Debby to move 
northward over the eastern Gulf of Mexico and approach the 
Florida Big Bend region over the next day or two.  The track 
guidance is in good agreement during this period, and the NHC track 
has only been shifted slightly east to account for a slight 
relocation of the initial position based on the aircraft data.  
After 2-3 days, the steering currents around Debby collapse, and 
the cyclone is expected to creep northeastward at less than 5 kt 
across northern Florida to near the coasts of Georgia and South 
Carolina by day 5.  While there is model disagreement on exactly 
where Debby will end up on day 5, there is high confidence that the 
storm will not be moving very fast, and this slow motion will have 
major implications for the associated hazards, particularly heavy 
rainfall and flooding.

Low vertical shear and very warm waters (as warm as 32 degrees 
Celsius within Apalachee Bay) are likely to support additional 
strengthening while Debby approaches the Florida Big Bend.  The 
intensity guidance has increased a bit on this cycle.  Most of the 
regional hurricane models are showing Debby reaching hurricane 
strength before it reaches the coast, while the 
statistical-dynamical SHIPS and LGEM models have increased to the 
75-80-kt range.  In addition, the Rapid Intensification indices are 
showing a 1-in-3 chance of a 45-kt increase in intensity over the 
next 36 hours.  Based on these model data, the NHC intensity 
forecast has been increased to 75 kt in 36 hours, just before the 
center of Debby is expected to reach the coast.  Weakening is 
anticipated after landfall, but Debby's intensity on days 3 through 
5 is highly uncertain and is dependent on whether the center moves 
over the Atlantic waters and for how long.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall will likely result in considerable flash and urban 
flooding across portions of Florida and the coastal areas of the 
Southeast through Thursday. Significant river flooding is also 
expected.
 
2.  Hurricane conditions are expected on Monday along portions of
the Florida Big Bend region where a Hurricane Warning is in effect,
with tropical storm conditions beginning late Sunday. Tropical storm
conditions are expected through Monday farther south within the
Tropical Storm Warning along Florida's west coast, including the
Tampa Bay area and the Lower Florida Keys.
 
3. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation
along portions of the Gulf coast of Florida from Aripeka to Indian
Pass. Life-threatening storm surge is possible south of Aripeka to
Bonita Beach, including Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor.
 
4. Impacts from storm surge, strong winds, and heavy rains are
possible elsewhere in Florida and along the southeast coast of the
United States from Georgia to North Carolina through the middle of
next week, and interests in those areas should continue to monitor
the progress of this system. Additional watches and warnings will
likely be required on Sunday.
