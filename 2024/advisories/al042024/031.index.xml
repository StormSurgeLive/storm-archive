Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Fri Aug 9 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The Weather Prediction Center is issuing advisories on Post-Tropical <br/>
Cyclone Debby, located inland over the northeastern United States.<br/>
<br/>
Near the Lesser and Greater Antilles:<br/>
Shower activity associated with a tropical wave located about 900 <br/>
miles west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands has become a little <br/>
better organized since yesterday.  Slow development of this system <br/>
is possible during the next couple of days while it moves westward <br/>
to west-northwestward across the central tropical Atlantic. <br/>
Conditions are expected to become more conducive for development <br/>
thereafter, and a tropical depression is likely to form by early <br/>
next week while the system approaches and then moves near or over <br/>
the Lesser Antilles. The system is forecast to continue moving <br/>
generally west-northwestward and could approach portions of the <br/>
Greater Antilles by the middle part of next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
