DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Four was 
located near latitude 23.1 North, longitude 82.6 West. The 
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 
km/h). A turn toward the northwest is forecast this afternoon, 
followed by a northward motion on Sunday and then a slower 
northeastward motion Sunday night and Monday. On the forecast track, 
the center of the depression will move across western Cuba this 
morning, and then move over the eastern Gulf of Mexico later today 
and Sunday, reaching the Florida Gulf coast late Sunday or Monday.
 
Recent satellite wind data and surface observations from the 
Florida Keys indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph 
(55 km/h) with higher gusts. Slow strengthening is expected this 
afternoon and tonight, and the depression is expected to become a 
tropical storm by tonight.  A faster rate of strengthening is 
expected Sunday through Monday, and the system could be near 
hurricane strength when it reaches the Florida Gulf coast.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface
observations from Cuba and the Florida Keys is 1009 mb (29.80 
inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for the depression can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area
by Sunday night, with tropical storm conditions possible earlier on
Sunday. Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread northward
over the warning areas beginning later today and continuing through
Sunday. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in
the Florida Keys later today or tonight, and in the Florida
Panhandle by late Sunday.  Wind gusts to tropical storm force are
currently occurring over the Florida Keys.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Aripeka, FL to Aucilla River, FL...3-5 ft
Aucilla River, FL to Indian Pass, FL...2-4 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Aripeka, FL...2-4 ft
Tampa Bay...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Four is expected to produce rainfall
totals of 5 to 10 inches, with maximum rainfall totals up to 15
inches, across portions of Florida and along the Southeast U.S.
coast this weekend through Thursday morning. This rainfall will
likely result in areas of locally considerable flash and urban
flooding, with river flooding expected.
 
For Cuba, rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches, with localized higher
amounts, will be possible through today. This may result in isolated
to scattered areas of flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Depression Four, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf
 
TORNADOES: A tornado or two is possible across the Florida Keys and
the western Florida Peninsula tonight through Sunday morning.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are expected to affect
much of the Gulf coast of Florida tonight through Monday and along
the Southeast U.S. coast early next week. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Tropical Depression Four Forecast Discussion Number 5</title>

Tropical Depression Four Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042024
1100 AM EDT Sat Aug 03 2024

Tropical Depression Four has become somewhat better organized this 
morning, with the circulation becoming better defined over western 
Cuba and curved convective bands forming close to the center in the 
southern semicircle.  However, the circulation is still somewhat 
elongated with multiple low-level vorticity centers rotating around 
the mean center.  The initial intensity has been increased to 30 kt 
based on surface observations in the Florida Keys and a satellite 
intensity estimate from TAFB.

The depression appears to be starting its northwestward turn with 
the initial motion now 300/13 kt.  A large mid- to upper-level 
trough over the central United States is creating a break in the 
subtropical ridge, and the cyclone is expected to turn northward 
into this break by 24-36 h.  This should be followed by a gradual 
turn toward the northeast through 60 h.  This motion should bring 
the center near or over the northern Gulf coast in roughly 48 h.  
After landfall, weakening steering currents should cause the cyclone 
to slow down while it moves northeastward over parts of northern 
Florida and Georgia.  The uncertainty in the forecast increases 
significantly after 72 h as the cyclone interacts with a portion of 
the U.S. trough. The current GFS and ECMWF forecast the system to 
move into the Atlantic, and then turn back toward the southeastern 
U.S. coast by 120 h.  On the other hand, the Canadian model moves 
the cyclone slowly northeastward across the southeastern states and 
does not bring it over the Atlantic.  This portion of the new 
forecast track shows a slower forward motion than the previous track 
due to changes in the GFS forecast since the previous advisory.
 
After the system crosses Cuba and emerges over the eastern Gulf of
Mexico, the environmental and oceanic conditions appear favorable
for intensification.  Due to the lack of internal organization, the 
initial intensification is likely to be slow.  However, a faster 
rate of development is likely once the system gets better 
organized, and the cyclone is likely to be near or at hurricane 
strength when it reaches to the northern Gulf coast.  Weakening is 
forecast after landfall while the system moves over the 
southeastern United States. Beyond 72 h, the intensity forecast 
remains quite uncertain due to uncertainty of whether the center 
will reach the Atlantic and how much interaction will occur with 
the aforementioned mid-latitude trough interaction.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall will likely result in locally considerable flash 
and urban flooding across portions of Florida and the coastal areas 
of the Southeast this weekend through Thursday morning. River 
flooding is also expected.

2.  Hurricane conditions are possible late Sunday in portions of the 
Florida Gulf Coast and Big Bend region where a Hurricane Watch is in 
effect. Tropical storm conditions are expected farther south along 
Florida’s west coast, including the Tampa Bay area, and in the Dry 
Tortugas where Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect.

3. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation 
along portions of the west coast of Florida from Aripeka to the 
Aucilla River. Life-threatening storm surge is possible west of 
Aucilla River to Indian Pass and south of Aripeka to Bonita Beach, 
including Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor.

4. Impacts from storm surge, strong winds, and heavy rains are 
possible elsewhere in Florida and along the southeast coast of the 
United States from Georgia to North Carolina through the middle of 
next week, and interests in those areas should continue to monitor 
the progress of this system. Additional watches and warnings will 
likely be required later today.
