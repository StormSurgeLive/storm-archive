DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Debby was located
near latitude 29.9 North, longitude 83.4 West.  Debby is moving
toward the north-northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A gradual 
decrease in forward speed with a turn toward the northeast and east 
is expected later today and Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the 
center will slowly across northern Florida and southern Georgia 
today and Tuesday, and be near the Georgia coast by Tuesday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is expected as Debby moves 
over land today and tonight.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140
miles (220 km).  A wind gust to 62 mph (100 km/h) was reported at 
Madison County High School within the last hour.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area for the next few hours.  Tropical storm conditions will 
continue over portions of the tropical storm warning area along 
the Florida Gulf coast through the morning, and begin along portions 
of the tropical storm warning area along the Atlantic coast by this
evening.  Tropical storm conditions are expected along the coast of
South Carolina within the tropical storm warning area by late
tonight.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Yankeetown, FL to Aucilla River, FL...6-10 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Yankeetown, FL...4-6 ft
Aucilla River, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...4-6 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Indian Pass, FL...3-5 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...3-5 ft
Tampa Bay...3-5 ft
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to South Santee River, SC...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce rainfall totals of 6 to 12
inches, with maximum amounts of 18 inches, across portions of
central and northern Florida as well as central and northeast North
Carolina through Saturday morning.  This rainfall will likely result
in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with significant
river flooding expected.
 
Across portions of southeast Georgia, the coastal plain of South
Carolina, and southeast North Carolina, 10 to 20 inches of rainfall,
with local amounts to 30 inches, are expected through Saturday
morning.  This potentially historic rainfall will likely result in
areas of catastrophic flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Debby, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.  For a list of
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the WMO header ACUS44
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible over central and northern
Florida and southeastern Georgia today.  The threat will spread
northeastward into parts of South Carolina later today and tonight.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Debby are expected to affect much of the
Gulf coast of Florida through tonight.  Swells will begin to affect
the Southeast U.S. coast later today and continue through the
middle of the week. These conditions are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.

Since Debby is inland and its Radar appearance has degraded, NHC 
has stopped issuing hourly position updates.

Hurricane Debby Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042024
500 AM EDT Mon Aug 05 2024
 
The eyewall of Debby is moving onshore and landfall in the Florida
Big Bend is expected to occur within the next few hours.  Doppler
radar images from Tallahassee indicate that the eye of the hurricane
has become a bit more circular and deep convection remains fairly
well organized over the eastern eyewall, and in bands east of the
center that have spread across portions of northern Florida.  There
have been numerous reports of sustained tropical-storm-force winds,
but the strongest so far is in Horseshoe Beach, where a weather
station recently recorded a sustained wind of 57 kt and a gust to
83 kt.  Data from the Air Force Hurricane Hunters indicate that the
maximum winds are likely near 70 kt, and Debby will likely maintain
that intensity or strengthen a little until it reaches the coast.
 
After landfall, Debby is expected to slow down and turn
northeastward as the steering currents collapse, taking the system
across northern Florida and southeastern Georgia later today through
Tuesday.  Most of the models show Debby moving off the southeast
U.S. coast late Tuesday and Wednesday before a ridge builds to the
north of the system, which should push it back inland over South
Carolina on Thursday.  Although the details of the track forecast
are unknown, there is high confidence that Debby will move slowly
while near or over the southeastern U.S., which will likely result
in catastrophic flooding in some locations.  The NHC track forecast
is similar to the previous one and in line with the consensus aids.
 
Rapid weakening is forecast after the center moves inland, and Debby
will likely become a tropical storm over northern Florida this
afternoon.  If Debby does move back offshore of the southeast U.S.,
there could be a little strengthening before it moves inland once
again.  Regardless of the system's strength, the main impact is
expected to be heavy rainfall as mentioned above. The NHC intensity
forecast is generally similar to the previous one and near the HCCA
and IVCN aids.
 
NHC has begun issuing hourly Tropical Cyclone Updates, and they
will continue through landfall.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Potentially historic heavy rainfall across southeast Georgia and
the coastal plain of South Carolina through Saturday morning will
likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding. Heavy rainfall will
likely result in considerable flooding impacts from portions of
central and northern Florida and across portions of central and
northeast North Carolina through Saturday morning.
 
2. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge along portions
of the Gulf Coast of Florida, with 6 to 10 feet of inundation above
ground level expected somewhere between Ochlockonee River to
Yankeetown through the morning. Residents in the Storm
Surge Warning area should follow any advice given by local
officials.
 
3. Hurricane conditions are expected this morning along portions of
the Florida Big Bend region where a Hurricane Warning is in effect.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue for several more
hours farther south within the Tropical Storm Warning area along
Florida's west coast, including the Tampa Bay area.
 
4. Dangerous storm surge and wind impacts are expected along
portions of the southeast U.S. coast from northeastern Florida to
North Carolina through the middle of the week, and storm surge
warnings and tropical storm watches and warnings are in effect
for portions of these areas.
