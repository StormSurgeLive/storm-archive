DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Debby was
located near latitude 24.1 North, longitude 83.3 West.  Debby is
moving toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  This motion is
expected to continue tonight, followed by a northward turn on Sunday
and a slower northeastward motion Sunday night and Monday. On the
forecast track, the center of Debby will move across the
southeastern and eastern Gulf of Mexico tonight and Sunday, reaching
the Florida Gulf coast late Sunday night or Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Strengthening is expected as Debby crosses the Gulf of Mexico, and 
the system is likely to be at or near hurricane strength when it 
reaches the Florida Gulf coast.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
to the east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface 
observations is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area by late Sunday night or Monday morning, with tropical storm
conditions expected to arrive during the day on Sunday.  Hurricane
conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area by Sunday night,
with tropical storm conditions expected to begin on Sunday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread northward over the
tropical storm warning areas this evening and continuing through
Sunday. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in
the Florida Keys tonight, and in the Florida Panhandle by late
Sunday or Monday morning.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Yankeetown, FL to  Aucilla River, FL ...4-7 ft
Aripeka, FL to Yankeetown, FL...3-5 ft
Aucilla River, FL to Indian Pass, FL...3-5 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Aripeka, FL...2-4 ft
Tampa Bay...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Debby is expected to produce rainfall
totals of 6 to 12 inches, with maximum rainfall totals up to 18
inches, across portions of Florida and along the Southeast U.S.
coast this weekend through Thursday. This rainfall will likely
result in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with
significant river flooding expected.
 
For Cuba, rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches, with localized higher
amounts, will be possible through tonight. This will result in
isolated to scattered areas of flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Debby, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero

TORNADOES: A tornado or two is possible across the Florida Keys and
the western Florida Peninsula through tonight, expanding across much
of northern and central Florida on Sunday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Debby are expected to affect much of the
Gulf coast of Florida tonight through Monday and along the Southeast
U.S. coast early next week. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM EDT.

Tropical Storm Debby Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042024
500 PM EDT Sat Aug 03 2024

The tropical cyclone has become better organized since the last 
advisory, with the circulation center becoming better defined over 
the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and areas of outer convective 
banding to the north and south of the central region.  A 
combination of earlier scatterometer data, surface observations in 
the Florida Keys, and ship reports in the Straits of Florida shows 
an area of 30-35 kt winds located about 120 n mi from the center in 
the eastern semicircle.  Based on this information, Tropical 
Depression Four is upgraded to Tropical Storm Debby.

The initial motion is now northwest or 310/13 kt. A large mid- to 
upper-level trough over the central United States is creating a 
break in the subtropical ridge, and Debby is expected to turn 
northward into this break in about 24 h.  This should be followed 
by a gradual turn toward the northeast at a slower forward speed 
through 60 h.  This motion should bring the center near or over the 
northern Gulf coast in roughly 48 h.  After landfall, weakening 
steering currents should cause the cyclone to slow down while it 
moves northeastward or eastward over parts of northern Florida and 
Georgia.  The uncertainty in the forecast increases significantly 
after 60 h as the cyclone interacts with a portion of the U.S. 
trough.  The latest GFS and ECMWF models show a slow eastward 
motion into the Atlantic, followed by a turn toward the north or 
northwest that brings the center back inland. On the other hand, 
the Canadian model is still forecasting Debby to move slowly 
northeastward across the southeastern states and does not bring it 
over the Atlantic.  This portion of the new forecast track 
continues to show a slow motion and leans toward the GFS/ECMWF 
solutions.

Conditions are favorable for strengthening over the Gulf of Mexico 
with warm sea surface temperatures and light shear.  
Intensification is likely to be slow during the first 12-24 h, then 
proceed at a faster rate after the cyclone develops an organized 
inner core.  The new intensity forecast calls for a peak intensity 
of 65 kt at landfall on the Gulf coast of Florida in best agreement 
with the HWRF model. Weakening is forecast after landfall while the 
system moves over the southeastern United States. Beyond 72 h, the 
intensity forecast remains quite uncertain due to the possibility 
of land interaction and how much interaction will occur with the 
aforementioned mid-latitude trough.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall will likely result in considerable flash and urban 
flooding across portions of Florida and the coastal areas of the 
Southeast this weekend through Thursday. Significant river flooding 
is also expected.
 
2.  Hurricane conditions are expected on Monday along portions of 
the Florida Big Bend region where a Hurricane Warning is in effect, 
with tropical storm conditions beginning late Sunday. Tropical storm 
conditions are expected through Monday farther south within the 
Tropical Storm Warning along Florida's west coast, including the 
Tampa Bay area and the Lower Florida Keys.

3. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation 
along portions of the Gulf coast of Florida from Aripeka to Indian 
Pass. Life-threatening storm surge is possible south of Aripeka to 
Bonita Beach, including Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor.

4. Impacts from storm surge, strong winds, and heavy rains are 
possible elsewhere in Florida and along the southeast coast of the 
United States from Georgia to North Carolina through the middle of 
next week, and interests in those areas should continue to monitor 
the progress of this system. Additional watches and warnings will 
likely be required tonight or on Sunday.
