HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Oscar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions, mainly in gusts, are expected 
within the warning area in eastern Cuba for the next few hours.  
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in parts 
of the central and southeastern Bahamas tonight and Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL: Through Wednesday morning, rainfall amounts of 7 to 14 
inches with isolated amounts of 20 inches are expected across 
eastern Cuba, especially within the Sierra Maestra. This rainfall 
will lead to areas of significant, life-threatening flash flooding 
along with mudslides. Preliminary reports indicate there have 
already been over 10 inches of rain in spots in the Province of 
Guantanamo.
 
Across the southeastern Bahamas, 3 to 5 inches are expected, with 
isolated amounts around 8 inches. This rainfall could cause 
localized flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with Oscar,
please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall
Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Elevated water levels in areas of onshore winds along
the coast of eastern Cuba will gradually subside tonight. Near the 
coast, large and dangerous waves will continue into early Tuesday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Oscar Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162024
500 PM EDT Mon Oct 21 2024

Although the circulation of Oscar is rather broad, visible 
satellite images show that the center is nearing the northern coast 
of eastern Cuba.  Deep convection associated with the system has 
diminished during the day, at least partially due to a diurnal 
fluctuation.  The intensity is kept, perhaps generously, at 35 kt 
for this advisory.  Surface synoptic observations and earlier 
scatterometer data indicate that the strongest winds are over the 
eastern semicircle of the cyclone, and no tropical-storm-force 
wind radii are shown to the northwest or southwest of the center 
for this advisory.

Oscar been turning fairly sharply to the right while the system 
executes a hairpin turn over eastern Cuba.  The current motion 
estimate is around 330/6 kt.  The tropical cyclone is expected to 
turn northward and northeastward with some increase in forward 
speed while it moves on the southeastern and eastern side of a 
mid-level trough.  Since the system has moved a little farther west 
than previously estimated, the overall official track forecast has 
been shifted slightly west of the previous one.  This is a blend of 
the simple and corrected dynamical model consensus predictions.

The tropical cyclone should move back over water soon, so some 
restrengthening is possible during the next day or two.  However, 
Oscar will be moving into an area of strong upper-level winds over 
the next couple of days which should impart significant westerly 
shear over the system.  Also, the cyclone is expected to remain in 
a relatively dry air mass to the north of the Greater Antilles.  
Thus, only slight restrengthening seems possible.  The official 
intensity forecast is above the latest SHIPS and LGEM guidance.  
In 2 to 3 days, the global models show the system being absorbed by 
a non-tropical low pressure system to the west of Bermuda.

The primary hazard associated with Oscar will continue to be heavy
rainfall and life-threatening flash flooding, particularly over the
mountainous terrain of eastern Cuba.  Over the last 24 hours, a 
rainfall total of nearly 15 inches was reported at Punta de Maisi 
on the eastern tip of Cuba.


Key Messages:
 
1. Through midweek, heavy rainfall from Oscar will lead to areas of
significant, life-threatening flash flooding along with mudslides
across portions of eastern Cuba, especially within the Sierra
Maestra. In addition, localized flash flooding will be possible
across the southeastern Bahamas.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue into this 
evening across portions of eastern Cuba. Tropical storm conditions 
are also expected in portions of the southeastern and central 
Bahamas tonight and Tuesday.
