CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of the Bahamas has discontinued the Tropical Storm 
Warning for the Central Bahamas.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Southeastern Bahamas
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Oscar was
located near latitude 22.9 North, longitude 74.1 West.  Oscar is
moving toward the northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h), and a faster 
northeastward motion is expected during the next day or two.  On 
the forecast track, the center of Oscar will be moving away from 
the Bahamas later today or tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Oscar could dissipate later today, or merge with an extratropical 
low pressure system within the next couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Oscar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in
parts of the southeastern Bahamas today.

RAINFALL: Across the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos 
Islands, additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 4 inches are expected 
through today. This rainfall could cause localized flash flooding.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with Oscar, 
please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall 
Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf.

NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 500 PM EDT.

Tropical Storm Oscar Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162024
1100 AM EDT Tue Oct 22 2024

An Air Force reconnaissance aircraft investigating Oscar has had 
difficulty locating a center this morning.  Data from the plane and 
visible satellite images suggest that the circulation is becoming 
elongated.  Also, the system may have weakened below tropical storm 
strength, but we will wait for an upcoming scatterometer pass that 
will provide a wider swath of wind data before downgrading it.  
Thus, for the moment, the intensity is being maintained at 35 kt.  
Nonetheless, since all of the stronger winds are occurring east of 
the center, the Tropical Storm Warning for the Central Bahamas is 
being discontinued.

Given the poor definition of the center, the initial motion is an 
uncertain 040/10 kt.  Oscar should accelerate northeastward along 
the eastern side of a mid- to upper-level trough during the next day 
or so.  The official track forecast is a little faster than the 
previous NHC prediction in 24-36 hours.  Within the next couple of 
days, the global models indicate that the trough will cause 
baroclinic cyclogenesis to occur near or north of Oscar.  The 
resulting extratropical surface low is likely to absorb or merge 
with the tropical cyclone or its remnants.

The atmospheric environment, consisting of strong shear and 
relatively dry air, is expected to remain hostile for the 
maintenance of a tropical cyclone, so no strengthening is 
anticipated.  Indeed, it is possible that Oscar could dissipate 
before it interacts with the new extratropical cyclone.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Localized flash flooding will be possible today across the 
southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands.  With 
rainfall easing across Cuba, flooding from rainfall which has 
already occurred could remain a concern for the next several days.

2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the 
southeastern Bahamas today.
