MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* North coast of the Cuban Provinces of Las Tunas, Holguin, and
Guantanamo to Punta Maisi
* South coast of Cuban Province of Guantanamo
* Southeastern Bahamas
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* North coast of the Cuban Province of Camaguey
* Central Bahamas
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within the next 24 to
36 hours.
 
Interests in the remainder of the Bahamas should monitor the
progress of Oscar.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Oscar was
located near latitude 20.2 North, longitude 75.3 West.  Oscar is
moving toward the west near 2 mph (4 km/h).  A turn to the northwest
and north is expected later today, followed by a faster
northeastward motion on Tuesday and Wednesday.  On the forecast
track, the center of Oscar is expected to continue moving across
eastern Cuba through this afternoon, then emerge off the northern
coast of Cuba late today or tonight and move near the southeastern
and central Bahamas on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Some additional weakening could occur while Oscar 
moves across the mountainous terrain of eastern Cuba, but Oscar is 
forecast to be a tropical storm when it moves north of Cuba late 
today and then moves near the southeastern and central Bahamas on 
Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Oscar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area and
possible in the watch area of Cuba today.  Tropical storm conditions
are expected in the warning area in parts of the southeastern
Bahamas and are possible in the watch area in parts of the central
Bahamas tonight and Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL: Through Wednesday morning, rainfall amounts of 7 to 14
inches with isolated amounts of 20 inches are expected across
eastern Cuba, especially within the Sierra Maestra.  This rainfall
will lead to areas of significant, life-threatening flash flooding
along with mudslides.
 
Across the southeastern Bahamas, 3 to 5 inches of rain are 
expected, with isolated amounts around 8 inches.  This rainfall 
could cause localized flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with Oscar,
please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall
Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Elevated water levels in areas of onshore winds along
the coast of eastern Cuba will gradually subside later today and
tonight.  Near the coast, large and dangerous waves will continue
into early Tuesday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Oscar Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Tropical Storm Oscar Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162024
500 AM EDT Mon Oct 21 2024
 
The center of Oscar has continued to move over eastern Cuba
overnight.  Although radar imagery from Guantanamo Bay has shown
a continued degradation of Oscar's inner core, bands of deep
convection with heavy rainfall remain over portions of the island.
A couple of ASCAT passes from earlier in the night showed that
tropical-storm-force winds were occurring along both the southern
and northern coasts of eastern Cuba.  Given the decrease in inner 
core organization over the past several hours, the initial 
wind speed has been lowered perhaps conservatively to 45 kt for 
this advisory.
 
Radar and surface observations from Guantanamo Bay indicate that
the center is located just north of that location.  The initial 
motion estimate is a somewhat uncertain 270/2 kt.  The storm 
should begin to turn northwestward and northward later today ahead 
of a shortwave trough moving over the northwestern Bahamas.  Some 
of the dynamical model guidance suggests that the center may 
re-form near the northern coast of Cuba later today, rather than 
the low-level center continuously tracking across the mountainous 
terrain of the island.  Regardless of the details of the track over 
eastern Cuba, Oscar is expected to emerge off the northern coast of 
Cuba later today or tonight.  Thereafter, the cyclone should 
accelerate northeastward over portions of the southeastern Bahamas 
and western Atlantic ahead of the aforementioned trough.  In 60-72 
hours, global model guidance indicates that the circulation will 
become elongated and that it will be absorbed by a larger developing 
non-tropical area of low pressure between Bermuda and the 
southeastern U.S. coast by day 3. The track guidance is again 
faster this cycle, and the NHC forecast has been adjusted 
accordingly. 

Additional weakening is expected while Oscar moves over eastern
Cuba today.  Most of the guidance now keeps Oscar a tropical
cyclone after it emerges off the northern coast of Cuba, but
increasing westerly vertical wind shear and dry mid-level air 
should prevent significant restrengthening before it is absorbed by 
a non-tropical area of low pressure. 

The primary hazard associated with Oscar will be heavy rainfall and 
life-threatening flash flooding, particularly over the mountainous 
terrain of eastern Cuba. 


Key Messages:
 
1. Through midweek, heavy rainfall from Oscar will lead to areas of
significant, life-threatening flash flooding along with mudslides 
across portions of eastern Cuba, especially within the Sierra 
Maestra. In addition, localized flash flooding will be possible 
across the southeastern Bahamas.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue today across 
portions of eastern Cuba. Tropical storm conditions are also 
expected in portions of the southeastern Bahamas tonight and 
Tuesday.
