DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Oscar was 
located near latitude 22.8 North, longitude 74.7 West.  Oscar is 
moving toward the northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A faster 
northeastward motion is expected later today and on Wednesday.  On 
the forecast track, the center of Oscar is expected to move near the 
southeastern and central Bahamas today, then move away from the 
Bahamas tonight and Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Little change in strength is forecast during the day today. Oscar is 
expected to become a post-tropical low by tonight or early 
Wednesday, and then be absorbed by another low pressure area by 
Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
east and northeast of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Oscar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in
parts of the central and southeastern Bahamas today.
 
RAINFALL: Across the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos 
Islands, rainfall amounts of 3 to 5 inches, with isolated amounts 
around 8 inches, are expected through today. This rainfall could 
cause localized flash flooding.

Tropical Storm Oscar Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162024
500 AM EDT Tue Oct 22 2024

Oscar is at best barely a tropical storm at this time.  While
convection associated with the system has increased since the last 
advisory, most of it is occurring in clusters well away from the 
center in the eastern semicircle, and there is only minimal 
convection near the center.  Also, while 850 mb flight-level winds 
were as high as 45-50 kt during an earlier Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter mission, dropsonde and SFMR data suggests those 
winds were having trouble mixing down to the surface.  The system 
will be maintained as a 35-kt tropical storm pending the next recon 
flight and whether convection will increase further during the 
upcoming diurnal maximum.

The global models are in good agreement that a developing mid- to 
upper-level trough over the southwestern Atlantic will cause 
baroclinic cyclogenesis near or north of Oscar during the next 
24-48 h.  The UKMET shows Oscar become the main focus for the 
development and becoming a large extratropical low, while the GFS 
develops a second low to the north of Oscar with Oscar becoming 
absorbed into the new system.  The ECMWF and Canadian models 
forecast a blend of these scenarios, with the baroclinic low forming 
close to Oscar.  Given Oscar's organization and current trends in 
satellite imagery, the intensity forecast leans towards the GFS 
solution, with Oscar becoming a post-tropical low in less than 24 h 
and then being absorbed by the new low in 36-48 h.  

The initial motion is now 030/10 kt.  Interaction with the above 
mentioned trough should steer Oscar generally northeastward with an 
increase in forward speed until it is absorbed by the new 
baroclinic low.  The new forecast track is similar to the previous 
track.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Through Tuesday, localized flash flooding will be possible across 
the southeastern Bahamas as well as the Turks and Caicos Islands.  
With rainfall easing across Cuba, flooding from rainfall which has 
already occurred could remain a concern for the next several days.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the
southeastern and central Bahamas today.
