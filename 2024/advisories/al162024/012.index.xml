DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Oscar was 
located near latitude 21.8 North, longitude 75.4 West. Oscar is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 8 mph (13 km/h). A faster 
northeastward motion is expected on Tuesday and Wednesday. On the 
forecast track, the center of Oscar is expected to move near the 
southeastern and central Bahamas on Tuesday.

Data from the Air Force Hurricane Hunters indicate that maximum
sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. Some
gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of days, and
Oscar could degenerate to a post-tropical low by Tuesday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
east and northeast of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Oscar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in
parts of the central and southeastern Bahamas overnight and Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL: Through Tuesday, additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 3
inches are expected, leading to storm total accumulations of 20
inches across portions of eastern Cuba. This rainfall may produce
additional flooding and mudslides, especially in areas of steep
terrain.
 
Across the southeastern Bahamas, rainfall amounts of 3 to 5 inches,
with isolated amounts around 8 inches, are expected. This rainfall
could cause localized flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with Oscar,
please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall
Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 AM EDT.

Tropical Storm Oscar Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162024
1100 PM EDT Mon Oct 21 2024
 
The center of Oscar has emerged off the northern coast of eastern
Cuba, but the system is struggling to maintain its identity as a
tropical cyclone. The limited convection noted in recent satellite
images is displaced over 100 n mi to the east of the center, likely
the result of increasing westerly shear and significant intrusions
of dry air. Also, satellite images suggest the center could be
somewhat elongated compared to earlier today. The Air Force
Hurricane Hunters sampled the wind field tonight and recently
reported peak 850-mb flight-level winds of 51 kt in clear air to the
east of the center. Based on this, the initial intensity is held at
35 kt for this advisory.
 
Oscar has made its anticipated turn and is now moving toward the
north-northeast (015/7 kt). A mid-level trough over the southwestern
Atlantic is expected to steer Oscar northeastward at a faster speed
during the next couple of days. By late Wednesday, Oscar should be
absorbed by a larger, non-tropical area of low pressure that is
forecast to develop over the western Atlantic. There were no
notable changes to the track guidance this cycle, and the NHC track
prediction remains similar to the previous one.
 
Based on satellite trends tonight, it seems more unlikely that Oscar
will be able to restrengthen given the continued bouts of dry air
and stronger shear expected over the next couple of days. As a
result, the updated NHC intensity forecast shows Oscar degenerating
to a post-tropical low in 24 h, although this could occur even
sooner if convection does not redevelop during the upcoming
convective maximum period. There is still a threat of additional
rainfall producing flash flooding across portions of eastern Cuba
and the southeastern Bahamas through Tuesday.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Through Tuesday, additional periods of heavy rainfall may lead to
flash flooding and mudslides across portions of eastern Cuba,
especially in areas of steep terrain. In addition, localized flash
flooding will be possible across the southeastern Bahamas.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the
southeastern and central Bahamas overnight and Tuesday.
