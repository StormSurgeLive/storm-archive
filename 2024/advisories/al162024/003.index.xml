DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Oscar was located 
near latitude 21.4 North, longitude 71.1 West. Oscar is moving 
toward the west near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this motion with a 
gradual slowdown and turn to the west-southwest is forecast tonight 
into tomorrow. A sharp turn to the northeast is anticipated by 
Monday. 
 
Dropsonde wind data indicate that maximum sustained winds have 
increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher gusts. A little more 
strengthening is possible tonight, but gradual weakening is expected 
to begin by Sunday night and Monday. 
 
Oscar is a very small hurricane, with hurricane-force winds only 
extending outward up to 5 miles (10 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on earlier dropsonde 
data is 987 mb (29.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to first reach the coast 
within the warning area tonight, with tropical storm conditions 
expected to begin shortly, making outside preparations dangerous. 

Hurricane conditions are possible in the watch area of Cuba by 
Sunday night. Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach 
the coast within the warning area by Sunday afternoon, making

significant coastal flooding in the Turks and Caicos Islands, where
water levels are expected to be between 2 and 4 feet. Near the

Hurricane Oscar Special Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162024
200 PM EDT Sat Oct 19 2024
 
This is a special advisory to update the initial and forecast 
intensity for Oscar and current watches and warnings. An Air Force 
Reserve Hurricane Hunter mission is currently flying through the 
system, and in their second southwest-to-northeast leg found 700 mb 
flight level winds of 76 kt, and a minimum central pressure of 989 
mb. The plane also reported a very small 3 n mi wide eye. A 
dropsonde recently launched in the northern quadrant also had a 150 
m boundary layer mean wind of 80 kt. A blend of these data supports 
upgrading Oscar to a hurricane this advisory with maximum sustained 
winds of 70 kt. The intensity forecast has been updated accordingly, 
and is substantially higher than the previous one.
 
Due to this unexpected higher intensity, the government of the
Bahamas has issued a Hurricane Warning for the Turks and Caicos
Islands and Southeastern Bahamas. The government of Cuba has also
issued a Hurricane Watch for the same area currently under a
Tropical Storm Warning.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Oscar is now expected to bring hurricane conditions to portions
of the southeastern Bahamas, Turks and Caicos Islands, and eastern
Cuba during the next day or so. A Hurricane Warning has now been
issued for those locations.
 
2. Oscar is expected to produce a dangerous storm surge on the
Turks and Caicos Islands beginning this evening.
 
3. Locally heavy rainfall is possible across the Turks and Caicos
Islands and the southeastern Bahamas later today and tonight. These
rains are expected to spread to eastern Cuba on Sunday.

Tropical Storm Nadine Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152024
400 PM CDT Sat Oct 19 2024
 
Nadine made landfall very near Belize City around 11 am CDT (1600
UTC) with peak winds of about 50 kt.  Since that time, the storm
has been moving across the northern portion of Belize and losing
strength.  The initial intensity is nudged down to 40 kt, with the
strongest winds likely occurring over water and along the coast.
Continued weakening is forecast as Nadine moves farther inland, and
it will likely dissipate on Sunday.
 
The storm has been accelerating westward, with the latest initial
motion estimated to be 270/11 kt.  A slightly faster westward or
west-southwestward motion is expected until the system dissipates
over southern Mexico.

Key Messages:
 
1. Localized areas of flash flooding are possible along the track
of Nadine across southern Mexico, northern Guatemala, and northern
Belize.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
coasts of Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico within the
warning area through this evening.
