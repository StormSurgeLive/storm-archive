DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Oscar was located 
near latitude 20.5 North, longitude 74.3 West. Oscar is moving 
toward the west-southwest near 6 mph (9 km/h). A continued 
west-southwestward motion at a slow forward speed is expected 
through tonight, followed by a turn toward the northwest and north 
on Monday and Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Oscar 
is expected to make landfall along the northern coast of eastern 
Cuba shortly. The system is then expected to move across eastern 
Cuba tonight and Monday.  Oscar is then forecast to begin moving a 
bit faster to the northeast across the central Bahamas on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher 
gusts. After Oscar makes landfall, significant weakening is 
expected, but Oscar could still be a tropical storm when it moves 
north of Cuba late Monday and then moves across the central Bahamas 
on Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles 
(75 km). Recently, there was a wind gust of 63 mph (101 km/h) from 
a weather station in Punta Maisi on the eastern tip of Cuba. 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 986 mb (29.12 inches). A 
weather station in Punta Maisi on the eastern tip of Cuba recently 
reported a minimum pressure of 998 mb (29.47 inches). 
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Hurricane Oscar Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162024
500 PM EDT Sun Oct 20 2024

Oscar is very close to making landfall this afternoon along the 
northern coast of eastern Cuba. Since the final observations from 
the morning Air Force Reconnaissance mission, the hurricane's 
structure on satellite imagery and radar out of Guantanamo Bay has 
not changed appreciably, with rotating cold convective bands noted 
on 1 minute GOES-16 imagery, and the eyewall on radar coming and 
going, occasionally open on the western side. Subjective and 
objective intensity estimates have not changed much from when the 
plane was in the hurricane this morning, so the initial intensity 
will remain at 70 kt this advisory. 

Oscar has continued a west-southwestward motion, but is slowing down 
as it nears the Cuban coast, estimated now at 250/5 kt. The 
strongest mid-level ridging is now oriented to the northwest of 
Oscar and is helping to steer the small hurricane west-southwestward 
into Cuba. However, by tomorrow a digging shortwave trough on the 
eastern side of a broader trough across the western Atlantic should 
further erode the steering flow north of Oscar, with much of the 
track guidance showing the system executing a slow but sharp turn 
northward on Monday, ultimately causing the tropical cyclone to 
emerge back out over open waters in 24-36 h. How fast Oscar then 
accelerates to the northeast could be related to how vertically deep 
the circulation is by the early part of this week, with the GFS 
showing a shallow Oscar drifting slowly over the central Bahamas, 
while the ECMWF keeps a stronger Oscar accelerating northeastward. 
The NHC track forecast is a little faster than the previous 
advisory, slightly favoring the ECMWF forecast solution over the GFS 
given its better performance with this small tropical cyclone, and 
lies not far off the TVCA and HCCA consensus aids. 

The small inner core of Oscar is likely to be severely disrupted by 
the higher terrain of eastern Cuba after it makes landfall, and 
weakening after it moves ashore will likely be quick. Some of the 
guidance, especially the GFS, suggests that Oscar could weaken more 
than shown here in the latest NHC intensity forecast. Once Oscar 
re-emerges over the Atlantic Ocean, the forecast environment is not 
very favorable for reintensification, with westerly shear increasing 
above 30 kt in 36 h and plenty of very dry air waiting to be 
imported into the cyclone's core. The NHC forecast does not show any 
intensification after it emerges back offshore, and most of the 
guidance shows the small cyclone being absorbed by the much larger 
baroclinic trough sometime this week, though the timing varies among 
the global and hurricane-regional model guidance.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. A Hurricane Warning is in effect for a portion of the northern 
coast of eastern Cuba where Oscar is expected to make landfall 
shortly. 
 
2. Oscar is expected to produce a dangerous storm surge on portions 
of the north shore of eastern Cuba this afternoon and evening.
 
3. Through midweek, heavy rainfall from Oscar will lead to areas of 
significant, potentially life-threatening flash flooding along with 
mudslides across portions of eastern Cuba, especially within the 
Sierra Maestra. In addition, localized flash flooding will be 
possible across the southeastern Bahamas.

...NADINE DISSIPATED OVER SOUTHERN MEXICO...
...HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLASH FLOODING STILL EXPECTED OVER 
PARTS OF BELIZE, GUATEMALA, AND MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1000 AM CDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.5N 93.0W
ABOUT 165 MI...265 KM SSW OF CIUDAD DEL CARMEN MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...30 MPH...45 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WSW OR 250 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1007 MB...29.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the remnants of Nadine were located near
latitude 16.5 North, longitude 93.0 West. The remnants are moving
toward the west-southwest near 14 mph (22 km/h) and they are
expected to move into the eastern Pacific later today.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts.
 
The combination of the remnants of Nadine and influences from a
Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind event are forecast to result in the
formation of a new low pressure system off the coast of southern
Mexico in a day or so. Additional development is expected after
that time, and a tropical depression is expected to form during the
early to middle part of this week while the system moves westward
at about 15 mph away from the coast of Mexico.

For additional information on the remnants of Nadine please see 
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under 
AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, on the web at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php, and the latest updates in the 
East Pacific Tropical Weather Outlook on the web at 
hurricanes.gov/gtwo.php?basin=epac.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for the remnants of Nadine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO
header WTNT45 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Additional rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches, with 
isolated areas up to 12 inches, are expected across the Mexican 
states of Chiapas and Tabasco into Veracruz and Oaxaca through 
Tuesday morning. Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches, with

Remnants Of Nadine Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152024
1000 AM CDT Sun Oct 20 2024
 
First-light GOES-16 imagery and station observations suggest that
the surface circulation associated with Nadine has dissipated over 
southern Mexico. Peak sustained winds remain 25 kt, mainly over the 
Bay of Campeche.
 
The remnants of Nadine are moving toward the west-southwest at 
around 12 kt and they are expected to move into the eastern Pacific 
later today.

The combination of the remnants of Nadine and influences from a Gulf 
of Tehuantepec gap wind event are forecast to result in the 
formation of a new low pressure system off the coast of southern 
Mexico in a day or so. Additional development is expected after that 
time, and a tropical depression is expected to form during the early 
to middle part of this week while the system moves westward at about 
15 kt away from the coast of Mexico. 

For additional information on the remnants of Nadine as it enters 
the eastern Pacific please see High Seas Forecasts issued by the 
National Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header 
FZPN02 KWBC, on the web at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php, 
and the latest updates in the East Pacific Tropical Weather Outlook 
on the web at hurricanes.gov/gtwo.php?basin=epac.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Localized areas of flash flooding will remain possible in 
the vicinity of the remnants of Nadine across Belize, northern 
Guatemala, and southern Mexico through Tuesday morning.
