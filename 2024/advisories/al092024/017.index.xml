<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Helene, located inland over northeast Georgia and on recently <br/>
upgraded Hurricane Isaac, located over the central Subtropical <br/>
Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL98):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure <br/>
located midway in between the Cabo Verde Islands and the Lesser <br/>
Antilles continues to become better organized. This disturbance is <br/>
already producing gale-force winds. Environmental conditions are <br/>
conducive for further development and a tropical depression or storm <br/>
could form today while the system moves generally westward to <br/>
west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph. The system is then forecast to <br/>
slow down and turn north-northwestward by this weekend. Additional <br/>
information on this system, including gale warnings, can be found in <br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Caribbean:<br/>
An area of low pressure could form over the western Caribbean Sea by <br/>
the middle of next week. Environmental conditions are expected to be <br/>
conducive for slow development thereafter while the system moves <br/>
generally northwestward, potentially entering the Gulf of Mexico by <br/>
the end of next week. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
An area of low pressure could form over the eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic by the early to middle part of next week. Environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to be conducive for slow development <br/>
thereafter while the system moves generally northwestward at 10 to <br/>
15 mph. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Joyce Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112024
1100 AM AST Fri Sep 27 2024
 
Tropical Storm Joyce has formed over the central tropical Atlantic 
Ocean, becoming the tenth named storm in the basin this season.  
First-light visible satellite imagery showed low-level clouds 
moving westward, indicating the surface circulation has closed.  
Deep, organized convection has been persistent for the past day or 
so with decent outflow noted in the northern semicircle of the 
circulation.  This initial intensity is set to 35 kt, representing 
the subjective satellite estimates from both TAFB and SAB.

Joyce has a short window for potential intensification.  For the 
next day or so, deep-layer vertical wind shear should be 
moderate-to-low with warm sea surface temperatures along the 
forecast track.  Mid-level humidities around Joyce are sufficient, 
but expected to dry in the coming days.  Global models predict the 
vertical wind shear should increase and the storm will likely 
experience dry air intrusions.  The official forecast shows Joyce 
strengthening to a peak of 50 kt on Saturday, followed by gradual 
weakening through next week.  Deep convection should be stripped 
away by Tuesday and Joyce is expected to become a remnant low 
at that point before opening into a trough.  However, the GFS 
suggests this could happen even sooner.

The storm is moving northwestward at 11 kt.  A weak mid-level ridge 
centered over the eastern Atlantic Ocean is expected to steer Joyce 
generally northwestward for the next day or so, followed by a 
gradual turn to the north-northwest and north with a slowing forward 
speed.  Model guidance is in relatively good agreement about this 
evolution and the NHC track forecast follows the various simple and 
corrected consensus aids.

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Helene can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: Water levels will continue to receed along the Florida 
Gulf Coast and portions of the southeast U.S. coast throughout the 
day.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occurring along much of the
South Carolina coast, and these conditions will continue for the 
next several hours. Strong, damaging winds, especially in gusts, 
will also continue as far inland as the higher terrain of the 
southern Appalachians.
 
RAINFALL: Over portions of the Central and Southern Appalachians, 
Helene is expected to produce additional rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 
inches leading to total rain accumulations of 6 to 12 inches, with 
isolated totals around 20 inches. This rainfall will result in 
catastrophic and potentially life-threatening flash and urban 
flooding, along with significant and record river flooding. Numerous 
significant landslides are expected in steep terrain across the 
Southern Appalachians.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Tropical Storm Helene, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero. 

For a list of rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated 
this storm, see the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the 
WMO header ACUS44 KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html
 
TORNADOES: Tornadoes are possible today across eastern South 
Carolina, central and eastern North Carolina, and southern Virginia.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Helene will affect the coasts of Georgia
and the Carolinas during the next day or so.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Helene Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092024
1100 AM EDT Fri Sep 27 2024
 
Helene has been racing northward and the low-level center is now
located over the southern Appalachians.  Strong bands of heavy rain
and very gusty winds continue off and along the South Carolina
coast.  In addition, wind gusts to around hurricane force have been
occurring this morning in portions of northeastern Georgia and the
western portions of the Carolinas, especially in areas of higher
terrain.  The initial intensity is set at 40 kt, and these sustained
winds are likely occurring off the south Carolina coast and over
the Appalachians.  The main hazard is the very heavy rainfall 
ongoing over portions of the southeastern U.S., which is 
causing historic and life-threatening flooding.
 
Helene is expected to move slower to the northwest later today and 
then stall over the Tennessee Valley tonight and through the weekend 
as it merges with a mid- to upper-level low.  This merger will also 
lead to extratropical transition, which is expected to occur later 
today.  The expected slow motion could result in significant 
flooding over the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, and over the southern 
Appalachians through the weekend.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Historic, catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban 
flooding, including numerous significant landslides, will continue 
across portions of the Southern Appalachians through this evening. 
Widespread significant river flooding is ongoing, some of which will 
be major to record breaking.
 
2. Damaging wind gusts will continue over portions of Georgia, the
Carolinas, Tennessee, and Kentucky today, particularly over the
higher terrain of the southern Appalachians.
 
3. There is a possibility of long-duration power outages in
portions of the southeast U.S.  If you use a generator after the
storm, be sure it is placed outside at least 20 feet away from
doors, windows, and garages to avoid deadly carbon monoxide
poisoning.

Hurricane Isaac Advisory Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
1100 AM AST Fri Sep 27 2024
 
...HURRICANE ISAAC HEADING WESTWARD OVER THE NORTH CENTRAL ATLANTIC
OCEAN...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...37.4N 46.8W
ABOUT 1080 MI...1740 KM W OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 65 DEGREES AT 18 MPH...30 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...981 MB...28.97 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Isaac was located 
near latitude 37.4 North, longitude 46.8 West. Isaac is moving 
toward the east-northeast near 18 mph (30 km/h).  A gradual turn to 
the east-northeast with a slight acceleration in forward speed is 
expected over the few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Additional strengthening is expected during the next day or
so followed by gradual weakening by the end of this weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles
(110 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 981 mb (28.97 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a 
deep-layer trough could spread into the Azores by this weekend.  
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather 
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

<title>Hurricane Isaac Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Hurricane Isaac Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
1100 AM AST Fri Sep 27 2024
 
Isaac is holding steady this morning.  Geostationary satellite data 
has shown consistent periodic bursts of convection wrapping around a 
small eye.  Subjective and objective Dvorak estimates range widely 
from 35 kt to 73 kt and the initial intensity is held at 65 kt for 
this advisory, closest to the SAB classification. 

The hurricane is moving eastward at 12 kt.  Isaac is moving along 
the northern periphery of a mid-level ridge  and should gradually 
turn to the east-northeast over the next couple of days.  Models are 
more in agreement this cycle and show a more northeastward turn on 
days 4 and 5 as Isaac interacts with an upper-level trough located 
to its east.  The latest track forecast is similar to the previous 
forecast through 72 h and slightly to the north at forecast periods 
beyond.

Isaac could still strengthen further over the next day or so.  While 
the vertical wind shear is expected to be strong-to-moderate, the 
upper-level divergence is forecast to increase and sea surface 
temperature should be relatively sufficient.  Beyond a day or so, 
oceanic and environmental conditions become less conducive, which 
should begin to weaken Isaac by Saturday night or Sunday.  The 
official intensity forecast is very similar to previous advisory, 
with a peak intensity of 75 kt by Saturday and the cyclone becoming 
extratropical by early next week.  However, global models show the 
system losing its deep convection by Monday, and the official 
forecast now predicts Isaac becoming a post-tropical cyclone at that 
point.
