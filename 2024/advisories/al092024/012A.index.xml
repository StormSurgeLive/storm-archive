DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Helene was located
near latitude 24.5 North, longitude 85.9 West. Helene is moving
toward the north-northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h). This general
motion is expected to continued with a significant increase in
forward speed during the next 24 hours.  On the forecast track,
Helene will move across the eastern Gulf of Mexico today and cross
the Florida Big Bend coast this evening or early Friday morning.
After landfall, Helene is expected to turn northwestward and slow
down over the Tennessee Valley on Friday and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 100 mph (155 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast, and Helene 
is expected to be a major hurricane when it reaches the Florida Big 
Bend coast this evening.  Weakening is expected after landfall, but 
Helene's fast forward speed will allow strong, damaging winds, 
especially in gusts, to penetrate well inland across the 
southeastern United States, including over the higher terrain of the 
southern Appalachians.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 345
miles (555 km). The Key West Naval Air Station recently reported
sustained winds of 41 mph (66 km/h) and a wind gust of 55 mph (89
km/h).  An observation in Sand Key recently reported sustained 
winds of 45 mph (72 km/h) and a gust to 58 mph (93 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on data from the 
NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 960 mb 
(28.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Helene can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a life-threatening storm surge and
the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded
by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Carrabelle, FL to Suwannee River, FL...15-20 ft
Apalachicola, FL to Carrabelle, FL...10-15 ft
Suwannee River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...10-15 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...8-12 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Apalachicola, FL...6-10 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...5-8 ft
Tampa Bay...5-8 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...4-7 ft
East of Mexico Beach, FL to Indian Pass, FL...3-5 ft
Englewood, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Charlotte Harbor...3-5 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the southern
coast of Pinar del Rio, Cuba, including the Isle of Youth.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the U.S. hurricane
warning area late today.  Tropical storm conditions have 
already begun in the Florida Keys and portions of south 
Florida, and these conditions are expected to spread northward 
across the state and into Georgia and South Carolina through 
tonight.  
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the warning
area in western Cuba during the next few hours.
 
RAINFALL: Hurricane Helene is expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches over western Cuba, the Cayman Islands
and the northeast Yucatan Peninsula, with isolated totals around 12
inches. This rainfall brings a risk of considerable flooding.
 
Over portions of the Southeastern U.S. into the Southern
Appalachians, Helene is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 6 to 12 inches with isolated totals around 18 inches. This
rainfall will likely result in catastrophic and potentially
life-threatening flash and urban flooding, along with significant
river flooding. Numerous landslides are expected in steep terrain
across the southern Appalachians.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Helene, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
TORNADOES: The risk for several tornadoes will gradually increase
today through tonight. The greatest threat is expected from parts of
northern Florida into southeast Georgia, the Midlands and Low
Country of South Carolina, and southern North Carolina.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Helene will affect much of Florida and 
the coasts of Georgia and the Carolinas during the next couple of 
days.  Swells will also continue across portions of Cuba and the 
Yucatan Peninsula through tonight. These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Helene Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092024
400 AM CDT Thu Sep 26 2024
 
Helene is sending some mixed structural signals this morning.  On
one side, an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft reports
that the central pressure has fallen to near 966 mb, and satellite 
imagery shows the eye is trying to clear out. On another side, the
aircraft reported concentric eyewalls of 16 and 32 n mi diameter, 
with the maximum flight-level winds, 80 kt at 700 mb, occurring 
about 50 n mi southeast of the center likely in relation to the 
outer eyewall.  Based on the central pressure fall and the 
available data, the initial intensity is increased to 80 kt.
 
The hurricane is starting its expected turn toward the 
north-northeast, with the initial motion now 015/10. The hurricane 
should accelerate north-northeastward during the next 24 h or so in 
the flow between a ridge over the Atlantic and a deep-layer 
baroclinic trough/cut-off low over the Tennessee Valley.  This 
motion should bring the center of Helene to the coast of the Florida 
Big Bend region Thursday evening or early Friday morning.  After 
landfall, Helene should turn northward and northwestward around the 
northeast and north side of the Tennessee Valley system.  After 48 
h, what is left of Helene should make a cyclonic loop as it merges 
with the baroclinic system.  The latest track guidance has nudged a 
little to the northeast, especially near 36 h, and the portion of 
the new forecast track over Georgia and Tennessee has been moved 
a bit to the east.  
 
Helene remains in an atmospheric and oceanic environment over the
eastern Gulf of Mexico that is very conducive for strengthening,
with the system forecast to traverse the Loop Current while it
remains in a moist and low-shear environment.  The main restraining
factor on intensification is the current concentric eyewall status.  
All of the intensity guidance continues to forecast strengthening 
until landfall.  Based on this, the new intensity forecast calls 
for Helen to become a major hurricane in about 12 h, and additional 
intensification is expected in the ensuing 6 h period or so before 
landfall.  After landfall, Helene should weaken and undergo 
extratropical transition as it merges with the baroclinic system 
over the Tennessee Valley, and this is expected to be complete by 
about 36 h.  The remnant extratropical low is forecast to dissipate 
after 72 h based on global model forecasts.
 
Helene is forecast to be a large major hurricane when it reaches the
Big Bend coast of Florida.   As a result, storm surge, wind, and
rainfall impacts will extend well away from the center and outside
the forecast cone, particularly on the east side.  In addition, the
fast forward speed when Helene moves inland will result in a far
inland penetration of strong winds over parts of the southeastern
United States, including strong gusts over higher terrain of the
southern Appalachians.  Indeed, the GFS and ECMWF models suggest
the possibility that the inner wind core may persist until the
center reaches northern Georgia.  A higher-than-normal gust factor
is indicated in the official forecast while Helene is inland.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. A catastrophic and deadly storm surge is likely along portions
of the Florida Big Bend coast, where inundation could reach as high
as 20 feet above ground level, along with destructive waves.  There
is also a danger of life-threatening storm surge along the remainder
of the west coast of the Florida Peninsula.  Residents in those
areas should follow advice given by local officials and evacuate if
told to do so.
 
2. Potentially catastrophic hurricane-force winds are expected
within the eyewall of Helene when it makes landfall in the Florida
Big Bend region later today.  Preparations to protect life and
property should be completed this morning before tropical
storm conditions arrive.  Damaging and life-threatening
hurricane-force winds, especially in gusts, will penetrate well
inland over portions of northern Florida and southern Georgia later 
today and tonight where Hurricane Warnings are in effect.  Strong 
wind gusts are also likely farther north across portions of
northern Georgia and the Carolinas, particularly over the higher
terrain of the southern Appalachians.
 
3. Catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding,
including numerous significant landslides, is expected across
portions of the southern Appalachians through Friday. Considerable
to locally catastrophic flash and urban flooding is likely for
northwestern and northern Florida and the Southeast through Friday.
Widespread significant river flooding and isolated major river
flooding are likely.
 
4. Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of western
Cuba within the Tropical Storm Warning area.  Hurricane Helene will
bring heavy rain to portions of the western Caribbean with
potentially significant flooding across western Cuba and the
northeastern Yucatan Peninsula through this morning.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Isaac was
located near latitude 37.1 North, longitude 52.8 West. Isaac is
moving toward the east near 12 mph (19 km/h) and a general eastward 
to east-northeastward motion is expected to continue for the next 
several days. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours and Isaac 
could be become a hurricane by Friday over the open Subtropical 
Atlantic. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a
deep-layer trough are affecting portions of the coast of Bermuda and
could spread into the Azores by this weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Isaac Forecast Discussion Number 2</title>

Tropical Storm Isaac Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
500 AM AST Thu Sep 26 2024

Isaac's structure on satellite looks fairly healthy for a 
high-latitude tropical cyclone. There are plenty of curved banding 
features rotating around the estimated center on IR satellite, 
matched by a recent AMSR2 microwave pass also showing convective 
banding. While the cloud top temperatures are not that cold, only 
-50 to -60 C, that is rather typical for a tropical cyclone along 
the axis of an upper-level trough with a depressed tropopause. Based 
on the earlier scatterometer wind data, plus a DMINT estimate from 
the AMSR2 pass of 46 kt, the initial intensity is held at 45 kt 
this advisory. 

The tropical storm is continuing eastward this morning at 90/10 kt. 
This general motion, albeit with a gradual turn more 
east-northeastward is expected over the next several days as Isaac 
slowly accelerates under the influence of mid-level ridging to the 
southeast of the storm. The track guidance is in pretty good 
agreement in the short-term. However, differences primarily in the 
along-track direction begin to be evident beyond 48 h, which could 
ultimately play a role in more notable across-track differences 
shown between the GFS and ECMWF solutions by early next week. For 
now, the NHC track forecast is very similar to the previous track 
forecast, and favors a solution very similar to the HFIP corrected 
consensus approach (HCCA) and ECMWF track. 
 
Given the storm's healthy current structure, there is an opportunity 
for it to intensify over the next couple of days. During this time 
span, sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) hover between 26-27 C, colder 
than normal upper-level temperatures should aid tropospheric 
instability, and vertical wind shear is forecast to remain in the 
15-20 kt range, in the same direction as the storm motion. The 
simulated IR imagery from the latest ECMWF and GFS runs also show 
Isaac attempting to clear out an eye occasionally in the 36-60 h 
period. These signals suggest that Isaac could become a hurricane, 
and that is now explicitly reflected in the latest NHC forecast, 
which is very close to the latest HCCA consensus aid. After 60 h, 
shear increases markedly as SSTs also decrease, which should lead to 
weakening, and Isaac is forecast to become post-tropical sometime 
near the end of the forecast as it passes by to the north of the 
Azores.
