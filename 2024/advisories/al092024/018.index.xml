Tropical Storm Joyce Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112024
500 PM AST Fri Sep 27 2024
 
Deep convection has increased and become more concentrated near the 
center of Joyce this afternoon. A cold dense overcast has developed 
and expanded over the low-level center of the tropical cyclone. As a 
result, the latest satellite intensity estimates have risen, and the 
initial intensity is brought up to 45 kt. This is consistent with a 
T3.0/45-kt Dvorak classification from TAFB, as well as a blend of 
recent UW-CIMSS objective estimates that range from 36-52 kt. 

Additional near-term strengthening is possible while Joyce remains 
in an environment of strong upper-level divergence and moderate 
shear over warm SSTs. However, the storm is forecast to encounter 
increasing shear and a progressively drier mid-level environment 
during the next couple of days, which should induce a weakening 
trend later this weekend and into early next week. The updated NHC 
intensity forecast peaks at 55 kt in 12 h, with gradual weakening 
shown thereafter based on the less favorable environmental 
conditions that are anticipated. Simulated satellite imagery from 
the latest ECMWF run shows Joyce maintaining organized convection 
through Monday, but the GFS suggests it could degenerate to a 
remnant low even sooner. This forecast shows Joyce degenerating into 
a post-tropical remnant low in 72 h and dissipating by day 5, but 
future timing changes may be necessary.

The storm continues to move northwestward (305/11 kt) around the 
southwestern periphery of a low- to mid-level ridge over the eastern 
Atlantic. A slight turn toward the west-northwest is expected during 
the next day or two, along with a slower forward speed as the 
steering currents weaken. There is more spread in the track guidance 
thereafter, with some model disagreement about whether and how 
quickly the storm turns northward ahead of an upper trough over the 
central Atlantic. For now, the NHC track forecast is shifted 
slightly to the left and is a bit slower between 48-72 h, following 
the latest HCCA and and TVCA trends.

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Helene can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Over portions of the central and southern Appalachians, 
Helene is expected to produce additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 
inches leading to widespread total rainfall accumulations of 6 to 12 
inches, with isolated totals exceeding 20 inches. This rainfall will 
result in catastrophic and potentially life-threatening flash and 
urban flooding, along with record level river flooding in many 
instances. Numerous significant landslides are expected in steep 
terrain across the southern Appalachians. Elsewhere, 1 to 3 inches 
of rainfall is expected across portions of the Ohio Valley through 
Sunday evening.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Tropical Storm Helene, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero. 

For a list of rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated 
this storm, see the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the 
WMO header ACUS44 KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html. 
 
TORNADOES: Isolated tornadoes are possible this afternoon and 
evening over southern Virginia and northeast North Carolina.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Helene will affect the coasts of Georgia
and the Carolinas during the next day or so.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Helene Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092024
400 PM CDT Fri Sep 27 2024
 
Helene has been producing catastrophic flooding over portions of
the southeast U.S. and southern Appalachians, and the associated
heavy rains are shifting westward into the Ohio and Tennessee
Valleys.  Satellite images and surface observations indicate that
Helene has completed extratropical transition, and the initial
intensity is set at 30 kt.
 
The cyclone is moving to the north-northwest at 15 kt.  A slowdown 
is expected tonight, and the cyclone is forecast to stall over the 
Tennessee Valley this weekend, likely resulting in continued and 
prolonged rainfall.
 
This is the last tropical cyclone discussion issued by the
National Hurricane Center on Helene.  Future information on
this system can be found in discussions issued by the Weather
Prediction Center beginning at 1000 PM CDT, under AWIPS header
TCDAT4, WMO header WTNT44 KWNH, and on the web at
www.hurricanes.gov.
 
Rainfall forecasts for the United States can always be found at
https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/qpf/qpf2.shtml
and outlooks of flash flood risks can be found at
https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/qpf/excessive_rainfall_outlook_ero.php
.

KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Historic, catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban 
flooding, including numerous major landslides, will continue across 
portions of the southern Appalachians through this evening, followed
by gradual improvement tonight and into Saturday.  Widespread 
serious river flooding is ongoing, some of which will be major to 
record breaking.
 
2. There is a possibility of long-duration power outages in
portions of the southeast U.S.  If you use a generator, be sure it
is placed outside at least 20 feet away from doors, windows, and
garages to avoid deadly carbon monoxide poisoning.
 
3. Use caution after the system passes as deadly hazards remain
including downed power lines and flooded areas.

BULLETIN
Hurricane Isaac Advisory Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
500 PM AST Fri Sep 27 2024
 
...ISAAC IS INTENSIFYING...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...37.8N 45.3W
ABOUT 995 MI...1600 KM W OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...85 MPH...140 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...E OR 80 DEGREES AT 16 MPH...26 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...976 MB...28.82 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Isaac was located
near latitude 37.8 North, longitude 45.3 West. Isaac is moving
toward the east near 16 mph (26 km/h). A gradual turn to the 
east-northeast is expected with a slight decrease in forward speed 
over the next day or so. On Saturday, a gradual turn to the 
northeast is forecast and this motion should continue through 
Monday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Some slight additional strengthening is expected 
tonight or Saturday morning followed by gradual weakening through 
early next week. Isaac is expected to be a post-tropical cyclone on 
Monday. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 976 mb (28.82 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a
deep-layer trough could spread into the Azores by this weekend.

<title>Hurricane Isaac Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Hurricane Isaac Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
500 PM AST Fri Sep 27 2024
 
Isaac's satellite presentation has improved since this morning. A 
small ragged eye can be seen on infrared imagery with cooler cloud 
tops surrounding it. An AMSR2 microwave pass from earlier today 
showed the mid- and low-level centers co-located with a primary 
band in the northwestern quadrant. Both the SAB and TAFB subjective 
Dvorak classifications suggested that Isaac's intensity has 
increased. Objective guidance aids are also suggesting the same. 
Taking all of these into consideration, the intensity has been 
increased to 75 kt.
 
The hurricane is moving eastward at 14 kt. Isaac is moving in the 
mid-latitude zonal flow and will gradual turn to the east-northeast 
later today. In about a day or so, Isaac will begin interacting with 
an upper-level trough to its east and turn more northeastward and 
slow down. The latest track forecast is very similar to the previous 
forecast, however, the day four and five track positions were 
adjusted westward as the model guidance has been shifting in this 
direction.  

Isaac is close to its peak intensity as the window for strengthening 
is ending soon. By Saturday, it will move over cooler waters, into 
an area of strong vertical wind shear, and a dry mid-level airmass. 
The peak intensity has been adjusted upward to 80 kt because of the 
recent strengthening.  On Saturday, Isaac is expect to gradually 
weaken and this trend will continue for the reminder of the forecast 
period. Simulated satellite imagery from the global models show 
Isaac losing its deep convection by Monday and the official forecast 
now predicts the hurricane to become a post-tropical cyclone by 60 
h.
