DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Helene was
located near latitude 34.2 North, longitude 83.0 West. Helene is
moving toward the north near 30 mph (48 km/h).  Helene is expected 
to turn northwestward and slow down over the Tennessee Valley later 
today and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Continued weakening is expected, and Helene is
expected to become a post-tropical low this afternoon or tonight.
However, damaging wind gusts will penetrate far inland across the
southeastern United States, including over the higher terrain of the
southern Appalachians.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275 miles (445 km)
mainly to the east of the center.  An observation in Brasstown 
Bald, Georgia recently reported a wind gust of 72 mph (116 km/h).  
An observation in Dewees Island, South Carolina, recently reported 
a sustained wind of 46 mph (74 km/h) and a gust of 62 mph (100 
km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure based on surface observations is 
972 mb (28.70 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Helene can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a life-threatening storm surge and
the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded
by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Aucilla River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...5-10 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Aucilla River, FL...3-6 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occurring along much of the 
Georgia and South Carolina coasts, and these conditions will 
continue for the next several hours. Strong, damaging winds, 
especially in gusts, will also continue as far inland as the higher 
terrain of the southern Appalachians.
 
RAINFALL: Over portions of the Southeastern U.S. into the Southern
Appalachians, Helene is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 6 to 12 inches, with isolated totals around 20 inches. This
rainfall will likely result in catastrophic and potentially
life-threatening flash and urban flooding, along with significant
and record river flooding. Numerous significant landslides are
expected in steep terrain across the southern Appalachians.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Helene, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
For a list of rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated
this storm, see the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the
WMO header ACUS44 KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.
 
TORNADOES: Tornadoes are possible this morning over parts of eastern
Georgia, and through this afternoon over the Carolinas and southern
Virginia.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Helene will affect the coasts of Georgia 
and the Carolinas during the next day or so.  These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Tropical Storm Helene Forecast Discussion Number 16</title>

Tropical Storm Helene Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092024
500 AM EDT Fri Sep 27 2024

The eye of Helene made landfall near Perry, Florida, just after the 
last advisory was issued. Since then, the center has crossed the 
Florida Big Bend region and is currently located over east central 
Georgia.  Surface observations have shown steady weakening since 
landfall, and the maximum winds have decreased to a possibly 
generous 60 kt.  During the last couple of hours, the radar 
signature of the cyclone has degraded, and based on this the hourly 
Tropical Cyclone Updates will be discontinued.

The initial motion is now northward or 360/26.  Helen should turn 
northwestward later today as it starts to interact with a mid- to 
upper-level baroclinic low to its northwest.  After that, the 
cyclone should considerably slow its forward motion and make a 
cyclonic loop as it gets absorbed into the low.  The new forecast 
track follows the general trend of the large-scale dynamical models.

Helene should continue to weaken, and simulated satellite imagery 
suggests it should lose its convection later today, the new 
intensity forecast calls for the cyclone to weaken and become 
post-tropical in about 12 h, followed by transition to an 
extratropical cyclone as it merges with the baroclinic low.  The 
remnant extratropical low is expected to dissipate by 72 h.

Although the system will weaken as it moves over land, the fast
forward speed of Helene during the next 12 hours or so will result
in a far inland penetration of strong winds over parts of the
southeastern United States, particularly over northern Georgia, 
including strong gusts over the higher terrain of the southern 
Appalachians. Accordingly, a higher-than-normal gust factor is 
indicated in the official forecast while Helene is inland.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The storm surge along portions of the Florida Big Bend coast and 
other portions of the west coast of Florida should subside today.
 
2. Damaging wind gusts will continue to penetrate well inland over 
portions of Georgia and the Carolinas today, particularly over the 
higher terrain of the southern Appalachians. Residents in these 
areas should be prepared for the possibility of long-duration power
outages.  If you use a generator after the storm, be sure it is
placed outside at least 20 feet away from doors, windows, and
garages to avoid deadly carbon monoxide poisoning.
 
3. Catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding, 
including numerous significant landslides, is expected across 
portions of the southern Appalachians through Friday. Considerable 
to locally catastrophic flash and urban flooding is likely for 
northwestern and northern Florida and the Southeast through Friday. 
Widespread significant river flooding is likely, some of which will 
be major to record breaking.

Hurricane Isaac Advisory Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
500 AM AST Fri Sep 27 2024
 
...ISAAC BECOMES A HURRICANE...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...37.0N 48.5W
ABOUT 1175 MI...1895 KM W OF THE AZORES
ABOUT 980 MI...1575 KM ENE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...E OR 90 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...981 MB...28.97 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Isaac was located
near latitude 37.0 North, longitude 48.5 West. Isaac is moving
toward the east near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this motion with a
gradual turn to the east-northeast is expected over the next
several days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Additional strengthening is expected during the next day or 
so followed by gradual weakening by the end of this weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles
(110 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 981 mb (28.97 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a
deep-layer trough are affecting portions of the coast of Bermuda and
could spread into the Azores by this weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Hurricane Isaac Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Hurricane Isaac Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
500 AM AST Fri Sep 27 2024
 
Isaac has continued to become better organized since the prior 
advisory. The earlier warm spot noted on IR satellite imagery has 
persisted and warmed further, with sufficently cold -55 to -60 C 
convective cloud tops encircling the feature. A helpful AMSR2 pass 
that became available after the prior advisory also showed an eye 
feature on both the 89-GHz and 37-GHz channels, the latter showing a 
cyan ring. These features suggest that Isaac has become a hurricane, 
and the initial intensity has been raised to 65 kt for this 
advisory.
 
Isaac still is moving generally eastward this morning, estimated at
090/10 kt. This motion with a gradual turn to the east-northeast
should occur over the next couple of days as the hurricane remains
steered mostly by deep-layer flow along the northern periphery of a
mid-level ridge centered to the southeast of Isaac. Once again, how
quick this forward motion ends up being will be critical for its
ultimate track down the road, with a track bifurcation continuing
between the GFS and ECMWF solutions occuring beyond 60 h as to how
much the upstream trough located to its east is able to interact
and pick up the cyclone. Despite the spread in the guidance, the
consensus aids are not that much altered from the prior cycle, and
the NHC track forecast is quite similar to the prior advisory.
 
Additional intensification is expected while the vertical wind shear
remains only low to moderate and Isaac continues to be over
sufficently warm sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) with instability
being aided by cold upper-level temperatures. After 36 h, SSTs drop
to 24 C and lower as shear increases markedly, which should induce
a gradual weakening trend. Both the GFS and ECMWF suggest the
cyclone should lose its deep convection sometime in the 72-96 h
period, marking its transition to post-tropical in that time frame.
The NHC intensity forecast is on the high side of the guidance, but
is generally in line with the latest GFS-based SHIPS and LGEM
guidance.
