DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Helene was 
located near latitude 25.5 North, longitude 85.5 West. Helene is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A 
significant increase in forward speed is expected during the next 24 
hours.  On the forecast track, Helene will make landfall in the 
Florida Big Bend region this evening. After landfall, Helene is 
expected to turn northwestward and slow down over the Tennessee 
Valley on Friday and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 105 mph (165 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast, and Helene
is expected to be a major hurricane when it reaches the Florida Big
Bend coast this evening.  Weakening is expected after landfall, but
Helene's fast forward speed will allow strong, damaging winds,
especially in gusts, to penetrate well inland across the
southeastern United States, including over the higher terrain of the
southern Appalachians.

Helene is a very large hurricane. Hurricane-force winds extend 
outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 345 miles
(555 km).
 
The minimum central pressure based on data from the Air Force 
Hurricane Hunters is 960 mb (28.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Helene can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a life-threatening storm surge and
the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded
by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Carrabelle, FL to Suwannee River, FL...15-20 ft
Apalachicola, FL to Carrabelle, FL...10-15 ft
Suwannee River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...10-15 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...8-12 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Apalachicola, FL...6-10 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...5-8 ft
Tampa Bay...5-8 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...4-7 ft
East of Mexico Beach, FL to Indian Pass, FL...3-5 ft
Englewood, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Charlotte Harbor...3-5 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be 
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding 
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, 
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the U.S. hurricane
warning area late today.  Tropical storm conditions have
already begun in the Florida Keys and portions of south
Florida, and these conditions are expected to spread northward
across the tropical storm warning areas in the southeastern U.S. 
through early Friday.  Strong, damaging winds, especially in gusts, 
will likely penetrate as far inland as the higher terrain of the 
southern Appalachians.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the warning
area in western Cuba during the next couple of hours.
 
RAINFALL: Hurricane Helene is expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches over western Cuba. This rainfall
brings a risk of considerable flooding.
 
Over portions of the Southeastern U.S. into the Southern
Appalachians, Helene is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 6 to 12 inches, with isolated totals around 20 inches. This
rainfall will likely result in catastrophic and potentially
life-threatening flash and urban flooding, along with significant
river flooding. Numerous significant landslides are expected in
steep terrain across the southern Appalachians.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Helene, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
For a list of rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated
this storm, see the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the
WMO header ACUS44 KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.
 
TORNADOES: The risk for several tornadoes will gradually increase
today through tonight. The greatest threat is expected from parts of
northern Florida into southeast Georgia, the Midlands and Low
Country of South Carolina, and southern North Carolina.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Helene will affect much of Florida and
the coasts of Georgia and the Carolinas during the next couple of
days.  Swells will also continue across portions of Cuba and the
Yucatan Peninsula through tonight. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Helene Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092024
1000 AM CDT Thu Sep 26 2024
 
Helene is gaining strength as it approaches the Florida Big Bend. A 
large eye has become apparent in satellite images, and that feature 
has been gradually clearing out over the past few hours. Convective 
banding is wrapping around the eye, and recent microwave images and 
reports from the NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate than an eyewall is almost completely closed.  The minimum 
pressure has been dropping steadily to near 960 mb, and based on the 
aircraft flight-level wind data, the initial intensity is estimated 
to have increased to 90 kt.  There have been several reports of 
tropical-storm-force winds occurring in portions of South Florida 
and the Florida Keys during the past few hours.
 
The large hurricane is picking up speed and has turned slightly to
the north-northeast.  The latest initial motion is 025/12 kt.  A
notably faster north-northeastward motion is expected through
landfall, which is expected to occur in the Florida Big Bend region
this evening.  After Helene moves inland, it is forecast to track
over Georgia and then slow down or stall over the Tennessee Valley
when it merges with a mid- to upper-level low pressure system.  Only
minor changes were made to the previous NHC track forecast.
 
Significant intensification is expected until Helene reaches the
coast since the overall atmospheric and oceanic conditions will
remain conducive.  The amount of strengthening will likely depend on
how much the inner core can contract and consolidate.  The HWRF and
HMON models show significant strengthening to category 4 status,
while most of the other models are a little lower.  The main message
is that Helene will likely make landfall as a large major hurricane
in the Florida Big Bend this evening, and all preparations in the
hurricane warning area should be rushed to completion.
 
It should also be re-emphasized that Helene is a very large
hurricane.  In fact, comparing the system with previous hurricanes
in the Gulf of Mexico over the past couple of decades, Helene is at
the upper bound in terms of size. As a result, storm surge, wind,
and rainfall impacts will extend far away from the center and well
outside the forecast cone, particularly on the east side.  In
addition, the fast forward speed when Helene moves inland will
result in a far inland penetration of strong winds over parts of the
southeastern United States, including strong gusts over higher
terrain of the southern Appalachians.  Accordingly, a
higher-than-normal gust factor is indicated in the official forecast
while Helene is inland.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. A catastrophic and deadly storm surge is likely along portions
of the Florida Big Bend coast, where inundation could reach as high
as 20 feet above ground level, along with destructive waves.  There
is also a danger of life-threatening storm surge along the remainder
of the west coast of the Florida Peninsula.  Residents in those
areas should follow advice given by local officials and evacuate if
told to do so.
 
2. Potentially catastrophic hurricane-force winds are expected
within the eyewall of Helene when it makes landfall in the Florida
Big Bend region this evening.  Preparations to protect life and
property should be rushed to completion.  Damaging and
life-threatening hurricane-force winds, especially in gusts, will
penetrate well inland over portions of northern Florida and southern
Georgia later today and tonight where Hurricane Warnings are in
effect.  Strong wind gusts are also likely farther north across
portions of northern Georgia and the Carolinas, particularly over
the higher terrain of the southern Appalachians.
 
3. Catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding,
including numerous significant landslides, is expected across
portions of the southern Appalachians through Friday. Considerable
to locally catastrophic flash and urban flooding is likely for
northwestern and northern Florida and the Southeast through Friday.
Widespread significant river flooding and isolated major river
flooding are likely.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Isaac was
located near latitude 37.3 North, longitude 51.7 West. Isaac is
moving toward the east near 12 mph (19 km/h). A turn toward the 
east-northeast or northeast is expected by the weekend, along with 
a slight increase in forward speed.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast, and Isaac is expected reach or be near 
hurricane strength by late Friday or early Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a
deep-layer trough are affecting portions of the coast of Bermuda and
could spread into the Azores by this weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Isaac Forecast Discussion Number 3</title>

Tropical Storm Isaac Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
1100 AM AST Thu Sep 26 2024

Isaac's structure has remained mostly steady state during the past 
6 hours. Cloud tops associated with the tropical storm are still 
not particularly cold, but as noted in previous discussions, this 
is not unexpected for its synoptic environment. A blend of 
subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB plus objective 
estimates from UW-CIMSS still supports an intensity of 45 kt for 
this advisory.

For the next 48-60 h, the track forecast appears to be mostly 
straightforward. All reliable guidance indicates that Isaac will 
continue moving eastward to east-northeastward with a mid-latitude 
trough during that period. However, there is a significant 
bifurcation in the dynamical models after that. A majority of the 
guidance, including most of the ECMWF ensemble, indicate that Isaac 
will turn back eastward, continuing with the mid-latitude flow 
associated with another deep-layer trough.  However, a few members 
of the global ensembles, plus the deterministic GFS, indicate Isaac 
could move slightly slower, which could cause the tropical storm to 
interact with a different trough, currently located over eastern 
Canada. This may cause the tropical cyclone to move northward after 
60 h, on a very different track. The NHC forecast treats the GFS as 
an outlier, and is instead near the consensus of the remaining 
guidance. It is therefore very similar to the previous forecast. 
However, confidence in this forecast is particularly low, and we 
can't rule out needing to make an unusually large change to later 
forecasts.
 
Isaac appears to be in an environment that should be generally 
conducive for some strengthening, especially during the next day or 
two.  After that, unusually cold upper-tropospheric temperatures 
could help sustain the tropical cyclone for a while, even as it 
moves over colder SSTs in the 24-25 deg C. By the end of the 
forecast period, much colder SSTs and a dramatic increase in shear 
should cause Isaac to become post-tropical. No changes of note were 
made to the NHC forecast, which still shows Isaac reaching 
hurricane strength during the next couple of days.
