<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
upgraded Hurricane Helene, located over the southeastern Gulf of <br/>
Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic (AL98):<br/>
A broad low pressure system associated with a tropical wave located <br/>
west of the Cabo Verde Islands continues to produce disorganized <br/>
shower and thunderstorm activity. Environmental conditions appear <br/>
favorable for gradual development of this system, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form in a few days while it moves westward <br/>
to west-northwestward across the eastern and central tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (AL99): <br/>
A non-tropical area of low pressure is currently located several <br/>
hundred miles to the northeast of Bermuda. The system is currently <br/>
producing winds up to storm force, and environmental conditions <br/>
could support the low developing some subtropical or tropical <br/>
characteristics over the next several days as the system moves <br/>
generally east-northeastward, remaining over the central Subtropical <br/>
Atlantic. Additional information on this system, including storm <br/>
warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National <br/>
Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Helene was located
near latitude 22.0 North, longitude 86.4 West.  Helene is moving
toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A turn toward the
north and north-northeast with an increase in forward speed is
expected later today through Thursday, bringing the center of Helene
across the eastern Gulf of Mexico and to the Florida Big Bend coast
by Thursday evening.  After landfall, Helene is expected to slow
down and turn toward the northwest over the southeastern United
States Friday and Saturday.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that maximum sustained winds remain near 80 mph (130 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Strengthening is forecast, and Helene is expected to 
be a major hurricane when it reaches the Florida Big Bend coast 
Thursday evening.  Weakening is expected after landfall, but 
Helene's fast forward speed will allow strong, damaging winds, 
especially in gusts, to penetrate well inland across the 
southeastern United States, including over the higher terrain of
the southern Appalachians.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275
miles (445 km).  A commercial fishing vessel located near Isla 
Mujeres, Mexico, recently reported a wind of 63 mph (102 km/h).
 
Dropsonde data indicate that the minimum central pressure has been 
relatively steady during the past few hours and is estimated to be
980 mb (28.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Helene can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a life-threatening storm surge and 
the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded 
by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could 
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated 
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Carrabelle, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...12-18 ft
Apalachicola, FL to Carrabelle, FL...8-12 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...8-12 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Apalachicola, FL...6-9 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...5-8 ft
Tampa Bay...5-8 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...4-7 ft
Englewood, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Charlotte Harbor...3-5 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the southern
coast of Pinar del Rio, Cuba, including the Isle of Youth.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3 to 5 feet above
ground level in areas of onshore winds within the warning area along
the north coast of the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the U.S. hurricane
warning area late Thursday, with tropical storm conditions
beginning Thursday morning.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected in southern Florida later today and will spread northward
across the rest of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina through
Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the
tropical storm watch area in South Carolina beginning on Thursday.
 
Hurricane conditions, especially in gusts, are expected in the
hurricane warning area in Mexico during the next several hours.
Tropical storm conditions are occurring in the warning area in Cuba,
and hurricane conditions are possible for the western portion of
Cuba today.
 
RAINFALL: Helene is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
4 to 8 inches over western Cuba, the Cayman Islands, and the
northeast Yucatan Peninsula, with isolated totals around 12 inches.
This rainfall brings a risk of considerable flooding.  A 24-hour 
rainfall total of 8.60 inches (218.4 mm) was recently reported in 
Embalse Herradura, Pinar del Rio, Cuba, by the Meteorological 
Service of Cuba.
 
Over the Southeastern U.S. into the Southern Appalachians, Helene
is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 5 to 10 inches
with isolated totals around 15 inches. This rainfall will likely
result in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with areas
of significant river flooding. Landslides are possible in areas of
steep terrain in the southern Appalachians.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Helene, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall
Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and
the Flash Flood Risk graphic at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
TORNADOES: A tornado or two may occur tonight over parts of the
Florida Peninsula and southern Alabama. The risk of tornadoes will
increase on Thursday, expanding northward across Florida into parts
of Georgia and South Carolina.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Helene will affect the southern coast of
Cuba and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico during the next couple of
days.  Swells will spread northward toward the west coast of Florida
and the northeastern Gulf Coast later today and Thursday. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

TCDAT4
 
Hurricane Helene Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092024
1000 AM CDT Wed Sep 25 2024
 
Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft have been
investigating Helene, with each plane recently measuring peak 
flight-level winds of 81 kt and 78 kt, respectively.  Helene has 
therefore become a hurricane with an estimated intensity of 70 kt.  
Dropsonde data also indicate that the pressure has fallen to about 
979 mb.  Radar data from Mexico and Cuba, as well as reconnaissance 
reports, indicate that Helene has formed a partial, elliptical 
eyewall that is open on the east side.
 
Helene has turned north-northwestward (330/9 kt) and is expected to
turn northward and north-northeastward later today and tonight,
bringing the center to the coast of the Florida Big Bend Thursday
evening. After landfall, Helene is expected to interact with a
deep-layer trough over the Lower Mississippi Valley and swing back
to the northwest and stall near the Tennessee Valley late Friday
into the weekend.  The track guidance remains tightly clustered,
and the NHC forecast is generally just an update of the previous
prediction. It is still too soon at this point to be overly focused
on an exact landfall location and time, since NHC track forecasts
can be off by an average of 60 nm at the 36-hour forecast time.
 
Helene is expected to move through/over an environment of
relatively low shear, strong upper-level divergence, and sea
surface temperatures of 29-31 degrees Celsius, all of which should
foster additional strengthening.  Rapid Intensification (RI)
indices indicate a high chance of RI during the next 24 hours, and
as a result the NHC intensity forecast shows Helene becoming a
major hurricane by Thursday morning.  There is still some
uncertainty on exactly how strong Helene will get, and upward
adjustments to the forecast intensity could be required in
subsequent advisories if Helene rapidly intensifies more than
forecast.  Regardless, Helene is forecast to be a large major
hurricane when it reaches the Big Bend coast of Florida.   As a
result, storm surge, wind, and rainfall impacts will likely extend
well away from the center and outside the forecast cone,
particularly on the east side.  In addition, the fast forward speed
while Helene crosses the coast will likely result in farther inland
penetration of strong winds over parts of the southeastern United
States after landfall, including strong gusts over higher terrain
of the southern Appalachians.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are expected over
northeastern portions of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico today where
Tropical Storm and Hurricane Warnings are in effect.  Tropical storm
conditions are occurring over portions of western Cuba within the
Tropical Storm Warning area, and hurricane conditions are possible
today within the Hurricane Watch area.
 
2. Due to the large size of Helene, there is a danger of
life-threatening storm surge along the entire west coast of the
Florida Peninsula and Florida Big Bend.  The highest inundation of
greater than 10 ft is expected along the Florida Big Bend coast.
Residents in those areas should follow advice given by local
officials and evacuate if told to do so.
 
3. Devastating hurricane-force winds are expected across portions 
of northern Florida and southern Georgia where the core of Helene 
moves inland.  Preparations to protect life and property should be 
completed by early Thursday since tropical storm conditions are 
expected to begin within these areas on Thursday.  Because of 
Helene’s expected fast forward speed, damaging and life-threatening 
wind gusts, are expected to penetrate well inland over portions of 
the southeastern United States, including in the higher terrain of 
the southern Appalachians.  
 
4. Helene will bring heavy rain to portions of the western
Caribbean with potentially significant flooding across western Cuba
and the northeastern Yucatan Peninsula into early Thursday.
Considerable and potentially life-threatening flash and urban
flooding is expected across portions of northwestern and northern
Florida, the Southeast, southern Appalachians, and the Upper
Tennessee Valley Wednesday through Friday. This includes the risk of
landslides across the southern Appalachians. Widespread minor to
moderate river flooding is likely, and isolated major river flooding
is possible.
