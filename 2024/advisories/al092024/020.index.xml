Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Sat Sep 28 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Isaac, located over the central Subtropical Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
Tropical Storm Joyce, located over the central Tropical Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.  The Weather Prediction Center is issuing advisories on <br/>
Post-Tropical Cyclone Helene, located inland over the Ohio River <br/>
Valley.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A broad and elongated area of low pressure, associated with a <br/>
tropical wave, is producing limited shower activity near and to the <br/>
west of the Cabo Verde Islands.  Environmental conditions appear <br/>
conducive for gradual development of this system, and a tropical <br/>
depression could form next week while moving toward the west and <br/>
then northwest at about 10 mph across the eastern and central <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure could form over the western Caribbean Sea by <br/>
the early part of next week.  Environmental conditions are expected <br/>
to be conducive for additional development thereafter while the <br/>
system moves generally northwestward, and a tropical depression <br/>
could form by the middle of next week as the system enters the Gulf <br/>
of Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>

<title>Tropical Storm Joyce Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>

Tropical Storm Joyce Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112024
500 AM AST Sat Sep 28 2024

Satellite imagery this morning indicates that Joyce has changed 
little in organization since the last advisory, with the low-level 
center located on the southern edge of the convection due to 
southerly shear. Satellite intensity estimates are clustered near 
45 kt and have changed little during the past 6 h, and based on 
this the initial intensity remains 45 kt.

The initial motion is just a little to the right of the previous 
motion, 305/9 kt.  Joyce is on the south side of a narrow 
subtropical ridge, which is going to weaken and break as a 
deep-layer trough amplifies over the central Atlantic during the 
next few days.  This evolution should cause Joyce to move slowly to 
the west-northwest and northwest for a couple of days, followed by 
an even slower motion toward the north.  The track guidance is in 
generally good agreement through 48 h, but after that time there is 
some divergence due to a couple of the regional hurricane models 
forecasting a stronger Joyce to recurve into the aforementioned 
trough.  As with the previous advisory, the track forecast calls for 
a weaker Joyce to move slowly and not be fully picked up by the 
trough, and the new forecast track has no significant changes from 
the previous forecast.

Joyce is experiencing moderate southerly shear, and the global
models forecast this to continue for the next several days.  In 
addition, the storm will be moving into a gradually drier and 
subsident environment.  Thus, the new intensity forecast is similar 
to the previous forecast in calling for little change in strength 
during the next 12 hours, followed by gradual weakening. Simulated 
satellite imagery from the GFS and ECMWF models suggest that Joyce 
will lose its convection and become a remnant low by day 3, if not 
sooner.  The remnant low should degenerate into a trough by day 4 or 
5, with the remnants subsequently being absorbed by another system 
approaching from the east.

Hurricane Isaac Advisory Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
900 AM GMT Sat Sep 28 2024
 
...ISAAC CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN OVER THE SUBTROPICAL ATLANTIC...
...LARGE AREA OF DANGEROUS HIGH SEAS SPREADING SOUTH OF THE
HURRICANE...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM GMT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...39.3N 41.3W
ABOUT 785 MI...1265 KM W OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...105 MPH...165 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 55 DEGREES AT 20 MPH...31 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...968 MB...28.59 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM GMT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Isaac was located
near latitude 39.3 North, longitude 41.3 West. Isaac is moving
toward the northeast near 20 mph (31 km/h), and this general motion 
should continue through Monday followed by a turn toward the 
north-northeast on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 105 mph (165 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is expected through 
mid-day, followed by gradual weakening through the remainder of 
the forecast period.  Isaac is expected to be a post-tropical 
cyclone on Monday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 968 mb (28.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a
deep-layer trough could spread into the Azores through the weekend. 
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather 
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM GMT.

Hurricane Isaac Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
900 AM GMT Sat Sep 28 2024
 
Isaac has continued to strengthen this morning.  The satellite
presentation consists of a 20 nm (WMG 8C) clear eye and an
impressive curve band in the north side of the cyclone beneath the
upper diffluent westerlies.  The initial intensity is bumped up to
90 kt for this advisory and is based on a UW-CIMSS SATCON  analysis
of 93 kt and the Dvorak intensity estimates for TAFB and SAB.
 
Some fluctuations in strength are possible during the day, after 
which Isaac will be traversing cooler oceanic surface temperatures 
and experiencing increasing deep-layer shear.  Subsequently, 
gradual weakening is forecast, and the cyclone is expected to lose 
its deep core convection and become a post-tropical cyclone in 48 
hrs.  After that time, the global model fields and the FSU Cyclone 
Phase Evolution forecast show Isaac transitioning from a symmetric 
warm-core system to an asymmetric cold-core, more frontal thermal 
structure.  The NHC intensity forecast is similar to the consensus 
aids and shows Isaac completing its extratropical cyclone 
transition by Tuesday.
 
Isaac has turned toward the northeast, or 055/17 kt, in response
to a mid-latitude shortwave ridge temporarily building to the north 
of the cyclone.  By early next week, as Isaac loses its tropical
characteristics and completes an extratropical transition, the
cyclone should turn toward the north-northeast while a major 
shortwave trough approaches from the northwest over the central 
Atlantic.  The official track forecast is adjusted a little to the 
right of the previous forecast beyond 48 hrs to agree more with 
the TVCA and HCCA consensus models.
