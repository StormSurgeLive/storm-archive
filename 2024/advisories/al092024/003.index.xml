HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine can be found in
the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and
WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine is expected to produce 
total rain accumulations of 4 to 8 inches over western Cuba and the 
Cayman Islands with isolated totals around 12 inches.  Over the 
eastern Yucatan Peninsula, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected with 
isolated totals over 6 inches.  This rainfall brings a risk of 
considerable flooding.

Over the Southeastern U.S., Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine is 
expected to produce total rain accumulations of 3 to 6 inches with 
isolated totals around 10 inches. This rainfall will likely result 
in areas of locally considerable flash and urban flooding, with 
minor to isolated moderate river flooding also possible.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Bonita Beach to Flamingo...2-4 ft
Dry Tortugas...1-3 ft
Florida Keys...1-3 ft
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the southern
coast of Pinar del Rio, Cuba, including the Isle of Youth.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
ground level in areas of onshore winds within the warning area along
the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch areas in
Cuba and Mexico by early Wednesday. Tropical storm conditions are
expected in the warning areas in Cuba and Mexico beginning on
Tuesday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area
beginning on Wednesday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by the system will affect the southern coast
of Cuba and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico during the next couple
of days.  Swells will spread northward toward the west coast of
Florida and the northeastern Gulf Coast on Wednesday and Thursday.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.

<title>Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine Forecast Discussion Number 3</title>

Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092024
1100 PM EDT Mon Sep 23 2024

Satellite imagery indicates that there has been little change in 
the organization of the system since earlier today.  Most of the 
deep convection is over the eastern part of the broad circulation.  
Animation of proxy-vis GOES images, and radar observations from 
Grand Cayman Weather Service suggest that the disturbance still 
does not have a well-defined center of circulation, so the system is 
kept as a potential tropical cyclone for the time being.  The 
advisory intensity is held at 30 kt which is in agreement with a 
Dvorak estimate from TAFB.  An Air Force reconnaissance aircraft is 
scheduled to investigate the area in a few hours to provide a 
better description of the system's structure along with an updated 
intensity estimate. 

The initial motion estimate is a rather uncertain 330/5 kt.  During 
the next day or so, the disturbance is expected to turn 
northwestward along the southern and southwestern side of a 
mid-level high pressure area.  Then, the high is expected to shift 
eastward while a mid-level trough drops into the central United 
States.  This evolution of the steering pattern should cause the 
system to accelerate northward to north-northeastward over the 
eastern Gulf of Mexico and toward the northeastern Gulf Coast 
through Thursday. There is good agreement in the track guidance, and 
the official forecast is close to the corrected dynamical consensus 
model, HCCA, prediction.  This is also very similar to the previous 
NHC forecast.

An upper-level low over the northeastern Yucatan Peninsula has been 
imparting some southwesterly vertical wind shear over the 
disturbance.  This has probably caused a temporary disruption in 
development.  Dynamical guidance shows this low weakening with time, 
resulting in a reduction of shear in an environment that is 
otherwise very conducive for intensification.  The system is 
projected to move over waters of very high ocean heat content, 
which should lead to considerable strengthening during the forecast 
period.  The official intensity forecast is similar to the previous 
one and lies between the statistical-dynamical model guidance and 
the purely dynamical model predictions.  It should be noted that 
the 72-hour forecast allows for a little weakening after moving 
inland, so the cyclone is still expected to be at major hurricane 
strength at landfall. 

It should also be noted that the cyclone is expected to grow in 
size while it traverses the Gulf.  Thus, the storm surge, wind, and 
rainfall impacts will extend well away from the center, particularly 
to the east of the system. In addition, the fast forward speed 
while it crosses the coast will likely result in farther inland 
penetration of strong winds over parts of the southeastern United 
States after landfall.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The disturbance is forecast to intensify and be near hurricane
strength when it reaches the far northwestern Caribbean Sea Tuesday
night. Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of
western Cuba and the northeastern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula
with hurricane conditions possible.
 
2. The system is expected to intensify into a major hurricane
before it approaches the northeastern Gulf Coast on Thursday. While
it is too soon to pinpoint the exact location and magnitude of
impacts, the potential for life-threatening storm surge and
damaging hurricane-force winds along the coast of the Florida
Panhandle and the Florida west coast is increasing.  Hurricane 
Watches and additional Storm Surge watches will likely be issued 
for a portion of that area Tuesday morning, and residents should 
ensure they have their hurricane plan in place.
 
3. Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine will bring heavy rain to portions 
of the western Caribbean, which will cause considerable flooding 
and mudslides across western Cuba.  Heavy rainfall will likely 
result in locally considerable flash and urban flooding across 
portions of Florida, with isolated flash and urban flooding 
possible across the Southeast, Southern Appalachians, and the 
Tennessee Valley Wednesday through Friday. Minor to isolated 
moderate river flooding will be possible.
