<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Helene, located over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and on newly <br/>
formed Tropical Storm Isaac, located over the central Subtropical <br/>
Atlantic Ocean. <br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic (AL98):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms have increased this morning in association <br/>
with a broad area of low pressure along a tropical wave located <br/>
several hundred miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands. However, <br/>
earlier satellite wind data suggested the system still lacks a <br/>
well-defined circulation.  Environmental conditions appear favorable <br/>
for gradual development of this system, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form during the next day or two while it moves westward to <br/>
west-northwestward at around 15 mph across the eastern and central <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Helene was located
near latitude 24.2 North, longitude 86.2 West. Helene is moving
toward the north-northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h). This general 
motion is expected to continued with a significant increase in 
forward speed during the next 24 hours. On the forecast track, 
Helene will move across the eastern Gulf of Mexico today and cross 
the Florida Big Bend coast this evening or early Friday morning.  
After landfall, Helene is expected to turn northwestward and slow 
down over the Tennessee Valley on Friday and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 90 mph (150 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Strengthening is forecast, and Helene is 
expected to be a major hurricane when it reaches the Florida Big 
Bend coast this evening.  Weakening is expected after landfall, but 
Helene's fast forward speed will allow strong, damaging winds, 
especially in gusts, to penetrate well inland across the 
southeastern United States, including over the higher terrain of 
the southern Appalachians.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 345 miles
(555 km). The Key West Naval Air Station recently reported 
sustained winds of 41 mph (66 km/h) and a wind gust of 64 mph   
(103 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft data is 966 mb (28.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Helene can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a life-threatening storm surge and
the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded
by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Carrabelle, FL to Suwannee River, FL...15-20 ft
Apalachicola, FL to Carrabelle, FL...10-15 ft
Suwannee River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...10-15 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...8-12 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Apalachicola, FL...6-10 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...5-8 ft
Tampa Bay...5-8 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...4-7 ft
East of Mexico Beach, FL to Indian Pass, FL...3-5 ft
Englewood, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Charlotte Harbor...3-5 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the southern
coast of Pinar del Rio, Cuba, including the Isle of Youth.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the U.S. hurricane
warning area late today, with tropical storm conditions beginning
this morning.  Tropical storm conditions are spreading across the
Florida Keys at this time, and they are expected to spread
northward across the rest of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina
through tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the warning
area in western Cuba during the next few hours.
 
RAINFALL: Hurricane Helene is expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches over western Cuba, the Cayman Islands
and the northeast Yucatan Peninsula, with isolated totals around 12
inches. This rainfall brings a risk of considerable flooding.
 
Over portions of the Southeastern U.S. into the Southern
Appalachians, Helene is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 6 to 12 inches with isolated totals around 18 inches. This
rainfall will likely result in catastrophic and potentially
life-threatening flash and urban flooding, along with significant
river flooding. Numerous landslides are expected in steep terrain
across the southern Appalachians.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Helene, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
TORNADOES: The risk for several tornadoes will gradually increase
today through tonight. The greatest threat is expected from parts of
northern Florida into southeast Georgia, the Midlands and Low
Country of South Carolina, and southern North Carolina.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Helene will affect the southern coast of
Cuba and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico during the next couple of
days.  Swells will spread northward toward the west coast of Florida
and the northeastern Gulf Coast today. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Hurricane Helene Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Hurricane Helene Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092024
1000 PM CDT Wed Sep 25 2024

Satellite images show that Helene has a well-organized appearance, 
with numerous convective banding features.  A ragged-looking eye 
feature is also apparent.  However, reports from both Air Force and 
a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigating the system suggest 
that the it lacks a well-defined inner core with a somewhat broad 
maximum wind field for now.  The central pressure has dropped a 
little to around 972 mb.  Given the slowly falling central 
pressure, the intensity is maintained at 75 kt for this advisory.  
Helene's structure and intensity will continue to be closely 
monitored by Hurricane Hunter aircraft tonight and Thursday.
 
The hurricane continues moving northward with an estimated initial
motion of 360/08 kt.  For the next couple of days, the steering
scenario for this system remains basically unchanged from the
earlier advisory.  The flow between a mid-tropospheric trough over
the east-central United States and a ridge over the western
Atlantic should result in Helene accelerating northward to
north-northeastward during the next 24 to 36 hours. This motion 
will bring the center of Helene to the northeastern Gulf of Mexico 
coast in about 24 hours.  The official track forecast through 
landfall is very similar to the previous NHC prediction and remains 
close to the corrected consensus guidance. After landfall, the 
trough to the northwest of the tropical cyclone becomes a cutoff 
low, and Helene should turn leftward as it rotates around the low.  
In 3-4 days, the system should become a shallow extratropical 
cyclone within weaker steering currents.
 
Helene should be in an atmospheric and oceanic environment over the
eastern Gulf of Mexico that will be very conducive for 
strengthening.  The system is expected to traverse the Loop Current, 
which has especially high oceanic heat content.  This, along with 
fairly low vertical wind shear and a moist mid- to lower- 
tropospheric air mass, should likely result in rapid 
intensification before landfall.  The official forecast continues
to call for the hurricane to reach category 4 status tomorrow.  It 
should be noted that the HAFS-A and HAFS-B regional hurricane models 
show even more intensification than indicated here.
  
Helene is forecast to be a large major hurricane when it reaches the
Big Bend coast of Florida.   As a result, storm surge, wind, and
rainfall impacts will extend well away from the center and outside
the forecast cone, particularly on the east side.  In addition, the
fast forward speed when Helene moves inland will result in a far
inland penetration of strong winds over parts of the southeastern
United States, including strong gusts over higher terrain of the
southern Appalachians.  A higher-than-normal gust factor is 
indicated in the official forecast while Helene is inland.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. A catastrophic and deadly storm surge is likely along portions
of the Florida Big Bend coast, where inundation could reach as high
as 20 feet above ground level, along with destructive waves.  There
is also a danger of life-threatening storm surge along the remainder
of the west coast of the Florida Peninsula.  Residents in those
areas should follow advice given by local officials and evacuate if
told to do so.
 
2. Potentially catastrophic hurricane-force winds are expected
within the eyewall of Helene when it makes landfall in the Florida
Big Bend region late Thursday.  Preparations to protect life and
property should be completed by early Thursday before tropical
storm conditions arrive.  Damaging and life-threatening
hurricane-force winds, especially in gusts, will penetrate well
inland over portions of northern Florida and southern Georgia late
Thursday and Thursday night where Hurricane Warnings are in effect.
Strong wind gusts are also likely farther north across portions of
northern Georgia and the Carolinas, particularly over the higher
terrain of the southern Appalachians.
 
3. Catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding, 
including numerous landslides, is expected across portions of the 
southern Appalachians through Friday. Considerable to locally 
catastrophic flash and urban flooding is likely for northwestern and 
northern Florida and the Southeast through Friday. Widespread minor 
to moderate river flooding and isolated major river flooding are 
likely.
 
4. Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of western
Cuba within the Tropical Storm Warning area.  Hurricane Helene will 
bring heavy rain to portions of the western Caribbean with 
potentially significant flooding across western Cuba and the 
northeastern Yucatan Peninsula into early Thursday.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Isaac was
located near latitude 37.1 North, longitude 52.8 West. Isaac is
moving toward the east near 12 mph (19 km/h) and a general eastward 
to east-northeastward motion is expected to continue for the next 
several days. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours and Isaac 
could be become a hurricane by Friday over the open Subtropical 
Atlantic. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a
deep-layer trough are affecting portions of the coast of Bermuda and
could spread into the Azores by this weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Isaac Forecast Discussion Number 2</title>

Tropical Storm Isaac Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
500 AM AST Thu Sep 26 2024

Isaac's structure on satellite looks fairly healthy for a 
high-latitude tropical cyclone. There are plenty of curved banding 
features rotating around the estimated center on IR satellite, 
matched by a recent AMSR2 microwave pass also showing convective 
banding. While the cloud top temperatures are not that cold, only 
-50 to -60 C, that is rather typical for a tropical cyclone along 
the axis of an upper-level trough with a depressed tropopause. Based 
on the earlier scatterometer wind data, plus a DMINT estimate from 
the AMSR2 pass of 46 kt, the initial intensity is held at 45 kt 
this advisory. 

The tropical storm is continuing eastward this morning at 90/10 kt. 
This general motion, albeit with a gradual turn more 
east-northeastward is expected over the next several days as Isaac 
slowly accelerates under the influence of mid-level ridging to the 
southeast of the storm. The track guidance is in pretty good 
agreement in the short-term. However, differences primarily in the 
along-track direction begin to be evident beyond 48 h, which could 
ultimately play a role in more notable across-track differences 
shown between the GFS and ECMWF solutions by early next week. For 
now, the NHC track forecast is very similar to the previous track 
forecast, and favors a solution very similar to the HFIP corrected 
consensus approach (HCCA) and ECMWF track. 
 
Given the storm's healthy current structure, there is an opportunity 
for it to intensify over the next couple of days. During this time 
span, sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) hover between 26-27 C, colder 
than normal upper-level temperatures should aid tropospheric 
instability, and vertical wind shear is forecast to remain in the 
15-20 kt range, in the same direction as the storm motion. The 
simulated IR imagery from the latest ECMWF and GFS runs also show 
Isaac attempting to clear out an eye occasionally in the 36-60 h 
period. These signals suggest that Isaac could become a hurricane, 
and that is now explicitly reflected in the latest NHC forecast, 
which is very close to the latest HCCA consensus aid. After 60 h, 
shear increases markedly as SSTs also decrease, which should lead to 
weakening, and Isaac is forecast to become post-tropical sometime 
near the end of the forecast as it passes by to the north of the 
Azores.
