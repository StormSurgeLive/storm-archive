DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM MST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ileana was
located near latitude 23.5 North, longitude 109.3 West. Ileana is
moving toward the north near 9 mph (15 km/h). A steady northward
to north-northwestward motion is expected during the next few days.
On the forecast track, Ileana is forecast to move near or over the
southern portion of the Baja California peninsula this evening, and
over the southern and central Gulf of California this weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of days, and 
Ileana is expected to weaken to a tropical depression on Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ileana can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Through this weekend, Tropical Storm Ileana may produce
rainfall of 4 to 6 inches, with localized higher amounts up to 8
inches, across southern Baja California Sur. For northwest coastal
Sinaloa, Tropical Storm Ileana may result in between 6 to 8 inches 
with localized higher amounts up to 12 inches.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Ileana, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected across portions of the
warning area in the southern Baja California Peninsula through this
evening and into early Saturday. Tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area by early Saturday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ileana will affect portions of the coast
of west-central Mexico and the coast of the southern Baja California
Peninsula during the next couple of days. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1100 PM MST.
Next complete advisory at 200 AM MST.

<title>Tropical Storm Ileana Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Tropical Storm Ileana Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092024
800 PM MST Fri Sep 13 2024
 
Tropical Storm Ileana is gradually becoming less organized as it 
skirts the southern coast of Baja California Sur.  Infrared 
satellite imagery shows convection being stripped away from the 
low-level circulation and radar imagery from Cabo San Lucas still 
shows a poorly organized, elongated center.  Based on the degraded 
presentation of the storm and the earlier ASCAT data, the initial 
intensity is set to 35 kt for this advisory.  

The storm is moving northward at 8 kt, and the center is expected 
to begin pulling away from the coast of Baja California Sur in the 
next couple of hours.  This motion should continue through most of 
Saturday before the weakening cyclone turns more north-northwestward 
over the Gulf of California.  The track guidance has shifted 
eastwards slightly, largely due to the initial position, and new NHC 
track forecast lies between the consensus aids and the previous 
prediction.  

Vertical wind shear is expected to increase dramatically over Ileana 
in the next day or so.  The model guidance is in good agreement that 
weakening should continue, and the official intensity forecast now 
shows Ileana becoming a depression by Saturday, a remnant low by 
Sunday, and dissipated by early next week.  However, it is possible 
this could occur sooner.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical Storm Ileana will bring heavy rainfall to portions of
western Mexico and southern Baja California Sur through this 
weekend. This heavy rainfall will bring a risk of flash flooding and
mudslides to portions of the area.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions could continue in portions of Baja 
California Sur during the next several hours where Tropical Storm 
Warnings are in effect.
