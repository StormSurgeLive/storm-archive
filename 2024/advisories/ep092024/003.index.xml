southward
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* East coast of Baja California Sur Mexico north of San Evaristo to
Loreto
* Mainland Mexico from Topolobampo to Huatabampito
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the Mexican states of Baja California Sur,
Sinaloa, and Sonora should closely monitor the progress of Tropical
Storm Ileana.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM MST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ileana was
located near latitude 21.0 North, longitude 108.5 West. Ileana is
moving toward the north-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A slower 
north-northwestward to northward motion is expected during the next 
few days.  On the forecast track, Ileana is expected to move across 
the southern portion of the Baja California peninsula on Friday and 
over the Gulf of California this weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is possible 
before Ileana reaches the Baja California peninsula.  However, 
weakening is expected to begin by late Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ileana can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Ileana is expected to produce 4-6 inches
with localized higher amounts up to 8 inches across the coastal
areas of Michoacan, Colima, and Jalisco through early Friday. From
Friday through Sunday, Tropical Storm Ileana may result in 4-6
inches, with localized higher amounts up to 8 inches, across
southern Baja California. For northwest coastal Sinaloa, Tropical
Storm Ileana may produce between 6-8 inches with localized higher
amounts up to 12 inches. This heavy rainfall will bring a risk of
flash flooding and mudslides to portions of the area.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach
the coast of the southern Baja California Peninsula within the
warning area Friday morning, making outside preparations difficult
or dangerous. Tropical storm conditions are possible within the
watch area by early Saturday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Ileana will affect portions
of the coast of west-central Mexico and the coast of the southern
Baja California Peninsula during the next couple of days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1100 PM MST.
Next complete advisory at 200 AM MST.

<title>Tropical Storm Ileana Forecast Discussion Number 3</title>

Tropical Storm Ileana Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092024
800 PM MST Thu Sep 12 2024
 
Ileana continues to slowly gain strength.  Deep convection has been
increasing near the center and in some fragmented curved bands
around the central dense overcast.  The latest objective and
subjective satellite intensity estimates range from 35 to 45 kt,
and based on that data, the initial wind speed is nudged upward to
40 kt.  Some of the outer bands are moving across west-central
Mexico and nearing the southern tip of the Baja California
peninsula.
 
The storm is moving north-northwestward at 10 kt toward a weakness
in the subtropical ridge.  A north-northwestward to northward motion
but at a slower pace is expected during the next few days, taking
Ileana across the southern portion of the Baja California peninsula
on Friday and into the Gulf of California this weekend.  The NHC
track forecast is similar to the previous one and near the HCCA and
TVCE aids.
 
Some additional strengthening is possible before Ileana reaches
Baja California and most of the models show the storm peaking in
intensity in about 12 hours.  Around the time the cyclone makes
landfall in Baja, a pronounced increase in wind shear and
intrusions of dry air, along with land interaction, should cause
steady weakening.  The shear is expected to increase to near 30 kt
in a couple of days, and that should cause Ileana to degenerate to
a remnant low by 60 hours and dissipate in 3 to 4 days.  The NHC
intensity forecast is in good agreement with the majority of the
models.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Ileana will bring heavy rainfall to portions of western Mexico
and southern Baja California through the weekend. This heavy
rainfall will bring a risk of flash flooding and mudslides to
portions of the area.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in portions of
the Baja California Sur on Friday, where Tropical Storm Warnings
are in effect.
