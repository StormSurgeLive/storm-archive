<title>Post-Tropical Cyclone Ileana Forecast Discussion Number 12</title>

Tropical Depression Ileana Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092024
200 AM MST Sun Sep 15 2024
 
All of Ileana's deep convection dissipated yesterday afternoon, and 
all that is left now is a swirl of low clouds off the coast of 
northern Sinaloa.  An ASCAT-C pass from 0410 UTC showed maximum 
winds near 30 kt over the Gulf of California near northern Sinaloa, 
and a weather station in Topolobampo is no longer reporting winds to 
tropical storm force.  As a result, Ileana is now designated as a 
30-kt tropical depression, and all coastal warnings in Mexico have 
been discontinued.

Ileana has been meandering, but the longer-term motion is 
west-northwestward, or 300/2 kt.  Model guidance indicates that the 
cyclone should turn northwestward later today but maintain a 
generally slow motion while moving over the Gulf of California.  
Due to strong southwesterly shear and a very dry atmosphere, deep 
convection is not expected to redevelop, and it's likely that 
Gordon will be declared a remnant low later this morning.  The 
remnant low is expected to dissipate on Monday.
