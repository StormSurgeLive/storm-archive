CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* West coast of Baja California Sur Mexico from Santa Fe southward
* East coast of Baja California Sur Mexico from San Evaristo
southward
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* East coast of Baja California Sur Mexico north of San Evaristo to
Loreto

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within
12 to 24 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within 36 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the Mexican states of Baja California Sur,
Sinaloa, and Sonora should closely monitor the progress of Ileana.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ileana was
located near latitude 22.3 North, longitude 109.3 West. Ileana is
moving toward the north-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A slower
north-northwestward to northward motion is expected during the next
few days. On the forecast track, Ileana is expected to move across
the southern portion of the Baja California peninsula today and over
the southern and central Gulf of California this weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast before Ileana reaches the
Baja California peninsula. Weakening is expected over the weekend,
and Ileana is forecast to dissipate by Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ileana can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Through this weekend, Tropical Storm Ileana may produce
rainfall of 4 to 6 inches, with localized higher amounts up to 8
inches, across southern Baja California. For northwest coastal
Sinaloa, Tropical Storm Ileana may result between 6 to 8 inches with
localized higher amounts up to 12 inches.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Ileana, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast of the southern Baja California Peninsula within the warning
area during the next several hours. Tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area by early Saturday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ileana will affect portions of the coast
of west-central Mexico and the coast of the southern Baja California
Peninsula during the next couple of days. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1100 AM MST.
Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

Tropical Storm Ileana Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092024
800 AM MST Fri Sep 13 2024
 
Recent satellite imagery shows that Ileana is producing a large
convective canopy with clouds top temperatures as cold as -80C.
However, data from the Mexican radar at Cabo San Lucas shows that
the convective banding under the canopy is poorly organized and
suggests that the circulation center is still broad and elongated.
The various satellite intensity estimates are little changed since
the previous advisory, so the initial intensity remains 40 kt.
 
The initial motion is 335/8 kt. This general motion should continue 
for the next 12 h or so, bringing the center across the southern 
portion of the Baja California peninsula later today and into the 
southern Gulf of California by early Saturday.  After that, a slower 
northward to north-northwestward motion is forecast until the 
cyclone dissipates over the weekend.  There are no significant 
changes to either the track forecast guidance and the forecast 
track.

Ileana currently appears too disorganized to take advantage of the 
current environment of light to moderate shear, good moisture, and 
warm water. Thus, little change in strength is expected before 
landfall in Baja California Sur.  When the cyclone reaches the Gulf 
of California, it is forecast to move into increasing westerly shear 
and a drier airmass, which should cause weakening despite the very 
warm sea surface temperatures.  Based on this scenario and the 
intensity guidance, the intensity forecast continues to show 
weakening, with the cyclone forecast to become a remnant low by 48 h 
and dissipate by 72 hr.


Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical Storm Ileana will bring heavy rainfall to portions of 
western Mexico and southern Baja California through this weekend. 
This heavy rainfall will bring a risk of flash flooding and 
mudslides to portions of the area.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in portions of
Baja California Sur during the next several hours where Tropical 
Storm Warnings are in effect.
