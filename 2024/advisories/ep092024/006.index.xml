DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ileana was
located near latitude 22.7 North, longitude 109.4 West. Ileana is
moving toward the north-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h). A slow
north-northwestward to northward motion is expected during the next
few days. On the forecast track, Ileana is expected to move near or 
over the southern portion of the Baja California peninsula this
afternoon and evening, and over the southern and central Gulf of 
California this weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of days, and 
Ileana is expected to weaken to a tropical depression on Sunday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
to the east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ileana can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Through this weekend, Tropical Storm Ileana may produce 
rainfall of 4 to 6 inches, with localized higher amounts up to 8 
inches, across southern Baja California. For northwest coastal 
Sinaloa, Tropical Storm Ileana may result between 6 to 8 inches with 
localized higher amounts up to 12 inches. 

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Tropical Storm Ileana, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?rainqpf 
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Ileana, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast of the southern Baja California Peninsula within the warning
area during the next several hours. Tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area by early Saturday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ileana will affect portions of the coast
of west-central Mexico and the coast of the southern Baja California
Peninsula during the next couple of days. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 500 PM MST.
Next complete advisory at 800 PM MST.

<title>Tropical Storm Ileana Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Ileana Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092024
200 PM MST Fri Sep 13 2024

Satellite imagery and radar data from Cabo San Lucas indicate that 
Ileana remains poorly organized with poorly-defined convective 
banding around the elongated center.  The latest satellite and radar 
imagery suggests the center is just east of the latest burst of 
convection south of Cabo San Lucas, and this is in reasonable 
agreement with positions from recently received ASCAT data.  The 
scatterometer passes show 30-35 kt winds to the east of the center, 
and based on this and the possibility of undersampling, the initial 
intensity is held at a possibly generous 40 kt.

The scatterometer and and an earlier microwave image show that 
Ileana is moving slower than thought previously, and the initial 
motion is now 345/6. A slow north-northwestward to northward motion 
should continue until the cyclone dissipates, with the center 
passing near or over the southern end of the Baja California 
peninsula during the next 6-12 h and then moving over the central 
and southern Gulf of California.  The track guidance shifted a 
little to the east of the previous guidance, and the new forecast 
track is a little to the east of the previous track.
 
The cyclone should be moving into an environment of increasing 
southwesterly to westerly shear and a drier airmass as it moves 
into the Gulf of California.  The intensity guidance is in good 
agreement that Ileana should weaken, and the new intensity forecast 
follows this trend.  The forecast now calls for the system to become 
a depression by 36 h, a remnant low by 48 h, and dissipate by 72 h. 
It is possible that Ileana could decay to a remnant low by 36 h, as 
the GFS and ECMWF forecast the associated convection to dissipate by 
that time.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical Storm Ileana will bring heavy rainfall to portions of 
western Mexico and southern Baja California through this weekend. 
This heavy rainfall will bring a risk of flash flooding and 
mudslides to portions of the area. 
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in portions of
Baja California Sur during the next several hours where Tropical
Storm Warnings are in effect.
