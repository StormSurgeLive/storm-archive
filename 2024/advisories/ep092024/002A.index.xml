WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* West coast of Baja California Sur Mexico from Santa Fe southward
* East coast of Baja California Sur Mexico from San Evaristo
southward
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* East coast of Baja California Sur Mexico north of San Evaristo to
Loreto
* Mainland Mexico from Topolobampo to Huatabampito
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the Mexican states of Baja California Sur,
Sinaloa, and Sonora should closely monitor the progress of Tropical
Storm Ileana.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM MST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ileana was
located near latitude 20.5 North, longitude 108.2 West. Ileana is
moving toward the north-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this
motion is expected to continue through Friday. A turn to the north
at a slightly slower forward speed is expected Friday night. On the
forecast track, the center of Ileana should pass near or over the
southern portion of Baja California Sur Friday and Friday night
before emerging over the southern Gulf of California by early 
Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some strengthening is expected before the storm reaches Baja 
California Sur. After that, gradual weakening is forecast while the 
cyclone is near or over land.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ileana can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Ileana is expected to produce 4-6 inches
with localized higher amounts up to 8 inches across the coastal
areas of Michoacan, Colima, and Jalisco through early Friday. From
Friday through Sunday, Tropical Storm Ileana may result in 4-6
inches, with localized higher amounts up to 8 inches, across
southern Baja California. For northwest coastal Sinaloa, Tropical
Storm Ileana may produce between 6-8 inches with localized higher
amounts up to 12 inches. This heavy rainfall will bring a risk of
flash flooding and mudslides to portions of the area.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach
the coast of the southern Baja California Peninsula within the
warning area Friday morning, making outside preparations difficult
or dangerous. Tropical storm conditions are possible within the
watch area by early Saturday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Ileana will affect portions 
of the coast of west-central Mexico and the coast of the southern 
Baja California Peninsula during the next couple of days. These 
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM MST.

Tropical Storm Ileana Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092024
200 PM MST Thu Sep 12 2024

The overall cloud pattern as seen in GOES-18 visible and infrared 
imagery does not appear to have changed very much from earlier 
today.  While the RMW still seems to be a bit large, the cyclone 
displays a large area of cold cloud tops with some evidence of 
curved banding.  The latest subjective Dvorak intensity estimates 
are a consensus T-2.5/35 kt from both TAFB and SAB, while recent 
objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS range from 33 to 42 kt. 
Based on the subjective and objective intensity estimates, the 
depression is being upgraded to Tropical Storm Ileana with an 
initial intensity estimate of 35 kt. 
 
The initial motion estimate is north-northwest, or 340/8 kt, which 
is a bit faster than before.  The overall synoptic steering pattern 
is unchanged in the models from earlier.  A deep-layer trough 
located over the western United States will continue to steer the 
cyclone toward the north-northwest through Friday, bringing the 
system near the southern portion of Baja California Sur.  After that 
time, this trough is forecast to weaken, which should cause steering 
currents to weaken.  This evolution should induce a slower motion 
toward the north, likely over the waters of the southern Gulf of 
California.  There were no major changes to the guidance for the 
first 36 to 48 h of the forecast, and very little change was made to 
the previous official forecast.  Thereafter, the guidance is a bit 
farther west, with some of the models keeping the cyclone moving 
north-northwestward over the Gulf of California rather than moving 
inland over mainland Mexico.  The NHC forecast was only nudged 
slightly west of the previous forecast, not as far west as the 
consensus aids during the 48 to 96 h time period.
 
Ileana is currently located within an environment of warm ocean 
waters, moderate vertical wind shear, and within a fairly moist low- 
to mid-level troposphere.  However, very dry air is evident on water 
vapor imagery to the northwest of the cyclone.  These conditions are 
unlikely to change before the cyclone reaches Baja California Sur on 
Friday, and the NHC forecast shows some strengthening before then.  
Land interaction with the peninsula should cause some weakening.  
When the center reaches the Gulf of California, the sea surface 
temperatures are quite warm.  While some restrengthening is possible 
after the cyclone emerges back over water, Ileana will encounter 
increasing westerly wind shear and drier air by hour 48, so it won't 
have much time to restrengthen.  After that time, weakening is 
expected as Ileana's convection is sheared off, and the cyclone is 
forecast to become a remnant low in about 72 h.  It should be noted 
that the GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite imagery show the cyclone 
becoming a remnant low a bit earlier around hour 60.  Although the 
cyclone will likely dissipate prior to 96 h, a 96 h point is carried 
as a remnant low for continuity.
 
Key Messages:
1. Tropical Storm Ileana will bring heavy rainfall to portions
of western Mexico and southern Baja California through this weekend.
This heavy rainfall will bring a risk of flash flooding and
mudslides to portions of the area.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in portions of
the Baja California Sur on Friday, where Tropical Storm Warnings
are in effect.
