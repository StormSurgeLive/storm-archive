ABOUT 30 MI...50 KM SSW OF LOS MOCHIS MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 2 MPH...4 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Altata to Huatabampito Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case during the 
next few hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM MST (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ileana was
located near latitude 25.4 North, longitude 109.2 West.  Ileana is
meandering off the coast of northern Sinaloa but has a longer-term 
motion toward the west-northwest near 2 mph (4 km/h).  A turn 
toward the northwest is expected soon with an increase in forward 
speed.  On the forecast track, the center of Ileana will move near 
the coastal region of northern Sinaloa overnight, and then move over 
the Gulf of California roughly parallel to the coast on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have begun decreasing and are now near 40 
mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast, 
and Ileana is expected to degenerate into a remnant low on Sunday.  
The remnant low is expected to dissipate by Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ileana can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Ileana is expected to bring additional
rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with localized higher amounts up
to 10 inches, across northwest coastal Sinaloa through this weekend.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Ileana, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions, especially in gusts, are expected 
across portions of the warning area in northern Sinaloa and 
southern Sonora during the next few hours.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ileana will affect portions of the
Gulf of California coasts of Sinaloa, southern Sonora, and southern
Baja California Sur during the next day or so.  These swells could
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM MST.

<title>Tropical Storm Ileana Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Tropical Storm Ileana Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092024
800 PM MST Sat Sep 14 2024
 
Ileana has stalled near the coast of northwestern Mexico, offshore
of the state of Sinaloa.  All of the deep convection has moved
inland, as indicated by both the radar and satellite imagery,
leaving the low-level circulation exposed.  Surface observations
from Topolobampo and Los Mochis recently measured sustained winds of
39 kt, with higher gusts.  Based on these data, the initial
intensity for this cycle is raised to 40 kt.
 
The storm is drifting with an uncertain motion of 360/1 kt.  Ileana
is still expected to turn northwestward soon and gradually
accelerate, bringing the center across the northern coastal region
of Sinaloa during the next 12 h.  By Sunday, the cyclone is forecast
to be near the coast of southern Sonora and stay roughly parallel to
the coast of Mexico over the Gulf of California until the system
dissipates. The new track forecast is again nudged to the north and
east of the previous track and lies near the various consensus
models.
 
Despite strong southwesterly vertical wind shear decoupling
Ileana's surface circulation from its deep convection, the surface
winds have yet to weaken.  Global models indicated that deep
organized convection should not reform and therefore Ileana is
expected to become a post-tropical cyclone by Sunday.  The system
should gradually weaken due to the interaction with land and
surrounding dry air and strong vertical wind shear.  The official
forecast shows Ileana dissipating by late Monday, though some
numerical guidance suggests this could occur sooner.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical Storm Ileana will bring heavy rainfall to portions of
coastal Sinaloa, Mexico through this weekend. This heavy rainfall
will bring a risk of flash flooding and mudslides to portions of the
area.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning area
of northern Sinaloa and southern Sonora through Sunday.
