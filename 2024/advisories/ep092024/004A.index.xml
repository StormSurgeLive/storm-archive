products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM MST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ileana was
located near latitude 21.8 North, longitude 109.0 West. Ileana is
moving toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A slower
north-northwestward to northward motion is expected during the next
few days. On the forecast track, Ileana is expected to move across
the southern portion of the Baja California peninsula today and over
the Gulf of California this weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast before Ileana reaches
the Baja California peninsula. Weakening is expected over the
weekend, and Ileana is forecast to dissipate by early Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ileana can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Through this weekend, Tropical Storm Ileana may produce
rainfall of 4 to 6 inches, with localized higher amounts up to 8
inches, across southern Baja California Sur. For northwest coastal
Sinaloa, Tropical Storm Ileana may result between 6 to 8 inches with
localized higher amounts up to 12 inches.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Ileana, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall
Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast of the southern Baja California Peninsula within the warning
area this morning. Tropical storm conditions are possible within the
watch area by early Saturday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ileana will affect portions of the coast
of west-central Mexico and the coast of the southern Baja California
Peninsula during the next couple of days. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM MST.

Tropical Storm Ileana Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092024
200 AM MST Fri Sep 13 2024
 
Recent passive microwave images of Ileana reveal a small area of 
deep convection near the center of the storm, and as a result Ileana 
has maintained a cold central dense overcast overnight. However, the 
sharp edge to the cloud pattern suggests some south-southeasterly 
shear is impinging on the storm. Radar data from Los Cabos show 
outer rainbands are spreading across the southern portion of the 
Baja California peninsula. The initial intensity is held at 40 kt 
for this advisory, which is consistent with recent scatterometer 
data that showed several tropical-storm-force wind vectors in the 
southeastern quadrant of the storm. 

The estimated initial motion of Ileana is north-northwestward at 
330/9 kt. The storm is expected to remain on this general heading in 
the near term, bringing the center across the southern portion of 
the Baja California peninsula later today and into the southern Gulf 
of California by early Saturday. Then, a slower northward to 
north-northwestward motion is forecast over the weekend. Little 
change was made to the updated NHC track forecast, which remains 
between the TVCE and HCCA aids.

The structure of Ileana in microwave and radar imagery does not 
suggest much, if any, strengthening is likely before the storm 
reaches the coast of Baja California Sur. Deep-layer wind shear is 
forecast to substantially increase thereafter, and land interaction 
along with potential intrusions of dry air should induce weakening 
through the weekend. The increasingly hostile environmental 
conditions will likely make it difficult for Ileana to sustain 
organized deep convection while it moves northward over the Gulf of 
California. Thus, the updated NHC forecast shows degeneration to a 
remnant low at 48 h and dissipation by 72 h.

Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical Storm Ileana will bring heavy rainfall to portions of 
western Mexico and southern Baja California Sur through this 
weekend. This heavy rainfall will bring a risk of flash flooding 
and mudslides to portions of the area. 
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in portions of
Baja California Sur later this morning, where Tropical Storm 
Warnings are in effect.
