ABOUT 70 MI...110 KM S OF LOS MOCHIS MEXICO
ABOUT 85 MI...135 KM ENE OF LA PAZ MEXICO

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None. 
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Altata to Huatabampito Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within
12 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the Mexican states of Baja California Sur,
Sinaloa, and Sonora should closely monitor the progress of Ileana.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM MST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ileana was
located near latitude 24.7 North, longitude 109.2 West.  Ileana is
moving toward the north near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue today.  A slower motion toward the
north-northwest and northwest is expected tonight and on Sunday.  On
the forecast track, the center of Ileana will move near or over the
coasts of northern Sinaloa and southern Sonora later today, and then
move over the Gulf of California roughly parallel to the coast on
Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Weakening is forecast to begin later this afternoon or
evening, and Ileana is likely to degenerate into a remnant low
tonight.  The remnant low is expected to dissipate by early Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.  The Mexican Navy station at Topolobampo recently 
reported sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) and a wind gust of 48 
mph (77 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ileana can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Ileana is expected to bring rainfall of 6
to 8 inches, with localized higher amounts up to 12 inches, across
northwest coastal Sinaloa through this weekend.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Ileana, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall
Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected across portions of the
warning area in northern Sinaloa and southern Sonora later this
morning and afternoon.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ileana will affect portions of the
Gulf of California coasts of Sinaloa, southern Sonora, and southern
Baja California Sur during the next day or so.  These swells could
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM MST.

Tropical Storm Ileana Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092024
200 AM MST Sat Sep 14 2024
 
Ileana continues to produce bursts of deep convection, but a 
sharpening of the west side of the cloud canopy suggests stronger 
vertical shear is setting in.  Maximum winds are still estimated to 
be 35 kt based on ASCAT data from last evening, and the fact that 
subjective and objective intensity estimates have not begun to 
decrease much quite yet.

Ileana's center is moving northward over the southern Gulf of 
California, away from southern Baja California Sur, with an initial 
motion of 360/8 kt.  A northward motion is expected to continue 
today, bringing Ileana's center near or over the coast of northern 
Sinaloa and southern Sonora around midday.  The new NHC track 
forecast is a bit to the east of the previous prediction during the 
first 12 hours or so, mainly due to an adjustment of the initial 
position.  The track guidance indicates that Ileana should slow 
down and turn north-northwestward and then northwestward tonight 
and on Sunday, generally running up the length of the Gulf of 
California.

Although deep-layer shear is beginning to increase, several models, 
including the GFS and ECMWF, indicate that Ileana could maintain 
tropical storm intensity and bring tropical storm conditions to 
portions of the northern coast of Sinaloa and southern coast of 
Sonora later this morning and early afternoon.  These same models, 
however, show Ileana's convection quickly being sheared away and 
dissipating by this evening and tonight as the cyclone moves into a 
much drier air mass.  As a result, the NHC forecast shows Ileana 
degenerating into a remnant low in about 24 hours, with the remnant 
low dissipating over the central Gulf of California by early Monday.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical Storm Ileana will bring heavy rainfall to portions of 
western Mexico through this weekend. This heavy rainfall will bring 
a risk of flash flooding and mudslides to portions of the area. 
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning area 
of northern Sinaloa and southern Sonora later this morning and 
afternoon.
