SUMMARY OF 200 PM MST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...25.5N 108.9W
ABOUT 20 MI...35 KM SSE OF LOS MOCHIS MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 0 DEGREES AT 6 MPH...9 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Altata to Huatabampito Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within
12 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the Mexican states of Baja California Sur,
Sinaloa, and Sonora should closely monitor the progress of Ileana.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ileana was
located near latitude 25.5 North, longitude 108.9 West. Ileana is
moving toward the north near 6 mph (9 km/h). A turn toward the 
northwest and a slow forward speed are expected tonight and on 
Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Ileana will move near 
over the coastal region of northern Sinaloa during the next several 
hours, and then move over the Gulf of California roughly parallel to 
the coast on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast to begin later this afternoon or evening, and 
Ileana is likely to degenerate into a remnant low tonight or on 
Sunday.  The remnant low is expected to dissipate by Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center. The Mexican Navy station at Topolobampo recently
reported sustained winds of 34 mph (54 km/h) and a wind gust of
47 mph (76 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ileana can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Ileana is expected to bring additional 
rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with localized higher amounts up 
to 10 inches, across northwest coastal Sinaloa through this weekend.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Tropical Storm Ileana, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?rainqpf 
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected across portions of the
warning area in northern Sinaloa and southern Sonora through this
afternoon.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ileana will affect portions of the
Gulf of California coasts of Sinaloa, southern Sonora, and southern
Baja California Sur during the next day or so.  These swells could
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 500 PM MST.
Next complete advisory at 800 PM MST.

Tropical Storm Ileana Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092024
200 PM MST Sat Sep 14 2024

Data from the Mexican radar at Guasave indicates that the center of 
Ileana has moved onto the coast of Mexico in the state of Sinaloa. 
The system is still producing bursts of convection to the north 
and northeast of the center, and surface observations show the 
winds to the northwest of the center are in the 25-30 kt range. 
Based on this, the intensity is held at 35 kt, with these winds 
likely occuring along the coast near and east of the center.
 
The initial motion is now 360/5 kt. A turn toward the northwest and 
a slow forward speed are expected during the next 6-12 h, with a 
continued northwestward motion after that.  This motion should 
bring the center across the coastal region of the state of Sinaloa 
for the next 12 h or so, followed by a motion over the Gulf of 
California roughly parallel to the coast of Mexico, with this 
motion continuing until the system dissipates.  The new track 
forecast is again nudged to the north and east of the previous 
track and lies near the various consensus models.
 
Ileana is expected to weaken below tropical-storm strength in a 
few hours due to a combination of shear and land interaction.  
However, until that happens, the cyclone should continue to 
bring bring tropical storm conditions to portions of the northern 
coast of Sinaloa and southern coast of Sonora through this 
afternoon.  The system is expected to degenerate to a remnant low 
between 12-24 h, with the remnant low dissipating over the central 
Gulf of California on Monday.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical Storm Ileana will bring heavy rainfall to portions of 
coastal Sinaloa, Mexico through this weekend. This heavy rainfall 
will bring a risk of flash flooding and mudslides to portions of the 
area. 
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning area
of northern Sinaloa and southern Sonora through this afternoon.
