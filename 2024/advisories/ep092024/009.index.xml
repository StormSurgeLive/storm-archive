WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Altata to Huatabampito Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within
12 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the Mexican states of Baja California Sur,
Sinaloa, and Sonora should closely monitor the progress of Ileana.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ileana was
located near latitude 24.9 North, longitude 108.9 West. Ileana is
moving toward the north near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue today.  A slower motion toward the
north-northwest and northwest is expected tonight and on Sunday.  On
the forecast track, the center of Ileana will move near or over the
coasts of northern Sinaloa and southern Sonora later today, and then
move over the Gulf of California roughly parallel to the coast on
Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast to begin later this afternoon or evening, and
Ileana is likely to degenerate into a remnant low tonight.  The
remnant low is expected to dissipate by Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ileana can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Ileana is expected to bring additional
rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with localized higher amounts up
to 10 inches, across northwest coastal Sinaloa through this weekend.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Ileana, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected across portions of the
warning area in northern Sinaloa and southern Sonora through this 
afternoon.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ileana will affect portions of the
Gulf of California coasts of Sinaloa, southern Sonora, and southern
Baja California Sur during the next day or so.  These swells could
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1100 AM MST.
Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

Tropical Storm Ileana Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092024
800 AM MST Sat Sep 14 2024
 
Satellite imagery shows that Ileana is being affected by increasing
southwesterly shear.  A large burst of convection that occurred in
the early morning hours has moved northeast of the exposed
low-level center, while new convection is forming to the north and
southeast of the center. The initial intensity is held at 35 kt
based on various satellite intensity estimates and earlier surface
data from Topolobampo, Mexico.
 
The initial motion is just east of due north or 010/6 kt.  This
general motion should continue for the next 6 hours or so, bringing 
the center near or over the coast of Mexico near Topolobampo and Los
Mochis today.  After that, Ileana should begin a slow motion toward
the northwest over the Gulf of California roughly parallel to the
coast of Mexico, with this motion continuing until the system
dissipates.  The new track forecast is nudged to the north and east
of the previous track and lies near the various consensus models.
 
Ileana is expected to weaken below tropical-storm strength later
today due to a combination of shear and land interaction.  However,
before that happens, the cyclone should bring tropical storm
conditions to portions of the northern coast of Sinaloa and
southern coast of Sonora through this afternoon.  The system is
expected to degenerate to a remnant low between 12-24 h, with the
remnant low dissipating over the central Gulf of California on
Monday.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical Storm Ileana will bring heavy rainfall to portions of
coastal Sinaloa, Mexico through this weekend. This heavy rainfall
will bring a risk of flash flooding and mudslides to portions of the
area.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning area
of northern Sinaloa and southern Sonora through this afternoon.
