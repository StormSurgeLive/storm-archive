Remnants Of Fourteen-E Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142024
300 PM CST Thu Nov 07 2024
 
First-light visible geostationary satellite imagery revealed that
the depression has dissipated.  Based on the low-level cloud
motions, Tropical Depression Fourteen-E no longer has a well-defined
circulation and appears to be a trough open to the northeast.  The
remnants of the depression are forecast to continue moving
southeastward today and then linger in the region for the next few
days.
