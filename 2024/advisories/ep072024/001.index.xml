Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 AM PDT Sun Aug 18 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Well Offshore of Southwestern Mexico (EP99):<br/>
An area of low pressure located several hundred miles off the <br/>
southwestern coast of Mexico is producing showers and thunderstorms <br/>
that continue to show signs of organization. Recently-received <br/>
microwave satellite imagery also suggests the system is developing a <br/>
well-defined center, and if these trends continue, a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form as soon as later today. The system is <br/>
forecast to move west-northwestward at about 10 to 15 mph across the <br/>
central portion of the eastern Pacific during the next several <br/>
days. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Portion of the East Pacific:<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms are associated with a broad <br/>
trough of low pressure located well west-southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula.  This system is forecast to <br/>
interact with another disturbance to its west-southwest over the <br/>
next several days, which could limit additional development if this <br/>
system does not become the dominant disturbance. Regardless, a <br/>
tropical depression could still form during the middle part of the <br/>
week while the system moves westward to west-northwestward over the <br/>
western portion of the East Pacific basin before it possibly merges <br/>
with the disturbance currently located further west. Information on <br/>
this system's development can also be found in the Tropical Weather <br/>
Outlook for the Central Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Well Southeast of the Hawaiian Islands:<br/>
Another area of low pressure located well southeast of the Hawaiian <br/>
Islands is currently associated with some disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms on its western side. This disturbance is forecast to <br/>
interact with the disturbance located to its east. If this system <br/>
becomes the dominant disturbance, some gradual development is <br/>
possible and a tropical depression could form by the middle part of <br/>
this week while it initially moves slowly over the western portion <br/>
of the East Pacific.  A faster west-northwestward motion into the <br/>
Central Pacific basin is likely by the latter portion of the week. <br/>
Information on this system's development can also be found in the <br/>
Tropical Weather Outlook for the Central Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Portion of the East Pacific:<br/>
Yet another area of low pressure could form well to the south of the <br/>
southwestern coast of Mexico over the next few days. Environmental <br/>
conditions appear generally conducive for some slow development of <br/>
this system thereafter as it moves slowly west-northwestward <br/>
throughout the week into the Central portion of the East Pacific <br/>
basin. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
The Tropical Weather Outlook for the Central Pacific basin can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header HFOTWOCP and WMO header ACPN50 PHFO and on <br/>

Tropical Depression Seven-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
800 AM MST Sun Aug 18 2024
 
The low pressure system well south of the southern tip of the Baja 
California peninsula has now developed a well-defined center and 
sufficiently organized deep convection. These criteria indicate a 
new tropical depression has formed, the seventh one of the 2024 East 
Pacific hurricane season.  The initial intensity is set at 30 kt, 
based on a Dvorak 2.0 classification from TAFB.
 
Moderate easterly vertical wind shear of 15-20 kt is confining most
of the thunderstorm activity to the western half of the circulation,
and since the shear is expected to persist through tonight, only a
little strengthening seems likely in the short-term.  The shear
should lessen beginning early Monday, and the more favorable
upper-level wind environment combined with warm waters and a
relatively moist atmosphere should allow for gradual strengthening
throughout much of the week.  The NHC intensity forecast is closest
to the HCCA guidance.
 
The initial motion is uncertain since the system has just formed,
but the best estimate is 290/11 kt.  A high pressure ridge situated
to the system’s north should cause the cyclone to move westward to
west-northwestward at about the same speed during the next few days.
Later in the week, the models show the ridge weakening as a trough
amplifies off the west coast of the U.S., which could cause the
system to slow down.  The models are in fair agreement with the
exception of the GFS, which shows a much slower motion likely due to
the interaction with a disturbance to its west.  At this point, that
model seems unrealistic so it is being discounted for now.  The NHC
track forecast is in best agreement with the ECMWF and HCCA aids.
