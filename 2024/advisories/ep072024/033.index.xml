Hurricane Gilma Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
1100 PM HST Sun Aug 25 2024
 
This evening's satellite presentation consists of a ragged
partially obscured eye with a small inner core open in the south
semi-circle.  Gilma's cloud pattern continues to deteriorate slowly
and has shed most of the associated convective bands with the
exception of fragmented curved band wrapping in from the south.
The initial intensity is lowered to 85 kt and is based on the
Dvorak satellite intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB and a blend
of the UW-CIMSS ADT, AiDT, and DMINT objective estimates, yielding
83 kt.
 
Water vapor imagery and global model RH/700mb fields indicate that
the cyclone is moving toward a dry, stable air mass, indicative of
a large low-level stratocumulus cloud deck intruding from the
northwest in the GOES-18 Proxy-VIS images.  Subsequently, the
statistical GFS/ECMWF SHIPS indicated a mid-level/700-500mb RH of
42 percent.  This inhibiting thermodynamic contribution, along with
increasing west-to-west-southwesterly shear noted in the
statistical SHIPS intensity guidance, particularly beyond 36 hrs,
should cause Gilma to weaken at a quicker rate through day 5.
The NHC intensity forecast is a compromise of the Decay-SHIPS and
the IVCN intensity consensus and shows Gilma degenerating to a
post-tropical cyclone in 4 days.
 
Gilma's initial motion is estimated to be westward, or 280/8 kt,
and is moving in the southern periphery of a mid-tropospheric
subtropical ridge extending westward across the tropical-eastern
Pacific from northwestern Mexico.  The global and regional models
are fairly clustered together and indicate a slightly to the right
of the initial track motion, or west-northwestward beyond the 60 hr 
period, and the official forecast follows suit.  Along-track 
differences continue to be a model inconsistency, but following the 
skilled TVCE and HCCA consensus models have been the best track 
forecast solution so far.
 
Gilma's 50 kt wind radii have been slightly adjusted based on a 
0559 UTC METOP-C ASCAT overpass.

Tropical Storm Hector Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082024
1100 PM HST Sun Aug 25 2024
 
Hector has generally changed little during the past several hours. 
The storm remains sheared with the low-level center located near the 
northern edge of the main area of deep convection as seen in 
microwave images.  The latest objective and subjective Dvorak 
estimates range from 35 to 45 kt, and a recent ASCAT-C pass showed a 
swath of 35-40 kt winds to the east of the center.  Based on all of 
this information, the initial intensity is again held at 40 kt.
 
The storm is moving westward (280 degrees) at 8 kt, and a continued
relatively slow westward to west-northwestward motion should persist
for another day or two.  Thereafter, a slightly faster westward
motion is forecast as a low- to mid-level ridge builds to the north
of the system.  There is some along-track spread in the guidance,
but most of the models show a similar theme.  Little change was made
to the previous NHC track, and this one lies fairly close to the
various consensus models.
 
Hector is currently experiencing some northerly wind shear.  The 
shear should decrease a little during the next couple of days, which 
could allow Hector to gain some strength.  However, the 
strengthening will likely be tempered due to Hector passing over 
Gilma's cool wake.  As Hector nears the central Pacific basin in a 
few days, the models show the storm moving into a region of stronger 
shear and drier air, which should end the opportunity for 
strengthening and induce weakening.  The NHC forecast shows Hector 
becoming a remnant low by day 5, but most of the global models 
depict this transition occurring sooner than that.  The intensity 
forecast is nudged downward from the previous one, but still lies at 
the high end of the latest model guidance.
