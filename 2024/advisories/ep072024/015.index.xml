Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 PM PDT Wed Aug 21 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Gilma, located about a thousand miles west-southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Well East-Southeast of the Hawaiian Islands (EP91):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms have changed little in organization <br/>
today in association with an area of low pressure located well <br/>
east-southeast of the Hawaiian Islands.  However, only a slight <br/>
improvement in organization could result in the formation of a <br/>
tropical depression or tropical storm later tonight or early <br/>
Thursday while it moves generally westward at 10 to 15 mph.  This <br/>
system is expected to strengthen as it moves into the central <br/>
Pacific basin on Thursday and moves near the Hawaiian Islands late <br/>
this weekend or early next week.<br/>
<br/>
Interests in Hawaii should closely monitor this disturbance, though <br/>
it remains too early to determine the exact location and magnitude <br/>
of potential impacts.  Information on this system's development can <br/>
also be found in the Tropical Weather Outlook for the Central <br/>
Pacific basin.  For marine forecasts, including gale warnings, see <br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Portion of the East Pacific: <br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue in association with <br/>
a trough of low pressure centered several hundred miles southwest of <br/>
the coast of southwestern Mexico.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to be generally conducive for development over the next <br/>
several days, and a tropical depression is likely to form in the <br/>
next two to three days while the system moves west-northwestward <br/>
into the central portion of the East Pacific, well offshore of <br/>
Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>

Hurricane Gilma Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
800 PM PDT Wed Aug 21 2024
 
Infrared and visible satellite imagery of Gilma this evening 
continues to depict a strong inner core with a well-defined eye. 
Deep convection with cold cloud tops near -80C have been persistent 
in the southern eye wall.  Over the last hour or so the northern 
portion of the inner core has become a little more broken in 
infrared imagery, which suggests the rapid intensification has 
stopped. Subjective Dvorak satellite intensity estimates for this 
cycle remained unchanged from TAFB and SAB, both T5.0/90-kt. The 
objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS range from 90 to 100 
kt. Using a blend of theses estimates, Gilma's initial intensity is 
set to 95 kt for this advisory.
 
Gilma is moving slowly west-northwestward with an estimated motion 
of 290/6 kt. A large subtropical ridge will continue to steer Gilma 
generally westward to west-northwestward during the next few days, 
with a gradual acceleration by the weekend. The latest NHC track is 
slightly to the right of the previous forecast, and lies between 
the previous forecast and the latest consensus aids.

Gilma is expected to continue to strengthen over the next day or so 
as the system moves over warm sea surface temperature with low 
vertical wind shear. The main change this cycle is that the peak and 
entire forecast period intensity guidance is much lower compared to 
6 hours ago. The NHC peak intensity forecast is slightly lower than 
previous but still shows steady strengthening over the next 24h. 
However, the system should then begin to traverse cooler waters and 
a drier more stable airmass, with a faster weakening trend compared 
to the previous advisory. Note that the NHC intensity forecast is 
above most of the intensity guidance, primarily due to continuity 
constraints, and additional changes in the intensity forecast may be 
needed in subsequent forecasts if intensity aid trends continue.
