Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 PM PDT Sun Aug 18 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gilma, located several hundred miles south-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Well East-southeast of the Hawaiian Islands (EP90):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms are showing some signs of organization in <br/>
association with a low pressure system located well east-southeast <br/>
of the Hawaiian Islands.  This disturbance is forecast to interact <br/>
with a disturbance located to its east-northeast.  If this system <br/>
becomes the dominant disturbance, some gradual development is <br/>
possible, and a tropical depression could form in the next couple of <br/>
days while it initially moves slowly over the western portion of the <br/>
East Pacific. A faster west-northwestward motion into the Central <br/>
Pacific basin is likely by the latter portion of the week. <br/>
Information on this system's development can also be found in the <br/>
Tropical Weather Outlook for the Central Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Portion of the East Pacific:<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue in association with <br/>
a broad trough of low pressure located well west-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.  This system is <br/>
forecast to interact with another disturbance to its west-southwest <br/>
over the next few days which could limit additional development. <br/>
Regardless, a tropical depression could form during the middle part <br/>
of the week while the system moves slowly west-northwestward before <br/>
it possibly merges with the disturbance currently located farther <br/>
west.  Information on this system's development can also be found in <br/>
the Tropical Weather Outlook for the Central Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Portion of the East Pacific:<br/>
An area of low pressure could form well to the south of the <br/>
southwestern coast of Mexico around the middle of the week. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear generally conducive for some slow <br/>
development of this system thereafter as it moves slowly <br/>
west-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
The Tropical Weather Outlook for the Central Pacific basin can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header HFOTWOCP and WMO header ACPN50 PHFO and on <br/>

<title>Tropical Storm Gilma Forecast Discussion Number 3</title>

Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
800 PM MST Sun Aug 18 2024
 
Gilma continues to battle easterly shear this evening.  
Deep convection has been regularly pulsing near the center and 
then pulled off toward the western side of the circulation.  
Subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB were T3.0/45 kt and 
T2.0/30 kt, respectively.  Objective intensity estimates range from 
30 to 38 kt.  The initial intensity is held at 35 kt, representing a 
blend of the various estimates.

Strong-to-moderate deep vertical wind shear is forecast to persist 
for the next day or two.  Global models vary when the shear will 
relax, but sometime on Tuesday or Wednesday Gilma should be in a 
more conducive environment and gradually strengthen.  By the end of 
the forecast period, the storm is expected to move into a drier 
airmass with increasing upper-level winds, which should induce 
gradual weakening.  The latest intensity forecast is very similar to 
the previous prediction, slightly higher than the various consensus 
aids.

Gilma is moving westward along the south side of a mid-level ridge 
at 280/11 kt.  A westward to west-northwestward motion should 
continue for the next couple of days.  By Wednesday, Gilma is 
expected to slow down and turn more northwestward when a trough 
off of the west coast of the United States erodes the ridge.  There 
is quite a bit of model spread during this period, with the GFS 
showing a slower forward speed and a more poleward turn compared to 
some of the regional models which stay farther to the south and 
move faster.  The official track forecast lies near the simple 
consensus aids and is slightly south of the previous track through 
60 h and a little to the north afterwards.
