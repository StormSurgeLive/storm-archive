Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 PM PDT Mon Aug 19 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gilma, located several hundred miles southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Well East-southeast of the Hawaiian Islands (EP90):<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity has changed little in organization <br/>
in association with an area of low pressure located well <br/>
east-southeast of Hawaii. Environmental conditions appear conducive <br/>
for further development, and a tropical depression is likely to form <br/>
during the next day or two. The disturbance is forecast to meander <br/>
slowly northward or northeastward during the next day to two, while <br/>
interacting with or possibly combining with another disturbance <br/>
located a few hundred miles to its east-northeast. The combined <br/>
system is then forecast to accelerate west-northwestward into the <br/>
Central Pacific basin by Wednesday night. Information on this <br/>
system's development can also be found in the Tropical Weather <br/>
Outlook for the Central Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Portion of the East Pacific:<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity has become a little better <br/>
organized in association with a broad area of low pressure located <br/>
well west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California <br/>
peninsula. This system is forecast to move toward the west-northwest <br/>
during the next day or two as it interacts with or possibly combines <br/>
with EP90 to its west, and a tropical depression could form within <br/>
the next few days. Further development after that time appears <br/>
unlikely.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Portion of the East Pacific:<br/>
An area of low pressure is expected to form well to the south of the <br/>
southwestern coast of Mexico by the end of this week. Environmental <br/>
conditions should support slow development thereafter, and a <br/>
tropical depression could form over the weekend while the system <br/>
moves west-northwestward over open waters, well offshore of Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>

<title>Tropical Storm Gilma Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
800 PM PDT Mon Aug 19 2024
 
Gilma is looking a little more ragged on satellite imagery this 
evening.  Deep convection is confined to the southwest quadrant of 
the circulation and the cloud top temperatures have been gradually 
warming.  Still, subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB have 
held steady this cycle, partially due to constraints.  The initial 
intensity remains at a possibly generous 50 kt.

The storm is moving westward at an estimated 9 kt.  The track 
reasoning has not changed.  A mid-level ridge centered over the 
southwestern United States is expected to turn Gilma  
west-northwestward soon and steer the storm in this general 
direction for the entirety of the forecast period.  The forward 
motion of the storm should slow in the next day or so as a 
deep-layer trough off of the U.S. west coast weakens the ridge.  
There is still quite a bit of spread in the model track guidance, 
though the envelope has shifted southward this cycle.  The official 
forecast has been nudged slightly south of the previously predicted 
track and remains near the various consensus aids.

The strong-to-moderate vertical wind shear is expected to abate 
within a day or so according to the global models.  Once this 
occurs, oceanic and environmental conditions should allow for steady 
strengthening, and Gilma is forecast to reach hurricane strength 
late this week or early this weekend.  There is a wide range in the 
intensity model guidance, making this forecast somewhat uncertain.  
The latest official intensity forecast is very similar to the 
previous prediction and lies in the middle of the guidance envelope.
