Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 AM PDT Thu Aug 22 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Gilma, located more than one thousand miles west-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Well East-Southeast of the Hawaiian Islands (EP91/CP90):<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity continues to show signs of <br/>
organization with an area of low pressure located well <br/>
east-southeast of the Hawaiian Islands. Only a slight improvement in <br/>
organization could result in the formation of a tropical depression <br/>
or tropical storm later today while it moves generally westward at <br/>
10 to 15 mph. This system is currently crossing into the Central <br/>
Pacific basin, where it is then forecast to strengthen during the <br/>
next couple of days and move near the Hawaiian Islands late this <br/>
weekend or early next week. For marine forecasts, including gale <br/>
warnings, see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather <br/>
Service.<br/>
<br/>
Interests in Hawaii should closely monitor this disturbance, though <br/>
it remains too soon to determine the exact location and magnitude of <br/>
potential impacts. Now that the system is moving into the Central <br/>
Pacific basin, all future information on this system will be found <br/>
in the Tropical Weather Outlook for the Central Pacific Basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Portion of the East Pacific (EP92): <br/>
A broad area of low pressure has formed several hundred miles to the <br/>
south of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula and is <br/>
currently producing an area of disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms primarily west of its center. Environmental conditions <br/>
are forecast to be generally conducive for development over the next <br/>
several days, and a tropical depression is likely to form during the <br/>
next few days while the system moves west-northwestward at about 10 <br/>
mph over the central portion of the East Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>

<title>Hurricane Gilma Forecast Discussion Number 17</title>

Hurricane Gilma Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
500 AM HST Thu Aug 22 2024
 
Gilma has continued to intensify with recent tightening of the 
eyewall diameter in the last few hours. Concurrently, solid cooling 
was noted in the surrounding inner ring of convection.  This 
has resulted in an increase in intensity for the Dvorak intensity 
estimates with TAFB up to a T6.0/6.0 or 115 knots while 
objective estimates from UW-CIMSS has seen a variation of Raw-T 
values between 5.5 and 5.8.  As such, the intensity has been 
adjusted slightly upward to 110 knots and brings intensity up to 
a strong Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. 

A northwest trend in center fixes continues to show slow forward 
speed at 290/6 knots, though small wobbles have been noted as the 
eye has been tightening and stronger convergence nodes are noted 
along the inner eye wall supporting a weak asymmetry to the eye 
itself.  Given weak mid-tropospheric forcing, storm motion will 
continue to be slow and is expected to turn more westward Friday 
into Saturday as it nears the 26-27C isotherm.  Proximity to the 
thermal gradient and convective activity will play a role in the 
longer term forecast as well.  Depending on the strength, a faster 
forward speed was noted through the guidance suite. As such, the 
official forecast is a bit faster along track though the track 
remains fairly stable.

Given that warmer oceans remain along the track of Gilma, some 
additional strengthening is expected with the low shear 
environment. As the cyclone reaches the 26-27C isotherm, gradual 
weakening is expected, but a slight northward adjustment will 
result in reduced warm, moist air to maintain its strength and 
slow weakening is expected after Friday morning.  As the storm 
treads further west, cooler water is likely to increase weakening of 
the system through the weekend into early next week.  As the system 
weakens and becomes shallower, forward speed will increase and 
perhaps further compound the weakening process a bit faster than 
prior forecast; however, the NHC intensity forecast 
remains on the higher end of the model guidance suite to better 
maintain continuity.
