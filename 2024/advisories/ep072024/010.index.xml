Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 AM PDT Tue Aug 20 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gilma, located several hundred miles southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Well East-southeast of the Hawaiian Islands (EP90/EP91):<br/>
A large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms is associated <br/>
with two disturbances over the western portion of the East Pacific <br/>
basin.  These systems are expected to merge tonight, and gradual <br/>
development is anticipated after they merge.  A tropical depression <br/>
will likely form during the next day or so while it moves generally <br/>
westward at 10 to 15 mph. The system is then expected to strengthen <br/>
as it moves across the central Pacific basin late this week and move <br/>
near the Hawaiian Islands late this weekend or early next week. <br/>
<br/>
While it is too early to determine the exact location and magnitude <br/>
of potential impacts, interests in Hawaii should closely monitor <br/>
this disturbance. Information on this system's development can also <br/>
be found in the Tropical Weather Outlook for the Central Pacific <br/>
basin.  For marine forecasts, including gale warnings, see High Seas <br/>
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Portion of the East Pacific:<br/>
An area of low pressure is expected to form well to the south of the <br/>
southwestern coast of Mexico in a couple of days. Environmental <br/>
conditions should support slow development thereafter, and a <br/>
tropical depression could form late this week or over the weekend <br/>
while the system moves west-northwestward over open waters, well <br/>
offshore of Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

<title>Tropical Storm Gilma Forecast Discussion Number 10</title>

Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
200 PM PDT Tue Aug 20 2024
 
Gilma has become much better organized throughout the day.  The
center is now embedded in the thunderstorm activity, and the
associated deep convection has been expanding and has a less sheared
appearance.  The Dvorak estimates have increased and are between 45
and 55 kt at 18Z.  Over the past hour or two, a pair of ASCAT passes
showed reliable winds in the 50-55 kt range.  Based on the ASCAT
data and the improving satellite appearance, the initial intensity
is increased to 60 kt.
 
Gilma is moving westward or 280 degrees at 10 kt.  A high pressure
ridge situated to the north of the storm should cause it to continue
westward to west-northwestward at about the same speed for another
day or so.  However, after that time, a decrease in forward speed
and a slight turn to the right are expected as the ridge weakens and
is replaced by a broad trough.  The NHC track forecast has again
been nudged to the south, toward the latest consensus aids.
 
The improving cloud pattern suggests that the vertical wind shear
around Gilma is lessening.  In addition, the storm is forecast to
remain over warm waters and in a relatively moist airmass for a few
days.  Therefore, continued steady strengthening is predicted, and
Gilma is expected to become a hurricane tonight or early Wednesday
with additional strengthening anticipated through Thursday.  By the
end of the week, however, the cyclone is expected to track over
cooler waters and into a more stable airmass, which should induce a
weakening trend.  The NHC intensity forecast is nudged upward from
the previous one and near the high end of the model guidance.
 
The initial 34- and 50-kt wind radii have been updated using the
aforementioned ASCAT data.
