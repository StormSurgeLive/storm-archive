Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 AM PDT Mon Aug 19 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gilma, located several hundred miles south-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Well East-southeast of the Hawaiian Islands (EP90):<br/>
An area of low pressure located well east-southeast of Hawaii <br/>
continues to show signs of becoming better organized. Environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to be conducive for additional development <br/>
and a tropical depression is likely to form during the next couple <br/>
of days. The disturbance is forecast to meander slowly northward <br/>
during the next few days, before accelerating west-northwestward <br/>
into the Central Pacific basin by the latter portion of the week.<br/>
Information on this system's development can also be found in the <br/>
Tropical Weather Outlook for the Central Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Portion of the East Pacific:<br/>
A broad area of shower and thunderstorm activity is located well <br/>
west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
This system is forecast to move slowly toward the northwest for the <br/>
next few days, and interactions with either EP90 to its west or <br/>
Gilma to its east could limit the potential for formation. <br/>
Regardless, a tropical depression could form within the next few <br/>
days. Further development after that time will be unlikely. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Portion of the East Pacific:<br/>
An area of low pressure could form well to the south of the <br/>
southwestern coast of Mexico around the middle of the week. <br/>
Environmental conditions could become conducive for some slow <br/>
development of this system thereafter as it moves slowly <br/>
west-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>

<title>Tropical Storm Gilma Forecast Discussion Number 5</title>

Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 19 2024

Recent AMSR and SSMIS imagery indicate that Gilma's center is 
located near the northeast edge of its deep convection, with little 
deep convection present in its northeast quadrant. This is due, at 
least in part, to upper-level easterly winds that are causing some 
shear across the cyclone. A consensus of objective and subjective 
intensity estimates from SAB, TAFB, and UW-CIMSS support an initial 
intensity of 45 kt for this advisory, which also agree well with 
earlier ASCAT data.

The aforementioned wind shear is expected to persist for at least 
another day or two, which should limit the potential for 
strengthening. After around 36 h, global models indicate the shear 
will begin to decrease, which should allow for more strengthening. 
The exact timing of this strengthening is still highly uncertain, 
with several global models suggesting it could begin near the 36 h 
mark, while the HWRF indicates it won't begin to strengthen until 
closer to 60 h. Regardless, there is a good chance that Gilma will 
become a hurricane at some point before the end of the week. No 
significant changes were made to the intensity forecast, which 
follows the HCCA and IVCN intensity models. 

The track forecast is also largely unchanged from the previous NHC 
advisory. Gilma is currently moving west near 12 kt. A ridge 
extending westward from the southwest United States should keep 
Gilma on a similar heading today. After that, the tropical storm 
may interact with another disturbance to its west, while a trough 
off the U.S. west coast will begin to erode the ridge slightly. All 
models indicate that Gilma will generally slow down and turn 
west-northwestward in response to these steering changes, but there 
is unusually high spread in the guidance on the exact track the 
cyclone will take. The NHC track forecast follows the consensus 
aids, but confidence in the specifics of the forecast is lower than 
normal due to the high model spread.
