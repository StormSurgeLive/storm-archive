Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 AM PDT Wed Aug 21 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Gilma, located about a thousand miles west-southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Well East-Southeast of the Hawaiian Islands (EP91):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms have changed little in organization since <br/>
last night in association with a well-defined area of low pressure <br/>
located well east-southeast of the Hawaiian Islands.  However, only <br/>
a slight improvement in organization could result in the formation <br/>
of a tropical depression or tropical storm later today while it <br/>
moves generally westward at 10 to 15 mph.  This system is expected <br/>
to strengthen as it moves into the central Pacific basin tonight or <br/>
on Thursday and moves near the Hawaiian Islands late this weekend <br/>
or early next week.<br/>
<br/>
Interests in Hawaii should closely monitor this disturbance, though <br/>
it remains too early to determine the exact location and magnitude <br/>
of potential impacts.  Information on this system's development can <br/>
also be found in the Tropical Weather Outlook for the Central <br/>
Pacific basin.  For marine forecasts, including gale warnings, see <br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Portion of the East Pacific: <br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue in association with <br/>
a trough of low pressure centered several hundred miles southwest of <br/>
the coast of southwestern Mexico.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to be generally conducive for development over the next <br/>
several days, and a tropical depression is likely to form in the <br/>
next two to three days while the system moves west-northwestward <br/>
into the central portion of the East Pacific, well offshore of <br/>
Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>

<title>Hurricane Gilma Forecast Discussion Number 14</title>

Hurricane Gilma Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
200 PM PDT Wed Aug 21 2024
 
Gilma's satellite presentation has improved significantly over the 
past three hours as a clear eye has appeared in visible imagery, and 
the latest subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB 
were both T5.0/90-kt. Using these estimates Gilma's initial 
intensity is set to 90 kt for this advisory, which represents an 
increase of 30-kt over the past 24 hours, meeting the criteria of 
rapid intensification.

Gilma is moving more west-northwestward this afternoon, estimated at 
285/6 kt. Over the next few days, a large subtropical ridge poleward 
of the hurricane should continue to steer it generally westward to 
west-northwestward. The latest track guidance has shifted slightly 
poleward, reversing the trend of the previous few cycles, possibly 
due to the more northern short-term motion as the hurricane's 
inner-core has become established. The latest NHC track was shifted 
slightly in that direction of the consensus track aids, blending 
them with the prior track forecast. 

Given the improvements to the inner core, Gilma is expected to 
steadily strengthen over the next day. The NHC intensity forecast 
now shows strengthening to a Category 4 hurricane in 24 h, which is 
in agreement with the latest HCCA consensus aid and still slightly 
below some of the hurricane-regional models (e.g. HAFS-A and 
HAFS-B). After 48 h, sea-surface temperatures begin to gradually 
decrease, and slow weakening is still expected to begin at that 
time, though a little less than the previous advisory.
