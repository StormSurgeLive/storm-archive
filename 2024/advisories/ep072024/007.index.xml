Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 PM PDT Mon Aug 19 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gilma, located several hundred miles southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Well East-southeast of the Hawaiian Islands (EP90):<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity continues in association with an <br/>
area of low pressure located well east-southeast of Hawaii. <br/>
Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive for <br/>
development and a tropical depression is likely to form during the <br/>
next couple of days. The disturbance is forecast to meander slowly <br/>
northward or northeastward during the next couple of days or so, <br/>
before accelerating west-northwestward into the Central Pacific <br/>
basin by the latter portion of the week. Information on this <br/>
system's development can also be found in the Tropical Weather <br/>
Outlook for the Central Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Portion of the East Pacific:<br/>
A broad area of shower and thunderstorm activity is located well <br/>
west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
This system is forecast to move slowly toward the northwest for the <br/>
next few days, and interactions with either EP90 to its west or <br/>
Gilma to its east could limit the potential for formation. <br/>
Regardless, a tropical depression could form within the next few <br/>
days. Further development after that time will be unlikely. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Portion of the East Pacific:<br/>
An area of low pressure is expected to form well to the south of the <br/>
southwestern coast of Mexico by the end of this week. Environmental <br/>
conditions could become conducive for some slow development of this <br/>
system thereafter as it moves slowly west-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>

The Tropical Weather Outlook for the Central Pacific basin can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header HFOTWOCP and WMO header ACPN50 PHFO and on <br/>

<title>Tropical Storm Gilma Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
200 PM PDT Mon Aug 19 2024

ASCAT data valid at 1644 UTC showed that Gilma has strengthened 
slightly and its wind field has grown a little. While the tropical 
storm is still sheared, maximum winds measured by the ASCAT were 
between 40 and 45 kt, which after accounting for undersampling 
supports an intensity around 50 kt. An average of the most recent 
Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB also yields 50 kt, so that is the 
intensity estimate for this advisory. The maximum extent of 34 kt 
winds is estimated to be around 70 n mi based on the ASCAT data, 
mostly to the southwest in the deep convection.

Although the track forecast spread in the model guidance remains 
unusually high, not much change was made to the NHC forecast, except 
to show a slightly faster forward motion in 24-48 h. Otherwise, 
Gilma is still expected to slow down and turn west-northwestward 
within the next day as the ridge currently steering the storm is 
gradually eroded by a deep-layer trough off the U.S. west coast. 
There is still quite a bit of difference between the models in the 
forward speed of Gilma, so the NHC forecast closely follows the 
consensus throughout the forecast. 

Only small adjustments were made to the intensity forecast. Gilma 
should remain sheared for another day or so, limiting the potential 
for strengthening during that period.  After that, the shear should 
decrease and Gilma should strengthen.  Most models continue to 
indicate that Gilma will approach hurricane strength later this 
week. The NHC intensity forecast remains very close to the various 
intensity consensus aids.
