Hurricane Gilma Discussion Number  35
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
1100 AM HST Mon Aug 26 2024
 
Gilma's eye continues to become more symmetric with a warming eye 
and impressive convection surrounding the eye.  Objective intensity 
estimates from UW-CIMSS have been generally increasing over the last 
several hours, ranging from 85 to 96 kt.  Subjective Dvorak 
estimates are T-5.0/90 kt from TAFB and T-5.5/102 kt from SAB.   The 
initial intensity is set to 95 kt based on a blend of the subjective 
estimates.

Other than the stronger initial intensity, there is no change to the 
environmental conditions that Gilma is expected to traverse through 
the forecast period.  Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and vertical 
wind shear conditions have been favorable enough for Gilma to 
strengthen over the past 12 h.  By tonight, westerly vertical wind 
shear is predicted to increase to 15 to 20 kt, which should put a 
halt to any additional strengthening, and likely induce a slow 
weakening trend.  Beyond 24 h, Gilma is forecast to reach slightly 
cooler SSTs, which should cause a faster rate of weakening in the 
24-48 h time period.  These factors, combined with the relatively 
dry and stable airmass that Gilma will continue to be embedded in, 
is likely to cause the cyclone to lose its convection and become a 
remnant low in 3 to 4 days, as suggested by the GFS and ECMWF 
simulated satellite imagery.  The global models then show the 
remnant low gradually weakening through day 5, possibly opening up 
into a trough around that time.  The new NHC intensity forecast is 
higher than the previous forecast for the first 24 h due to the 
stronger initial intensity and relatively unchanged after that, and 
lies close to the middle of the guidance envelope.

The initial motion is estimated to be westward, or 280/7 kt.  The 
track guidance is faster this cycle, following the global model 
solutions.  The new NHC forecast is similar to the previous forecast 
through 36 h, then shows a faster motion toward the west-northwest, 
though not as fast as the latest consensus track models.  The cross 
track spread in the guidance remains very low, and the NHC forecast 
is essentially on top of the consensus models.

Tropical Storm Hector Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082024
1100 AM HST Mon Aug 26 2024

Hector's cloud pattern has not become better organized since earlier 
today.  Most of the deep convection is over the northern and eastern 
portions of the circulation.  Microwave imagery suggested some 
southeastward tilt of the vortex center with height.  Upper-level 
outflow is limited and mainly occurring over the southern portion of 
the system.  Subjective Dvorak satellite classifications from both 
TAFB and SAB are T3.0 corresponding to an intensity of 45 kt, so the 
advisory intensity remains unchanged at that value.

Hector has been moving west-northwestward with an initial motion 
estimate of 285/9 kt.  There is little change to the track forecast 
philosophy.  A low- to mid-level ridge to the north of the cyclone 
is forecast to strengthen slightly during the next few days.  This 
should result in a west-northwestward to westward motion with a 
gradual increase in forward speed during the forecast period.  By 
the end of the period, Hector should be a shallow system and be 
steered mainly by the low-level easterly flow.  The official track 
forecast is basically an extension of the previous one, and remains 
close to the model consensus aids.

Dynamical guidance indicates that weak-to-moderate vertical wind 
shear is likely over Hector during the next few days which could 
allow some strengthening.  However, the system is expected to 
continue moving near or over the cool wake of Hurricane Gilma and 
drier air should be affecting the circulation within the next couple 
of days. Therefore only a slight short-term increase in strength is 
forecast, with the official forecast being on the high side of the 
model guidance.  Given the expectation of increasingly unfavorable 
environmental conditions later in the forecast period, the official 
forecast shows Hector becoming a remnant low in 5 days.  However the 
global models suggest that the system may degenerate even sooner.
