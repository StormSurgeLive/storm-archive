Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 AM PDT Sun Aug 18 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on newly formed <br/>
Tropical Depression Seven-E, located well south of the southern tip <br/>
of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Well Southeast of the Hawaiian Islands:<br/>
Another area of low pressure located well southeast of the Hawaiian <br/>
Islands is producing some disorganized showers and thunderstorms on <br/>
its western side. This disturbance is forecast to interact with the <br/>
disturbance located to its east. If this system becomes the dominant <br/>
disturbance, some gradual development is possible, and a tropical <br/>
depression could form by the middle part of the week while it <br/>
initially moves slowly over the western portion of the East Pacific. <br/>
A faster west-northwestward motion into the Central Pacific basin is <br/>
likely by the latter portion of the week. Information on this <br/>
system's development can also be found in the Tropical Weather <br/>
Outlook for the Central Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Portion of the East Pacific:<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue in association with <br/>
a broad trough of low pressure located well west-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.  This system is <br/>
forecast to interact with another disturbance to its west-southwest <br/>
over the next few days, which could limit additional development if <br/>
this system does not become the dominant disturbance. Regardless, a <br/>
tropical depression could still form during the middle part of the <br/>
week while the system moves generally west-northwestward before it <br/>
possibly merges with the disturbance currently located further west. <br/>
Information on this system's development can also be found in the <br/>
Tropical Weather Outlook for the Central Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Portion of the East Pacific:<br/>
Yet another area of low pressure could form well to the south of the <br/>
southwestern coast of Mexico around the middle of the week. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear generally conducive for some slow <br/>
development of this system thereafter as it moves slowly <br/>
west-northwestward into the central portion of the East Pacific <br/>
basin. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>

Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
200 PM MST Sun Aug 18 2024
 
Despite continued moderate easterly vertical wind shear, deep 
convection has been expanding and has now built over the center of 
the system.  Accordingly, the Dvorak estimates have nudged upward 
and are now between 30 and 35 kt.  Based on those classifications 
and the improving convective pattern, the initial intensity is 
increased to 35 kt, making the system Tropical Storm Gilma.
 
Moderate easterly vertical wind shear of about 20 kt is expected to 
continue during the next day or so, which should limit the amount of 
strengthening in the short term.  The shear is expected to lessen 
some after that, and the somewhat more favorable upper-level wind 
environment combined with warm waters and a relatively moist 
atmosphere should allow for gradual strengthening throughout much of 
the week.  The NHC intensity forecast is higher than the previous 
one and roughly between the HCCA and IVCN guidance.
 
Gilma is moving west-northwestward, or 285 degrees, at 12 kt.  A 
high pressure ridge situated to the system’s north should cause the 
storm to move westward to west-northwestward at about the same speed 
during the next couple of days.  Later in the week, the models show 
the ridge weakening as a trough amplifies off the west coast of the 
U.S., which should cause the system to slow down and turn a bit to 
the right.  There is quite a bit of along-track spread in the 
models, with the GFS being the slowest model and HWRF/HAFS the 
fastest.  The NHC track forecast is similar to the previous one 
through 60 h and then is a little to the north of the prior track 
after that.  This forecast is close to the various consensus models.
