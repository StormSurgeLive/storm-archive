Hurricane Gilma Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
1100 PM HST Sun Aug 25 2024
 
This evening's satellite presentation consists of a ragged
partially obscured eye with a small inner core open in the south
semi-circle.  Gilma's cloud pattern continues to deteriorate slowly
and has shed most of the associated convective bands with the
exception of fragmented curved band wrapping in from the south.
The initial intensity is lowered to 85 kt and is based on the
Dvorak satellite intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB and a blend
of the UW-CIMSS ADT, AiDT, and DMINT objective estimates, yielding
83 kt.
 
Water vapor imagery and global model RH/700mb fields indicate that
the cyclone is moving toward a dry, stable air mass, indicative of
a large low-level stratocumulus cloud deck intruding from the
northwest in the GOES-18 Proxy-VIS images.  Subsequently, the
statistical GFS/ECMWF SHIPS indicated a mid-level/700-500mb RH of
42 percent.  This inhibiting thermodynamic contribution, along with
increasing west-to-west-southwesterly shear noted in the
statistical SHIPS intensity guidance, particularly beyond 36 hrs,
should cause Gilma to weaken at a quicker rate through day 5.
The NHC intensity forecast is a compromise of the Decay-SHIPS and
the IVCN intensity consensus and shows Gilma degenerating to a
post-tropical cyclone in 4 days.
 
Gilma's initial motion is estimated to be westward, or 280/8 kt,
and is moving in the southern periphery of a mid-tropospheric
subtropical ridge extending westward across the tropical-eastern
Pacific from northwestern Mexico.  The global and regional models
are fairly clustered together and indicate a slightly to the right
of the initial track motion, or west-northwestward beyond the 60 hr 
period, and the official forecast follows suit.  Along-track 
differences continue to be a model inconsistency, but following the 
skilled TVCE and HCCA consensus models have been the best track 
forecast solution so far.
 
Gilma's 50 kt wind radii have been slightly adjusted based on a 
0559 UTC METOP-C ASCAT overpass.

Tropical Storm Hector Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082024
500 AM HST Mon Aug 26 2024

Microwave imagery continues to show evidence of northerly shear 
over the cyclone, with the mid-level center displaced a little to 
the south of the surface center.  However, the overall cloud 
pattern appears to be slightly better organized than it was 
yesterday with some evidence of banding features over the eastern 
portion of the circulation.  The advisory intensity has been 
increased a bit, to 45 kt, in agreement with subjective Dvorak 
Current Intensity Numbers from TAFB and SAB.
 
Center fixes from geostationary and microwave imagery give a 
westward motion at around 270/9 kt.  A weak low- to mid-level ridge 
is currently situated to the north of Hector, and the global 
models suggest that the ridge will build a little in a few days.  
The track guidance calls for a west-northwestward to westward 
heading with a slight increase in forward speed for the next 3-5 
days.  The official forecast is similar to the previous one and 
follows the dynamical model consensus predictions.

Although the vertical shear is not forecast to be very strong, 
Hector is expected to traverse marginal SSTs for the next few days 
while it moves over or near the oceanic wake of Hurricane Gilma.  
Also, the global models show the system encountering increasingly 
dry air at low- to mid-levels.  The intensity guidance does not 
call for much additional strengthening and the official 
forecast is at the high end of the model predictions.  With the
expected less favorable environment, a weakening trend is likely to 
begin in a couple of days.  Simulated satellite imagery from the 
ECMWF and GFS models show little or no deep convection associated 
with Hector by the end of the forecast period, so the official 
forecast calls for the system to become a remnant low at that time.
