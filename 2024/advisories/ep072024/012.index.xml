Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 PM PDT Tue Aug 20 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gilma, located several hundred miles west-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Well East-Southeast of the Hawaiian Islands (EP90/EP91):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a well-defined area of <br/>
low pressure located well east-southeast of the Hawaiian Islands <br/>
are gradually becoming better organized, and only a slight increase <br/>
in organization could result in the formation of a tropical <br/>
depression or tropical storm while it moves generally westward at <br/>
10 to 15 mph.  The weaker disturbance located just to its southwest <br/>
is expected to dissipate or merge with this system during the next <br/>
several hours.  This system is expected to strengthen as it moves <br/>
across the central Pacific basin late this week and move near the <br/>
Hawaiian Islands late this weekend or early next week.<br/>
<br/>
While it is too early to determine the exact location and magnitude <br/>
of potential impacts, interests in Hawaii should closely monitor <br/>
this disturbance. Information on this system's development can also <br/>
be found in the Tropical Weather Outlook for the Central Pacific <br/>
basin.  For marine forecasts, including gale warnings, see High Seas <br/>
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Portion of the East Pacific:<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms centered several hundred <br/>
miles southwest of the coast of southwestern Mexico are associated <br/>
with a trough of low pressure.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to become more conducive for development in a day or two, <br/>
and a tropical depression could form late this week or over the <br/>
weekend while the system moves west-northwestward over open waters, <br/>
well offshore of Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>

<title>Hurricane Gilma Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
800 PM PDT Tue Aug 20 2024
 
Gilma is holding steady this evening.  The low-level circulation is 
still hidden beneath a modest Central Dense Overcast (CDO).  Recent 
satellite microwave imagery showed the deep convection is limited to 
the southern half of the storm, with a band extending to the 
southwest of the center.  The initial intensity is held at 60 kt in 
deference to the earlier ASCAT data, slightly above the subjective 
Dvorak estimates of 55 kt from TAFB and SAB.

A ridge centered over the southwestern U.S. is steering the storm at 
an estimated 275/9 kt.  A westward to west-northwestward motion 
should continue for the next day or so.  By Thursday, a slight turn 
poleward and decrease of forward speed is expected as a deep-layer 
trough moving in from the west erodes the ridge.  Once again, the 
track model guidance has shifted southward this cycle.  The latest 
NHC track forecast has been nudged to the south and lies between the 
previous track forecast and the simple consensus aid TVCE.

Gilma seems to be holding its own against the moderate northeasterly 
wind shear.  Global models suggest the upper-level winds should 
gradually become more favorable over the next day or so, allowing 
Gilma to reach hurricane status overnight or Wednesday morning.  The 
storm should have the necessary ingredients to steadily strengthen 
through Thursday, and the forecast peak remains at 90 kt. By the end 
of the week and into the weekend, Gilma should encounter cooling sea 
surface temperatures, increasing shear, and dry mid-level humidities 
causing it to gradually weaken. The latest official forecast is 
largely an update of the previous prediction.
