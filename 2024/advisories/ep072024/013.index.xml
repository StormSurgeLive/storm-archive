Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 AM PDT Wed Aug 21 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
upgraded Hurricane Gilma, located several hundred miles <br/>
west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California <br/>
peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Well East-Southeast of the Hawaiian Islands (EP90/EP91):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to become better organized <br/>
in association with a well-defined area of low pressure located <br/>
well east-southeast of the Hawaiian Islands. If these trends <br/>
continue, a tropical depression or tropical storm is likely to <br/>
develop later today while it moves generally westward at 10 to 15 <br/>
mph.  A weaker disturbance located just to its southwest is expected <br/>
to merge with this system later today.  This system is expected to <br/>
strengthen as it moves into the central Pacific basin tonight or on <br/>
Thursday and moves near the Hawaiian Islands late this weekend or <br/>
early next week.<br/>
<br/>
Interests in Hawaii should closely monitor this disturbance, though <br/>
it remains too early to determine the exact location and magnitude <br/>
of potential impacts. Information on this system's development can <br/>
also be found in the Tropical Weather Outlook for the Central <br/>
Pacific basin.  For marine forecasts, including gale warnings, see <br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Portion of the East Pacific:<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue in association with <br/>
a trough of low pressure centered several hundred miles southwest of <br/>
the coast of southwestern Mexico.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to become more conducive for development in a few days, and <br/>
a tropical depression is likely to form late this week or over the <br/>
weekend while the system moves west-northwestward into the central <br/>
portion of the East Pacific, well offshore of Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

<title>Hurricane Gilma Forecast Discussion Number 13</title>

Hurricane Gilma Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
800 AM PDT Wed Aug 21 2024
 
This morning, Gilma's structure on satellite has continued to 
improve, with infrared satellite depicting a banding type eye 
appearing intermittently as convection attempts to wrap around the 
estimated center. In addition, we received a 0933 UTC AMSR2 
microwave pass which showed a developing eyewall on both the 89-GHz 
and 37-GHz channels, though with some vertical tilt. The latest 
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were both 
T4.5/77-kt, which also matches the latest ADT estimate. Thus, 
Gilma's initial intensity will be raised to 75 kt for this 
advisory. 

Gilma appears to be moving just north of due west, but slower than 
earlier, estimated at 280/6 kt. Over the next few days, a large 
subtropical ridge poleward of the hurricane should continue to steer 
it generally westward to west-northwestward. However, this ridge 
becomes positioned a little farther northwest with time as a subtle 
weakness north of the storm forms, resulting in a 
slower-than-typical forward motion for this part of the Eastern 
Pacific basin. The latest track guidance this cycle is notably 
slower and more equatorward than the previous cycle, and the NHC 
track was shifted in that direction, but not quite as far as the 
reliable track consensus guidance TVCE and HCCA. As mentioned in the 
previous discussion, if these southward trends continue, further 
southward adjustments may be necessary.  

With the improvement of Gilma's inner core structure this morning, 
the hurricane may be poised to intensify more over the next day or 
two. This scenario is shown by the recent hurricane-regional model 
guidance, which shows more intensification than the prior cycle. 
Given the reduction in vertical wind shear noted in the recent SHIPS 
guidance and as Gilma remains over 27-28 C sea-surface temperatures 
for the next 48 h, the NHC intensity forecast now shows 
intensification into a Category 3 hurricane over this time period. 
This intensity forecast is higher than the previous one, but is in 
good agreement with the latest HCCA consensus aid. However there 
remain some hurricane-regional models that show even more 
intensification (e.g., HAFS-A). After 48 h, sea-surface temperatures 
begin to gradually decrease, and slow weakening is expected to begin 
thereafter, though less than the previous advisory due to the 
further south track over warmer ocean waters.
