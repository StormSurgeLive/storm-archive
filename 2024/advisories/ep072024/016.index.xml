Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 PM PDT Wed Aug 21 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Gilma, located about one thousand miles west-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Well East-Southeast of the Hawaiian Islands (EP91):<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity has gradually increased tonight in <br/>
association with an area of low pressure located well east-southeast <br/>
of the Hawaiian Islands. A slight improvement in organization could <br/>
result in the formation of a tropical depression or tropical storm <br/>
on Thursday while it moves generally westward at 10 to 15 mph. This <br/>
system is expected to move into the central Pacific basin early <br/>
Thursday morning, where it is then forecast to strengthen during the <br/>
next couple of days and move near the Hawaiian Islands late this <br/>
weekend or early next week.<br/>
<br/>
Interests in Hawaii should closely monitor this disturbance, though <br/>
it remains too early to determine the exact location and magnitude <br/>
of potential impacts. Information on this system's development can <br/>
also be found in the Tropical Weather Outlook for the Central <br/>
Pacific basin. For marine forecasts, including gale warnings, see <br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Portion of the East Pacific: <br/>
A trough of low pressure located several hundred miles to the south <br/>
of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula is producing a <br/>
broad area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Environmental <br/>
conditions are forecast to be generally conducive for development <br/>
over the next several days, and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form during the next few days while the system moves <br/>
west-northwestward at about 10 mph over the central portion of the <br/>
East Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>

<title>Hurricane Gilma Forecast Discussion Number 16</title>

Hurricane Gilma Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
200 AM PDT Thu Aug 22 2024

Gilma has continued to intensify while exhibiting a well-defined 
eye on geostationary satellite imagery, and convective cloud tops 
colder than -70 deg C are evident around the eyewall.   The cloud 
pattern is fairly symmetric in appearance, and upper-level outflow 
is well defined over all quadrants of the circulation.  The current 
intensity estimate is raised to 100 kt based on a subjective Dvorak 
classification from TAFB and various objective estimates from 
UW-CIMSS.  This makes Gilma the first major hurricane of the 2024 
east Pacific season.

Center fixes show a fairly slow forward speed toward the 
west-northwest, with an initial motion estimate of 290/5 kt.  A 
mid-tropospheric trough near the California coast has broken down 
the subtropical ridge to the north of Gilma, resulting in a weaker 
than normal steering current.  Over the next several days, the ridge 
is expected to build back rather slowly, resulting in only a gradual 
increase in the tropical cyclone's forward speed over the forecast 
period.  The official track forecast is about the same as the one 
from the previous NHC advisory, and is near the southern side of the 
model suite.

Some additional strengthening is expected, since the system has a 
well-defined inner core and is in an environment of low shear while 
situated over warm waters.  The short-term intensity forecast 
reflects current trends and is in line with much of the regional 
dynamical hurricane model guidance.  In the next day or two, the 
SSTs below Gilma are expected to gradually decrease.  Later in the 
forecast period, the cyclone will be moving into a drier and more 
stable air mass.  These factors should cause slow weakening, and the 
official intensity forecast is similar to the previous one.  
Overall, the NHC intensity forecast is on the high end of the model 
guidance.
