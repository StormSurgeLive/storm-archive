near latitude 18.1 North, longitude 135.1 West. Gilma is moving
toward the west near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A westward to 
west-northwestward motion at a similar forward speed is expected
during the next several days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 105 mph (165 km/h)

the next couple of days, Gilma is forecast to remain a hurricane as 
it approaches the central Pacific basin.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles
(110 km).

Hurricane Gilma Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
500 PM HST Sun Aug 25 2024
 
Gilma is a compact hurricane with a small eye noted in both
infrared satellite imagery and a recent 0039 UTC SSMIS microwave
overpass. The microwave imagery showed that the convection
associated with Gilma has eroded over the southern semicircle,
likely due to an increase in shear and dry air intrusion.  The
initial intensity has been lowered to 90 kt, which is a blend of
the latest objective and subjective intensity estimates.  It should
be noted that the range of the satellite intensity estimates is
atypically large and is around 75 kt on the low side to around 
100 kt at the upper end.
 
Westerly shear over Gilma is forecast to increase to moderate
levels during the next 24 hours, and this along with nearby dry
mid-level air and slightly lower SSTs are expected to cause gradual
weakening during the next couple of days.  Around 72 hours a more
substantial increase in vertical wind shear is anticipated and this
should result in a faster rate of weakening.  The global models
suggest the system is likely to struggle to produce organized
deep convection by day 4, and Gilma is forecast to become a
post-tropical cyclone around that time.
 
Gilma has been moving just north of due west (275/8 kt) during the
past 12 hours.  A mid-level ridge to the north of Gilma should
continue to steer the storm on a westward to west-northwestward
heading throughout much of this week.  The track guidance is in
good agreement during the next 48-72 hours, but there is greater
spread in Gilma's forward speed at days 4 and 5.  This is related 
to how long Gilma remains vertically coherent.  The models that 
weaken the cyclone more quickly favor a faster forward speed later 
in the forecast period. The NHC track forecast is a little faster 
at 96 and 120 h to be closer to the latest consensus aids. 
Otherwise, the new track forecast is essentially an update of
the previous official forecast.

Tropical Storm Hector Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082024
1100 AM HST Sun Aug 25 2024

Two ASCAT overpasses recently sampled the tropical disturbance well 
to the southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.  These scatterometer 
observations revealed that the system now has a well-defined 
surface circulation with maximum winds of around 40 kt.  Although 
some higher wind speeds were noted, these vectors are believed to 
be rain-contaminated and a little inflated.  Based on these data, 
the system is being upgraded to Tropical Storm Hector.  The 
low-level center is situated near the northern edge of a rather 
ragged-looking area of deep convection, and banding features are 
not well-defined at this time.

The earlier center fixes from conventional satellite imagery had 
considerable spread, making the initial motion a rather uncertain 
270/10 kt.  A mid-level ridge should be maintained to the north of 
Hector for the next several days.  Therefore, a west-northwestward 
or westward track is forecast during the upcoming 5-day period.  
The NHC track forecast is close to the simple model consensus.

Over the next couple of days, Hector should be moving through an 
environment that is marginally conducive for strengthening.  The 
tropical cyclone is likely to pass near or over the wake of 
Hurricane Gilma, which could limit strengthening.  The official 
intensity forecast is similar to the latest Decay-SHIPS prediction, 
and shows only modest strengthening over the next few days followed 
by gradual weakening.  It should be noted that some of the global 
models, such as the ECMWF, suggest that Hector could weaken faster 
than shown here during the latter part of the forecast period.
