Post-Tropical Cyclone Fabio Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
200 PM PDT Wed Aug 07 2024
 
This afternoon's satellite presentation shows that Fabio has 
succumbed to the increasingly harsh surrounding environment.  Only a 
poorly defined surface circulation of low cloud elements is what 
remains of the tropical cyclone.  Therefore, Fabio no longer meets 
the definition of a tropical cyclone, and this will be the last NHC 
advisory.  The post-tropical cyclone's initial intensity is reduced 
to 35 kt, based on the TAFB and SAB satellite intensity estimates.  
Further weakening is forecast in the short term before merging with 
Emilia on Thursday.
 
Fabio's initial motion is estimated to be southwestward or
225/14 kt and this general motion is expected to continue through
tonight, while it moves around the western periphery of Emilia's
circulation and eventually merges with Emilia on Thursday, or
sooner.
 
For additional information on the post-tropical cyclone please see
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under
AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN03 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php

MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...993 MB...29.33 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM PDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Emilia was 
located near latitude 20.5 North, longitude 119.9 West. Emilia is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 18 mph (30 km/h) and this 
motion with a slower forward speed is expected over the next several 
days. 
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple 
of days and Emilia is likely to become a post-tropical remnant low 
by the end of this week. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 993 mb (29.33 inches).

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
800 PM PDT Wed Aug 07 2024
 
Emilia seems to be in the final stages of fully absorbing the 
remnants of Fabio, which now appear fully enveloped in Emilia's 
larger circulation. With that said, the merger has not benefited 
Emilia, and most of its deep central convection has collapsed as the 
system approaches cooler waters. While there hasn't been recent 
microwave data over the system, subjective and objective satellite 
intensity estimates have either stayed the same or decreased 
slightly. The initial intensity is nudged downward to 50 kt for this 
advisory.
 
The interaction with Fabio may have resulted in a brief acceleration 
in Emilia's forward motion, but the longer term motion is now off to 
the west-northwest at 290/16-kt. The steering associated with a 
mid-level ridge to the north should continue to result in a 
west-northwestward motion for most of the forecast period. The NHC 
track forecast is very similar to the prior advisory, and still lies 
in the middle of the track guidance envelope.
 
As mentioned in the prior advisory, the shear is forecast to remain 
low over Emilia, but the tropical storm is also forecast to cross 
the 26 C isotherm tonight and move over increasingly cool ocean 
waters. In addition, the storm will also be traversing an 
increasingly dry and stable air mass along the forecast track. Thus, 
gradual weakening is forecast to continue, with Emilia expected to 
become a remnant low in about 48 hours, about the time when the GFS 
and ECMWF simulated satellite shows organized convection 
dissipating. It will likely take a few more days for the circulation 
to spin down to the point it opens up into a trough, sometime 
between days 4 to 5.
