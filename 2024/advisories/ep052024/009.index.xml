Tropical Storm Fabio Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
200 AM MST Tue Aug 06 2024
 
Fabio has become better organized this evening.  The satellite 
presentation reveals a developing deep convective band wrapping 
around the southern portion of the cyclone, and a small Central 
Dense Overcast (CDO) with cold cloud tops of -83C that appears to be 
forming over the surface center.  A blend of the Dvorak satellite 
and UW-CIMSS objective intensity estimates, and a recent SATCON 
intensity analysis yields 55 kt for this advisory.
 
A low shear and moist thermodynamic environment should allow Fabio 
to strengthen before the cyclone directly interacts and becomes 
absorbed by Emilia.  The deterministic guidance also shows an 
upper-level low moving toward Fabio from the northeast and producing 
favorable upper diffluent flow over the northeast portion of the 
cyclone.  The new NHC intensity forecast is a bit above the previous 
one and now shows Fabio's peak intensity at 60 kt, which is close to 
the IVCN and HCCA consensus aids.  It's worth noting, however, that 
the initialization of the two tropical cyclones in the GFS seems to 
be the most reasonable based on the structure and intensity of both 
cyclones.  Therefore, a change in the forecast philosophy may be 
deemed necessary in subsequent advisories.
 
Fabio's initial motion is estimated to be west-northwestward or 
295/15 kt.  The global models show that Fabio will move between 
Emilia to the west-southwest and a mid-tropospheric ridge extending 
from the west Gulf of Mexico to the southern Baja California 
Peninsula during the next couple of days.  The models also generally 
agree that Emilia will capture and absorb Fabio, but the exact 
timing for which this will occur is in some doubt. The 
ECMWF/CMC/UKMET and the COAMPS-TC show this evolution taking place 
within 36 hours, while the GFS run indicates the two tropical 
cyclones cyclonically orbiting around each other during the next 
three to four days.  The best solution at this time is to show a 
similar scenario to the previous advisory and hedge toward the 
better-performing consensus guidance with Fabio becoming absorbed by 
Emilia by mid-week.

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
200 AM MST Tue Aug 06 2024
 
Emilia is becoming more organized overnight.  The tropical storm has 
had a healthy burst of deep convection near the surface center with 
a growing central dense overcast.  Some fortuitous scatterometer 
data showed an area of 45-50 kt of wind along the southern portion 
of the circulation.  This combined with a TAFB Dvorak estimate of 
T3.5 is the basis for increasing the initial intensity to 55 kt for 
this advisory.  The wind radii have also been updated using the 
satellite surface wind data, extending the tropical-storm-force 
winds in the southern half of the storm.

The cyclone is moving at an uncertain 255/4 kt.  Emilia's track 
forecast is dependent on Fabio, the tropical storm to its east.  The 
two systems are forecast to rotate around one another as they both 
turn generally north-northwestward to northwestward and accelerate 
along southwestern side of a ridge centered over the United States 
during the next day or so.  As Emilia weakens later in the week, 
the shallower vortex should turn westward in the low-level flow.  
Only small changes have been made to the latest track forecast, and 
it lies on the southern side of the track guidance envelope.

Models continue to show Emilia as the dominant cyclone that should 
survive the interaction with Fabio.  Steady intensification is still 
forecast over the next 24 h, but the peak has been adjusted upward 
due to the recent strengthening trend.  Emilia is now expected to 
become a hurricane on Wednesday.  Later in the week, most models 
show Emilia and Fabio merging, though the timing is questionable.  
The official prediction shows Fabio being absorbed into Emilia's 
circulation by 48 h, similar to the most recent ECMWF model 
forecast.  The storm will gradually weaken into a remnant low by 
the end of the forecast period as it moves over cooling ocean waters 
and into a dry and stable environment.  Due to the uncertainty in 
the interaction with Tropical Storm Fabio, changes to the forecast 
could be necessary in later advisory packages.
