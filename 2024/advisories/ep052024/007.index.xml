Tropical Storm Fabio Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
800 PM MST Mon Aug 05 2024

Fabio has become better organized today with a larger area of deep 
convection becoming more persistent.  Based on microwave data from 
the past 6 h, the center of Fabio appears to be located underneath 
the northern portion of the convective area.  The latest subjective 
Dvorak estimates are 55 kt from TAFB and 45 kt from SAB, while the 
latest objective intensity estimates range from 37 kt to 55 kt.  
The initial intensity is raised to 45 kt for this advisory, but 
that could be a bit conservative.

The initial motion is now 300/16 kt.  Fabio's motion should be
dominated by interaction with Tropical Storm Emilia to the
west-southwest, with Fabio expected to move west-northwestward at a 
similar forward speed around the north side of Emilia for the next 
36 h or so.  The new forecast track has only minor changes from the 
previous track.
 
Some strengthening could occur in the next 12 h or so.  After that, 
no additional strengthening is expected as Fabio moves closer to 
Emilia.  This forecast assumes that Fabio will be absorbed by Emilia 
Wednesday or Wednesday night.  Confidence in this forecast scenario 
is increasing due to the more consistent global model solutions that
Emilia will absorb Fabio.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
The weakening trend will continue, and the system is forecast to
dissipate around Wednesday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).

Post-Tropical Cyclone Carlotta Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
Issued by NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI
800 PM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024

Remaining deep convection associated with Carlotta has been
intermittent and distant from the fully exposed circulation center.
This is not surprising considering that Carlotta is moving over sea
surface temperatures near 24C with vertical shear near 30 kt. 
Initial intensity estimates ranged from the ADT's 25 kt to CIMSS 
SATCON's 36 kt. The initial intensity for this advisory has been 
held at 35 kt based on the SATCON estimate.
 
While there may be intermittent flare-ups of deep convection over
the next day or so, reintensification under these environmental
conditions is not likely. As a result, Carlotta has been declared a
post-tropical cyclone. The remnant circulation of Carlotta
should continue to spin down and the global and hi-res hurricane
models open up the circulation into a trough around the middle of
the week.
 
This is the last advisory on this system. For additional information
on the post-tropical cyclone, please see the High Seas Forecasts
issued by the National Weather Service under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI,
WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php

Remnants Of Daniel Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042024
800 PM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024
 
Earlier today, GOES Proxy-Vis satellite imagery and microwave 
overpasses had indicated that Daniel's surface circulation center 
had become less defined, and this afternoon's scatterometer pass 
showed a poorly defined surface swirl and possibly open in the 
north quadrant.  Since that time, the satellite presentation shows 
that the cyclone has opened up into a trough while embedded within 
the persistent southwesterly monsoonal flow.  Accordingly, this is 
the last NHC Advisory on this system.

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
800 PM MST Mon Aug 05 2024

Earlier ASCAT data showed that Emilia was likely a 45 kt tropical 
storm around 18Z, with an exposed low-level center located just 
outside of and to the northeast of the convective overcast area, 
due to moderate northeasterly shear.  Since that time, the 
low-level center appears to have moved toward the edge of the 
convective mass.  However infrared satellite imagery shows that some 
of the cloud tops in the convective area have warmed slightly during 
that time.  The latest subjective Dvorak estimates are 45 kt from 
TAFB and 35 kt from SAB.  Recent objective intensity estimates from 
CIMSS range from 34 to 42 kt.  Based on all the data and satellite 
imagery, the 45 kt intensity is unchanged from the previous NHC 
advisory.
 
The latest global model runs continue to forecast that Emilia will 
be the survivor in its interaction with Tropical Storm Fabio to the 
east, and the merger is forecast to happen on Wednesday or Wednesday 
night.  In the short term, moderate northeasterly shear is forecast 
to continue over Emilia.  Due to the moderate shear, only modest 
strengthening is forecast, and no change is made to the previous NHC 
peak intensity forecast of 55 kt.  After Emilia absorbs Fabio in 
about 48 h, Emilia is forecast to move over less than 26C SSTs, 
which should cause weakening.  Emilia is forecast to weaken below 
tropical storm strength by day 4, and will continue to spin down 
after that as it moves over progressively colder water.  Confidence 
in this forecast is increasing due to the more consistent model 
guidance that Emilia will absorb Fabio and not the other way around.

Emilia is currently moving very slowly toward the west-southwest.  
A turn toward the northwest or north-northwest with an increase in 
forward speed is expected Tuesday, and Emilia is expected to absorb 
Fabio on Wednesday.  After Fabio dissipates in about 48 h, Emilia 
should generally move west-northwestward on the south side of a low- 
to mid-level ridge to the north, with this general motion expected 
for the remainder of the forecast period.  Only very minor changes 
were made to the previous NHC track forecast.
