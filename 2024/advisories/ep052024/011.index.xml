Tropical Storm Fabio Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
800 PM PDT Tue Aug 06 2024

Deep convection associated with Fabio has decreased significantly 
since the previous advisory, with most of the convection off to 
the northeast of the low-level center. The latest subjective 
intensity estimates are 45 kt from both TAFB and SAB, and recent 
objective intensity estimates from CIMSS range from 35 to 53 kt. 
The intensity is lowered a bit to 45 kt, which is a compromise of 
the data.

Moderate westerly wind shear should continue to be an issue for the 
next 12 h or so.  After that, Fabio will increasingly interact with 
Emilia as SSTs along Fabio's path decrease to below 26C in 18 to 24 
h. These factors are likely to cause some additional weakening 
before Fabio dissipates or merges with Emilia.

Fabio should move on a west-northwest course over the next 24 h.  
The 18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF models are both forecasting Fabio to 
dissipate or merge with Emilia in 24 to 36 h. Therefore, the NHC 
forecast now calls for dissipation by hour 36.

<title>Tropical Storm Emilia Forecast Discussion Number 10</title>

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
200 PM PDT Tue Aug 06 2024

Satellite imagery shows curved banding that has become slightly more 
impressive over the past 6 h, and there are signs that the RMW may 
have contracted a bit.  Emilia has a much healthier appearance on 
satellite imagery compared to Fabio, which is currently centered 
about 320 miles to the north-northeast of Emilia.  The latest 
subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB range from 55-65 kt, 
and the latest reliable objective intensity estimates from CIMSS 
range from 48 to 59 kt.  The intensity is held at 55 kt for this 
advisory, but this estimate could be slightly conservative.

Emilia is moving slowly northwestward, or 325/3-kt.  The northerly 
flow to the west of Fabio is keeping Emilia's forward speed slow for 
now.  However, as Fabio moves farther west over the next day or so, 
Emilia will accelerate to the northwest.  The confidence in the 
track forecast is below average due to the complex interaction with 
Fabio.  The latest forecast was adjusted slightly to the right and 
slightly slower than the previous official forecast for about the 
first 36 h, closer to the latest model consensus.  Emilia is 
forecast to absorb Fabio into its circulation by Thursday, but there 
are some timing differences among the various models.  The timing 
and location of the merger is a blend of the 12Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF 
model solutions.  After the merger, Emilia will turn toward the 
west-northwest as it is steered more by the lower-level flow.  The 
track forecast beyond 48 h is very close to the previous NHC 
forecast.  

The interaction with Fabio makes the intensity forecast challenging. 
The NHC forecast continues to favor the solution in which Emilia 
absorbs Fabio in 36 to 48 h.  Emilia has been able to fight off 
moderate northeasterly vertical wind shear so far, and it seems 
reasonable that the cyclone could intensify a bit more over the next 
24 h as it remains over warm ocean waters.  Emilia is forecast to 
cross the 26C isotherm by 36 h, and steady weakening is expected 
after that time.  Emilia should weaken below tropical storm strength 
on Friday and become a remnant low on Saturday.  The latest 
intensity forecast is near the middle of the intensity guidance and 
is similar to the previous forecast.
