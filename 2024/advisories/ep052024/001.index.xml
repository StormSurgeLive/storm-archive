Tropical Weather Outlook...Corrected<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 AM PDT Sun Aug 4 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Corrected to update active systems and include statement for gale <br/>
warnings for EP96.<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
downgraded Tropical Storm Carlotta, located several hundred miles to <br/>
the west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California <br/>
peninsula, and on Tropical Storm Daniel, located more than one <br/>
thousand miles to the west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja <br/>
California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
South of Southwestern Mexico (EP96):<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity has increased with a broad area of <br/>
low pressure located a few hundred miles south of southwestern <br/>
Mexico. Environmental conditions remain conducive for gradual <br/>
development, and a tropical depression is likely to form during the <br/>
next day or two while the system moves generally west-northwestward <br/>
at 10 to 15 mph, remaining well offshore of the coast of Mexico. For <br/>
more information of this system, including Gale Warnings, see High <br/>
Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South-Southwest of the Baja California Peninsula (EP97):<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity is showing signs of organization <br/>
with an area of low pressure located several hundred miles to the <br/>
south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California <br/>
peninsula. Environmental conditions appear conducive for development <br/>
over the next day or two, and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form during that time while the system meanders within weak steering <br/>
currents. Thereafter, the system is forecast to interact with the <br/>
disturbance (EP96) to its southeast, which should limit the chances <br/>
of further development afterwards.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

<title>Tropical Storm Carlotta Forecast Discussion Number 17</title>

Tropical Storm Carlotta Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
800 AM PDT Sun Aug 04 2024
 
Carlotta's deep convection has become quite limited this
morning. Subjective Dvorak and objective satellite estimates like
the UW-CIMSS ADT are all decreasing, and support an initial
intensity estimate of 55 kt. No changes of note were made to the NHC
forecast, and further weakening should continue as Carlotta moves
over SSTs that are already below 25 deg C. The SSTs will only get
colder during the next couple of days as Carlotta moves along the
forecast track. The tropical storm is forecast by most models to
lose its remaining deep convection in about 48 h, and based on
current trends this could occur even sooner. Dissipation is still
expected around mid-week.
 
The tropical storm is still moving westward to west-northwestward. 
This general motion should continue for the next day or two as 
Carlotta is steered by a deep-layer ridge centered well to its 
northeast. As the cyclone weakens further and becomes more 
vertically shallow, low-level steering will likely cause it to turn 
westward and slow down slightly in a couple of days.

Tropical Storm Daniel Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042024
800 AM PDT Sun Aug 04 2024

Daniel's convective structure continues to sputter along, with the 
coldest cloud tops organized in two regions to the northeast and 
southwest of the center, which appears to be mostly exposed this 
morning. The latest round of both subjective and objective intensity 
guidance has not changed much from overnight, and so the initial 
intensity remains 35 kt this advisory. 

It appears that the tropical storm is finally starting to track more 
north-northeastward this morning, with the estimated motion at 030/4 
kt. A somewhat faster northeastward motion is expected to begin 
later today through Monday as Daniel's motion is influenced by the 
southwesterly monsoonal flow being picked up by Carlotta passing to 
the north. The global models still show a turn north and 
northwestward as Daniel gets caught in the outer periphery  of 
Carlotta's larger circulation. The NHC track forecast is quite 
similar to the prior advisory, close to the multi-model consensus. 
 
While the vertical wind shear that was previously affecting Daniel 
is starting to subside, there is quite a bit of environmental dry 
air to the north of the storm, which will likely keep it in check, 
and only a modest amount of intensification is forecasted. After 48 
h, this dry air is expected to fully envelop the circulation, 
choking off the remaining convection, marking the storm's transition 
to a post-tropical remnant low. The low is finally forecast to open 
up into a trough by midweek.

SUMMARY OF 800 AM MST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.8N 112.9W
ABOUT 530 MI...850 KM SSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...STATIONARY
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1007 MB...29.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Five-E
was located near latitude 15.8 North, longitude 112.9 West. The
depression is nearly stationary, but a slow generally southward 
motion is expected to begin later today and continue into Monday. A 
sharp turn back toward the north is possible by Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Slow strengthening is expected today and the system is forecast to 
become a tropical storm tonight. The cyclone will then begin to 
interact with another larger disturbance approaching from the east, 
which is expected to cause this system to dissipate in a few days.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).

Tropical Depression Five-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
800 AM MST Sun Aug 04 2024
 
Convection associated with a low located well offshore Mexico has 
steadily increased in coverage and organization since yesterday. 
Overnight ASCAT and first-light visible imagery indicate that the 
cyclone also has a well-defined, if somewhat broad, circulation. 
Subjective Dvorak classifications from TAFB and SAB were both 2.0 
at 1200 UTC, which support initiating advisories on the system as a 
30 kt depression.

The depression is located within a very convectively active 
environment over the east Pacific, deep-layer wind shear is low, and 
SSTs are plenty warm, so strengthening is expected in the short 
term. The biggest source of uncertainty for this forecast is an 
expected interaction with a larger disturbance, currently Invest 
96E, which is approaching from the east. Based on the available 
global and hurricane dynamical model forecasts, the most likely 
scenario is that 96E will be the dominant system. In that case, the 
new depression will only have a short window to strengthen before it 
is wrapped into and dissipates within the other circulation. Models 
historically handle interaction cases like this poorly, so 
confidence in the forecast is not high, despite the near universal 
agreement between the dynamical guidance on this upcoming evolution.

The NHC forecast is very close to the consensus guidance through 24 
to 36 h.  After that, the model trackers appear to be getting fooled 
by the close proximity of 96E and TD Five-E and are following the 
stronger vortex instead. The NHC forecast is based heavily on a 
broad consensus of model fields beyond 36 h and shows dissipation 
occuring by 60 h.  There is some chance that the depression could 
persist longer than forecast if the two systems remain farther 
apart, however there is not enough guidance with a trackable vortex 
to justify an explicit forecast beyond what is currently shown.
