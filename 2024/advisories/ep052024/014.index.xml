Post-Tropical Cyclone Fabio Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
200 PM PDT Wed Aug 07 2024
 
This afternoon's satellite presentation shows that Fabio has 
succumbed to the increasingly harsh surrounding environment.  Only a 
poorly defined surface circulation of low cloud elements is what 
remains of the tropical cyclone.  Therefore, Fabio no longer meets 
the definition of a tropical cyclone, and this will be the last NHC 
advisory.  The post-tropical cyclone's initial intensity is reduced 
to 35 kt, based on the TAFB and SAB satellite intensity estimates.  
Further weakening is forecast in the short term before merging with 
Emilia on Thursday.
 
Fabio's initial motion is estimated to be southwestward or
225/14 kt and this general motion is expected to continue through
tonight, while it moves around the western periphery of Emilia's
circulation and eventually merges with Emilia on Thursday, or
sooner.
 
For additional information on the post-tropical cyclone please see
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under
AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN03 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
200 PM PDT Wed Aug 07 2024

Emilia's cloud pattern has become a little ragged-looking since 
earlier today, and the low-level center appears to be located near 
the northern edge of the main area of deep convection.  The storm's 
circulation has been interacting with Fabio, which is rotating 
around the western side of Emilia while dissipating.  Emilia is 
expected to absorb the remnant disturbance of Fabio within the next 
day or so.  The current intensity is set at 55 kt based on a blend 
of subjective Dvorak classifications from TAFB and SAB.  This is 
also within the range of various objective intensity estimates from 
UW-CIMSS.

The system appears to be continuing on a generally northwestward 
track, with an initial motion estimate of 305/16 kt.  The steering 
flow associated with a mid-level ridge to the north of Emilia is 
likely to cause a generally west-northwestward motion for the next 
few days.  The official forecast track lies roughly in the middle 
of the track guidance suite.

Although the vertical shear over Emilia is expected to remain fairly 
low, The cyclone will be traversing progressively cooler waters 
during the next 48 hours or so.  Low- to mid-level relative humidity 
is also forecast to decrease during this period as well.  Therefore, 
gradual weakening is anticipated during the next couple of days and 
Emilia should become a post-tropical remnant low on Friday.  This is 
similar to the scenario shown by the previous official forecast.
