Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Mon Sep 30 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Isaac, located several hundred miles northwest of the Azores, <br/>
on Tropical Depression Joyce, located over the central Atlantic <br/>
Ocean, and on Tropical Depression Twelve, located over the eastern <br/>
tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Western Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located over the western Caribbean Sea <br/>
is producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental <br/>
conditions appear to be conducive for gradual development, and a <br/>
tropical depression could form around the middle part of this week <br/>
while the disturbance moves slowly west-northwestward.  This system <br/>
is then expected to move northwestward into the Gulf of Mexico <br/>
during the latter portion of this week.  Interests in the <br/>
northwestern Caribbean Sea and along the U.S. Gulf Coast should <br/>
monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located a few hundred miles south-southeast of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands is producing limited shower and thunderstorm <br/>
activity.  Upper-level winds are forecast to become more conducive <br/>
for gradual development of this system during the next few days, and <br/>
a tropical depression could form during the middle or latter part of <br/>
this week while it moves slowly westward or west-northwestward over <br/>
the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
Public Advisories on Tropical Depression Twelve are issued under <br/>
WMO header WTNT32 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCPAT2.<br/>

Tropical Depression Joyce Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112024
1100 PM AST Sun Sep 29 2024
 
The exposed center of Joyce is completely devoid of convection, with
only a few intermittent bursts noted in satellite imagery during the
past several hours. If the system is unable to generate and sustain
organized convection soon, it will degenerate to a post-tropical
cyclone on Monday. A partial scatterometer pass indicates that winds
over the eastern part of the circulation have diminished, and the
satellite intensity estimates have continued to fall this evening.
Based on these data and the degraded satellite presentation, Joyce
is downgraded to a 30-kt depression.
 
The storm is still moving northwestward (310/5 kt), but is forecast 
to turn northward soon toward a weakness in the subtropical ridge 
over the central Atlantic. The NHC track forecast has been adjusted 
slightly left of the previous one based on current motion trends. 
Joyce is surrounded by a dry air mass and is expected to face 
continued southwesterly shear, making it unlikely for the system to 
sustain organized deep convection going forward. Thus, the updated 
NHC forecast shows Joyce degenerating to a post-tropical remnant low 
by late Monday. However, this could occur even sooner if convection 
does not regenerate overnight. The global models agree that Joyce 
should open into a trough and dissipate by Wednesday.

Tropical Depression Twelve Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
1100 PM AST Sun Sep 29 2024
 
The depression is gradually becoming better organized while 
continuing to produce a large area of deep convection. Recent 
scatterometer winds indicate the center of the system lies on the 
northern side of the convective cloud mass, with 25-30 kt winds 
noted within the eastern semicircle of the circulation and weaker 
winds on the west side. Based on the scatterometer data, the system 
remains a 30-kt depression for this advisory.

The depression is moving westward at about 6 kt, to the south of an 
established subtropical ridge over the eastern Atlantic. This 
feature should keep the tropical cyclone on a westward to 
west-northwestward heading during the next couple of days. Then, a 
northwestward turn is forecast later this week as a deep-layer 
trough over the north-central Atlantic weakens the ridge. This 
recurvature over open waters is supported by the latest track 
guidance and global model ensembles, and the updated NHC track 
forecast is essentially an update of the previous one with no 
notable changes.

Intensification is expected due to very favorable environmental and 
oceanic conditions. The tropical cyclone will move over SSTs warmer 
than 29C during the next several days, within a moist and unstable 
environment with weak deep-layer shear. Once the system becomes more 
consolidated and establishes an inner core, its rate of 
strengthening is likely to increase. The latest NHC intensity 
forecast closely follows the HCCA and IVCN multi-model consensus 
aids, which brings the system to hurricane strength in 48 h and 
major hurricane intensity by day 5. In addition, the system is 
forecast to become a large hurricane, with an expanding wind and 
wave field as it gains latitude later in the period.

BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Isaac Advisory Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
900 AM GMT Mon Sep 30 2024
 
...ISAAC EXPECTED TO BECOME POST-TROPICAL LATER TODAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM GMT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...44.7N 31.3W
ABOUT 515 MI...825 KM NNW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 60 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...975 MB...28.80 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM GMT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Isaac was
located near latitude 44.7 North, longitude 31.3 West.  Isaac is
moving toward the east-northeast near 15 mph (24 km/h).  A turn
toward the northeast at a similar forward speed is expected on
Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Slow weakening is expected during the next several days.
Isaac is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone later today.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 975 mb (28.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac will affect the Azores over the 
next few days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening 
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your 
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM GMT.

Tropical Storm Isaac Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
900 AM GMT Mon Sep 30 2024

Isaac continues to show signs of transitioning into an extratropical 
cyclone.  The central convection has mostly dissipated, and the 
system is taking on more of a frontal appearance, with a 
zonally-oriented cloud and rain shield over the cyclone's northern 
semicircle.  The current intensity is kept at 55 kt in accordance 
with a Dvorak estimate from TAFB, although this is somewhat 
uncertain since Isaac no longer appears to be a true tropical 
cyclone.

The cyclone continues to move east-northeastward or at about 060/13 
kt within a southern branch of the mid-latitude westerlies.  Isaac 
is expected to turn toward the northeast during the next couple 
of days as it approaches a shortwave ridge just west of the 
British Isles.  The official track forecast has been nudged only 
slightly eastward in the 2-3 day time frame, towards the latest 
corrected dynamical model consensus.

Isaac is moving over cool waters and should complete its 
extratropical transition today.  The global models suggest that the 
system will gradually weaken during the next few days as it becomes 
absorbed within a larger low over the North Atlantic.  The official 
intensity forecast is similar to the previous NHC prediction.
