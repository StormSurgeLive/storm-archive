Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Sun Sep 29 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Isaac, located several hundred miles west-northwest of the Azores, <br/>
and on Tropical Storm Joyce, located over the central Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic (AL90):<br/>
An elongated area of low pressure located a few hundred miles <br/>
west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands continues to produce <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions <br/>
appear conducive for gradual development of this system, and a <br/>
tropical depression will likely form during the early or middle part <br/>
of this week while the system moves toward the west and then <br/>
northwest across the eastern and central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure is expected to form over the western <br/>
Caribbean Sea in a couple of days.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to be conducive for gradual development thereafter, and a <br/>
tropical depression could form around the middle part of this <br/>
week.  This system is expected to move northwestward into the Gulf <br/>
of Mexico during the latter portion of this week, and interests in <br/>
the northwestern Caribbean Sea and along the U.S. Gulf Coast should <br/>
monitor its progress.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Joyce was
located near latitude 21.3 North, longitude 48.1 West.  Joyce is
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general
motion with a decrease in forward speed is expected through tonight. 
A turn toward the north and north-northeast is forecast on Monday 
and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Weakening is forecast, and Joyce is expected to become a 
depression by early Monday and then a remnant low on Tuesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).

Tropical Storm Joyce Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112024
500 AM AST Sun Sep 29 2024

Strong south-southwesterly vertical wind shear, associated with an 
upper-level trough over the central subtropical Atlantic, continues 
to impact the tropical storm.  Although deep convection has been 
intermittently redeveloping near the center, the persistent shear 
is displacing this shower and thunderstorm activity to the north 
and northeast of the mostly exposed circulation center.  The 
advisory intensity estimate is held at 40 kt, in agreement with 
the most recent scatterometer data.  This is also supported 
by a blend of subjective and objective estimates.

Center fixes indicate that the motion remains about the same, 
or at around 305/8 kt.  An amplifying mid-level trough over the 
east-central Atlantic should cause Joyce to turn northward during 
the next day or so.  If Joyce maintains some vertical depth in 2-3 
days, it could accelerate north-northeastward ahead of the trough 
around that time.  The official track forecast is the same as the 
previous NHC prediction and close to the model consensus. 

Over the next couple of days, Joyce is expected to remain in an 
environment of strong southwesterly to westerly vertical wind shear 
and an increasingly dry low- to mid-level air mass.  Therefore, 
weakening is anticipated and the system will probably degenerate 
into a remnant low pressure area in 2-3 days. This is consistent 
with the global model predictions.  The official intensity forecast 
is the same as the previous one.

There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM GMT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Isaac was located
near latitude 42.6 North, longitude 36.5 West. Isaac is moving
toward the northeast near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue during the next couple of days, 
followed by a turn toward the north-northeast to north on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased near 80 mph (130 km/h) with 
higher gusts, and continued weakening is expected over the next
few days.  Isaac is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone by 
early Monday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles
(335 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 969 mb (28.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a
deep-layer trough will affect the Azores over the next few days.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM GMT.

Hurricane Isaac Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
900 AM GMT Sun Sep 29 2024
 
The strong deep-layer shear and sub-24C sea surface temperatures
continue to disrupt Isaac's cloud pattern, although recent images 
show a small burst of deep convection developing near the surface 
center.  The outer convective curve bands are diminishing and 
have dissipated in the east semicircle of the cyclone.  Based on 
the latest Dvorak satellite intensity estimates and a UW-CIMSS 
SATCON analysis, the initial intensity is set at 70 kt.
 
Decreasing oceanic surface temperatures and a sharp increase in
west-southwesterly vertical shear support further weakening as an
extratropical cyclone through day 5.  Isaac could lose what remains
of its organized deep convection later tonight and become a 
post-tropical cyclone, as suggested by the global model 
simulated/IR forecast.  In any event, extratropical transition is 
anticipated by Monday evening due to baroclinic forcing from a 
middle-latitude trough and the proximity of a frontal boundary.
 
Isaac's initial motion is estimated to be northeastward, or 045/11 
kt as it continues to be steered by the mid-latitude southwesterly 
flow.  A turn toward the north-northeast by the middle part of this 
week is forecast in response to a mid- to upper-level trough 
approaching the cyclone from the west-northwest.  Around the 72 hr 
period, Isaac should turn northward while moving around the eastern
periphery of a larger baroclinic low-pressure system.  An 
adjustment slightly to the right of the previous track advisory is  
again needed beyond the 24 hr period to conform with the latest 
consensus guidance.
