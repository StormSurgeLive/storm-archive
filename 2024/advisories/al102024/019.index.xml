Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Mon Sep 30 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Isaac, located several hundred miles north of the Azores, on <br/>
Tropical Depression Joyce, located over the central Atlantic Ocean, <br/>
and on Tropical Depression Twelve, located over the eastern <br/>
tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Western Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
A large and disorganized area of low pressure located over the <br/>
western and southwestern Caribbean Sea is producing some shower and <br/>
thunderstorm activity.  Environmental conditions could become <br/>
conducive for gradual development, and a tropical depression could <br/>
form in a few days while the system is over the southern Gulf of <br/>
Mexico or northwestern Caribbean Sea.  While interests in the <br/>
northwestern Caribbean Sea and along the U.S. Gulf Coast should <br/>
continue to monitor the progress of this system, the timetable for <br/>
potential development has shifted later toward late week or this <br/>
weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms have increased in association with a <br/>
tropical wave located a few hundred miles south of the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands.  Upper-level winds are forecast to become more conducive <br/>
for gradual development, and a tropical depression is likely to form <br/>
in a few days while it moves slowly westward over the eastern <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>

Tropical Depression Joyce Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112024
1100 AM AST Mon Sep 30 2024

Joyce continues to struggle to remain a tropical depression, having 
a fully exposed low-level center displaced to the west of pulsing 
deep convection. This displacement is a result of strong 
southwesterly vertical wind shear ahead of a central Atlantic 
upper-level trough. With no recent surface observations or 
scatterometer wind data available, 30 kt will remain the initial 
intensity, reflecting the subjective Dvorak analysis from TAFB and 
SAB.

The depression has meandered this morning, and the current motion 
estimate is an uncertain 360/2 kt. The official track forecast 
depicts a slow northward motion until Joyce fully dissipates in 48 
h, similar to the previous track forecast. 

Continued shear coupled with persistent dry air should increasingly 
inhibit organized convection, leading to Joyce degenerating into a 
remnant low soon. The intensity forecast is similar to the previous 
one showing Joyce becoming a remnant low in 12 h with total 
dissipation in about 48 h.

Tropical Depression Twelve Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
500 AM AST Mon Sep 30 2024

Tropical Depression Twelve has become better organized overnight.  A 
29/2338 UTC ASCAT-B overpass showed a large area of 25 to 30 kt 
winds, and that the center was located near the northern edge of the 
large convective mass.  Although a 30/0334 UTC AMSR2 microwave image 
showed that the center was still located near the northern edge of 
the central convective area, curved banding has been increasing 
during the night, with a large area of cold cloud tops persisting.  
Subjective Dvorak intensity estimates are a consensus T-2.0/30 kt 
from both TAFB and SAB.  Objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS 
are rising and now range from 36 to 41 kt.  Based on the subjective 
Dvorak estimates, a 30 kt initial intensity is held for this 
advisory, but the depression is likely very near tropical storm 
strength.

The estimated initial motion of the depression is westward, or 275/7 
kt.  The cyclone will continue moving westward to west-northwestward 
for another couple days while a well-established subtropical ridge 
remains in place to the north of the system.  A gradual turn to the 
northwest is expected around mid-week as a deep-layer trough over 
the north-central Atlantic weakens the ridge.  At the end of the 
forecast period, an approaching upper-level trough near Bermuda will 
induce the cyclone to turn northward over the open waters of the 
central Atlantic Ocean.  Some along-track spread is noted in the 
various track model solutions, but the models are in good agreement 
on the northward turn, with little cross-track spread.  The latest 
NHC track forecast is nearly identical to the previous one, and is 
about halfway between the slower GFS solution and the faster ECMWF 
model.

Conditions are quite favorable along the path of the depression with 
29 degree C sea-surface temperatures, a moist environment, and weak 
vertical wind shear.  Given the weak shear and the gradually 
improving structure, the cyclone should begin to steadily intensify 
soon.  The depression is forecast to become a hurricane in 36 to 48 
hours and a major hurricane in about 4 days.  The NHC intensity 
forecast is similar to the previous one, and lies between the middle 
and upper end of the intensity guidance suite, near the HCCA and 
IVCN multi-model consensus aids.  It should be noted that most of 
the models indicate that the cyclone's wind and wave field will 
expand significantly over the next several days, and the system is 
forecast to become a large and powerful hurricane as it gains 
latitude later this week.

BULLETIN
Post-Tropical Cyclone Isaac Advisory Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
300 PM GMT Mon Sep 30 2024
 
...ISAAC BECOMES A POST-TROPICAL CYCLONE...
...THIS IS THE LAST ADVISORY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM GMT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...44.8N 29.1W
ABOUT 480 MI...775 KM NNW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 65 DEGREES AT 17 MPH...28 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...983 MB...29.03 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Isaac 
was located near latitude 44.8 North, longitude 29.1 West. The 
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east-northeast near 17 
mph (28 km/h) and a turn to the northeast is expected with a similar 
forward motion for the next several days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h)
with higher gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast over the next
several days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 983 mb (29.03 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac will affect the Azores over the
next few days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Isaac Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
900 AM GMT Mon Sep 30 2024

Isaac continues to show signs of transitioning into an extratropical 
cyclone.  The central convection has mostly dissipated, and the 
system is taking on more of a frontal appearance, with a 
zonally-oriented cloud and rain shield over the cyclone's northern 
semicircle.  The current intensity is kept at 55 kt in accordance 
with a Dvorak estimate from TAFB, although this is somewhat 
uncertain since Isaac no longer appears to be a true tropical 
cyclone.

The cyclone continues to move east-northeastward or at about 060/13 
kt within a southern branch of the mid-latitude westerlies.  Isaac 
is expected to turn toward the northeast during the next couple 
of days as it approaches a shortwave ridge just west of the 
British Isles.  The official track forecast has been nudged only 
slightly eastward in the 2-3 day time frame, towards the latest 
corrected dynamical model consensus.

Isaac is moving over cool waters and should complete its 
extratropical transition today.  The global models suggest that the 
system will gradually weaken during the next few days as it becomes 
absorbed within a larger low over the North Atlantic.  The official 
intensity forecast is similar to the previous NHC prediction.
