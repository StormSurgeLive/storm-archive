Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Sun Sep 29 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Isaac, located several hundred miles northwest of the Azores, and <br/>
on Tropical Storm Joyce, located over the central Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic (AL90):<br/>
Recent satellite imagery indicates that the circulation associated <br/>
with an area of low pressure located several hundred miles west- <br/>
southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands is becoming better defined.<br/>
Environmental conditions are favorable for continued development of <br/>
this system, and a tropical depression is likely to form early this <br/>
week, possibly as soon as tonight. The low will continue to move <br/>
westward and then northwestward across the eastern and central <br/>
tropical Atlantic. Additional information on this system, including <br/>
gale warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the <br/>
National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located over the western Caribbean Sea <br/>
is producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Environmental <br/>
conditions appear to be conducive for gradual development, and a <br/>
tropical depression could form around the middle part of this week <br/>
while the disturbance meanders towards the west-northwest. This <br/>
system is then expected to move northwestward into the Gulf of <br/>
Mexico during the latter portion of this week, and interests in the <br/>
northwestern Caribbean Sea and along the U.S. Gulf Coast should <br/>
monitor its progress.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Atlantic:<br/>
A low-latitude tropical wave located near the coast of western <br/>
Africa is currently producing limited shower and thunderstorm <br/>
activity.  Upper-level winds are forecast to become more conducive <br/>
for gradual development of this system during the next several days <br/>
while it moves slowly westward or west-northwestward over the <br/>
eastern Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service<br/>
can be found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 <br/>
KWBC, and online at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php<br/>

Tropical Storm Joyce Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112024
1100 AM AST Sun Sep 29 2024
 
The center of Joyce is exposed on the southern side of a small
area of deep convection due to continued strong south-southwesterly
vertical wind shear. The most recent scatterometer data from 1230
UTC indicates at least 35 kt winds are within the circulation, and
given the known low bias of the instrument, 40 kt is chosen as the
initial intensity, closest to a blend of the TAFB T- and CI-numbers.
 
The storm has been moving more slowly this morning, estimated to be
northwestward at about 5 kt.  Joyce should turn northward on Monday
due to a deep-layer trough over the north-central Atlantic.  The
only notable change to some of the guidance this cycle is that they
generally agree Joyce or its remnants will be less vertically deep
by mid-week. This evolution should result in less northward
acceleration as the circulation decays due to persistent shear and
dry air aloft.  Thus, the new NHC forecast is a bit to the left and
slower based on the latest aids.  The intensity guidance remains in
good agreement, and the only slight intensity change from the last
advisory is to show Joyce becoming a remnant low at 48 h.

located near latitude 43.8 North, longitude 34.7 West. Isaac is
moving toward the northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h). This motion is
expected to continue for the next couple of days, followed by a
turn towards the north-northeast on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h)
with higher gusts, and continued weakening is forecast over the
next few days. Isaac is forecast to become an extratropical
cyclone on Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 973 mb (28.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and an upstream deep-layer trough
will affect the Azores over the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM GMT.

<title>Tropical Storm Isaac Forecast Discussion Number 16</title>

Tropical Storm Isaac Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
900 PM GMT Sun Sep 29 2024
 
The increasingly hostile sea surface temperatures, strong vertical
wind shear, and dry air wrapping around the southern half of Isaac
has weakened the cyclone. The last few visible stallite images
before sundown suggest that the vortex could be tilted, with the
low-level center displaced southwest of the upper-level vortex.
Additionally, deep convection has become less symmetric since the
last advisory, with convection in the southern semicircle likely
being cut off by the aformentioned dry air. This structure is
indicative of a progressing extratropical transition, as Isaac
continues to interact with a baroclinic frontal zone to its
northeast. The initial intensity is set to 60 kt for this advisory,
which is a blend of the subjective and objective satellite
classifications.
 
Tropical Storm Isaac is forecast to continue its extratropical
transition and become a fully extratropical cyclone on Monday. This
is in agreement with model-diagnosed thermodynamics that maintain a
warm core until this time, in addition to simulated IR satellite
data from the GFS and ECMWF models. The intensity forecast is
similar to the previous forecast and shows a steady decrease in
maximum sustained winds through the forecast period.
 
The forward motion of the cyclone continues to be northeastward
(050/10 kt). This general motion is forecast to continue for the
next day or so as Isaac continues to be steered by a mid-level
trough to its west. This mid-level trough will steer Isaac towards
the north-northeast beyond 36 hr. Beyond 96 hr, global model data
indicates Isaac will be absorbed by a more potent extratropical
cyclone just southeast of Iceland. The track forecast is again
adjusted eastward from the previous advisory.
