DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Helene was located
near latitude 31.2 North, longitude 83.3 West. Helene is moving
toward the north-northeast near 26 mph (42 km/h).  A turn toward the
north is expected overnight, taking the center over central and 
northern Georgia this morning.  After that, Helene is expected to 
turn northwestward and slow down over the Tennessee Valley later 
today and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near near 90 mph      
(145 km/h) with higher gusts.  Continued weakening is expected, but 
the fast forward speed will allow strong, damaging winds, 
especially in gusts, to penetrate well inland across the 
southeastern United States, including over the higher terrain of
the southern Appalachians.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (50 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310
miles (500 km), mainly to the east of the center.  A automated 
station at Grassy Pond, Georgia, just south of Valdosta, recently 
reported a wind gust of 96 mph (154 km/h).  On the Atlantic 
coast of Georgia, Savannah International Airport recently reported 
a wind gust of 75 mph (120 km/h.)
 
The minimum central pressure based on surface observations in the 
Valdosta area is 955 mb (28.20 inches).
 
A NOAA National Ocean Service tide gauge located on Cedar Key
recently reported a water level of 9.30 feet above mean higher high
water.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Helene can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a life-threatening storm surge and
the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded
by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Carrabelle, FL to Suwannee River, FL...15-20 ft
Apalachicola, FL to Carrabelle, FL...10-15 ft
Suwannee River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...10-15 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...8-12 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Apalachicola, FL...6-10 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...5-8 ft
Tampa Bay...5-8 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...4-7 ft
East of Mexico Beach, FL to Indian Pass, FL...3-5 ft
Englewood, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Charlotte Harbor...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are occurring within the hurricane
warning area.  When the eye passes over, people are reminded to not
venture out into the relative calm, as hazardous winds will increase
very quickly when the eye passes.  Tropical storm conditions are
occurring from southern Florida to southeastern Georgia, and these 
conditions will continue spreading northward across the tropical 
storm warning areas in the Southeastern U.S. through today.  
Strong, damaging winds,  especially in gusts, will likely penetrate 
as far inland as the higher terrain of the southern Appalachians.
 
RAINFALL: Over portions of the Southeastern U.S. into the Southern
Appalachians, Helene is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 6 to 12 inches, with isolated totals around 20 inches. This
rainfall will likely result in catastrophic and potentially
life-threatening flash and urban flooding, along with significant
river flooding. Numerous significant landslides are expected in
steep terrain across the southern Appalachians.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Helene, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
For a list of rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated
this storm, see the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the
WMO header ACUS44 KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.
 
TORNADOES: The risk for several tornadoes continues tonight through
this morning over parts of north/central Florida, Georgia, South 
Carolina, and southern North Carolina. The tornado risk will 
persist today across the Carolinas and southern Virginia.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Helene will affect much of Florida and
the coasts of Georgia and the Carolinas during the next couple of
days.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.

Hurricane Helene Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092024
1100 PM EDT Thu Sep 26 2024
 
The hurricane is about to make landfall in the Florida Big Bend
region.  Timely observations from Air Force and NOAA Hurricane
Hunter aircraft showed that Helene continued to strengthen rapidly
to Category 4 status before it approached the coast, with the
central pressure falling at about 3 mb per hour since this
afternoon.  Peak 700 mb flight-level winds from the aircraft were
136 kt, corresponding to an intensity of about 120 kt, which might
be a bit conservative.  Radar and satellite images show numerous
mesocyclones rotating around the eyewall.
 
The large hurricane continues moving rapidly north-northeastward
with the latest initial motion estimated to be 015/21 kt.  A
generally northward track is expected overnight, taking the center
from southern to northern Georgia through early Friday morning.
Later on Friday and Saturday, Helene should slow down considerably
while it interacts with a mid-level low to its northwest and west.
The weakening system is likely to become nearly stationary in 48-60
hours.  The official track forecast follows the dynamical model
consensus.
 
Although the system will weaken as it moves over land, the fast
forward speed of Helene during the next 12 hours or so will result
in a far inland penetration of strong winds over parts of the
southeastern United States, particularly over Georgia, including
strong gusts over the higher terrain of the southern Appalachians.
Accordingly, a higher-than-normal gust factor is indicated in the
official forecast while Helene is inland.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. A catastrophic and deadly storm surge is occurring along portions
of the Florida Big Bend coast, where inundation could reach as high
as 20 feet above ground level, along with destructive waves.  There
is also a danger of life-threatening storm surge along the remainder
of the west coast of the Florida Peninsula.
 
2. Catastrophic hurricane-force winds are occurring near the coast
within the eyewall of Helene and will spread inland over portions
of northern Florida and southern Georgia.
 
3. Damaging wind gusts will penetrate well inland over portions of
Georgia and the Carolinas tonight, particularly over the higher
terrain of the southern Appalachians. Residents in these areas
should be prepared for the possibility of long-duration power
outages.  If you use a generator after the storm, be sure it is
placed outside at least 20 feet away from doors, windows, and
garages to avoid deadly carbon monoxide poisoning.
 
4. Catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding,
including numerous significant landslides, is expected across
portions of the southern Appalachians through Friday. Considerable
to locally catastrophic flash and urban flooding is likely for
northwestern and northern Florida and the Southeast through Friday.
Widespread significant river flooding and isolated major river
flooding are likely.

500 AM AST Fri Sep 27 2024
 
...ISAAC BECOMES A HURRICANE...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...37.0N 48.5W
ABOUT 1175 MI...1895 KM W OF THE AZORES
ABOUT 980 MI...1575 KM ENE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...E OR 90 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...981 MB...28.97 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Isaac was located
near latitude 37.0 North, longitude 48.5 West. Isaac is moving
toward the east near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this motion with a
gradual turn to the east-northeast is expected over the next
several days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Additional strengthening is expected during the next day or 
so followed by gradual weakening by the end of this weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles
(110 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 981 mb (28.97 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a
deep-layer trough are affecting portions of the coast of Bermuda and
could spread into the Azores by this weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Hurricane Isaac Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Hurricane Isaac Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
500 AM AST Fri Sep 27 2024
 
Isaac has continued to become better organized since the prior 
advisory. The earlier warm spot noted on IR satellite imagery has 
persisted and warmed further, with sufficently cold -55 to -60 C 
convective cloud tops encircling the feature. A helpful AMSR2 pass 
that became available after the prior advisory also showed an eye 
feature on both the 89-GHz and 37-GHz channels, the latter showing a 
cyan ring. These features suggest that Isaac has become a hurricane, 
and the initial intensity has been raised to 65 kt for this 
advisory.
 
Isaac still is moving generally eastward this morning, estimated at
090/10 kt. This motion with a gradual turn to the east-northeast
should occur over the next couple of days as the hurricane remains
steered mostly by deep-layer flow along the northern periphery of a
mid-level ridge centered to the southeast of Isaac. Once again, how
quick this forward motion ends up being will be critical for its
ultimate track down the road, with a track bifurcation continuing
between the GFS and ECMWF solutions occuring beyond 60 h as to how
much the upstream trough located to its east is able to interact
and pick up the cyclone. Despite the spread in the guidance, the
consensus aids are not that much altered from the prior cycle, and
the NHC track forecast is quite similar to the prior advisory.
 
Additional intensification is expected while the vertical wind shear
remains only low to moderate and Isaac continues to be over
sufficently warm sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) with instability
being aided by cold upper-level temperatures. After 36 h, SSTs drop
to 24 C and lower as shear increases markedly, which should induce
a gradual weakening trend. Both the GFS and ECMWF suggest the
cyclone should lose its deep convection sometime in the 72-96 h
period, marking its transition to post-tropical in that time frame.
The NHC intensity forecast is on the high side of the guidance, but
is generally in line with the latest GFS-based SHIPS and LGEM
guidance.
