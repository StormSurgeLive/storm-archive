<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Helene, located over the eastern Gulf of Mexico and on Tropical <br/>
Storm Isaac, located over the central Subtropical Atlantic Ocean. <br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic (AL98):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure <br/>
located several hundred miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands <br/>
continue to show signs of organization. Recent satellite imagery <br/>
suggests the system does not yet have a well-defined surface <br/>
circulation. However, environmental conditions are expected to be <br/>
conducive for further development. A tropical depression is <br/>
expected to form later today or tomorrow while the disturbance <br/>
moves generally westward to west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph. The <br/>
system is then forecast to slow down and turn northward late Friday <br/>
and Saturday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Caribbean:<br/>
An area of low pressure could form over the western Caribbean by the <br/>
middle of next week. Environmental conditions are expected to be <br/>
conducive for slow development thereafter, while the system moves <br/>
generally northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Helene was located
near latitude 27.9 North, longitude 84.6 West. Helene is moving
toward the north-northeast near 23 mph (37 km/h).  A continued fast 
motion to the north-northeast is expected through landfall in the 
Florida Big Bend this evening. After landfall, Helene is expected to 
turn northwestward and slow down over the Tennessee Valley on 
Friday and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 125 mph (205 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Helene is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional strengthening is 
expected, and Helene will likely be an extremely dangerous category 
4 hurricane at landfall. Weakening is expected after Helene moves 
inland, but the fast forward speed will allow strong, damaging 
winds, especially in gusts, to penetrate well inland across the 
southeastern United States, including over the higher terrain of the
southern Appalachians.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310 miles
(500 km).  A weather station at Venice Municipal Airport recently 
reported a sustained wind of 46 mph (74 km/h) with a gust of 69 mph 
(111 km/h).  Another observation near Venice Beach reported a 
sustained wind of 51 mph (82 km/h) with a gust to 66 mph (106 
km/h). 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on data from the Air 
Force Hurricane Hunters is 951 mb (28.09 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Helene can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a life-threatening storm surge and
the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded
by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Carrabelle, FL to Suwannee River, FL...15-20 ft
Apalachicola, FL to Carrabelle, FL...10-15 ft
Suwannee River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...10-15 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...8-12 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Apalachicola, FL...6-10 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...5-8 ft
Tampa Bay...5-8 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...4-7 ft
East of Mexico Beach, FL to Indian Pass, FL...3-5 ft
Englewood, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Charlotte Harbor...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane warning 
area this evening.  Tropical storm conditions are occurring in the 
southern and central Florida, and these conditions are expected to 
spread northward across the tropical storm warning areas in the 
Southeastern U.S. through early Friday.  Strong, damaging winds, 
especially in gusts, will likely penetrate as far inland as the 
higher terrain of the southern Appalachians.
 
RAINFALL: Over portions of the Southeastern U.S. into the Southern 
Appalachians, Helene is expected to produce total rain accumulations 
of 6 to 12 inches, with isolated totals around 20 inches. This 
rainfall will likely result in catastrophic and potentially 
life-threatening flash and urban flooding, along with significant 
river flooding. Numerous significant landslides are expected in 
steep terrain across the southern Appalachians.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Hurricane Helene, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero. 

For a list of rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated
this storm, see the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the
WMO header ACUS44 KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.
 
TORNADOES: The risk for several tornadoes continues through 
tonight over much of Florida, southeast Georgia, central and 
southern South Carolina, and southern North Carolina. The tornado 
risk will continue Friday across the Carolinas and southern 
Virginia.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Helene will affect much of Florida and
the coasts of Georgia and the Carolinas during the next couple of
days.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and 
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local 
weather office.

Hurricane Helene Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092024
500 PM EDT Thu Sep 26 2024
 
Helene has rapidly intensified today while nearing landfall in the
Florida Big Bend.  Doppler radar and aircraft data indicate that the
eyewall is now completely closed and the eye has become more
circular and is clearing out.  The aircraft data also indicated 
that the inner core has contracted significantly today while the
tropical-storm-force winds have expanded.  Based on all of the data,
the initial intensity is set at 110 kt.  The latest minimum pressure
based on the aircraft data is around 951 mb. Tropical-storm-force
winds are occurring across portions of west-central and southwestern
Florida, and conditions are expected to deteriorate rapidly in the
hurricane warning area during the next several hours.  It should be
emphasized that Helene is at the upper bound of hurricanes in
terms of storm size and impacts are and will occur well away 
from the center.
 
The large hurricane is now accelerating north-northeastward, with
the latest initial motion estimated to be 025/20 kt.  This general
motion is expected to continue, taking the core of the major
hurricane to the Florida Big Bend later this evening.  After
landfall, a turn to the north over Georgia is expected late tonight
and early Friday, followed by a slowdown or a complete stall over
the Tennessee Valley late Friday and Saturday when Helene merges
with a mid- to upper-level low.
 
The hurricane has intensified by 30 kt since sunrise and given the
conducive environmental conditions and contracting inner core, it
seems likely that Helene will be at or very near category 4 strength
when it makes landfall in the Florida Big Bend this evening.
The fast forward speed when Helene moves inland will result in a
far inland penetration of strong winds over parts of the
southeastern United States, including strong gusts over the higher
terrain of the southern Appalachians.  Accordingly, a
higher-than-normal gust factor is indicated in the official forecast
while Helene is inland.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. A catastrophic and deadly storm surge will occur along portions 
of the Florida Big Bend coast, where inundation could reach as high 
as 20 feet above ground level, along with destructive waves.  If 
you live in this area and were told to evacuate by local officials, 
your opportunity to do so is almost over.  There is also a danger 
of life-threatening storm surge along the remainder of the west 
coast of the Florida Peninsula.  

2. Potentially catastrophic hurricane-force winds are expected 
within the eyewall of Helene and will spread inland over portions 
of northern Florida and southern Georgia when Helene makes landfall 
in the Florida Big Bend region this evening.  Persons in these 
areas should be prepared to take shelter in the interior portion of 
a well-built structure and remain sheltered until after hazardous 
conditions pass. You may need to remain sheltered after the storm 
due to downed trees and power lines, as well as flooding, in the 
area.

3. Damaging wind gusts will penetrate well inland over portions of 
Georgia and the Carolinas  tonight, particularly over the higher 
terrain of the southern Appalachians. Residents in these areas 
should be prepared for the possibility of long-duration power 
outages.  If you use a generator after the storm, be sure it is 
placed outside at least 20 feet away from doors, windows, and 
garages to avoid deadly carbon monoxide poisoning.

4. Catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding, 
including numerous significant landslides, is expected across 
portions of the southern Appalachians through Friday. Considerable 
to locally catastrophic flash and urban flooding is likely for 
northwestern and northern Florida and the Southeast through Friday. 
Widespread significant river flooding and isolated major river 
flooding are likely.

...ISAAC CONTINUING EASTWARD WITH NO CHANGE IN STRENGTH...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...37.5N 50.6W
ABOUT 1285 MI...2070 KM W OF THE AZORES
ABOUT 880 MI...1415 KM ENE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...E OR 80 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...995 MB...29.39 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Isaac was
located near latitude 37.5 North, longitude 50.6 West. Isaac is
moving toward the east near 10 mph (17 km/h), and a turn toward the
east-northeast is expected by the weekend. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast, and Isaac is expected reach or be near
hurricane strength by late Friday or early Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a
deep-layer trough are affecting portions of the coast of Bermuda and
could spread into the Azores by this weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Isaac Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>

Tropical Storm Isaac Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
500 PM AST Thu Sep 26 2024

Little change with the structure of Isaac has been noted this 
afternoon. Episodic bursts of deep convection have been observed 
over the western semi-circle throughout the day, but cloud tops have 
largely failed to break -60C. There remains a relative void of 
thunderstorms over the eastern half of Isaac's circulation as it 
traverses across 26C water. ASCAT passes, combined with a blend of 
subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB, plus objective 
estimates from UW-CIMSS collectively support maintaining an initial 
intensity of 45 kt for this advisory.

For the next couple of days, the track guidance is tightly clustered 
as Isaac continues on a general east to east-northeast heading, 
remaining embedded within a well established mid-latitude trough. 
Beyond Saturday, there has been a large change in the dynamic model 
suite. A vast majority of the the guidance, including the 
deterministic ECMWF and several of its ensemble members, have shown 
a rather dramatic poleward shift, similar to previous runs of the 
GFS. This is ultimately induced by a slight decrease in forward 
speed, which in turn allows Isaac to be steered by a strong closed 
mid-latitude trough digging out of eastern Canada into the north 
Atlantic. This would force Isaac to the northeast and eventually 
northward. Isaac's medium range track confidence is quite low, owing 
to lack of model consistency during the past several runs. To avoid 
making too large of a change, the forecast track after Day 3 has 
shifted to the left for this advisory. However, it falls well to the 
east of the guidance envelope and further large changes may be 
needed.

Despite the longer range track uncertainty, Isaac appears to be in 
an environment that should be generally conducive for some 
strengthening, especially during the next day or two.  After that, 
unusually cold upper-tropospheric temperatures should help sustain 
the tropical cyclone for a while, even as it moves over colder SSTs 
in the 24-25 deg C range. By the end of the forecast period, much 
colder SSTs and a dramatic increase in shear should cause Isaac to 
become post-tropical. This transition could occur more quickly than 
forecast if the system takes a more northerly turn early next week. 
No changes of note were made to the official intensity forecast, 
which still shows Isaac reaching hurricane strength during the next 
couple of days.
