Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Sat Sep 28 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Isaac, located several hundred miles west-northwest of the Azores, <br/>
and on Tropical Storm Joyce, located over the central Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic (AL90):<br/>
An elongated area of low pressure located a few hundred miles <br/>
west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands continues to produce <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions <br/>
appear conducive for gradual development of this system, and a <br/>
tropical depression will likely form during the early or middle part <br/>
of next week while the system moves toward the west and then <br/>
northwest across the eastern and central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure is expected to form over the western <br/>
Caribbean Sea in a couple of days.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to be conducive for gradual development thereafter, and a <br/>
tropical depression could form around the middle part of next week.  <br/>
This system is expected to move northwestward into the Gulf of <br/>
Mexico during the latter portion of next week, and interests in the <br/>
northwestern Caribbean Sea and along the U.S. Gulf Coast should <br/>
monitor its progress.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Joyce was
located near latitude 20.9 North, longitude 47.5 West.  Joyce is
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general 
motion with a decrease in forward speed is expected through late 
Sunday.  A turn toward the north and north-northeast is forecast on 
Monday and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast, and Joyce is expected to become a depression 
by early Monday and then a remnant low by early Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).

Tropical Storm Joyce Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112024
1100 PM AST Sat Sep 28 2024
 
Joyce's low-level center remains exposed on the southwest side of 
bursting deep convection due to moderate-to-strong 
south-southwesterly shear.  The initial intensity remains 40 kt 
based on a blend of subjective and objective intensity estimates, 
and a recent ASCAT-C pass.  Deep-layer shear is expected to continue 
affecting Joyce during the next couple of days, turning more out of 
the southwest or west, while the storm also moves through a 
relatively dry air mass.  As a result, continued gradual weakening 
is anticipated, with Joyce potentially becoming a tropical 
depression by early Monday and a remnant low by early Tuesday.  The 
NHC intensity forecast follows a blend of the HCCA 
corrected-consensus and the GFS/ECMWF global models.  The remnant 
low is forecast to degenerate into a trough by Wednesday.
 
Joyce has turned northwestward (305 deg) at 8 kt.  An amplifying 
deep-layer trough over the central Atlantic is expected to cause 
Joyce to turn northward and slow down during the next couple of 
days.  Depending on how much of Joyce is left in 2-3 days, it could 
accelerate toward the north-northeast ahead of the trough.  The NHC 
track forecast is close to the GFEX consensus aid, and it's a little 
faster than the previous prediction.

At 300 AM GMT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Isaac was located 
near latitude 42.1 North, longitude 37.6 West. Isaac is moving 
toward the northeast near 14 mph (22 km/h). A slower east-northeast 
to northeast motion is expected during the next couple of days, 
followed by a turn toward the north-northeast on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) 
with higher gusts, and continued weakening is expected over the next 
few days. Isaac is forecast to become a powerful post-tropical 
cyclone by Sunday night or early Monday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles
(335 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 972 mb (28.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a
deep-layer trough will affect the Azores over the next few days.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM GMT.

Hurricane Isaac Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
300 AM GMT Sun Sep 29 2024
 
Isaac continues to weaken tonight. Southwesterly shear and 
intrusions of drier mid-level air have eroded convection over the 
southern portion of the hurricane, and there is no longer a coherent 
eye feature in satellite images. A partial scatterometer pass shows 
a frontal zone in close proximity to the east of Isaac, signaling 
extratropical transition could begin soon. A blend of the TAFB and 
SAB Dvorak Current Intensity estimates with objective UW-CIMSS 
estimates supports lowering the intensity to 70 kt.
 
As Isaac moves deeper into the mid-latitudes, it will cross even
cooler waters and encounter increasing deep-layer shear. Thus,
continued weakening is likely, and Isaac is expected to lose
tropical characteristics soon and complete extratropical transition
by Monday while becoming entangled with a nearby frontal system. The
updated NHC forecast shows a faster rate of weakening in the near
term. The wind radii of Isaac are likely to become increasingly
asymmetric as the cyclone takes on frontal characteristics.
 
Isaac is moving northeastward at about 13 kt. This general motion
should continue for the next couple of days while Isaac remains
embedded in deep-layer southwesterly flow. The storm is forecast to
turn more north-northeastward by midweek as an upper-level trough
digs to the west of Isaac. There is more track spread in the
guidance related to this interaction, and the extratropical portion
of the NHC track forecast was adjusted slightly to the right of the
previous prediction, following the latest multi-model consensus
trends.
