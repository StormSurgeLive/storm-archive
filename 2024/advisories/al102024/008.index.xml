Tropical Storm Joyce Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112024
1100 AM AST Fri Sep 27 2024
 
Tropical Storm Joyce has formed over the central tropical Atlantic 
Ocean, becoming the tenth named storm in the basin this season.  
First-light visible satellite imagery showed low-level clouds 
moving westward, indicating the surface circulation has closed.  
Deep, organized convection has been persistent for the past day or 
so with decent outflow noted in the northern semicircle of the 
circulation.  This initial intensity is set to 35 kt, representing 
the subjective satellite estimates from both TAFB and SAB.

Joyce has a short window for potential intensification.  For the 
next day or so, deep-layer vertical wind shear should be 
moderate-to-low with warm sea surface temperatures along the 
forecast track.  Mid-level humidities around Joyce are sufficient, 
but expected to dry in the coming days.  Global models predict the 
vertical wind shear should increase and the storm will likely 
experience dry air intrusions.  The official forecast shows Joyce 
strengthening to a peak of 50 kt on Saturday, followed by gradual 
weakening through next week.  Deep convection should be stripped 
away by Tuesday and Joyce is expected to become a remnant low 
at that point before opening into a trough.  However, the GFS 
suggests this could happen even sooner.

The storm is moving northwestward at 11 kt.  A weak mid-level ridge 
centered over the eastern Atlantic Ocean is expected to steer Joyce 
generally northwestward for the next day or so, followed by a 
gradual turn to the north-northwest and north with a slowing forward 
speed.  Model guidance is in relatively good agreement about this 
evolution and the NHC track forecast follows the various simple and 
corrected consensus aids.

Helene is forecast to become extratropical later this afternoon.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface
observations is 982 mb (29.00 inches).  
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Helene can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: Water levels will continue to recede along the Florida
Gulf Coast and portions of the southeast U.S. coast throughout the
day.
 
WIND: Gusts to tropical-storm-force are still occurring in portions 
of the Appalachians and off the South Carolina coast, but they 
should subside by this evening.
 
RAINFALL: Over portions of the Central and Southern Appalachians,
Helene is expected to produce additional rainfall amounts of 3 to 6
inches leading to total rain accumulations of 6 to 12 inches, with
isolated totals around 20 inches. This rainfall will result in
catastrophic and potentially life-threatening flash and urban
flooding, along with significant and record river flooding. Numerous
significant landslides are expected in steep terrain across the
Southern Appalachians.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Helene, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall 
Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and 
the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
For a list of rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated
this storm, see the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the
WMO header ACUS44 KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html
 
TORNADOES: Tornadoes are possible today across eastern South
Carolina, central and eastern North Carolina, and southern Virginia.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Helene will affect the coasts of Georgia
and the Carolinas during the next day or so.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Helene Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092024
1100 AM EDT Fri Sep 27 2024
 
Helene has been racing northward and the low-level center is now
located over the southern Appalachians.  Strong bands of heavy rain
and very gusty winds continue off and along the South Carolina
coast.  In addition, wind gusts to around hurricane force have been
occurring this morning in portions of northeastern Georgia and the
western portions of the Carolinas, especially in areas of higher
terrain.  The initial intensity is set at 40 kt, and these sustained
winds are likely occurring off the south Carolina coast and over
the Appalachians.  The main hazard is the very heavy rainfall 
ongoing over portions of the southeastern U.S., which is 
causing historic and life-threatening flooding.
 
Helene is expected to move slower to the northwest later today and 
then stall over the Tennessee Valley tonight and through the weekend 
as it merges with a mid- to upper-level low.  This merger will also 
lead to extratropical transition, which is expected to occur later 
today.  The expected slow motion could result in significant 
flooding over the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, and over the southern 
Appalachians through the weekend.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Historic, catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban 
flooding, including numerous significant landslides, will continue 
across portions of the Southern Appalachians through this evening. 
Widespread significant river flooding is ongoing, some of which will 
be major to record breaking.
 
2. Damaging wind gusts will continue over portions of Georgia, the
Carolinas, Tennessee, and Kentucky today, particularly over the
higher terrain of the southern Appalachians.
 
3. There is a possibility of long-duration power outages in
portions of the southeast U.S.  If you use a generator after the
storm, be sure it is placed outside at least 20 feet away from
doors, windows, and garages to avoid deadly carbon monoxide
poisoning.

At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Isaac was located
near latitude 37.8 North, longitude 45.3 West. Isaac is moving
toward the east near 16 mph (26 km/h). A gradual turn to the 
east-northeast is expected with a slight decrease in forward speed 
over the next day or so. On Saturday, a gradual turn to the 
northeast is forecast and this motion should continue through 
Monday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Some slight additional strengthening is expected 
tonight or Saturday morning followed by gradual weakening through 
early next week. Isaac is expected to be a post-tropical cyclone on 
Monday. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 976 mb (28.82 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a
deep-layer trough could spread into the Azores by this weekend.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

<title>Hurricane Isaac Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Hurricane Isaac Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
1100 AM AST Fri Sep 27 2024
 
Isaac is holding steady this morning.  Geostationary satellite data 
has shown consistent periodic bursts of convection wrapping around a 
small eye.  Subjective and objective Dvorak estimates range widely 
from 35 kt to 73 kt and the initial intensity is held at 65 kt for 
this advisory, closest to the SAB classification. 

The hurricane is moving eastward at 12 kt.  Isaac is moving along 
the northern periphery of a mid-level ridge  and should gradually 
turn to the east-northeast over the next couple of days.  Models are 
more in agreement this cycle and show a more northeastward turn on 
days 4 and 5 as Isaac interacts with an upper-level trough located 
to its east.  The latest track forecast is similar to the previous 
forecast through 72 h and slightly to the north at forecast periods 
beyond.

Isaac could still strengthen further over the next day or so.  While 
the vertical wind shear is expected to be strong-to-moderate, the 
upper-level divergence is forecast to increase and sea surface 
temperature should be relatively sufficient.  Beyond a day or so, 
oceanic and environmental conditions become less conducive, which 
should begin to weaken Isaac by Saturday night or Sunday.  The 
official intensity forecast is very similar to previous advisory, 
with a peak intensity of 75 kt by Saturday and the cyclone becoming 
extratropical by early next week.  However, global models show the 
system losing its deep convection by Monday, and the official 
forecast now predicts Isaac becoming a post-tropical cyclone at that 
point.
