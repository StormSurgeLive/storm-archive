Special Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1045 PM EDT Wed Sep 25 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Special outlook issued to update information about AL99, the <br/>
system located over the Central Subtropical Atlantic. <br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Helene, located over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic (AL98):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms have become slightly better organized over <br/>
the past 24 hours in association with a broad low pressure system <br/>
along a tropical wave located several hundred miles west of the Cabo <br/>
Verde Islands.  Environmental conditions appear favorable for <br/>
gradual development of this system, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form during the next couple of days while it moves <br/>
westward to west-northwestward across the eastern and central <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (AL99): <br/>
Updated: Showers and thunderstorms continue to become better <br/>
organized with a gale-force area of low pressure located several <br/>
hundred miles to the east-northeast of Bermuda. Recently-received <br/>
satellite wind data has revealed that the low is no longer attached <br/>
to a frontal boundary and is producing a concentrated area of <br/>
tropical-storm-force winds near the center. If these trends <br/>
continue, this system is likely to become a tropical storm shortly. <br/>
The system should continue moving generally east-northeastward, <br/>
remaining over the central and eastern subtropical Atlantic. <br/>
Additional information on this system, including gale warnings, can <br/>
be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather <br/>
Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Helene was
located near latitude 23.1 North, longitude 86.6 West. Helene is
moving toward the north near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A northward or
north-northeastward motion at a faster forward speed is expected
during the next 36 hours.  On the forecast track, Helene will move
across the eastern Gulf of Mexico tonight and Thursday and cross the
Florida Big Bend coast Thursday evening.  After landfall, Helene is
expected to turn northwestward and slow down over the Tennessee
Valley on Friday and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast, and Helene is expected to be a
major hurricane when it reaches the Florida Big Bend coast Thursday
evening.  Weakening is expected after landfall, but Helene's fast
forward speed will allow strong, damaging winds, especially in
gusts, to penetrate well inland across the southeastern United
States, including over the higher terrain of the southern
Appalachians.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 345 miles
(555 km).
 
The minimum central pressure reported by Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
is 972 mb (28.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Helene can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a life-threatening storm surge and
the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded
by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Carrabelle, FL to Suwannee River, FL...15-20 ft
Apalachicola, FL to Carrabelle, FL...10-15 ft
Suwannee River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...10-15 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...8-12 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Apalachicola, FL...6-10 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...5-8 ft
Tampa Bay...5-8 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...4-7 ft
East of Mexico Beach, FL to Indian Pass, FL...3-5 ft
Englewood, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Charlotte Harbor...3-5 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the southern
coast of Pinar del Rio, Cuba, including the Isle of Youth.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3 to 5 feet above
ground level in areas of onshore winds within the warning area along
the north coast of the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the U.S. hurricane
warning area late Thursday, with tropical storm conditions
beginning Thursday morning.  Tropical storm conditions are expected
in southern Florida tonight and will spread northward across the
rest of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina through Thursday night.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the warning
area in western Cuba during the next several hours.
 
RAINFALL: Hurricane Helene is expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches over western Cuba, the Cayman Islands
and the northeast Yucatan Peninsula, with isolated totals around 12
inches. This rainfall brings a risk of considerable flooding.
 
Over portions of the Southeastern U.S. into the Southern
Appalachians, Helene is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 6 to 12 inches with isolated totals around 18 inches. This
rainfall will likely result in catastrophic and potentially
life-threatening flash and urban flooding, along with significant
river flooding. Numerous landslides are expected in steep terrain
across the southern Appalachians.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Helene, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
TORNADOES: A tornado or two may occur tonight over parts of Florida.
The risk for tornadoes will increase on Thursday, expanding
northward across Florida into parts of Georgia and South Carolina.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Helene will affect the southern coast of
Cuba and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico during the next couple of
days.  Swells will spread northward toward the west coast of Florida
and the northeastern Gulf Coast tonight and Thursday. These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Helene Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092024
1000 PM CDT Wed Sep 25 2024

Satellite images show that Helene has a well-organized appearance, 
with numerous convective banding features.  A ragged-looking eye 
feature is also apparent.  However, reports from both Air Force and 
a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigating the system suggest 
that the it lacks a well-defined inner core with a somewhat broad 
maximum wind field for now.  The central pressure has dropped a 
little to around 972 mb.  Given the slowly falling central 
pressure, the intensity is maintained at 75 kt for this advisory.  
Helene's structure and intensity will continue to be closely 
monitored by Hurricane Hunter aircraft tonight and Thursday.
 
The hurricane continues moving northward with an estimated initial
motion of 360/08 kt.  For the next couple of days, the steering
scenario for this system remains basically unchanged from the
earlier advisory.  The flow between a mid-tropospheric trough over
the east-central United States and a ridge over the western
Atlantic should result in Helene accelerating northward to
north-northeastward during the next 24 to 36 hours. This motion 
will bring the center of Helene to the northeastern Gulf of Mexico 
coast in about 24 hours.  The official track forecast through 
landfall is very similar to the previous NHC prediction and remains 
close to the corrected consensus guidance. After landfall, the 
trough to the northwest of the tropical cyclone becomes a cutoff 
low, and Helene should turn leftward as it rotates around the low.  
In 3-4 days, the system should become a shallow extratropical 
cyclone within weaker steering currents.
 
Helene should be in an atmospheric and oceanic environment over the
eastern Gulf of Mexico that will be very conducive for 
strengthening.  The system is expected to traverse the Loop Current, 
which has especially high oceanic heat content.  This, along with 
fairly low vertical wind shear and a moist mid- to lower- 
tropospheric air mass, should likely result in rapid 
intensification before landfall.  The official forecast continues
to call for the hurricane to reach category 4 status tomorrow.  It 
should be noted that the HAFS-A and HAFS-B regional hurricane models 
show even more intensification than indicated here.
  
Helene is forecast to be a large major hurricane when it reaches the
Big Bend coast of Florida.   As a result, storm surge, wind, and
rainfall impacts will extend well away from the center and outside
the forecast cone, particularly on the east side.  In addition, the
fast forward speed when Helene moves inland will result in a far
inland penetration of strong winds over parts of the southeastern
United States, including strong gusts over higher terrain of the
southern Appalachians.  A higher-than-normal gust factor is 
indicated in the official forecast while Helene is inland.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. A catastrophic and deadly storm surge is likely along portions
of the Florida Big Bend coast, where inundation could reach as high
as 20 feet above ground level, along with destructive waves.  There
is also a danger of life-threatening storm surge along the remainder
of the west coast of the Florida Peninsula.  Residents in those
areas should follow advice given by local officials and evacuate if
told to do so.
 
2. Potentially catastrophic hurricane-force winds are expected
within the eyewall of Helene when it makes landfall in the Florida
Big Bend region late Thursday.  Preparations to protect life and
property should be completed by early Thursday before tropical
storm conditions arrive.  Damaging and life-threatening
hurricane-force winds, especially in gusts, will penetrate well
inland over portions of northern Florida and southern Georgia late
Thursday and Thursday night where Hurricane Warnings are in effect.
Strong wind gusts are also likely farther north across portions of
northern Georgia and the Carolinas, particularly over the higher
terrain of the southern Appalachians.
 
3. Catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding, 
including numerous landslides, is expected across portions of the 
southern Appalachians through Friday. Considerable to locally 
catastrophic flash and urban flooding is likely for northwestern and 
northern Florida and the Southeast through Friday. Widespread minor 
to moderate river flooding and isolated major river flooding are 
likely.
 
4. Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of western
Cuba within the Tropical Storm Warning area.  Hurricane Helene will 
bring heavy rain to portions of the western Caribbean with 
potentially significant flooding across western Cuba and the 
northeastern Yucatan Peninsula into early Thursday.

BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Isaac Advisory Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 25 2024
 
...NEW TROPICAL STORM FORMS IN THE OPEN CENTRAL SUBTROPICAL
ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...37.1N 54.1W
ABOUT 1480 MI...2380 KM W OF THE AZORES
ABOUT 690 MI...1115 KM ENE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...E OR 85 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...997 MB...29.44 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Isaac was 
located near latitude 37.1 North, longitude 54.1 West. Isaac is 
moving toward the east near 12 mph (19 km/h) and a general eastward 
to east-northeastward motion at a slightly faster speed is 
anticipated over the next several days.
 
Recent satellite wind data indicates that maximum sustained winds 
are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. Some strengthening is 
forecast during the next couple of days and Isaac could be near 
hurricane intensity by the end of the week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles (350 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and a large wind fetch from a
deep-layer trough are affecting portions of the coast of Bermuda and
could spread into the Azores by this weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Tropical Storm Isaac Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 25 2024
 
The non-tropical area of low pressure we have been monitoring to the 
northeast of Bermuda over the last day or so has become 
significantly better organized today, with deep central convection 
forming and now wrapping around a small surface circulation. While 
the system had previously been attached to an occluded frontal 
boundary to its northwest, recently received scatterometer data now 
shows that the circulation has fully detached form this boundary, 
and is producing winds of 40-45 kt in a small circular area embedded 
within the organizing convection. These structural changes indicate 
the the system has undergone and has completed tropical 
transition. Thus, the system is now being designated Tropical Storm 
Isaac this advisory, and the initial intensity is set to 45 kt based 
on the earlier scatterometer data.
 
Isaac is moving just north of due east at 85/10 kt. This motion 
should continue with a gentle turn more east-northeastward over the 
next several days as the system is steered primarily by mid-level 
ridging present to its south. However, there does not appear to be a 
mid-latitude trough early on to help the storm to accelerate much 
over the next few days. The initial NHC track forecast is in good 
agreement with the simple and corrected consensus aids TCVN and 
HCCA.
 
While Isaac is traversing only marginally warm waters, it is also 
still embedded within the base of an upper-level trough which has 
reduced tropospheric stability due to colder upper-level 
temperatures. This is partially why Isaac has been able to develop 
organized deep convection this evening. The shear is not 
anticipated to increase much over the next couple of days, which 
could allow for some gradual intensification. The NHC intensity 
forecast is in good agreement the with HCCA and ECMWF forecasts and 
shows a peak intensity of 60 kt in 48 h, followed by gradual 
weakening after 72 h as sea-surface temperatures cool further and 
shear begins to increase more markedly.
