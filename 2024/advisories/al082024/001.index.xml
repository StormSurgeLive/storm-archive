Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Sun Sep 15 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gordon, located over the central tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore the Southeastern U.S. Coast (AL95):<br/>
A non-tropical low pressure area is located along a frontal <br/>
boundary a couple of hundred miles off the southeastern U.S. coast, <br/>
and is producing winds to gale force north of its center.  The low <br/>
is forecast to move northwestward or northward over the warm waters <br/>
of the Gulf Stream toward the coasts of North Carolina and South <br/>
Carolina, and it could become a subtropical or tropical storm during <br/>
the next day or so if the associated front dissipates and showers <br/>
and thunderstorms become sufficiently organized.  An Air Force <br/>
Hurricane Hunter aircraft is currently investigating the system.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of tropical or subtropical development, the low is <br/>
likely to bring gusty winds, heavy rains with the potential for <br/>
flash flooding, coastal flooding, and dangerous beach conditions to <br/>
portions of the U.S. Southeast and Mid-Atlantic coast during the <br/>
next couple of days, and interests in these areas should monitor <br/>
the system's progress.  Additional information can be found in <br/>
products issued by your local National Weather Service Forecast <br/>
Office and High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather <br/>
Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and <br/>

<title>Tropical Depression Gordon Forecast Discussion Number 18</title>

Tropical Depression Gordon Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072024
500 PM AST Sun Sep 15 2024
 
Gordon's center remains well displaced to the west of the area of 
deep convection. There recently was a convective burst near the 
center, and it remains to be seen if this is an intermittent pulse 
of convection or if the system will try to maintain convection. 
Subjective and objective Dvorak estimates have decreased between 25 
to 35 kt. Using an average of these estimates, the intensity for 
this advisory is set to 30 kt, and Gordon has weakened into a 
tropical depression.
 
The cyclone continues to move west-southwestward, with a current 
motion estimate of 260/7 kt.  Gordon is being steered by a mid-level 
ridge to to the north.  The steering flow is expected to weaken as 
the ridge to the north becomes less pronounced, which should result 
in Gordon slowing down considerably. By late in the forecast period, 
a trough develops to the west-northwest of Gordon. This is expected 
to cause the tropical cyclone to turn toward the north-northeast.  
The official track forecast is similar to the previous one, nudged 
slightly to the right and a little faster towards the end of the 
period near the HFIP corrected consensus.
 
Gordon continues to experience strong westerly vertical wind shear 
and is within fairly stable airmass. It still remains possible that 
the the system could degenerate into a remnant low, as it struggles 
to produce convection. The environmental conditions improve towards 
the end of the forecast period that depicts that the system could 
re-strengthen. The current intensity forecast is similar to the 
previous forecast but does show Gordon becoming a tropical storm 
again towards the end of the period, if it can survive the next few 
days.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the disturbance was centered near latitude 
32.0 North, longitude 78.0 West. The disturbance is moving toward 
the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h) and this general motion is 
expected to continue through Monday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of the system should reach the coast within the warning area 
on Monday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is possible before the system makes landfall.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning 
area beginning late tonight.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and 
the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded 
by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could 
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated 
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

South Santee River, SC to Oregon Inlet, NC... 1-3 ft
Neuse and Bay Rivers, NC... 1-3 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers, NC... 1-3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to 
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be 
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding 
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and 
can vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to 
your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather 
Service forecast office.

For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge 
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak 
Storm Surge Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?peakSurge.
  
RAINFALL: Through Wednesday, Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight will
bring 3 to 6 inches of rainfall with isolated totals near 8 inches
across northern and northeast portions of South Carolina along with
the North Carolina Coastal Plain. Across the rest of North Carolina
and much of Virginia, the potential tropical cyclone will bring 2 to
4 inches of rain, with isolated totals near 6 inches. This rainfall
could lead to isolated to scattered flash and urban flooding and
minor river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?ero
 
TORNADOES: A couple of tornadoes may occur Monday across eastern
North Carolina and vicinity.
 
SURF: Swells are forecast to affect portions of the coast of the 
southeastern United States during the next couple of days. These 
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight Forecast Discussion Number 1</title>

Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082024
500 PM EDT Sun Sep 15 2024

Reports from an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that 
the non-tropical low pressure system off the South Carolina coast 
has a broad low-level circulation center, but could be in the 
process of reforming closer to the mid-level circulation currently 
seen on radar from Wilmington, NC.  However, the system may not have 
yet completely shed its frontal characteristics. Since there is deep 
convection over and around the center, it is becoming more
likely the cyclone could become either a tropical or subtropical 
cyclone within the next day or so. Therefore the disturbance is 
being designated as Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight at this time 
with an initial intensity of 40 kt. 

There has been significant uncertainty in the center positions since 
last night, and the best guess at initial motion is northwestward or 
320/6 kt.  Over the next couple of days, the disturbance is expected 
to be steered by the flow on the southern or southwestern side of a 
mid-level high pressure system over the northeastern United States. 
This motion should bring the center inland over the southeastern 
U.S. coast in 24 hours or so.  The NHC forecast track is close to 
the simple and corrected dynamical consensus model solutions.

the system will be traversing warm waters for the next 24 hours or 
so and it may be situated within an area of relatively low shear 
near the axis of an upper-level trough.  Therefore some 
strengthening is possible before landfall, and the official forecast 
is similar to the latest decay-SHIPS model guidance.

Key Messages:

1. An area of low pressure off the southeastern U.S. coast is 
expected to bring impacts from tropical-storm-force winds, heavy 
rain, coastal flooding, and high surf to portions of the southeast 
United States coast beginning tonight and continuing during the next 
couple of days.  

2. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the 
coasts of South Carolina and North Carolina within the Tropical 
Storm Warning area beginning tonight through tomorrow night. 

3. The system will bring the potential for scattered flash and urban 
flooding and minor river flooding across eastern North Carolina and 
northeast South Carolina from tonight into early Tuesday. There is 
also a risk of isolated flash and urban flooding across much of the 
Mid-Atlantic region through Wednesday.
