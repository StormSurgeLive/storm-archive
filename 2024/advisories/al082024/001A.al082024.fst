HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight can be found in 
the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO 
header WTNT43 KNHC.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area beginning late tonight.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will 
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising 
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the 
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if 
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

South Santee River, SC to Oregon Inlet, NC... 1-3 ft
Neuse and Bay Rivers, NC... 1-3 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers, NC... 1-3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to
your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.

For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?peakSurge.

RAINFALL: Through Wednesday, Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight will
bring 3 to 6 inches of rainfall with isolated totals near 8 inches
across northern and northeast portions of South Carolina along with
the North Carolina Coastal Plain. Across the rest of North Carolina
and much of Virginia, the Potential Tropical Cyclone will bring 2 to
4 inches of rain, with isolated totals near 6 inches. This rainfall
could lead to isolated to scattered flash and urban flooding and
minor river flooding.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?ero

TORNADOES: A couple of tornadoes may occur Monday across eastern 
North Carolina and the vicinity.

SURF: Swells are forecast to affect portions of the coast of the
southeastern United States during the next couple of days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
