Tropical Depression Gordon Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072024
500 AM AST Mon Sep 16 2024

The convection that developed during the evening hours on the east 
side of Gordon has persisted through the night.  Nighttime CIRA 
proxy vis imagery suggests that the low-level center of Gordon is 
near the western edge of this convection.  Subjective and objective 
intensity estimates range from 25 to 33 kt.  In the absence of 
ASCAT data, no change is made to the 25-kt intensity carried in 
the previous NHC advisory.

The initial motion is estimated to be westward, or 270/7 kt. 
Gordon is being steered westward by the subtropical ridge, situated 
to the north of the tropical depression.  This setup should 
continue to steer Gordon slowly westward through today.  
Thereafter, a frontal low located to the north of the ridge is 
forecast to drop equatorward towards Gordon, creating a weakness 
in the subtropical ridge.  As a result of this steering change, 
Gordon should initially slow its forward motion, and then turn 
toward the north-northeast while gradually accelerating.  The 
consensus track models have continued to shift a bit to the right 
and faster, and the latest NHC forecast is again nudged in that 
direction.

Gordon has been doing a remarkable job fighting off environmental 
dry air given how the area of convection has maintained itself 
overnight relatively close to the low-level center.  Gordon is 
forecast to remain in a dry mid-level environment for the next few 
days, although some slight moistening of the environment is 
possible beyond 24 h while the vertical shear is forecast to remain 
relatively low.  Although it is still possible that Gordon could 
degenerate to a remnant low, if the cyclone is able to survive the 
next 24 h, then its chances of surviving the next 5 days would seem 
to increase.  There is also some uncertainty as to how Gordon's 
circulation could potentially interact with a non-tropical low in 3 
to 4 days.  If Gordon then survives its interaction with the 
non-tropical low, some strengthening would be possible in 4 to 5 
days as shown by some of the global models.  No changes were made to 
the previous NHC intensity prediction, which still assumes Gordon 
will survive in the short term.

* Edisto Beach, South Carolina northward to Ocracoke Inlet, North
Carolina
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within the
next 12 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the disturbance was centered near latitude 
32.7 North, longitude 78.2 West. The system is moving toward the 
northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h). A faster motion toward the northwest 
or north-northwest is expected today and Tuesday, followed by a 
gradual turn toward the north by Wednesday. On the forecast track, 
the low will reach the coast of South Carolina this afternoon and 
then move inland across the Carolinas tonight through Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Little change in strength is expected before the system reaches the 
coast, and the low still has a chance of becoming a tropical or 
subtropical storm. Weakening is forecast after the system moves 
inland, and it is likely to dissipate over the Carolinas by late 
Wednesday.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km) 
from the center. Doppler radar data and surface observations 
indicate strong winds are nearing the coast and will spread onshore 
during the next few hours. NOAA buoy 41013 at Frying Pan Shoals, 
North Carolina recently reported a sustained wind of 47 mph (76 
km/h) and a gust of 56 mph (91 km/h). NOAA buoy 41037 offshore of 
Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina recently reported a sustained 
wind of 38 mph (61 km/h) and a gust of 54 mph (87 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight can be found in
the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO
header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area through late this afternoon or evening.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
South Santee River, SC to Oregon Inlet, NC... 1-3 ft
Neuse and Bay Rivers, NC... 1-3 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers, NC... 1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to
your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight will bring 4 to 8 inches
of rainfall, with isolated totals near 10 inches, across portions of
northeast South Carolina into southeast North Carolina today into
tonight. Across the remainder of North Carolina, 2 to 4 inches of
rainfall, with isolated totals near 6 inches, are expected through
Tuesday. Over much of Virginia, 1 to 3 inches of rainfall, with
locally higher amounts, are expected tonight through Wednesday.
This rainfall could lead to a risk of flash and urban flooding and
minor river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?ero.
 
TORNADOES:  A couple of tornadoes may occur through this evening
across the eastern Carolinas.
 
SURF: Swells are forecast to affect portions of the coast of the
southeastern United States during the next couple of days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082024
500 AM EDT Mon Sep 16 2024
 
The structure of the area of low pressure off the coast of South
Carolina has seemingly become less organized during the past few
hours.  Proxy-visible satellite imagery indicates that the
low-level circulation is elongated from northeast to southwest, and
the center has not become well defined.  The associated deep
convection has a generally linear orientation and has been
displaced farther to the north and east of the center due to strong
upper-level winds.  Lastly, an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter
aircraft still measured a 2-3 degree Celsius temperature difference
at 850 mb from north to south, indicating that the frontal boundary
is diffuse but not totally gone.  Therefore, the low is still not a
tropical or subtropical cyclone.  That said, the plane measured a 
peak wind of 54 kt at 6000 ft in the convection well northeast of 
the center, suggesting that the current intensity is about 45 kt.
 
The low is drifting northwestward (325 degrees) at 3 kt, gradually
approaching the South Carolina coast.  A faster motion toward the
northwest is expected to occur today as the low moves between
mid-level high pressure over the northeastern U.S. and a trough
over the southeastern U.S.  The NHC track forecast shows the low 
crossing the coast later this afternoon, which is shown by most of 
the track models.  The GFS remains the notable outlier since it 
initialized the low too far to the northwest and consequently has 
it crossing the coast around sunrise.  After moving inland, the low 
is expected to continue moving slowly northwestward and then 
northward over the Carolinas through Wednesday.  The new track 
forecast has been nudged westward from the previous forecast, 
although there is a modest amount of uncertainty given the 
ill-defined nature of the center.
 
The chances of the system becoming a tropical or subtropical
cyclone may be starting to decrease given the current structure, and
since it only has another 12 hours or so before moving inland.  
Most of the intensity guidance also suggests that the maximum winds 
should gradually decrease as the low approaches the coast, although 
tropical-storm-force winds are still expected to occur within the 
warning areas today.  Further weakening is forecast after the 
system moves inland, and it will likely dissipate over the Carolinas 
by late Wednesday.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
coasts of South Carolina and North Carolina within the Tropical
Storm Warning area through this evening.
 
2. The system will bring the potential for locally considerable 
flash and urban flooding and minor river flooding across southeast 
North Carolina and northeast South Carolina through tonight.  There 
is also a risk of isolated flash and urban flooding across much of 
the Mid-Atlantic region through Wednesday.

3. Coastal flooding and high surf are likely along portions of 
the southeastern U.S. coast over the next day or two.
