<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Carlotta, located several hundred miles west-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula and on newly formed <br/>
Tropical Storm Daniel, located more than one thousand miles to the <br/>
west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California <br/>
peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico (EP96):<br/>
A large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms located a few <br/>
hundred miles south of southern Mexico continues to be associated <br/>
with a broad area of low pressure.  Environmental conditions appear <br/>
generally conducive for gradual development, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form by early next week while the system <br/>
moves westward to west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph, staying well <br/>
offshore of the coast of Mexico. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Carlotta Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
200 PM PDT Sat Aug 03 2024

Carlotta appears to have peaked in intensity earlier today, as the 
core convection on the west side has eroded a bit this afternoon, 
leading to a slightly less symmetric structure. A pair of recent 
ASCAT passes indicate that the low-level wind structure is fairly 
symmetric, with winds over 50 kt in all quadrants. The latest 
subjective CI numbers from TAFB and SAB are T-4.5/77 kt and the 
objective CIMSS intensity estimates range from 64 to 87 kt. The 
initial intensity has been nudged down to 75 kt based on a blend of 
the data and the slightly degraded structure noted on satellite 
imagery.

Carlotta has been moving more westward and a bit slower, about 
275/9-kt. A deep-layer ridge to the north of Carlotta will keep the 
cyclone moving on a westward to west-northwestward course at a 
slightly slower forward speed during the next few days. After that 
time, Carlotta is expected to become more vertically shallow, which 
should ultimately cause the cyclone to turn back westward towards 
the end of the forecast period. Very little change has been made to 
the previous NHC forecast.

Carlotta will be crossing the 26C SST isotherm by this evening. 
Beyond 24 hours, the wind shear is forecast to increase as the 
cyclone moves into a more stable environment. Only slow weakening 
is forecast during the next 24 hours, with more steady weakening 
after that time. Carlotta is forecast to become a remnant low on 
Tuesday, as both the GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite imageries 
show the cyclone losing its convection by that time. The remnant 
low should then dissipate later in the week. The NHC intensity 
forecast is in good agreement with the intensity consensus aids.

Tropical Storm Daniel Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042024
200 PM PDT Sat Aug 03 2024
 
Since this morning, Daniel continues to be a sheared tropical 
cyclone, with the deepest central convection remaining displaced to 
the west of the low-level center, which is now mostly exposed. This 
structure was also captured in a GMI microwave pass at 1712 UTC 
which showed the low-level center on the 37 GHz channel with the 
deeper convection displaced to the southwest. Subjective Dvorak Data 
T-numbers are both 2.0/30 kt from SAB and TAFB, but given the 
earlier scatterometer data, the intensity will remain 35 kt this 
advisory.
 
Daniel has been moving very slowly today and may have reformed a bit 
westward from last night, with the current motion estimated as a 
northward drift at 360/2 kt. As previously discussed, the primary 
steering mechanism the next several days is large-scale monsoonal 
southwesterly flow that the cyclone is expected to remain embedded 
in. This flow should begin to cause Daniel to move northeastward 
within the next 12 to 24 h. After 48 h, the influence of Carlotta's 
outer circulation should cause the weaker Daniel to turn more 
northward or north-northwestward before it becomes a remnant low or 
is absorbed by the stronger storm. There was not a whole lot of 
change in the track guidance for this cycle other than in the very 
short-term due to the more westward initial position, and the NHC 
track forecast is very close to the prior forecast, blending the 
HCCA and TCVE consensus aids.
 
There is also not much change in the intensity reasoning for Daniel. 
Moderate northeasterly shear and a dry mid-level air environment 
will probably prevent much robust strengthening despite the warm 29 
C sea-surface temperatures, and only a modest increase in winds are 
forecast over the next 24 to 36 h. Thereafter, Daniel's circulation 
is forecast to begin interacting with Carlotta to the north, and 
will likely start to gradually weaken. Both the GFS and ECMWF 
suggest the circulation will stop producing organized convection by 
72 h, just before the system opens up into a trough. The intensity 
forecast remains in good agreement with the HCCA and SHIPS guidance.
