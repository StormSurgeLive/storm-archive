<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Carlotta, located several hundred miles west-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula and on Tropical Storm <br/>
Daniel, located more than one thousand miles to the west-southwest <br/>
of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico (EP96):<br/>
A large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms located a few <br/>
hundred miles south of southern Mexico continues to be associated <br/>
with a broad area of low pressure.  Environmental conditions appear <br/>
conducive for gradual development, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form by early next week while the system moves westward to <br/>
west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph, staying well offshore of the <br/>
coast of Mexico. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Well South of the Baja California Peninsula:<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms located several hundred miles <br/>
south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula <br/>
are associated with another broad area of low pressure that has <br/>
formed.  Some development is possible during the next day or two <br/>
before the system interacts with the disturbance (EP96) to its <br/>
southeast.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

<title>Hurricane Carlotta Forecast Discussion Number 15</title>

Hurricane Carlotta Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
800 PM PDT Sat Aug 03 2024

The structure of Carlotta on conventional geostationary satellite 
imagery has been gradually becoming less impressive.  Although the 
latest subjective CI numbers are still around 77 kt, the latest 
CIMSS objective intensity estimates have fallen to the 65-72 kt 
range.  Based on these data, the initial intensity is set to 70 kt.

Carlotta is moving toward the west-northwest, or 285/9 kt.  A 
deep-layer ridge to the north of Carlotta will keep the cyclone 
moving on a west-northwestward course at a similar forward speed 
during the next couple of days.  After that time, Carlotta is 
expected to become more vertically shallow, which should ultimately 
cause the cyclone to turn westward within the low-level steering 
flow.  The new NHC track forecast is essentially unchanged from the 
previous forecast, and lies near the middle of the guidance 
envelope.
 
Carlotta has crossed the 26C SST isotherm this evening and is 
forecast to reach SSTs colder than 24C within the next 24 h.  The 
cyclone is currently in a low-shear environment, but southwesterly 
shear is forecast to become much stronger in about 24 h.  Carlotta 
will also be reaching a more stable environment by Sunday morning.  
The combination of these factors will cause continued weakening.  
Carlotta is forecast to become a remnant low on Tuesday morning, as 
both the GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite imagery show the cyclone 
losing its convection by that time. The remnant low should then 
dissipate later in the week. The NHC intensity forecast is in good 
agreement with the intensity consensus aids and is nearly identical 
to the previous NHC forecast.

Tropical Storm Daniel Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042024
200 PM PDT Sat Aug 03 2024
 
Since this morning, Daniel continues to be a sheared tropical 
cyclone, with the deepest central convection remaining displaced to 
the west of the low-level center, which is now mostly exposed. This 
structure was also captured in a GMI microwave pass at 1712 UTC 
which showed the low-level center on the 37 GHz channel with the 
deeper convection displaced to the southwest. Subjective Dvorak Data 
T-numbers are both 2.0/30 kt from SAB and TAFB, but given the 
earlier scatterometer data, the intensity will remain 35 kt this 
advisory.
 
Daniel has been moving very slowly today and may have reformed a bit 
westward from last night, with the current motion estimated as a 
northward drift at 360/2 kt. As previously discussed, the primary 
steering mechanism the next several days is large-scale monsoonal 
southwesterly flow that the cyclone is expected to remain embedded 
in. This flow should begin to cause Daniel to move northeastward 
within the next 12 to 24 h. After 48 h, the influence of Carlotta's 
outer circulation should cause the weaker Daniel to turn more 
northward or north-northwestward before it becomes a remnant low or 
is absorbed by the stronger storm. There was not a whole lot of 
change in the track guidance for this cycle other than in the very 
short-term due to the more westward initial position, and the NHC 
track forecast is very close to the prior forecast, blending the 
HCCA and TCVE consensus aids.
 
There is also not much change in the intensity reasoning for Daniel. 
Moderate northeasterly shear and a dry mid-level air environment 
will probably prevent much robust strengthening despite the warm 29 
C sea-surface temperatures, and only a modest increase in winds are 
forecast over the next 24 to 36 h. Thereafter, Daniel's circulation 
is forecast to begin interacting with Carlotta to the north, and 
will likely start to gradually weaken. Both the GFS and ECMWF 
suggest the circulation will stop producing organized convection by 
72 h, just before the system opens up into a trough. The intensity 
forecast remains in good agreement with the HCCA and SHIPS guidance.
