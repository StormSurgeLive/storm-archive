There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fabio was
located near latitude 15.6 North, longitude 108.1 West. Fabio is
moving toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h)  and this motion 
is expected to continue with a faster forward speed through 
tonight. A turn toward the west-northwest is expected on Tuesday, 
followed by a turn toward the west on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is expected this afternoon and tonight. After 
that, Fabio is expected to weaken, and the system is expected to be 
absorbed by Tropical Storm Emilia Wednesday or Wednesday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.

Tropical Storm Fabio Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
800 AM MST Mon Aug 05 2024
 
Satellite imagery this morning indicates that the disturbance 
located well southwest of the southwestern coast of Mexico has 
continued to become better organized, and that it now has sufficient 
convection and a well-enough defined circulation to be considered a 
tropical cyclone.  With an initial intensity of 35 kt based on 
earlier scatterometer data, advisories are being initiated on 
Tropical Storm Fabio.

The initial motion is a somewhat uncertain 310/10.  Fabio's motion 
should be dominated by interaction with Tropical Storm Emilia to 
the west, with Fabio expected to move northwestward and westward at 
an increased forward speed around the north side of Emilia through 
the next 48 h.  

The intensity forecast is based on the global model forecasts 
that Fabio will wind up being absorbed into Emilia in the not 
too distant future.  Some strengthening is expected during the next 
12-24 h.  After that, the global models are forecasting that Fabio 
will dissipate as it is absorbed into Emilia by the 60 h point.  
The intensity forecast and dissipation time lean toward the GFS and 
Canadian model solutions, which keep Fabio separate from Emilia 
through about 48 h.  This forecast is low confidence due to the 
possibility that Fabio could try to absorb Emilia.

Tropical Storm Carlotta Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024

If not for a recent small burst of convection nearly 60 n mi from 
its center, Carlotta would be devoid of organized deep convection. 
The intensity estimate remains 40 kt, close to a recent UW-CIMSS 
SATCON estimate. Deep convection may persist today, but could cease 
at just about any time due to cold waters beneath Carlotta and a 
surounding dry and stable environment. By this time tomorrow, 
Carlotta should be a post-tropical cyclone.

Carlotta's initial motion remains 280/8kt. This general motion 
should continue today as long as Carlotta maintains some deep 
convection. A slight left turn toward the west-southwest should 
begin once the last of Carlotta's convection is gone. No significant 
changes were made to the NHC track or intensity forecasts.

Tropical Depression Daniel Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042024
200 PM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024
 
A recent ASCAT-B pass over Daniel this afternoon revealed that
Daniel barely has a closed circulation and its maximum winds
have decreased to 30 kt, making Daniel a tropical depression.
Daniel's convective organization is also lacking, but it has
produced persistent deep convection over its center for the past
several hours.
 
Little change was made to the NHC forecast. Daniel should 
weaken and wrap cyclonically around the larger and more robust 
circulation of Carlotta during the next couple of days. Global 
models indicate that Daniel could open into a trough at any time, 
Even if it maintains its circulation, its unlikely to maintain its 
organized deep convection beyond tonight. Therefore the largest 
change in the NHC forecast is to show Daniel becoming a remnant low 
tonight or early tomorrow and dissipating soon after that.

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
200 PM MST Mon Aug 05 2024
 
Satellite imagery shows that Emilia remains a sheared cyclone this
afternoon, with the low-level center still located near the
northeastern edge of a large convective mass with cloud tops to
near -80C.  A recent ASCAT overpass showed winds of 40+ kt in the
southern semicircle, while the various subjective and objective
satellite intensity estimates remain in the 35-40 kt range.  Based
on the scatterometer data, the initial intensity is increased to  
45 kt.  The initial wind radii were adjusted based on the ASCAT 
data.
 
The latest global model runs continue to forecast that Emilia will
be the survivor in its interaction with the Tropical Storm Fabio to
the east, and the intensity forecast is based on this scenario and
the expectation of continued moderate easterly shear. The forecast
follows the trend of the intensity guidance and now forecasts a
peak intensity of 55 kt in 36 h.  After that time, although the
shear is forecast to decrease, Emilia is expected to slowly weaken
as it moves over decreasing sea surface temperatures.  The new
forecast is again an update of the previous forecast.  Confidence
in this forecast is increasing due to the more consistent model
guidance that Emilia will absorb Fabio and not the other way around.
 
The interaction with Fabio should steer Emilia southward for the
next 12 h or so.  After that, a turn toward the northwest or
north-northwest with an increase in forward speed is expected as
Emilia starts to absorb Fabio.  After Fabio dissipates in about 48
h, Emilia should generally move west-northwestward on the south
side of a low- to mid-level ridge to the north, with this general
motion expected for the remainder of the forecast period.  The new
forecast track has only minor changes from the previous track.
