Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 PM PDT Sat Aug 3 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Carlotta, located several hundred miles to the west-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula, and on Tropical Storm <br/>
Daniel, located more than one thousand miles to the west-southwest <br/>
of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
South of Southwestern Mexico (EP96):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located a few hundred miles south of <br/>
southwestern Mexico continues to produce a large area of <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Environmental conditions <br/>
appear conducive for gradual development, and a tropical depression <br/>
is likely to form during the next couple of days while the system <br/>
moves generally west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph, remaining well <br/>
offshore of the coast of Mexico. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Well South-Southwest of the Baja California Peninsula (EP97):<br/>
Satellite-derived wind data indicate an area of low pressure located <br/>
several hundred miles to the south-southwest of the southern tip of <br/>
the Baja California peninsula is gradually becoming better defined. <br/>
Although its shower and thunderstorm activity remains disorganized, <br/>
environmental conditions appear conducive for some development, and <br/>
a tropical depression could form during the next couple of days <br/>
while the system meanders within weak steering currents. Thereafter, <br/>
the system is forecast to interact with the disturbance (EP96) to <br/>
its southeast, which should limit further development.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
Public Advisories on Tropical Storm Daniel are issued under      <br/>

<title>Tropical Storm Carlotta Forecast Discussion Number 16</title>

Tropical Storm Carlotta Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
200 AM PDT Sun Aug 04 2024

Carlotta has continued to weaken overnight. Central deep convection 
has collapsed, and the low-level center appears to be at least 
partially exposed in proxy-visible satellite images. As a result, 
the satellite-based intensity estimates have decreased. The initial 
intensity is lowered to 60 kt for this advisory, which makes 
Carlotta a tropical storm.

The storm is expected to move over progressively cooler SSTs over 
the next few days while encountering stronger deep-layer shear in a 
drier, more stable environment. Therefore, steady weakening is 
forecast, and Carlotta is likely to lose organized convection and 
become a post-tropical remnant low on Tuesday. After that, the 
shallow cyclone should spin down and dissipate around midweek.

Carlotta continues to move west-northwestward at around 10 kt while 
being steered by a deep-layer ridge centered to its north and east. 
This general motion is expected to continue during the next day or 
two. As the system weakens, the shallow vortex should move westward 
within the low-level steering currents. There are no significant 
changes to the latest NHC track prediction.

Tropical Storm Daniel Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042024
800 PM PDT Sat Aug 03 2024
 
Deep convection associated with Daniel continues to pulse this 
evening.  The convection is not well organized in bands, but it has 
recently moved closer to the low-level center. Subjective Dvorak 
current intensity numbers from TAFB and SAB remain T2.0 or 30 kt, 
but the initial intensity is once again held at 35 kt in deference 
to the earlier scatterometer data and the fact that there has been 
little overall change in organization. 

The intensity forecast reasoning remains the same as before.  
Moderate northeasterly shear and dry mid-level air is likely to 
prevent significant strengthening overnight.  On Sunday, the shear 
is forecast to relax some which could allow the cyclone to 
strengthen slightly while it traverses warm sea surface 
temperatures. By 48 hours, Daniel is likely to weaken as it moves 
over cooler waters and reaches a more stable environment. The 
cyclone is likely to cease producing organized deep convection in 
about 60 hours, and it is forecast to become a remnant low around 
that time. 

Daniel has moved very little since the previous advisory, but a slow 
northward motion is expected to begin shortly.  The cyclone should 
start moving faster toward the northeast on Sunday as southwesterly 
low to mid-level flow around Hurricane Carlotta increases.  After 48 
h, the influence of Carlotta's outer circulation should cause the 
weaker Daniel to turn more northward or north-northwestward before 
it becomes a remnant low. The updated NHC track forecast is similar 
to the previous advisory through 36-48 hours, and it adjusted 
slightly westward thereafter to be closer to the latest consensus 
aids.
