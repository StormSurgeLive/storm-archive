Special Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1155 AM PDT Fri Aug 2 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Special outlook issued to update discussion of the area of low <br/>
pressure in the Western part of the East Pacific (EP95). <br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
upgraded Hurricane Carlotta, located several hundred miles southwest <br/>
of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Western East Pacific (EP95):<br/>
Updated: Recent satellite-derived wind data indicate that the low <br/>
pressure located well to the west-southwest of the southern tip of <br/>
the Baja California peninsula has a well-defined circulation and is <br/>
producing winds up to 35 mph. Despite marginal environmental <br/>
conditions, any improvement in the current convective organization <br/>
could result formation of a tropical depression over the next day or <br/>
two as the low meanders over open waters, then begins to move <br/>
northeastward by late this weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico (EP96):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure forming a few hundred miles to the <br/>
south of southern Mexico is producing a large area of disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms. Environmental conditions appear conducive <br/>
for additional development and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form by late this weekend or early next week while the system moves <br/>
westward to west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph, staying well <br/>
offshore of the coast of Mexico. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM PDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Carlotta was 
located near latitude 18.7 North, longitude 116.4 West. Carlotta is 
moving toward the west near 14 mph (22 km/h) and a general westward 
to west-northwestward motion with a gradual slowdown is forecasted 
over the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast during the 
next day or so, followed by weakening beginning by early next week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the

(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 981 mb (28.97 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Carlotta are affecting the coasts of
west-central mainland Mexico and the southern Baja California

<title>Hurricane Carlotta Forecast Discussion Number 10</title>

Hurricane Carlotta Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
200 PM PDT Fri Aug 02 2024

While Carlotta remains a small hurricane, its structure appears 
rather healthy, with a distinct central dense overcast and a clouded 
over eye appearing on visible or infrared imagery. There was also a 
GPM microwave pass at 1623 UTC which showed a well-organized 
inner-core with a small eyewall. The latest TAFB Dvorak intensity 
estimate was T4.5/77-kt, and objective estimates range from 65-82 
kt, so the initial intensity was nudged up to 75 kt for this 
advisory. The 34- and 50-kt wind radii were adjusted some thanks to 
a helpful afternoon scatterometer pass. 

Carlotta is moving a little more westward this afternoon, estimated 
at 280/12 kt. There has not been much change to the track forecast 
philosophy, with well-established ridging poleward of Carlotta 
expected to maintain this westward to west-northwestward heading 
over the next several days, albeit with a gradual slowdown. By the 
end of the forecast as Carlotta loses its deep convection, it will 
turn westward as it primarily becomes steered by the low-level flow. 
The track guidance was little changed from the previous cycle, and 
the NHC track forecast is quite similar to the previous advisory. 

The hurricane has another 24 hours over sufficently warm waters and 
light to moderate vertical wind shear to intensify a bit more, and 
the NHC intensity forecast maintains a peak intensity at 85 kt, or 
Category 2 intensity. However, Carlotta then moves over less than 26 
C sea surface temperatures beyond that time frame, and this coupled 
with the hurricane moving into increasingly dry and stable air, 
should induce gradual weakening. This process will also be hastened 
by increasing southwesterly shear beyond 60 h, and Carlotta will 
likely lose convective organization sometime in the days 4 or 5 
time-frame, marking its transition to a post-tropical cyclone. The 
NHC intensity forecast is in pretty good agreement with the 
consensus intensity aids, and is a little lower after 24 hours than 
the prior NHC intensity forecast.
