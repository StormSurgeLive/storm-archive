Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 PM PDT Fri Aug 2 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Carlotta, located several hundred miles west-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Western East Pacific (EP95):<br/>
A low pressure system located well to the west-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula has changed little <br/>
in organization since earlier today. Despite marginal environmental <br/>
conditions, a tropical depression could form over the next day or so <br/>
as the low meanders.  By late this weekend, environmental conditions <br/>
are expected to become increasingly unfavorable for development as <br/>
the system moves northeastward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico (EP96):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure forming a few hundred miles to the <br/>
south of southern Mexico is producing a large area of disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms. Environmental conditions appear conducive <br/>
for additional development, and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form by late this weekend or early next week while the system moves <br/>
westward to west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph, staying well <br/>
offshore of the coast of Mexico. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

<title>Hurricane Carlotta Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Hurricane Carlotta Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
800 PM PDT Fri Aug 02 2024
 
Carlotta has changed little in structure this evening.  Infrared 
geostationary satellite imagery continues to show hints of a clouded 
eye embedded in a central dense overcast with upper-level outflow 
present in all quadrants.  Subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and 
SAB were T4.5/77-kt and objective estimates range between 71-82 kt.  
The initial intensity for this advisory is held at 75 kt in the 
middle of these estimates.
 
The hurricane is moving westward at about 12 kt.  A ridge centered 
over the southwestern United States is forecast to steer Carlotta 
westward for another day or so.  Later this weekend, the hurricane 
is expected to turn to the west-northwest around the southwest edge 
of the ridge.  Carlotta should turn back to the west as it weakens 
later in the forecast period.  Only minor adjustments have been made 
to the latest NHC track forecast.

The window for additional strengthening is growing smaller.  Within 
a day, Carlotta is expected to be over cooler ocean waters and begin 
weakening.  By Sunday night or Monday morning, the vertical wind 
shear is forecast to notably increase and steadily weaken the 
hurricane.  Simulated satellite imagery from global models indicate 
that Carlotta should lose its convection by day 4.  The official 
intensity forecast is above most guidance in the near-term 
prediction, and closer to the various consensus aids for the 
remainder of the forecast period.
