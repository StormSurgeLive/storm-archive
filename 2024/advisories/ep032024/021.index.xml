Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 AM PDT Mon Aug 5 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Carlotta, on Tropical Storm Daniel, and on Tropical Storm <br/>
Emilia, all located well offshore of the coast of Mexico.  <br/>
<br/>
South of Southwestern Mexico (EP96):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure <br/>
located a few hundred miles south of southwestern Mexico continue to <br/>
show signs of organization. Overnight satellite-derived wind data <br/>
indicated that the system did not yet have a well-defined <br/>
circulation.  However, satellite imagery since that time suggests <br/>
that the system may have become better organized since that time. A <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form today or tonight while the <br/>
system moves generally west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph, remaining <br/>
well offshore of the coast of Mexico. For more information on this <br/>
system, including Gale Warnings, see High Seas Forecasts issued by <br/>
the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
Public Advisories on Tropical Storm Emilia are issued under  <br/>
WMO header WTPZ35 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCPEP5. <br/>
Forecast/Advisories on Tropical Storm Emilia are issued under <br/>
WMO header WTPZ25 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCMEP5.<br/>

Tropical Storm Carlotta Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024

If not for a recent small burst of convection nearly 60 n mi from 
its center, Carlotta would be devoid of organized deep convection. 
The intensity estimate remains 40 kt, close to a recent UW-CIMSS 
SATCON estimate. Deep convection may persist today, but could cease 
at just about any time due to cold waters beneath Carlotta and a 
surounding dry and stable environment. By this time tomorrow, 
Carlotta should be a post-tropical cyclone.

Carlotta's initial motion remains 280/8kt. This general motion 
should continue today as long as Carlotta maintains some deep 
convection. A slight left turn toward the west-southwest should 
begin once the last of Carlotta's convection is gone. No significant 
changes were made to the NHC track or intensity forecasts.

Tropical Storm Daniel Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042024
200 AM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024
 
A 05/0422 UTC GPM/GMI microwave pass and GOES proxy-vis imagery
indicate that Daniel's structure continues deteriorating due to
the disrupting dominant monsoonal flow.  Despite the advantageous
microwave image, it has become increasingly difficult to pinpoint 
the cyclone's surface circulation center.
 
Some fluctuations in Daniel's strength are possible today while the 
cyclone continues its trek over warm waters and remains within a 
modest wind shear environment.  Afterward, the cyclone should move 
counter-clockwise around the eastern periphery of the larger 
Carlotta.  During that time, SHIPS statistical intensity guidance 
and the global models show increasing dry air entrainment, 
prompting the cyclone to weaken through the remainder of the 
forecast period.  The official intensity forecast agrees with the 
HCCA and IVCN intensity consensus guidance and is similar to the 
previous advisory.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be east-northeastward, 060/10 
kt, and this general motion within the low to mid-level 
southwesterly monsoonal flow should continue through today.  After 
that time, global and regional models indicate that Daniel will 
move into the eastern periphery of Carlotta's cyclonic flow, 
resulting in a turn toward the north and northwest while spinning 
down to a remnant low on Tuesday and eventually opening up into a 
trough on Thursday.  The NHC track forecast is an update to the 
previous one and closely follows the HCCA and TVCE consensus models.

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
200 AM MST Mon Aug 05 2024
 
Emilia has held relatively steady overnight.  Recently, a large
burst of convection with cloud top temperatures of less than -80
degrees C has formed near the estimated center.  Subjective Dvorak
estimates from TAFB and SAB both support maintaining the initial
intensity at 35 kt for this advisory cycle.
 
The intensity forecast continues to be quite uncertain.  This is
because of a system to the east of Emilia, Invest 96E.  Almost all
global and regional weather model guidance has trended toward making
Emilia the dominant system.  As a result, dissipation is no longer
expected in a couple of days.  Instead, Emilia is expected to take
advantage of the warm ocean waters and conducive environment and
strengthen through mid-week.  By the end of the week, Emilia should
move into a more stable environment with cooling sea surface
temperature and gradually weaken.  However, it is still possible
that Invest 96E forms, strengthens, and causes Emilia to dissipate
sooner.  The latest NHC intensity forecast peaks Emilia in 48 h at
60 kt and predicts the system to become a remnant low by 120 h.
 
The tropical storm is moving slowly to the south-southwest, at an
estimated 200/4 kt.  The near-term track forecast is being
influenced by Invest 96E.  Emilia is forecast to continue slowly
south-southwestward as the two systems rotate cyclonically around
each other.  In about a day or so, Emilia should begin to lift to
the north-northwest and accelerate as it is steered by a ridge
centered over the southwestern United States.  This motion should
gradually turn more northwestward by mid-week.  The latest track
forecast has shifted to the west due to the initial location and has
been extended into the future out to 5 days.
