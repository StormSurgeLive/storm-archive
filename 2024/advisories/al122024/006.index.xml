Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Mon Sep 30 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Joyce, located over the central Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
Tropical Storm Kirk, located over the eastern Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms located over the southwestern <br/>
Caribbean Sea are associated with a trough of low pressure. <br/>
Environmental conditions could support some gradual development of <br/>
this system, and a tropical depression could form over the next <br/>
several days while it moves generally northwestward over the <br/>
northwestern Caribbean Sea and the southern Gulf of Mexico. <br/>
Interests along the U.S. Gulf Coast should continue to monitor the <br/>
progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL91):<br/>
Satellite wind data indicate that a broad area of low pressure has <br/>
formed in association with a tropical wave located a few hundred <br/>
miles south of the Cabo Verde Islands. Showers and thunderstorms <br/>
continue to gradually increase in association with the system, and <br/>
environmental conditions appear conducive for further development. A <br/>
tropical depression is very likely to form during the next few days <br/>
while it moves slowly westward over the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

Remnants Of Joyce Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112024
1100 PM AST Mon Sep 30 2024
 
Recent CIRA ProxyVis GOES imagery, and an ASCAT-C overpass around 
00Z indicate that Joyce no longer has a well-defined center. 
Therefore, Joyce is no longer a tropical cyclone and this is the 
last NHC advisory.  The ASCAT data indicated that winds of 25-30 kt 
are still occuring near the remaining convection associated with the 
remnants of Joyce.

Joyce's remnants are expected to merge with a mid-latitude system 
and accelerate northeastward during the next couple of days. 
Additional information on this system can be found in High Seas 
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header 
NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at

<title>Tropical Storm Kirk Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Kirk Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
1100 PM AST Mon Sep 30 2024
 
Satellite images indicate Kirk is an asymmetric tropical storm with 
curved bands of deep convection primarily over the eastern half of 
the circulation. Recent scatterometer winds indicate the center of 
Kirk is slightly north of previous estimates, with a large 
tropical-storm-force wind field over the eastern semicircle. Based 
on the scatterometer data and a blend of the various satellite 
intensity estimates, the initial intensity is held at 50 kt.

Kirk is now moving west-northwestward (285/10 kt). This general 
motion should continue for the next couple of days while Kirk moves 
around the southwestern periphery of a deep-layer subtropical ridge 
over the eastern Atlantic. A gradual turn toward the northwest is 
anticipated during the middle part of the week, followed by a 
recurvature to the north-northwest and north over the central 
Atlantic by the end of the 5-day forecast period. The track guidance 
remains in very good agreement, and only minor adjustments were made 
to the NHC track forecast. 
 
Very warm waters, weak vertical wind shear, and a moist environment 
should support steady to perhaps rapid strengthening of Kirk during 
the next several days. The tropical storm is currently broad and 
lacks an inner core, but the forecast shows a faster rate of 
strengthening by midweek as Kirk is expected to become better 
organized within this favorable environment. No significant changes 
were made to the NHC intensity forecast, which lies on the higher 
side of the guidance envelope in best agreement with the 
statistical-dynamical aids and some of the regional hurricane 
models. The models agree that the wind field of Kirk will grow quite 
large later in the period as the cyclone gains latitude over open 
waters. Ultimately, Kirk is forecast to become a large, major 
hurricane over the open central Atlantic later this week.
