...LARGE SWELLS FROM KIRK EXPECTED TO REACH THE U.S. EAST COAST BY
SUNDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...29.6N 50.0W
ABOUT 1140 MI...1835 KM NE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 1435 MI...2310 KM WSW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...120 MPH...195 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 5 DEGREES AT 20 MPH...31 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...949 MB...28.03 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the Azores should monitor the progress of Kirk.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located 
near latitude 29.6 North, longitude 50.0 West. Kirk is moving toward 
the north near 20 mph (31 km/h) and this motion is expected to 
continue through tonight. A faster northeastward motion is expected 
on Sunday and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Kirk is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Weakening is forecast through early next week,
but Kirk will remain a large hurricane for the next couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles
(370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 949 mb (28.03 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Bermuda, and the Greater Antilles. These swells are expected to
spread westward to the east coast of the United States, Atlantic
Canada, and the Bahamas tonight and Sunday, and to the Azores
on Monday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.

<title>Hurricane Kirk Forecast Discussion Number 26</title>

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
500 PM AST Sat Oct 05 2024
 
Kirk continues to have a tight inner core, with deep convection 
wrapping around the center. The eye has continued to become more 
cloud filled, as shear increases over the system. The latest 
subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates have held 
mostly steady with this cycle, and the initial intensity is held at 
105 kt.
 
Kirk continues to move northward and increase forward speed with an 
estimated motion of (005/17 kt) between a trough located over the 
west-central Atlantic and a subtropical ridge in the east Atlantic.  
Model track guidance remains tightly clustered, although there has 
been a slight shift southward as the system transitions and becomes 
post-tropical. The NHC forecast track shows the center of Kirk 
passing just to the north of the Azores on Monday as an 
extratropical cyclone, and then moving across the northeastern 
Atlantic and over western Europe by the middle of next week. The 
official NHC track forecast is very similar to the previous 
advisory, with a slight nudge southward towards the end of the 
period following the consensus model trends.
 
Wind shear has started to increase over Kirk this afternoon, but the 
inner core has been able to remain intact. However, the environment 
will only continue to become more hostile as wind shear continues to 
increase, with drier mid-level air, and cooler sea surface 
temperatures. Therefore, steady weakening is forecast through early 
next week. The system should lose tropical characteristics and 
transition to a strong extratropical cyclone around 60 h. The 
updated NHC intensity forecast is near the previous one in the near 
term, with a slightly faster rate of weakening in agreement with the 
latest HCCA and simple consensus aids.
 
Kirk is producing ocean swells that are propagating far away from
the hurricane. These large swells will likely increase the risk of
dangerous surf and rip currents across the Leeward Islands, Bermuda,
and the Greater Antilles beginning later today, much of the U.S.
East Coast, Atlantic Canada, and the Bahamas by Sunday, and the
Azores by Monday. For more information on this hazard, see products
issued by your local weather office.

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 PM AST Sat Oct 05 2024
 
Leslie continues to produce deep convection this afternoon. Although 
the convective pattern depicts some southwesterly shear  
starting to impact the system. Subjective and objective Dvorak 
satellite intensity estimates range from 55-70 kt. Given the deep 
convection over the center still, the initial intensity is held at 
70 kt for this advisory, although that could be a little generous.
 
The hurricane continues to move slowly west-northwestward at 300/7 
kt, steered along the southwestern portion of a mid-level 
subtropical ridge over the eastern Atlantic. The ridge will continue 
to steer Leslie the next several days with a turn more 
northwestward, with an increase in forward speed the next several 
days. Model track guidance still remains fairly tightly clustered 
and the NHC track forecast is very close to the previous one.
 
Leslie may be able to fend off the shear over the next 12 hours or 
so, however by Sunday, the system will start to move into increasing 
wind shear and mid-level dry air. The NHC forecast track also takes 
Leslie over Kirk's cold wake. There continues to be some model 
differences on how significantly, and quickly weakening will occur. 
The NHC forecast follows the latest consensus aids downward trends, 
and is slightly lower than the previous forecast.

the Florida Keys, and the northwestern Bahamas should monitor the
progress of this system.
 
Hurricane and Storm Surge watches will likely be required for
portions of Florida on Sunday.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Milton was
located near latitude 22.7 North, longitude 95.5 West. Milton is
moving toward the north-northeast near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A slow
east-northeastward motion is expected to begin tonight. A
slightly faster eastward to east-northeastward motion is forecast
by Monday and Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the depression is
forecast to remain over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico through
Sunday night, then move across the south-central Gulf of Mexico on
Monday and Tuesday, and approach the west coast of the Florida
Peninsula by midweek.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Steady to rapid strengthening is forecast during the next few days.
Milton is forecast to become a hurricane Sunday night, and it could
become a major hurricane while it moves across the central and
eastern Gulf of Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.

Tropical Storm Milton Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
400 PM CDT Sat Oct 05 2024
 
Scatterometer data around midday confirmed that the circulation of
the depression was well-defined, and it also revealed peak winds of
35 kt.  Based on that data, the depression was upgraded to Tropical
Storm Milton a few hours ago.  The scatterometer data showed that
the center was embedded within the area of cold cloud tops, but the
area of tropical-storm-force winds was small. The overall structure
has not changed much since that time, and the initial intensity
remains 35 kt for this advisory.
 
Given that the system is still in its development stage, the initial
motion is a somewhat uncertain 020/3 kt.  Milton is not expected to
move much through tonight, but it should begin to move eastward to
east-northeastward on Sunday as a shortwave trough drops southward
over the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. On Monday, Milton should begin
to track a little faster toward the east or east-northeast as it
moves ahead of another mid-latitude trough approaching the
southeastern United States.  This trough is expected to cause Milton
to further accelerate northeastward by Tuesday night with the center
approaching the west coast of Florida. The overall track guidance
envelope has nudged northward this cycle and it should also be noted
that there remains large along-track or timing differences in the
various dynamical models.  The updated official forecast is slightly
north of the previous track and is a little slower to be in better
agreement with the latest multi-model consensus aids. Users are
again reminded to not focus on the exact forecast track or timing at
the longer range as the average NHC 4-day track error is about 150
miles.
 
Milton is within favorable atmospheric and oceanic conditions for
strengthening.  The scatterometer data indicated that the radius of
maximum was around 20 n mi, and with the expected low vertical wind
shear conditions, steady to rapid strengthening appears likely
during the next few days.  The official intensity forecasts calls
for Milton to become a hurricane in about 36 hours, and a major
hurricane by 72 hours.  The regional hurricane models continue to
be quite aggressive in intensifying Milton.  For now, the NHC
intensity forecast is near the multi-model consensus aids, but
upward adjustments could be required if the dynamical hurricane
models continue their trends.  Regardless of the exact details of
the intensity forecast, an intense hurricane with multiple
life-threatening hazards is likely to affect the west coast
of the Florida Peninsula next week.
 
Key Messages:
1.  Milton is forecast to quickly intensify while it moves
eastward to northeastward across the Gulf of Mexico and be at or
near major hurricane strength when it reaches the west coast of the
Florida Peninsula mid week.
 
2.  There is an increasing risk of life-threatening storm surge and
wind impacts for portions of the west coast of the Florida
Peninsula beginning late Tuesday or Wednesday. Residents in these
areas should ensure they have their hurricane plan in place, follow
any advice given by local officials, and check back for updates to
the forecast.
 
3. Areas of heavy rainfall will impact portions of Florida Sunday
and Monday well ahead of Milton, with heavy rainfall more directly
related to the system expected later on Tuesday through Wednesday
night. This rainfall brings the risk of flash, urban, and areal
flooding, along with minor to moderate river flooding.
