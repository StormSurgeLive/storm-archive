DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM GMT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located
near latitude 38.6 North, longitude 43.6 West. Kirk is moving toward
the northeast near 25 mph (41 km/h).  An even faster 
east-northeastward motion is expected during the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Although gradual weakening is expected, Kirk is forecast to 
become a large and strong extratropical low during the next couple 
of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310
miles (500 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 964 mb (28.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Bermuda, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, the east coast of the
United States, portions of Atlantic Canada, and the Azores. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  31
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
300 AM GMT Mon Oct 07 2024
 
Kirk is in the process of transitioning into an extratropical 
cyclone.  Satellite images show that the associated deep convection 
is now confined to the northern side of the circulation and that the 
inner core has been eroding.  In addition, there appears to be some 
frontal features beginning to form.  The initial intensity is 
lowered to 70 kt following a blend of the latest satellite intensity 
estimates.  The 34-kt wind radii have been tweaked on the system's 
east side based on recent ASCAT data.

Extratropical transition should be complete on Monday when the 
system moves over water temperatures in the low 20's C and into an 
environment of nearly 40 kt of vertical wind shear.  These 
parameters will also cause steady weakening during the next few 
days, and dissipation seems likely by day 4.  The models are in 
good agreement, and this forecast is closest to the latest GFS 
solution.

Kirk is gradually turning to the right, and the latest initial 
motion is 045/22 kt.  A turn to the east-northeast with a notable 
increase in forward speed is expected during the next few days as 
the system moves within the mid-latitude westerly flow.  This 
should take the extratropical low to the north of the Azores on 
Tuesday and across western Europe on Wednesday.

Although Kirk is over the open ocean, it is still producing large 
swells that could lead to life-threatening rip currents across 
portions of the Caribbean, Bermuda, the east coast of the U.S., and 
Atlantic Canada.

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 PM AST Sun Oct 06 2024
 
Leslie's satellite imagery has become a little more ragged as 
southwesterly shear has disrupted the overall convective pattern. 
The deep inner core convection has become a little more broken the 
last few hours. Subjective and objective estimates range from 75 to 
85 kt, with a T4.5 from both TAFB and SAB. Based on these 
satellite estimates, the initial intensity is held at 80 kt.
 
Leslie is moving northwestward (310/8 kt) while being steered by a 
subtropical ridge over the eastern Atlantic. The ridge will continue 
to build to the northeast of the system, which should steer the 
hurricane northwestward throughout the forecast period. Models 
continue to be in good agreement, the NHC track forecast is very 
similar to the previous which remains near the latest consensus 
aids.
 
The hurricane has started to enter a more hostile environment. 
Southwesterly shear has started to increase, with drier mid-levels, 
and upper-level convergence along the forecast path. The latest NHC 
forecast follows the latest model trends with gradual weakening 
beginning on Monday. Since Leslie is a relatively small tropical 
cyclone, it could be more susceptible to these negative factors and 
weaken even faster than the NHC forecast later in the period, as 
suggested by some of the global and hurricane regional models.

NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
700 PM CDT Sun Oct 06 2024
 
...MILTON EXPECTED TO BECOME A MAJOR HURRICANE IN THE NEXT DAY OR 
SO...

 
SUMMARY OF 700 PM CDT...0000 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...22.5N 93.4W
ABOUT 250 MI...405 KM WNW OF PROGRESO MEXICO
ABOUT 780 MI...1255 KM WSW OF TAMPA FLORIDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...85 MPH...140 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...E OR 100 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...981 MB...28.97 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Celestun to Cabo Catoche
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Celestun to Cancun
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests in the remainder of the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, the
Florida Peninsula, the Florida Keys, and the northwestern Bahamas
should monitor the progress of this system.
 
Storm Surge and Hurricane Watches will likely be issued for portions 
of Florida early Monday.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Milton was 
located by Air Force and NOAA Hurricane Hunters near latitude 22.5 
North, longitude 93.4 West.  Milton is moving toward the east near 
7 mph (11 km/h), and this general motion is expected tonight.  An 
eastward to east-northeastward motion is forecast on Monday, 
followed by a faster northeastward motion on  Tuesday and 
Wednesday.  On the forecast track, Milton is forecast to move just 
north of the Yucatan Peninsula and across the southern Gulf of 
Mexico Monday and Tuesday and approach the west coast of the 
Florida Peninsula by Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Milton is forecast to intensify rapidly during the next 
couple of days and become a major hurricane on Monday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80
miles (130 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft observations is 981 mb (28.97 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Hurricane Milton can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 2
to 4 feet above ground level along the northern coast of the
Yucatan Peninsula in areas of onshore winds.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches, with localized totals
up to 15 inches, are expected across portions of the Florida
Peninsula and the Keys through Wednesday night. This rainfall brings
the risk of considerable flash, urban, and areal flooding, along
with the potential for moderate to major river flooding.
 
Milton will also produce rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches across
portions of the northern Yucatan Peninsula.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin as early as
Monday morning in the warning area, and hurricane conditions are
possible beginning Monday afternoon.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the system are affecting the coast of the
southwestern Gulf of Mexico.  These swells are expected to spread 
northward and eastward along much of the Gulf Coast within the next 
day or two, and are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local 
weather office.

<title>Hurricane Milton Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Hurricane Milton Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
400 PM CDT Sun Oct 06 2024
 
Milton is rapidly intensifying.  Satellite images indicate very
deep convection in the eyewall and hints of an eye starting to
appear.  The last fix from the aircraft showed that the
central pressure was down to 985 mb, about 3 mb less than 80
minutes prior, and winds supporting 70 kt at the surface.  Since
that time, satellite images continue to show further organization,
and the initial wind speed is set to 75 kt.
 
Milton is moving just south of due east at about 6 kt.  This
equatorward motion has been more than expected probably due to a
stronger low/ mid-level frontal low over the northeastern Gulf of 
Mexico. The frontal feature is forecast to weaken while it moves 
across Florida and gradually lose its influence on Milton.  This 
evolution should allow the hurricane to turn eastward on Monday and 
then accelerate to the northeast on Tuesday and Wednesday toward the 
Florida Peninsula ahead of a trough moving offshore of Texas.  The 
NHC forecast is a bit south of the previous one through 48 hours, 
following the trend of the guidance at that time, and the government 
of Mexico has issued a Hurricane Watch for a portion of the northern 
coast of Yucatan.  Later on, the guidance is similar to, or slightly 
north of the last cycle, and very little change is made to the 
forecast near Florida. It should be noted that the average NHC track 
error at day 3 is around 100 miles, and users should not focus on 
the exact track.
 
The intensity forecast appears straightforward at first, with rapid 
intensification likely while the small hurricane remains within 
light shear and over very deep warm waters.  Intensity guidance is 
about as bullish as I've seen in this part of the basin, with 
almost everything showing a peak intensity of category 4 or 5 in 
the southern Gulf of Mexico in a day or two.  The NHC forecast is 
raised from the previous one and lies near the intensity consensus 
model and still could be too low.  Later on, vertical wind shear is
forecast to markedly increase as Milton approaches Florida, and 
some weakening is anticipated.  However, the regional hurricane 
models are showing the system growing even if it weakens, and we are 
expecting Milton to be a large hurricane at landfall, with very 
dangerous impacts spread out over a big area. There is increasing 
confidence that a powerful hurricane with life- threatening hazards 
will be affecting portions of the Florida west coast around the 
middle of this week. Residents there should closely monitor this 
system and listen to local officials.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Milton is forecast to be a major hurricane when it reaches the 
west coast of the Florida Peninsula midweek. Users are reminded to 
not focus on the details of the forecast as there remains 
significant uncertainty in the eventual track and intensity of 
Milton. 

2. While it is too soon to specify the exact magnitude and location 
of the greatest impacts, there is an increasing risk of life- 
threatening storm surge and damaging winds for portions of the west 
coast of the Florida Peninsula beginning early Wednesday and Storm 
Surge and Hurricane Watches will likely be issued tonight or early 
Monday.  Residents in the Florida Peninsula should follow any advice 
given by local officials and monitor updates to the forecast. 

3. Areas of heavy rainfall will impact portions of Florida through 
Monday well ahead of Milton, with heavy rainfall more directly 
related to Milton expected on Tuesday through Wednesday night. This 
rainfall will bring the risk of considerable flash, urban, and areal 
flooding, along with the potential for moderate to major river 
flooding.

4. Tropical storm conditions are expected with hurricane conditions 
possible beginning Monday across portions of the northern Yucatan 
Peninsula of Mexico where a Tropical Storm Warning and Hurricane 
Watch are in effect.
