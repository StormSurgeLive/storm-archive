Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Tue Oct 1 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Kirk, located over the central tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
A broad trough of low pressure is producing a large area of <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms from the southwestern <br/>
Caribbean Sea into the southern Gulf of Mexico. Environmental <br/>
conditions could support some gradual development of this system, <br/>
and a tropical depression could form towards the end of this week or <br/>
this weekend as the broader disturbance moves fully into the Gulf of <br/>
Mexico. Interests along the U.S. Gulf Coast should continue to <br/>
monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL91):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to show signs organization in <br/>
association with an area of low pressure located a few hundred <br/>
miles south-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands.  Environmental <br/>
conditions appear conducive for further development of this system, <br/>
and a tropical depression is expected to form during the next <br/>
day or two while it moves slowly westward over the eastern <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

<title>Hurricane Kirk Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
500 PM AST Tue Oct 01 2024

Kirk's appearance on satellite has improved with a large burst of 
convection near the center and deep convective bands continuing to 
wrap around the southeast side. A 1808 UTC GPM microwave pass 
showed an improved inner-core structure with an eyewall noted on the 
37 GHz channel. The UW-CIMSS DMINT intensity estimate associated 
with the microwave image was 63 kt. This estimate combined with the 
most recent TAFB Dvorak fix of 4.0/65 kt is the basis for making 
Kirk a hurricane this afternoon with an intensity of 65 kt.  

Kirk is moving slightly more poleward this afternoon, with an 
estimated motion of 305/12 kt. This motion, with perhaps a slight 
slowdown, should continue over the next couple of days as Kirk is 
primarily steered along the southwestern edge of a subtropical ridge 
positioned to its north. The western extent of this ridge will 
become eroded by a long-wave trough offshore of eastern North 
America towards the latter part of this week, allowing Kirk to turn 
first northwestward and then recurving north-northeastward by the 
end of the forecast period. The track guidance continues to be in 
good agreement, and the latest NHC track forecast lies near the 
middle of the guidance envelope, very similar to the prior advisory 
and between the HCCA and TVCN consensus aids.

Now that Kirk's inner core is becoming better established it is 
poised to intensify at a faster rate. Favorable environmental 
factors surrounding Kirk, such as decreasing shear, warm 28-30 C 
sea-surface temperatures, and plenty of deep-layer moisture will 
continue to support a faster rate of strengthening through the 24-48 
h period. The NHC intensity forecast shows Kirk becoming a major 
hurricane towards the end of the forecast period. In addition, 
Kirk's wind field is forecast to expand as the system moves poleward 
through the end of the week. Thereafter, hard to predict inner-core 
structural changes will likely lead to fluctuations in intensity, 
though by day 5, shear increases again with weakening commencing. 
However, Kirk will likely remain a large and formidable hurricane 
through the forecast. The NHC intensity forecast is close the middle 
of the intensity guidance consensus and still a little on the 
upper-end towards the end of the forecast period.
