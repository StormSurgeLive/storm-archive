Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Tue Oct 1 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
upgraded Hurricane Kirk, located over the central tropical Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
A broad trough of low pressure is producing a large area of <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms from the southwestern <br/>
Caribbean Sea into the southern Gulf of Mexico. Environmental <br/>
conditions could support some gradual development of this system, <br/>
and a tropical depression could form towards the end of the week or <br/>
over the weekend as the broader disturbance moves fully into the <br/>
Gulf of Mexico. Interests along the U.S. Gulf Coast should continue <br/>
to monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL91):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue in association with an area of <br/>
low pressure located a few hundred miles south-southwest of the Cabo <br/>
Verde Islands.  Environmental conditions appear conducive for <br/>
further development of this system, and a tropical depression is <br/>
expected to form during the next day or two while it moves slowly <br/>
westward over the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

<title>Hurricane Kirk Forecast Discussion Number 10</title>

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
1100 PM AST Tue Oct 01 2024
 
Kirk has stopped its strengthening trend for the moment.  
Geostationary satellite imagery has shown a large primary band 
extending around the northern and eastern portions of the 
circulation, with a dry air intrusion making its way into the inner 
core.  An SSMIS microwave pass from 1915 UTC showed that the eyewall 
was open to the southwest.  The initial intensity is held at 65 kt, 
closest to the subjective Dvorak estimate from TAFB.
 
The hurricane is moving northwestward at 11 kt.  A subtropical ridge
should continue to steer Kirk in the same general direction through
Thursday.  By the end of the week, a trough exiting the eastern U.S.
seaboard should weaken the ridge and turn Kirk northward, followed
by a turn to the north-northeast over the weekend.  The track
guidance is tightly clustered and only minor updates have been made
to the latest NHC track forecast.
 
Kirk is expected to continue strengthening in the coming days. 
Global models forecast the deep-layer vertical wind shear to remain 
weak and warm sea surface temperatures along the forecast track 
during the next few days. The vertical wind shear is predicted to 
gradually increase over the weekend and will likely induce a 
weakening trend by the end of the forecast period.  The latest NHC 
intensity forecast is unchanged from the previous advisory and now 
lies at the upper-end of the guidance envelope, closest to HCCA.  As 
mentioned earlier, Kirk is a large system and expected to grow 
larger as it moves northward, with tropical-storm-force winds 
extending far from the center.
