Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Fri Oct 4 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Kirk, located over the central subtropical Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
Tropical Storm Leslie, located over the eastern tropical Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms located over the western Gulf <br/>
of Mexico are associated with a trough of low pressure. A broad area <br/>
of low pressure is expected to form over the southwestern or <br/>
south-central Gulf of Mexico this weekend, and thereafter some <br/>
gradual development is possible while the low moves slowly eastward <br/>
or northeastward. A tropical or subtropical depression or storm <br/>
could form during the early to middle part of next week if the low <br/>
remains separate from a frontal boundary that is forecast to extend <br/>
across the Gulf of Mexico next week. Regardless of tropical or <br/>
subtropical development, locally heavy rains could occur over <br/>
portions of Mexico during the next few days and over portions of the <br/>
Florida Peninsula late this weekend into next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>

...KIRK REMAINS A LARGE AND POWERFUL MAJOR HURRICANE...
...LARGE SWELLS FROM KIRK COULD REACH THE U.S. EAST COAST BY
SUNDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...22.3N 48.1W
ABOUT 1010 MI...1630 KM ENE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 1655 MI...2665 KM SW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...145 MPH...230 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...934 MB...27.58 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Kirk was located near 
latitude 22.3 North, longitude 48.1 West. Kirk is moving toward the 
northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this general motion is expected 
to continue today. A turn toward the north and north-northeast at a 
faster forward speed is anticipated over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Kirk is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Small intensity fluctuations are possible 
today. Weakening is forecast to begin on Saturday and continue 
through early next week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles
(315 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 934 mb (27.58 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are spreading westward and are
expected to reach the Leeward Islands later today, Bermuda and the
Greater Antilles on Saturday, the east coast of the United States,
Atlantic Canada, and the Bahamas on Sunday, and the Azores on
Monday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Hurricane Kirk Forecast Discussion Number 19</title>

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
1100 PM AST Thu Oct 03 2024
 
Kirk continues to prosper.  The earlier eyewall replacement cycle
appears to have completed, and Kirk is back on a strengthening
trend.  Satellite images indicate that Kirk has a circular and
clear 15 n mi eye surrounded by a solid ring of intense deep
convection.  The latest satellite intensity estimates range from
115 to 135 kt, and based on that data, the initial wind speed is
increased to 125 kt.
 
The hurricane is moving northwestward at 9 kt, and this general
motion should continue through Friday as Kirk continues to move
along the southwestern periphery of a high pressure ridge over the
central and eastern subtropical Atlantic.  A turn to the north is
expected on Saturday when Kirk reaches the western periphery of the
ridge and as a shortwave trough approaches the system.  This trough
and a reinforcing one should cause the hurricane to accelerate
northeastward on Sunday and early next week.  The models are in
fairly good agreement on this overall scenario, and the NHC track
forecast has been nudged westward to be in better agreement with
the latest model runs.
 
Kirk could strengthen a little more during the next 12 hours or so,
but increasing vertical wind shear and intrusions of dry air should
cause a steady weakening trend to begin shortly after that.  Kirk
will likely complete extratropical transition when it moves
over cool waters sometime between day 4 and day 5, but it is
expected to remain a powerful system throughout the forecast
period.  The NHC track forecast is in best agreement with the HCCA
and IVCN consensus models.
 
Even though Kirk is expected to stay over the open Atlantic, its
strong intensity and increasing size will cause large ocean swells
to propagate far away from the hurricane.   These swells will likely
increase the risk of dangerous surf and rip currents across the
Leeward Islands beginning Friday, Bermuda and the Greater Antilles
by Saturday, and much of the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic Canada, and
the Bahamas by Sunday.  For more information on this hazard, see
products issued by your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Leslie Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 AM AST Fri Oct 04 2024
 
A 0421 UTC GMI microwave pass showed that Leslie has developed a 
well-defined low-level structure, along with what appears to be an 
attempt at an eyewall feature south of the center.  This asymmetry 
in the convection is the result of continued moderate shear out of 
the north-northeast.  ASCAT-C data from several hours ago showed 
several 44-kt wind barbs northwest of the center.  Given the 
typical undersampling of this instrument, and the storm's improved 
structure despite the shear, the initial intensity is estimated to 
be 50 kt.

The GMI and ASCAT passes helped immensely in locating Leslie's 
center, which is a little farther south than previously estimated.  
Leslie is moving slowly westward, or 270/5 kt, along the southern 
periphery of the subtropical ridge.  With the ridge expected to 
remain centered over the eastern Atlantic, Leslie is forecast to 
gradually turn west-northwestward later today and then toward the 
northwest in about 48 hours, with that motion continuing through 
the middle of next week.  The NHC track forecast is near a blend of 
the HCCA and TVCA consensus aids, and any differences from the 
previous prediction should be considered negligible.

The deep-layer shear affecting Leslie is likely to abate in about 
12 hours.  However, there are a few environmental features that 
could potentially limit Leslie's rate of intensification.  
Mid-level shear and dry air are shown to be the biggest negative 
factors in the SHIPS diagnostics, and Leslie may end up moving over 
Hurricane Kirk's cold wake.  Additional strengthening is still 
anticipated, however much of the intensity guidance has come down 
on this cycle.  The NHC intensity forecast is slightly lower than 
the previous forecast to follow this trend, but it lies near or 
above the highest intensity models for most of the forecast period.
