NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Wed Oct 2 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Kirk, located over the central tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
A broad trough of low pressure is producing a large area of <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms from the southwestern <br/>
Caribbean Sea into the southern Gulf of Mexico. Environmental <br/>
conditions could support some gradual development of this system, <br/>
and a tropical depression could form over the weekend as the broader <br/>
disturbance moves fully into the Gulf of Mexico. Interests along the <br/>
U.S. Gulf Coast should continue to monitor the progress of this <br/>
system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL91):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to show signs of organization in <br/>
association with an area of low pressure located a few hundred miles <br/>
south-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands.  Environmental conditions <br/>
appear conducive for further development of this system, and a <br/>
tropical depression is expected to form during the next day or so <br/>
while it moves slowly westward over the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located
near latitude 18.0 North, longitude 43.0 West. Kirk is moving toward
the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this motion is expected

The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

<title>Hurricane Kirk Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
500 AM AST Wed Oct 02 2024

Satellite imagery over the past 6 to 12 hours indicates a gradual 
improvement in the organization of Kirk's central dense overcast.  
The low-level center is likely underneath the southern portion of 
the central convective area.  The cyclone is also growing in size.  
Convective banding in the southeast semicircle sprawls out a far 
distance away from the center.  The latest subjective intensity 
estimates from TAFB and SAB range from 65 to 77 kt, while objective 
intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS are ranging from 61 to 71 kt.  
The initial intensity is nudged up to 70 kt based on an average of 
the subjective estimates.

Kirk has been moving northwestward, or 305/12 kt.  A similar 
heading at perhaps a slightly slower forward speed is expected 
through Thursday as Kirk is steered by a subtropical ridge.  By the 
end of the week, Kirk will gradually turn northward in between an 
approaching deep-layer trough over the western Atlantic and a 
subtropical ridge to the east of the hurricane.  A turn toward the 
north-northeast is expected by the end of the weekend, and the 
models remain in good agreement on this scenario.  The new NHC 
track forecast is nearly unchanged from the previous one through 72 
h, but a bit west of the previous forecast beyond 72 h.  The NHC 
forecast is in best agreement with the TVCA consensus aid.

Favorable environmental conditions are forecast to continue for the 
next 60 to 72 hours as Kirk travels over warm sea-surface 
temperatures and within a relatively moist environment with weak 
deep-layer vertical wind shear.  These favorable conditions should 
allow for continued steady strengthening, and Kirk is forecast to 
become a major hurricane on Thursday.  By hour 96, Kirk is likely 
to experience stronger southwesterly wind shear, which should begin 
a weakening trend.  The latest intensity forecast is similar to the 
previous one and lies in the middle to upper portion of the 
guidance envelope.  Kirk is a large tropical cyclone and is expected
to grow into a very large and powerful major hurricane over the 
next couple of days.

Tropical Depression Thirteen Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
200 PM CVT Wed Oct 02 2024

The system we have been monitoring several hundred miles to the 
southwest of the southernmost Cabo Verde Islands has become 
gradually better organized this morning with some curved bands 
organizing to the west of the estimated center. Visible satellite 
images show that at least a broad closed circulation has developed. 
Based on the latest subjective Dvorak fixes of T2.5/35-kt from TAFB 
and T1.5/25-kt from SAB, advisories are being initiated on Tropical 
Depression Thirteen, with an initial intensity in between these 
estimates at 30 kt.

The depressions initial motion appears to be slowly due west, at 
270/6 kt. Over the next day or two this motion should continue, 
though some of the track guidance actually shows a south of due west 
motion, partially related to the steering flow and also the 
possibility that the center might try to reform underneath deep 
convective bursts in the southern semicircle. After 48 h, the 
guidance shows TD13 turning west-northwestward and then 
northwestward by the end of the forecast as mid-level ridging 
becomes more eroded on its northwestern side while a large long-wave 
trough becomes established over the Northwest Atlantic. The initial 
NHC track forecast has opted to favor a track close to the consensus 
aid TVCN. Interestingly, both the GFS and ECMWF are on the east side 
of the guidance, while HCCA is on the western side by the end of the 
forecast period. 

Intensity wise, initial strengthening could be on the slower end, as 
the system has to deal with some northwesterly shear related of the 
outflow from the much larger Hurricane Kirk impinging upon the 
system. However, the guidance insists this shear will soon decrease, 
especially after 24-36 h where the upper-level flow seems to split 
off into a cutoff low to the southwest, and a upper-level trough 
that shifts east of the depression, leaving the depression in a more 
favorable upper-level diffluent pattern. After TD13's inner core 
become better defined, the rate of intensification could increase 
after 36 h, and the latest NHC intensity forecast forecasts the 
depression to become a hurricane in 3 days. Additional 
intensification is forecast after that point as long as the cyclone 
tracks far enough away from the cold ocean wake left behind by Kirk. 
This forecast is roughly in the mean of the intensity guidance 
envelope.
