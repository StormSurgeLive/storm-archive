Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Mon Sep 30 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Joyce, located over the central Atlantic Ocean, on <br/>
newly formed Tropical Storm Kirk, located over the eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic Ocean and has issued the last advisory on Post-Tropical <br/>
Cyclone Isaac.<br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
A trough of low pressure located over the southwestern Caribbean Sea <br/>
continues to produce some disorganized shower and thunderstorm <br/>
activity.  Environmental conditions could become conducive for <br/>
gradual development, and a tropical depression could form in a few <br/>
days while the system is over the southern Gulf of Mexico or <br/>
northwestern Caribbean Sea.  Interests along the U.S. Gulf Coast <br/>
should continue to monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to increase in association with a <br/>
tropical wave located a few hundred miles south of the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands.  Upper-level winds appear conducive for further <br/>
development, and a tropical depression is very likely to form in a <br/>
few days while it moves slowly westward over the eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Joyce Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112024
1100 AM AST Mon Sep 30 2024

Joyce continues to struggle to remain a tropical depression, having 
a fully exposed low-level center displaced to the west of pulsing 
deep convection. This displacement is a result of strong 
southwesterly vertical wind shear ahead of a central Atlantic 
upper-level trough. With no recent surface observations or 
scatterometer wind data available, 30 kt will remain the initial 
intensity, reflecting the subjective Dvorak analysis from TAFB and 
SAB.

The depression has meandered this morning, and the current motion 
estimate is an uncertain 360/2 kt. The official track forecast 
depicts a slow northward motion until Joyce fully dissipates in 48 
h, similar to the previous track forecast. 

Continued shear coupled with persistent dry air should increasingly 
inhibit organized convection, leading to Joyce degenerating into a 
remnant low soon. The intensity forecast is similar to the previous 
one showing Joyce becoming a remnant low in 12 h with total 
dissipation in about 48 h.

Tropical Storm Kirk Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
1100 AM AST Mon Sep 30 2024
 
Satellite images show an expanding area of central convection near 
the system with the low-level center on the western side of the deep 
convection.  Microwave data from a few hours ago showed that an 
inner core is forming, with a partial eyewall noted on an AMSU 
pass. The initial wind speed is set to 45 kt based on 40-45 kt 
winds from a pair of recent scatterometer passes. 

The motion of Kirk appears to be westward at about 10 kt, with the 
center apparently re-forming to the south within the deeper 
convection.  The track forecast is relatively straightforward, with 
Kirk expected to follow the south and southwestern edge of the 
subtropical high over the east-central Atlantic, resulting in a 
path that gradually gains latitude and Kirk moving northward by 
this weekend.  Other than a small westward adjustment based on the 
initial motion, the new forecast is very close to the old one.

The environment around Kirk appears quite favorable for 
strengthening during the next several days, with warm waters, a 
moist environment and low shear in forecast.  Given the formation 
of an inner core, the rate of strengthening has been raised in the 
short term, and rapid intensification is a distinct possibility.  
The biggest negative to this system is probably its large size, 
which could eventually promote eyewall replacement cycles and some 
SST cooling ahead of the system.  Still, almost all of the guidance 
show Kirk becoming quite a large and powerful hurricane.  The new 
NHC intensity forecast lies between the dynamical model consensus 
and the statistical-dynamical models, which are quite bullish on 
this system.

BULLETIN
Post-Tropical Cyclone Isaac Advisory Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
300 PM GMT Mon Sep 30 2024
 
...ISAAC BECOMES A POST-TROPICAL CYCLONE...
...THIS IS THE LAST ADVISORY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM GMT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...44.8N 29.1W
ABOUT 480 MI...775 KM NNW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 65 DEGREES AT 17 MPH...28 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...983 MB...29.03 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Isaac 
was located near latitude 44.8 North, longitude 29.1 West. The 
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east-northeast near 17 
mph (28 km/h) and a turn to the northeast is expected with a similar 
forward motion for the next several days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h)
with higher gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast over the next
several days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 983 mb (29.03 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac will affect the Azores over the
next few days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane 
Center on this system. Additional information on this system can be 
found in High Seas Forecasts issued by Meteo France under WMO header 
FQNT50 LFPW and available on the web at

Post-Tropical Cyclone Isaac Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
300 PM GMT Mon Sep 30 2024
 
Geostationary satellite data this morning indicates that Isaac has 
completed its transition to a Post-Tropical Extratropical Low and 
this will be the last NHC advisory. The remaining moderate-to-deep 
convection has sheared off to the northeast as stable stratocumulus 
clouds have fully infiltrated its low-level circulation from the 
west. The initial intensity has been lowered to 50 kt blending the 
latest subjective and objective measurements.
 
The post-tropical cyclone is still moving east-northeastward at 
about 065/15 kt. A subtle turn to the northeast is still expected 
over the next couple of days as the cyclone remains embedded in the 
mid-latitude westerlies. The guidance has shifted a bit east of the 
prior forecast track, partially a reflection of the more eastward 
initial position, and the NHC track was nudged in that direction. 
Over the forecast period, the cyclone is expected to slowly weaken, 
lacking baroclinic support for much non-tropical development. The 
low should ultimately dissipate in the far North Atlantic to the 
west of Ireland before the end of the week.
