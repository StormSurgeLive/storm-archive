Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Sat Oct 5 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Kirk, located over the central subtropical Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
Hurricane Leslie, located over the eastern tropical Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Gulf of Mexico (AL92):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a broad area of low <br/>
pressure located over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico are gradually <br/>
becoming better organized.  Development of this system is expected, <br/>
and a tropical depression or storm is likely to form later today or <br/>
on Sunday while it moves slowly eastward over the southwestern Gulf <br/>
of Mexico.  By early next week, the system is forecast to move <br/>
faster eastward or northeastward across the central and eastern Gulf <br/>
of Mexico where additional strengthening is likely.  Interests on <br/>
the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, the  Florida Peninsula, the Florida <br/>
Keys, and the northwestern Bahamas should monitor the progress of <br/>
this system. Regardless of development, locally heavy rains could <br/>
occur over portions of Mexico during the next day or two, and over <br/>
much of Florida late this weekend through the middle of next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Far Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa on <br/>
Monday or Tuesday.  Some development of this system is possible <br/>
thereafter while it moves westward or west-northwestward across the <br/>
eastern tropical Atlantic.  The system is expected to move near or <br/>
over the Cabo Verde Islands on Wednesday and Thursday, and interests <br/>
there should monitor its progress.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

...MAJOR HURRICANE KIRK TURNING MORE NORTHWARD...
...LARGE SWELLS FROM KIRK EXPECTED TO REACH THE U.S. EAST COAST BY
SUNDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...27.6N 50.3W
ABOUT 1040 MI...1675 KM NE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 1525 MI...2455 KM WSW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...120 MPH...195 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 355 DEGREES AT 16 MPH...26 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...949 MB...28.03 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the Azores should monitor the progress of Kirk.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located 
near latitude 27.6 North, longitude 50.3 West. Kirk is moving toward 
the north near 16 mph (26 km/h) and this motion is expected to 
continue through tonight. A faster northeastward motion is expected 
on Sunday and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Kirk is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Weakening is forecast through early next week, 
but Kirk will remain a large hurricane for the next couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles
(370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 949 mb (28.03 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Bermuda, and the Greater Antilles. These swells are expected to
spread westward to the east coast of the United States, Atlantic
Canada, and the Bahamas Saturday night and Sunday, and to the Azores
on Monday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

<title>Hurricane Kirk Forecast Discussion Number 25</title>

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
1100 AM AST Sat Oct 05 2024
 
The inner core of Kirk has become a little less pronounced and 
ragged on satellite imagery, with the eye becoming more cloud 
filled. Shear is starting to increase over the system with some 
drier air intrusions becoming evident. The latest subjective and 
objective satellite intensity estimates have come down with this 
cycle, and the initial intensity is lowered to 105 kt.
 
Kirk continues to turn more northward (355/14 kt) within the flow 
between a shortwave trough over the west-central Atlantic and a 
subtropical ridge to the east Atlantic  Model guidance is in fairly 
good agreement that Kirk should keep turning to the northeast and 
east-northeast through early next week and increasing forward 
motion. The NHC forecast track shows the center of Kirk passing to 
the north of the Azores on Monday as an extratropical cyclone, and 
then moving across the northeastern Atlantic and over western Europe 
by the middle of next week. The official NHC track forecast is very 
similar to the previous advisory.
 
The hurricane is getting ready to move into a hostile environment 
with increasing shear and drier air. The system will also be 
traversing cooler sea surface temperatures throughout the forecast 
period. Therefore, steady weakening is forecast through early next 
week. The system should lose tropical characteristics and 
transition to a strong extratropical cyclone around 60 h, which is 
supported by the global model fields and simulated satellite 
imagery. The updated NHC intensity forecast is near the previous in 
the near term, with a slightly faster rate of weakening beyond 60 h 
in agreement with the latest HCCA and simple consensus aids.
 
Kirk is producing ocean swells that are propagating far away from 
the hurricane. These large swells will likely increase the risk of 
dangerous surf and rip currents across the Leeward Islands, Bermuda, 
and the Greater Antilles beginning later today, much of the U.S. 
East Coast, Atlantic Canada, and the Bahamas by Sunday, and the 
Azores by Monday. For more information on this hazard, see products 
issued by your local weather office.

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
1100 AM AST Sat Oct 05 2024
 
Deep convection continues to burst over the center of Leslie this 
morning. Some of the latest satellite images depict a little bit of 
shear starting to impact the system, with a sharper convective edge 
on the western side. Subjective and objective satellite intensity 
estimates range from 65 to 75 kt.  Using a blend of these estimates, 
the initial intensity is held at 70 kt for this advisory.
 
Leslie continues to move slowly west-northwestward (295/6 kt), 
steered by a mid-level subtropical ridge over the eastern Atlantic. 
The ridge will continue to steer Leslie the next several days with a 
turn more northwestward, with an increase in forward speed by the 
middle of the forecast period. The NHC track forecast is very close 
to the previous, and lies near the simple and corrected consensus 
aids.

The intensity forecast continues to trend downward with Leslie. The 
system has about 12-24 hours left within a favorable environment 
where some slight additional strengthening may occur. By Sunday, 
increased shear, drier mid-level, and the track taking Leslie over 
Kirk's cold wake, this could cause some weakening after 24 hours. 
There is better agreement with the weakening trend, however they 
differ on how significantly and how quickly weakening will occur. 
Therefore, downward adjustments were made to the NHC intensity 
forecast and now has Leslie weakening below hurricane strength 
beyond 48 h.  If trends continue further downward adjustments may be 
required in future advisories.
