Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Sun Sep 29 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Isaac, located several hundred miles northwest of the Azores, and <br/>
on Tropical Storm Joyce, located over the central Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic (AL90):<br/>
Recent satellite imagery indicates that the circulation associated <br/>
with an area of low pressure located several hundred miles west- <br/>
southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands is becoming better defined.<br/>
Environmental conditions are favorable for continued development of <br/>
this system, and a tropical depression is likely to form early this <br/>
week, possibly as soon as tonight. The low will continue to move <br/>
westward and then northwestward across the eastern and central <br/>
tropical Atlantic. Additional information on this system, including <br/>
gale warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the <br/>
National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located over the western Caribbean Sea <br/>
is producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Environmental <br/>
conditions appear to be conducive for gradual development, and a <br/>
tropical depression could form around the middle part of this week <br/>
while the disturbance meanders towards the west-northwest. This <br/>
system is then expected to move northwestward into the Gulf of <br/>
Mexico during the latter portion of this week, and interests in the <br/>
northwestern Caribbean Sea and along the U.S. Gulf Coast should <br/>
monitor its progress.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Atlantic:<br/>
A low-latitude tropical wave located near the coast of western <br/>
Africa is currently producing limited shower and thunderstorm <br/>
activity.  Upper-level winds are forecast to become more conducive <br/>
for gradual development of this system during the next several days <br/>
while it moves slowly westward or west-northwestward over the <br/>
eastern Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service<br/>
can be found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 <br/>

Tropical Storm Joyce Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112024
500 PM AST Sun Sep 29 2024

Joyce's center continues to be exposed to the southwest of its
convective mass as shear persists across the circulation.  There's 
generally been a slight reduction in the objective and subjective 
estimates from the last advisory, so the initial wind speed is set 
to 35 kt.
 
The storm is moving erratically northwestward at about 5 kt.  Joyce 
is still forecast to turn northward on Monday due to a deep-layer 
trough over the north-central Atlantic, with only minor 
disagreements on the exact longitude of recurvature.  The new 
forecast is a touch west of the last one, consistent with the 
consensus guidance.  The intensity forecast seems straightforward 
with unabating shear and plentiful environmental dry air causing 
gradual weakening, with no significant change from the last NHC 
forecast.  The remnant low might dissipate into a trough sooner 
than shown here, similar to the latest ECMWF forecast.

Tropical Depression Twelve Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
500 PM AST Sun Sep 29 2024

The system we have been monitoring in the eastern Tropical Atlantic 
(AL90) has continued to become better organized throughout the day. 
After an overnight deep convective burst, outer convective banding 
has become better defined, noted by the most recent TAFB subjective 
Dvorak fix of T2.0/30 kt. GOES-16 1-minute visible imagery also 
shows that the circulation, which was more elongated this morning, 
has become better defined on the western side, suggesting a 
well-defined closed vortex now exists. Based on the above data, 
advisories are initiated on Tropical Depression Twelve this 
afternoon, with an initial intensity of 30 kt.

The motion of the new depression currently appears to be westward at 
270/8 kt. A prominent subtropical ridge to the north should continue 
to steer the system generally westward to west-northwestward over 
the next couple of days. After that time, this ridge becomes more 
eroded by a mid-latitude trough on its western side, resulting in 
the system gradually turning more poleward through the end of the 
forecast. In general the guidance is pretty tightly clustered for 
the first 48-60 h, with spread increasing a little more thereafter 
related to how quickly the system turns poleward. The initial NHC
track forecast lies near the HFIP Corrected Consensus Approach 
(HCCA), which favors the ECMWF track a little further west than the 
GFS track.  

For at least the next 2-3 days, vertical wind shear is expected to 
remain low, mid-level moisture stays high, as the system remains 
over 29-30 C sea-surface temperatures. Yet, the current large 
convective envelope of the system suggests it may take a day or so 
for an inner-core to become established. Thus, the initial rate of 
intensification is a bit slow, a little under the guidance for the 
next 24 hours, but then becomes faster and ends up near the IVCN 
consensus aid by 120 h. The initial NHC intensity forecast shows 
TD12 becoming a hurricane in 60 h and a major hurricane in 5 days.

Tropical Storm Isaac Advisory Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
900 PM GMT Sun Sep 29 2024
 
...LARGE SWELLS AND DANGEROUS SURF IMPACTING THE AZORES...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM GMT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...43.8N 34.7W
ABOUT 565 MI...910 KM NW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...70 MPH...110 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 50 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...973 MB...28.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Isaac was
located near latitude 43.8 North, longitude 34.7 West. Isaac is
moving toward the northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h). This motion is
expected to continue for the next couple of days, followed by a
turn towards the north-northeast on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h)
with higher gusts, and continued weakening is forecast over the
next few days. Isaac is forecast to become an extratropical
cyclone on Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 973 mb (28.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Isaac and an upstream deep-layer trough
will affect the Azores over the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM GMT.

Tropical Storm Isaac Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102024
900 PM GMT Sun Sep 29 2024
 
The increasingly hostile sea surface temperatures, strong vertical
wind shear, and dry air wrapping around the southern half of Isaac
has weakened the cyclone. The last few visible stallite images
before sundown suggest that the vortex could be tilted, with the
low-level center displaced southwest of the upper-level vortex.
Additionally, deep convection has become less symmetric since the
last advisory, with convection in the southern semicircle likely
being cut off by the aformentioned dry air. This structure is
indicative of a progressing extratropical transition, as Isaac
continues to interact with a baroclinic frontal zone to its
northeast. The initial intensity is set to 60 kt for this advisory,
which is a blend of the subjective and objective satellite
classifications.
 
Tropical Storm Isaac is forecast to continue its extratropical
transition and become a fully extratropical cyclone on Monday. This
is in agreement with model-diagnosed thermodynamics that maintain a
warm core until this time, in addition to simulated IR satellite
data from the GFS and ECMWF models. The intensity forecast is
similar to the previous forecast and shows a steady decrease in
maximum sustained winds through the forecast period.
 
The forward motion of the cyclone continues to be northeastward
(050/10 kt). This general motion is forecast to continue for the
next day or so as Isaac continues to be steered by a mid-level
trough to its west. This mid-level trough will steer Isaac towards
the north-northeast beyond 36 hr. Beyond 96 hr, global model data
indicates Isaac will be absorbed by a more potent extratropical
cyclone just southeast of Iceland. The track forecast is again
adjusted eastward from the previous advisory.
