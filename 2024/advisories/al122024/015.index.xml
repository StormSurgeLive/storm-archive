...MAJOR HURRICANE KIRK EXPECTED TO CONTINUE STRENGTHENING...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.5N 44.5W
ABOUT 1370 MI...2205 KM WNW OF THE CABO VERDE ISLANDS
ABOUT 1140 MI...1835 KM ENE OF THE LESSER ANTILLES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...125 MPH...205 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...952 MB...28.12 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located 
near latitude 19.5 North, longitude 44.5 West. Kirk is moving toward 
the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this general motion is 
expected over the day or so with a gradual turn to the 
north-northwest and north by this weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 125 mph (205 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Kirk is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Strengthening is forecast over 
the next couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles
(350 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 952 mb (28.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are beginning to spread outward and
could affect portions of the Leeward Islands and Bermuda by this
weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
1100 PM AST Wed Oct 02 2024
 
Kirk has undergone an impressive period of rapid intensification 
over the past 24 h.  Recent satellite imagery showed a ragged eye, 
with multiple deep bursts of convection rotating in the eyewall.  
Overshooting tops are obscuring the eye now, but it would not be 
surprising if it clears again soon.  As noted in the special 
advisory, the subjective Dvorak satellite estimates have climbed but 
were constrained.  The initial intensity is nudged up to 110 kt for 
this advisory, closest to the T6.0 data-T number from SAB.  The 
hurricane has strengthened 55 kt since 0300 UTC last night, which 
means Kirk lands at a Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale.

The hurricane continues to be steered by the subtropical ridge to 
the northwest at an estimated 310/9 kt.  Little has changed in the 
track forecast reasoning.  On Friday night or Saturday, Kirk is 
expected to gradually turn north-northwestward to northward and 
accelerate in the flow between a deep-layer trough and the weakening 
subtropical ridge.  Later in the weekend, Kirk is expected to 
continue accelerating north-northeastward to northeastward.  Few 
changes have been made to the latest official track forecast, which 
lie close to various consensus aids.

Given Kirk's recent rapid intensification, conditions appear 
conducive for further strengthening during the next day or so.  The 
short-term forecast is therefore above all of the guidance now, 
peaking at 130 kt in 24 h.  By Friday, the vertical wind shear is 
expected to increase and gradually weaken Kirk through the remainder 
of the forecast period.  As the hurricane moves more poleward, 
Kirk's tropical-storm-force winds are predicted to grow and send 
large swell westward to the northern Leeward Islands and the Bahamas 
over the weekend.

Tropical Storm Leslie Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
1100 PM AST Wed Oct 02 2024
 
Geostationary satellite and microwave images indicate that the 
system has become better organized with convective bands wrapping 
about two-thirds of the way around the center.  A partial ASCAT pass 
from around 2230 UTC showed winds very close to tropical storm 
force northeast of the center.  Since the system has continued to 
become organized since the ASCAT pass, the initial intensity is 
increased to 35 kt, making the cyclone Tropical Storm Leslie.    
This intensity estimate is also in agreement with a 2.5 Dvorak 
classification from TAFB.

Leslie is moving slowly to the west at about 5 kt.  A continued slow 
westward to west-northwestward motion is expected during the next 2 
to 3 days as Leslie remains steered by a weak mid-level ridge to its 
north.  Beyond that time, a slightly faster motion to the northwest 
is predicted as the storm moves on the western periphery of the 
ridge and approaches a broad trough over the central Atlantic.  The 
models are in fair agreement overall, and the NHC track forecast 
lies near the middle of the guidance envelope.

Leslie is currently in a moderate wind shear environment due to the 
outflow from major Hurricane Kirk to its northwest.  However, the 
shear is expected to lessen while Leslie remains over warm waters 
and in a moist environment.  These condition should support steady 
strengthening during the next few days, and the official intensity 
forecast is a little higher than the previous one.  Beyond a few 
days, Leslie is predicted to move over Kirk's prior track and 
associated cool wake, and into a slightly drier air mass.  These 
conditions could cause the intensity to level off.  The new 
forecast is in best agreement with the latest HCCA guidance.
