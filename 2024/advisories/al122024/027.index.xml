NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
1100 PM AST Sat Oct 05 2024
 
...KIRK SENDING LARGE SWELL TOWARDS THE U.S. EAST COAST...
...INCREASED RISK OF LIFE-THREATENING RIP CURRENTS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...31.3N 49.3W
ABOUT 1345 MI...2165 KM WSW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...115 MPH...185 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 5 DEGREES AT 20 MPH...31 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...951 MB...28.09 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the Azores should monitor the progress of Kirk.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located 
near latitude 31.3 North, longitude 49.3 West. Kirk is moving toward 
the north near 20 mph (31 km/h).  On Sunday, Kirk should accelerate 
and turn toward the north-northeast and northeast, followed by an 
east-northeastward to eastward motion on Monday and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 115 mph (185 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Kirk is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Weakening is forecast through 
early next week, but Kirk will remain a large hurricane for the next 
couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles
(370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 951 mb (28.09 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Bermuda, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, and portions of the east
coast of the United States. These swells are expected to spread
northward along the east coast of the United States, Atlantic Canada
on Sunday, and to the Azores on Monday. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
500 PM AST Sat Oct 05 2024
 
Kirk continues to have a tight inner core, with deep convection 
wrapping around the center. The eye has continued to become more 
cloud filled, as shear increases over the system. The latest 
subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates have held 
mostly steady with this cycle, and the initial intensity is held at 
105 kt.
 
Kirk continues to move northward and increase forward speed with an 
estimated motion of (005/17 kt) between a trough located over the 
west-central Atlantic and a subtropical ridge in the east Atlantic.  
Model track guidance remains tightly clustered, although there has 
been a slight shift southward as the system transitions and becomes 
post-tropical. The NHC forecast track shows the center of Kirk 
passing just to the north of the Azores on Monday as an 
extratropical cyclone, and then moving across the northeastern 
Atlantic and over western Europe by the middle of next week. The 
official NHC track forecast is very similar to the previous 
advisory, with a slight nudge southward towards the end of the 
period following the consensus model trends.
 
Wind shear has started to increase over Kirk this afternoon, but the 
inner core has been able to remain intact. However, the environment 
will only continue to become more hostile as wind shear continues to 
increase, with drier mid-level air, and cooler sea surface 
temperatures. Therefore, steady weakening is forecast through early 
next week. The system should lose tropical characteristics and 
transition to a strong extratropical cyclone around 60 h. The 
updated NHC intensity forecast is near the previous one in the near 
term, with a slightly faster rate of weakening in agreement with the 
latest HCCA and simple consensus aids.
 
Kirk is producing ocean swells that are propagating far away from
the hurricane. These large swells will likely increase the risk of
dangerous surf and rip currents across the Leeward Islands, Bermuda,
and the Greater Antilles beginning later today, much of the U.S.
East Coast, Atlantic Canada, and the Bahamas by Sunday, and the
Azores by Monday. For more information on this hazard, see products
issued by your local weather office.

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 PM AST Sat Oct 05 2024
 
Leslie continues to produce deep convection this afternoon. Although 
the convective pattern depicts some southwesterly shear  
starting to impact the system. Subjective and objective Dvorak 
satellite intensity estimates range from 55-70 kt. Given the deep 
convection over the center still, the initial intensity is held at 
70 kt for this advisory, although that could be a little generous.
 
The hurricane continues to move slowly west-northwestward at 300/7 
kt, steered along the southwestern portion of a mid-level 
subtropical ridge over the eastern Atlantic. The ridge will continue 
to steer Leslie the next several days with a turn more 
northwestward, with an increase in forward speed the next several 
days. Model track guidance still remains fairly tightly clustered 
and the NHC track forecast is very close to the previous one.
 
Leslie may be able to fend off the shear over the next 12 hours or 
so, however by Sunday, the system will start to move into increasing 
wind shear and mid-level dry air. The NHC forecast track also takes 
Leslie over Kirk's cold wake. There continues to be some model 
differences on how significantly, and quickly weakening will occur. 
The NHC forecast follows the latest consensus aids downward trends, 
and is slightly lower than the previous forecast.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Milton was
located near latitude 22.9 North, longitude 95.1 West.  Milton is
moving toward the north-northeast near 5 mph (7 km/h).  An eastward
to east-northeastward motion is forecast during the next couple of
days, followed by a faster northeastward motion.  On the forecast
track, Milton is forecast to move across the Gulf of Mexico and
approach the west coast of the Florida Peninsula by midweek.

Tropical Storm Milton Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
1000 PM CDT Sat Oct 05 2024
 
Milton appears to be slowly organizing.  The storm has a central
dense overcast pattern with deep convection persisting near and to
the south of the center.  The latest satellite intensity estimates
range from 30 to 50 kt, and based on that data, the initial
intensity is nudged upward to 40 kt.  Milton is a small storm at the
moment, with its estimated tropical-storm-force winds extending only
about 30 n mi from the center.
 
The storm is moving slowly northeastward at 4 kt as it remains
embedded in weak steering currents.  However, a shortwave trough is
expected to push southward into the northern Gulf of Mexico.  This
trough and a reinforcing one should cause Milton to turn eastward on
Sunday, and move progressively faster to the east and then northeast
across the Gulf of Mexico and Florida during the next 3 to 4 days.
The guidance is in fair agreement, but there is some spread in
both direction and timing.  Overall, the models have trended slower
this cycle, and the NHC track forecast has been adjusted in that
direction.  This prediction is near the middle of the guidance
envelope and close to the typically best-performing consensus aids.
It should be noted that the average NHC track error at day 4 is
around 150 miles.  Therefore, users are reminded to not focus on the
exact track.
 
Milton will likely steadily strengthen during the next few days as
it moves over the very warm Gulf of Mexico waters, remains in a
moist air mass, and in a diffluent and low to moderate wind shear
environment.  The big question is how quickly and by how much will
the storm intensify.  There is a big spread in the intensity
models, with the hurricane regional models notably above the
global and statistical-dynamical models.  The new intensity
forecast is a little higher than the previous one and in good
agreement with the HCCA and IVCN aids.  It is hoped that the models
will come into better agreement tomorrow after ingesting some of the
Hurricane Hunter aircraft observations.
 
Regardless of the details, there is increasing confidence that a
powerful hurricane with life-threatening hazards will be affecting
portions of the Florida west coast around the middle of next week.
Residents there should closely monitor this system and listen
to local officials.
 
Key Messages:
1.  Milton is forecast to quickly intensify while it moves
eastward to northeastward across the Gulf of Mexico and be at or
near major hurricane strength when it reaches the west coast of the
Florida Peninsula mid week.  Hurricane Watches could be issued as
early as late Sunday for portions of Florida.
 
2.  There is an increasing risk of life-threatening storm surge and
wind impacts for portions of the west coast of the Florida
Peninsula beginning late Tuesday or Wednesday. Residents in these
areas should ensure they have their hurricane plan in place, follow
any advice given by local officials, and check back for updates to
the forecast.
 
3. Areas of heavy rainfall will impact portions of Florida Sunday
and Monday well ahead of Milton, with heavy rainfall more directly
related to the system expected later on Tuesday through Wednesday
night. This rainfall brings the risk of flash, urban, and areal
flooding, along with minor to moderate river flooding.
