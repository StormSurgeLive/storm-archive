DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Kirk was 
located near latitude 15.3 North, longitude 39.2 West. Kirk is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this 
motion is expected to continue with a gradual turn more 
northwestward over the next several days.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is anticipated and 
Kirk should become a hurricane by tonight, and a major hurricane in 
a couple of days.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles (315 km) 
from the center. A PIRATA Buoy (13008) earlier this morning 
measured a sustained wind of 40 mph (64 km/h), and a gust to 51 mph 
(83 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 988 mb (29.18 inches). A 
PIRATA Buoy 13008 earlier reported a minimum pressure of 990.2 mb 
(29.24 inches).
