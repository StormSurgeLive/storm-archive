Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Tue Oct 1 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Kirk, located over the central tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms located over the southwestern <br/>
Caribbean Sea are associated with a trough of low pressure. <br/>
Environmental conditions could support some gradual development of <br/>
this system, and a tropical depression could form towards the end of <br/>
this week or this weekend while it moves generally northwestward <br/>
over the northwestern Caribbean Sea and into the Gulf of Mexico. <br/>
Interests along the U.S. Gulf Coast should continue to monitor the <br/>
progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL91):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to show signs organization in <br/>
association with a broad area of low pressure located a few hundred <br/>
miles south-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands.  Environmental <br/>
conditions appear conducive for further development of this system, <br/>
and a tropical depression is expected to form during the next <br/>
couple of days while it moves slowly westward over the eastern <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Kirk Advisory Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
1100 AM AST Tue Oct 01 2024
 
...NEARBY BUOY FINDS A STRONGER KIRK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.3N 39.2W
ABOUT 1010 MI...1630 KM W OF THE CABO VERDE ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...70 MPH...110 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...988 MB...29.18 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Kirk was 
located near latitude 15.3 North, longitude 39.2 West. Kirk is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this 
motion is expected to continue with a gradual turn more 
northwestward over the next several days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is anticipated and 
Kirk should become a hurricane by tonight, and a major hurricane in 
a couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles (315 km) 
from the center. A PIRATA Buoy (13008) earlier this morning 
measured a sustained wind of 40 mph (64 km/h), and a gust to 51 mph 
(83 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 988 mb (29.18 inches). A 
PIRATA Buoy 13008 earlier reported a minimum pressure of 990.2 mb 
(29.24 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Kirk Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Tropical Storm Kirk Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
500 AM AST Tue Oct 01 2024
 
Satellite imagery indicates that Kirk's structure hasn't changed 
very much over the past 6 h.  The infrared imagery consists of a 
large comma-shaped area of deep convection.  ASCAT data from Monday 
evening as well as a more recent 01/0416 AMSR2 image indicate that 
the center is near the northern edge of the convection.  The AMSR2 
image also indicates that the convective bands haven't become any 
better organized around the center over the past 6 h.  The latest 
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates range from 45 to 55 kt, and 
the latest objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS range from 49 
to 56 kt.  Given that the highest ASCAT vectors from around 0000 UTC 
were about 43 kt, and taking into account the recent intensity 
estimates, the initial intensity is set to 50 kt, which is unchanged 
from the previous NHC advisory.

Kirk is estimated to be moving west-northwestward, or 295/12 kt. 
This general motion should continue for the next day or so while 
Kirk moves around the southwestern periphery of a deep-layer 
subtropical ridge over the eastern Atlantic. A gradual turn toward 
the northwest is expected during the middle part of the week, 
followed by a recurvature to the north over the central Atlantic by 
the end of the forecast period.  The track guidance is in good 
agreement for the first couple days of the forecast, with a bit of 
spread noted thereafter.  The new NHC track forecast is similar to 
the previous official forecast through 72 h, and west of the 
previous forecast at days 4 and 5, close to the multi-model 
consensus aid TVCA.

Favorable environmental conditions are forecast to persist along 
Kirk's path through the next 4 days or so, with warm ocean waters, 
weak vertical wind shear and a relatively moist and unstable 
atmosphere.  Kirk has a broad structure with a large wind field.  
The tropical storm force radii are forecast to continue increasing 
through the forecast period.  This structure could limit Kirk's 
chances for rapid strengthening, despite the favorable environment. 
Little change has been made to the NHC intensity forecast, which 
calls for steady strengthening over the next 3 days.  The NHC 
intensity forecast is near the high end of the guidance envelope.  
Kirk is forecast to become a large, major hurricane over the open 
central Atlantic later this week.
