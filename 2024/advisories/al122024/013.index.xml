Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Wed Oct 2 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Kirk, located over the central tropical Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
newly-developed Tropical Depression Thirteen, located over the <br/>
eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
A broad trough of low pressure is producing disorganized areas of <br/>
showers and thunderstorms over the northwestern Caribbean Sea and <br/>
the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. Environmental conditions could <br/>
support some gradual development of this system, and a tropical <br/>
depression could form over the weekend as the broader disturbance <br/>
moves fully into the Gulf of Mexico. Interests along the U.S. Gulf <br/>
Coast should continue to monitor the progress of this system. <br/>
Regardless of development, locally heavy rains could occur over <br/>
portions of Mexico during the next several days and over portions <br/>
of the Florida Peninsula by the weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
Public Advisories on Tropical Depression Thirteen are issued under <br/>
WMO header WTNT33 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCPAT3.<br/>

...KIRK EXPECTED TO BECOME A LARGE AND FORMIDABLE MAJOR HURRICANE...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.9N 44.0W
ABOUT 1330 MI...2145 KM WNW OF THE CABO VERDE ISLANDS
ABOUT 1165 MI...1875 KM ENE OF THE LESSER ANTILLES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...975 MB...28.80 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located 
near latitude 18.9 North, longitude 44.0 West. Kirk is moving toward 
the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this general motion is 
expected over the day or so with a gradual turn more to the 
north-northwest and northward by this weekend. 

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 90 mph (150 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Strengthening is forecast over the next several 
days and Kirk is expected to become a major hurricane tomorrow. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles
(350 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 975 mb (28.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are beginning to spread outward and
could affect portions of Leeward Islands and Bermuda by this 
weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and 
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local 
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
1100 AM AST Wed Oct 02 2024

Kirk continues to intensify this morning. On geostationary satellite 
imagery convective bands continue to rotate around the eye seen 
earlier in microwave imagery, although this feature hasn't shown up 
yet on visible imagery. The subjective Dvorak estimates were a 
consensus T4.5/77 kt, and blending these estimates with somewhat 
lower objective intensity estimates, the intensity has been raised 
to 75 kt this advisory.
 
Kirk continues moving northwestward, or 305/10 kt. A gradual 
slowdown at a similar heading is expected over the next day or two 
as the hurricane remains steered by a subtropical ridge centered to 
its northeast. At the end of the week, Kirk will find itself between 
an increasingly eroded ridge to its east, and a digging upper-level 
trough to its west, and it is likely Kirk will be steered between 
these features, recurving northward, and then north-northeastward by 
the end of the forecast period. The latest NHC track forecast is 
very similar to the prior one, especially over the next several 
days, but is a little further northwest thereafter, blending the 
prior track forecast to the consensus aids TCVA and HCCA, though in 
general the track spread among the track guidance remains relatively 
low. 

Kirk appears poised to intensify quite a bit in the short-term now 
that shear has decreased as the hurricane remains over very warm 
ocean waters and plenty of deep-layer moisture. These favorable 
conditions should promote notable strengthening, and the latest NHC 
intensity forecast now shows Kirk becoming a major hurricane in 24 
h, and peaking as a 115 kt Category 4 hurricane in 48 h. Thereafter, 
southwesterly shear from the upper-level trough to its west could 
begin to increase, leading to a gradual weakening trend. The latest 
intensity forecast is a little higher than earlier, owing to 
somewhat higher intensity guidance aids this cycle, but still 
remains lower than some of the more bullish guidance (HAFS-B) but is 
roughly in line with HCCA this cycle. Kirk is also expected to 
continue growing in size with a larger than average radius of both 
tropical storm and hurricane-force wind radii as it recurves into 
the open Atlantic Ocean.

Tropical Depression Thirteen Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
800 PM CVT Wed Oct 02 2024
 
Tropical Depression Thirteen has become a little better organized 
since the last advisory, with improving circulation definition and 
convection continuing to curve cyclonically in a banded fashion on 
its western side. However, Dvorak intensity estimates have not 
changed much this afternoon, still at T2.5/35-kt from TAFB and 
T1.5/25-kt from SAB, so the initial intensity will remain 30 kt. 
 
The depression appears to be moving just south of due west following 
along from previous fixes with a current estimated motion at   260/7 
kt. This motion has resulted in a slight southward track shift from 
the previous forecast but remains close to the consensus aid TVCN. 
This motion should continue over the next day or so guided by a 
steering ridge to the north and enhanced convection along the 
southern semicircle potentially pulling it southward as the 
depression organizes. Track guidance then shows TD13 turning 
west-northwestward after 48 hours and ultimately northwestward 
towards the end of the forecast period as the ridge steering becomes 
more eroded on its western side. The track guidance was very 
similar to the previous cycle, albeit a touch further south in 5 
days, and the latest NHC track has been nudged a bit further south 
towards the end of the forecast. 
 
The forecast for this cycle shows a somewhat faster intensification 
rate than the prior advisory, with the system now becoming a 
hurricane in 48 hours, and peaking at 80 kt in 72 hours, due to 
decreasing shear and plenty of warm ocean waters and moisture early 
on in the forecast. The intensity guidance then proceeds to show the 
intensity plateauing after 72 hours as the system could encounter 
the edge of Hurricane Kirk's large area of ocean upwelling. Both 
HAFS-A/B show this potentially limiting the intensity in the longer 
term, but the NHC intensity forecast could be conservative if TD13 
ends up tracking further south than forecasted.
