NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Wed Oct 2 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Kirk, located over the central tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
A broad trough of low pressure is producing a large area of <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms from the southwestern <br/>
Caribbean Sea into the southern Gulf of Mexico. Environmental <br/>
conditions could support some gradual development of this system, <br/>
and a tropical depression could form over the weekend as the broader <br/>
disturbance moves fully into the Gulf of Mexico. Interests along the <br/>
U.S. Gulf Coast should continue to monitor the progress of this <br/>
system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL91):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to show signs of organization in <br/>
association with an area of low pressure located a few hundred miles <br/>
south-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands.  Environmental conditions <br/>
appear conducive for further development of this system, and a <br/>
tropical depression is expected to form during the next day or so <br/>
while it moves slowly westward over the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

<title>Hurricane Kirk Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
500 AM AST Wed Oct 02 2024

Satellite imagery over the past 6 to 12 hours indicates a gradual 
improvement in the organization of Kirk's central dense overcast.  
The low-level center is likely underneath the southern portion of 
the central convective area.  The cyclone is also growing in size.  
Convective banding in the southeast semicircle sprawls out a far 
distance away from the center.  The latest subjective intensity 
estimates from TAFB and SAB range from 65 to 77 kt, while objective 
intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS are ranging from 61 to 71 kt.  
The initial intensity is nudged up to 70 kt based on an average of 
the subjective estimates.

Kirk has been moving northwestward, or 305/12 kt.  A similar 
heading at perhaps a slightly slower forward speed is expected 
through Thursday as Kirk is steered by a subtropical ridge.  By the 
end of the week, Kirk will gradually turn northward in between an 
approaching deep-layer trough over the western Atlantic and a 
subtropical ridge to the east of the hurricane.  A turn toward the 
north-northeast is expected by the end of the weekend, and the 
models remain in good agreement on this scenario.  The new NHC 
track forecast is nearly unchanged from the previous one through 72 
h, but a bit west of the previous forecast beyond 72 h.  The NHC 
forecast is in best agreement with the TVCA consensus aid.

Favorable environmental conditions are forecast to continue for the 
next 60 to 72 hours as Kirk travels over warm sea-surface 
temperatures and within a relatively moist environment with weak 
deep-layer vertical wind shear.  These favorable conditions should 
allow for continued steady strengthening, and Kirk is forecast to 
become a major hurricane on Thursday.  By hour 96, Kirk is likely 
to experience stronger southwesterly wind shear, which should begin 
a weakening trend.  The latest intensity forecast is similar to the 
previous one and lies in the middle to upper portion of the 
guidance envelope.  Kirk is a large tropical cyclone and is expected
to grow into a very large and powerful major hurricane over the 
next couple of days.
