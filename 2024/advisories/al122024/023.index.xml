Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Fri Oct 4 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Kirk, located over the central subtropical Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
Tropical Storm Leslie, located over the eastern tropical Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located over the southwestern Gulf of <br/>
Mexico is producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  <br/>
Gradual development of this system is expected, and a tropical or <br/>
subtropical depression or storm is likely to form late this weekend <br/>
or early next week while the system moves eastward or northeastward <br/>
across the Gulf of Mexico.  Interests in the Florida Peninsula and <br/>
the Florida Keys should monitor the progress of this system.   <br/>
Regardless of tropical or subtropical development, locally heavy <br/>
rains could occur over portions of Mexico during the next day or <br/>
two, and over much of Florida late this weekend through the middle <br/>
of next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Far Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of  <br/>
Africa on Monday or Tuesday.  Some development of this system is <br/>
possible thereafter while it moves westward or west-northwestward <br/>
across the eastern tropical Atlantic. Interests in the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands should monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

...KIRK REMAINS A POWERFUL CATEGORY 4 HURRICANE OVER THE OPEN
ATLANTIC...
...LARGE SWELLS FROM KIRK EXPECTED TO REACH THE U.S. EAST COAST BY
SUNDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...25.0N 49.8W
ABOUT 975 MI...1565 KM ENE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 1610 MI...2585 KM WSW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...130 MPH...215 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 330 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...943 MB...27.85 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the Azores should monitor the progress of Kirk.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Kirk was located
near latitude 25.0 North, longitude 49.8 West. Kirk is moving toward
the north-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A turn to the north is 
expected on Saturday, followed by a faster northeastward motion 
Sunday and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Kirk is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Small intensity fluctuations are possible 
overnight, but steady weakening should begin on Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles
(350 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 943 mb (27.85 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Bermuda, and the Greater Antilles.  These swells are expected to
spread westward to the east coast of the United States, Atlantic
Canada, and the Bahamas Saturday night and Sunday, and the Azores on
Monday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.

<title>Hurricane Kirk Forecast Discussion Number 22</title>

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
500 PM AST Fri Oct 04 2024

Kirk has changed little in structure during the past several hours 
and remains an impressive hurricane with a well-defined eye inside 
a central dense overcast.  There has been no recent microwave 
imagery to determine if the apparent outer eyewall seen earlier is 
still there.  The various subjective and objective satellite 
intensity estimates are mostly near 115 kt, so the initial 
intensity for this advisory is set at that.
 
The initial motion is now 325/10.  Kirk is currently approaching a 
large break in the subtropical ridge caused by a deep-layer low 
centered near 33N 61W.  During the next 48 h, the hurricane should 
recurve through this break and accelerate northeastward into the 
mid-latitude westerlies.   After that time, the cyclone should move 
quickly east-northeastward across the northern and northeastern 
Atlantic.  The track guidance more or less is the same as seen in 
the previous advisory, with the exception of a southward nudge near 
96 h.  The new forecast track also has this nudge, but is otherwise 
little changed from the previous track.
 
Fluctuations in intensity are likely during the next 12 h due to the
possible eyewall replacement cycle.  After that, Kirk should 
encounter increasing southwesterly shear and move over cooler sea 
surface temperatures, which should cause a steady weakening. 
Extratropical transition is likely to begin between 60-72 h and be 
complete by 96 h, with Kirk becoming a strong extratropical cyclone 
over the northeastern Atlantic.  The new intensity forecast again 
follows the general trends of the intensity guidance, and is closest 
to the GFS model forecast during the extratropical stage.
 
Even though Kirk is expected to recurve over the open Atlantic, its
strong intensity and increasing size will result in large ocean
swells that will propagate far away from the hurricane. These swells
will likely increase the risk of dangerous surf and rip currents
across the Leeward Islands beginning this evening, Bermuda and the
Greater Antilles by Saturday, much of the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic
Canada, and the Bahamas by Sunday, and the Azores by Monday. For
more information on this hazard, see products issued by your local
weather office.

Tropical Storm Leslie Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 PM AST Fri Oct 04 2024
 
The convective structure of Leslie has become better organized this 
afternoon with a more symmetrical convective shield. There have not 
been any helpful microwave or scatterometer passes the last several 
hours to help evaluate the structure further. The latest subjective 
Dvorak satellite intensity estimates were T/3.5 and T/4.0, from TAFB 
and SAB respectively. Using a blend of these estimates, the initial 
intensity is set to 60 kt for this advisory.
 
Leslie is moving slowly west-northwestward at 290/6 kt, and this 
motion is expected to continue as the storm rounds the subtropical 
ridge anchored over the east Atlantic. Leslie should continue 
west-northwestward then turn more northwestward by the end of the 
weekend with a slight increase in forward speed through the end of 
the forecast period. The track guidance is fairly well clustered and 
the NHC track lies near the consensus aids.
 
The intensity forecast has become a little more uncertain with 
varying model solutions the last few model cycles, especially with 
the peak intensity and potential weakening towards the middle to end 
of the period. Northeasterly shear from Kirk has started to weaken 
over the system this afternoon, and that has likely aided the 
improved convective pattern. Leslie will be within a favorable 
atmospheric and oceanic environment for steady strengthening over 
the next 2 days or so. Beyond that time models begin to plateau the 
strengthening or start a weakening trend, as Leslie encounters some 
westerly shear and a drier air mass.  There is a notable difference 
between the GFS and ECMWF in how hostile the environment will be by 
five days, with the ECMWF showing more shear, a much drier air 
mass, and a much weaker Leslie.  One other issue is that the 
forecast track is expected to take Leslie over the cold wake left 
behind from Hurricane Kirk. Given the lowering intensity guidance 
and varying model solutions, the NHC intensity forecast has been 
adjusted downward, but still lies at the higher end of the guidance 
envelope. Additional adjustments to the intensity forecast may be 
needed on later advisories.
