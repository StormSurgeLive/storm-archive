DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 16.6 North, longitude 74.4 West. Beryl is moving
toward the west-northwest near 20 mph (31 km/h), and this general
motion should continue through today, followed by a turn more toward
the west tonight or Thursday.  On the forecast track, the center of
Beryl will move rapidly across the central Caribbean Sea and is
forecast to pass near or over Jamaica later today.  The center is
expected to pass near or over the Cayman Islands tonight or early
Thursday and move over the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico early Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Beryl is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some weakening is forecast during the next 
day or two.  However, Beryl is forecast to be at or near major 
hurricane intensity while it passes near Jamaica later today and 
the Cayman Islands tonight or early Thursday. Additional weakening 
is expected thereafter, though Beryl is forecast to remain a 
hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 946 mb (27.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast of
Jamaica within the warning area around midday.  Winds are expected
to first reach tropical storm strength later this morning, making
outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the Cayman Islands
tonight or early Thursday.  Winds are expected to first reach
tropical storm strength late this afternoon, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible along portions of the east coast
of the Yucatan Peninsula as early as late Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area along the
south coast of Hispaniola today.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the coast
of Belize by late Thursday or early Friday.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 6
to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along
the immediate coast of Jamaica.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the immediate
coast of the Cayman Islands.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above
ground level in areas of onshore winds along the southern coast of
Hispaniola.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3 to 5 feet
above ground level in areas of onshore winds along the east coast of
the Yucatan Peninsula within the hurricane watch area.
 
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8 
inches, with localized amounts of 12 inches, across Jamaica through 
this evening along with additional rainfall of 4 to 6 inches over 
the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti. This heavy rainfall is expected to 
cause life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides. 
 
Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with 
localized maxima of 6 inches over the Cayman Islands tonight into 
Thursday. Over the Yucatan Peninsula into northern Belize, Beryl is 
expected to produce rainfall totals of 2 to 6 inches with localized 
amounts of 8 inches, along with at least localized flash flooding, 
late Thursday through Friday.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf

SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are impacting the southern
coasts of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Jamaica and are expected to
impact the Cayman Islands later today through midweek.  Swell will
continue to affect the Windward and Leeward Islands during the next
day or so.  These swells are expected to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.

Hurricane Beryl Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022024
1100 PM EDT Tue Jul 02 2024
 
Both NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft have been
investigating Beryl this evening.  Data from the aircraft suggest
that Beryl hasn't weakened very much so far.  Flight-level winds
indicate that the intensity is still near 130 kt. Satellite- 
derived intensity estimates are below this value, and the
eye has become a little less well-defined on the imagery.
 
The rapid west-northwestward motion continues, at around 290/19 kt.
A strong mid-level ridge to the north of Beryl should continue to
steer the system on a west-northwestward heading across the central
and northwestern Caribbean for the next few days.  This motion
should bring the center near Jamaica in 12 to 24 hours, near the
Cayman Islands in 24 to 36 hours, and near the Yucatan Peninsula of
Mexico in 48 to 60 hours.  Beyond 72 hours, when Beryl should be
located over the western Gulf of Mexico, the track model spread
increases.  Therefore there is significant uncertainty in the 4-
and 5-day forecast points, when the system encounters a weakness in
the ridge.
 
There is also considerable uncertainty in the future intensity of
Beryl.  Vertical shear, associated with an upper-level low near the
Yucatan Channel, should increase over Beryl during the next day
or so.  Therefore some weakening seems likely during the next 48
hours.  However, the system should maintain hurricane strength
while it moves over the northwestern Caribbean.  Later in the
forecast period, when Beryl moves over the western Gulf of Mexico,
it is not clear how much the cyclone will re-intensify, but it
should at least be close to hurricane intensity around that time.
The official intensity forecast is on the high side of the model
guidance.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Devastating hurricane-force winds, life-threatening storm surge,
and damaging waves are expected in portions of Jamaica and the
Cayman Islands Wednesday and Wednesday night.  Residents in these
areas should listen to local government and emergency management
officials for preparedness and/or evacuation orders.
 
2. Heavy rainfall and life-threatening flash flooding are likely
over much of Jamaica and southern Hispaniola through late Wednesday.
 
3. Beryl is forecast to remain a hurricane when it approaches the
Yucatan Peninsula and Belize late Thursday, where hurricane and
tropical storm watches have been issued.
 
4. There remains uncertainty in the track and intensity forecast of
Beryl over the western Gulf of Mexico this weekend. Interests in the
western Gulf of Mexico should monitor the progress of Beryl.
