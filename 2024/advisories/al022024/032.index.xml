NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022024
1000 AM CDT Sat Jul 06 2024
 
...TROPICAL STORM WARNING ISSUED FOR PORTIONS OF THE WESTERN GULF
COAST...
...BERYL EXPECTED TO BE A HURRICANE NEAR LANDFALL IN TEXAS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1000 AM CDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...23.0N 92.3W
ABOUT 460 MI...740 KM SE OF CORPUS CHRISTI TEXAS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...997 MB...29.44 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is now in effect for the Texas coast south
of Baffin Bay to the mouth of the Rio Grande River.
 
The Meteorological Service of Mexico has issued a Tropical Storm
Warning for the northeastern coast of mainland Mexico from Barra el
Mezquital to the mouth of the Rio Grande.  The Meteorological
Service of Mexico has also discontinued the Hurricane Watch for the
northeastern coast of mainland Mexico from Barra el Mezquital to
the mouth of the Rio Grande.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* The Texas coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande River northward
to San Luis Pass
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* The Texas coast south of Baffin Bay to the mouth of the Rio
Grande River
* The northeastern coast of mainland Mexico from Barra el
Mezquital to the mouth of the Rio Grande River
 
A Storm Surge Watch is in effect for...
* The Texas coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande River northward
to High Island
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.
 
Interests elsewhere in northeastern Mexico and the Texas coast
should closely monitor the progress of Beryl. A Hurricane Warning
will likely be issued for a portion of the Texas coast this
afternoon.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area
outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by
your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beryl was
located near latitude 23.0 North, longitude 92.3 West. Beryl is
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). A turn to
the northwest is expected later today, followed by a turn toward
the north-northwest by Sunday night. On the forecast track, the
center of Beryl is expected to approach the Texas coast by late
Sunday into Monday morning.
 
Reports from NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft
indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h)
with higher gusts. Little change in strength is expected today.
However, strengthening is expected to begin tonight or on Sunday,
and Beryl is forecast to become a hurricane before it reaches the
Texas coast.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from the Hurricane Hunter
aircraft data is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the NHC website at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area
along in Texas by early Monday, with tropical storm conditions 
beginning Sunday night.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm
warning area in Texas and northeastern Mexico late Sunday or 
Sunday night.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Baffin Bay, TX to San Luis Pass, TX...3-5 ft
Corpus Christi Bay...3-5 ft
Matagorda Bay...3-5 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Baffin Bay, TX...2-4 ft
San Luis Pass, TX to High Island, TX...2-4 ft
Galveston Bay...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL:  Heavy rainfall of 5 to 10 inches with localized amounts
of 15 inches is expected across portions of the Texas Gulf Coast and
eastern Texas beginning late Sunday through the middle of next week. 
This rainfall will likely produce areas of flash and urban 
flooding, some of which may be locally considerable. Minor to 
isolated moderate river flooding is also possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Beryl, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?ero
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are expected to reach 
eastern Mexico and much of the Gulf Coast of the U.S. today. 
These swells are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather 
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Beryl Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022024
1000 AM CDT Sat Jul 06 2024
 
Recently, a convective burst has developed near the center of Beryl 
in the northwestern quadrant, and the low-level center is for the 
moment no longer exposed.  Tail Doppler radar data from the NOAA 
aircraft suggests that the cyclone has become better aligned 
vertically during the past few hours, likely due to the effects of 
this burst.  Reports from both NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft show that the central pressure is now near 997 mb, 
with the Air Force plane reporting severe turbulence in the 
convection. The initial intensity remains 50 kt for this advisory 
based on the flight-level and SFMR wind data from the two aircraft.
 
The initial motion is 300/10 kt.  Water vapor imagery shows a 
developing mid-latitude trough over the central United States that 
is opening a break in the subtropical ridge over Texas.  Beryl is 
expected to turn northwest later today, then turn northward by 
48-60 h into the break, with the center making landfall on the 
Texas coast. Recurvature to the northeast is subsequently expected 
after 72 h.  The forecast guidance has not changed much since the 
previous advisory, and the new forecast track is basically an update 
of the previous track.  The new track lies between the main 
consensus models and the HCCA corrected consensus model. 

Beryl remains in an area of about 15 kt of southerly vertical 
shear, and water vapor imagery shows mid- to upper-level dry air 
over the southern semicircle of the cyclone.  This combination 
suggests the possibility that the current convective burst will 
weaken later today.  After 24 h, the shear is forecast to diminish, 
and the intensity guidance is in good agreement that significant 
strengthening should occur.  Based on this, the intensity forecast 
shows only modest strengthening during the first 24 h, followed by 
intensification to hurricane strength before landfall in Texas.  
The peak intensity is based on the HWRF, HMON, HAFS-A and HAFS-B 
guidance.  After landfall, Beryl is expected to weaken, with 
the system forecast to decay to a remnant low pressure area by
120 h.
 
It is important to note that the average NHC track error at 48 
hours is about 70 miles and the average intensity error is close to 
one category.  Users are reminded to consider these uncertainties 
when using the forecast information.
 
 
Key Messages:

1. There is an increasing risk of damaging hurricane-force winds and 
life-threatening storm surge along portions of the lower and middle 
Texas coast late Sunday into Monday, where Hurricane and Storm Surge 
Watches are in effect. A Tropical Storm Warning is now in effect for 
portions of deep south Texas and additional warnings will likely be 
required later today. Interests in these areas should follow any 
advice given by local officials.

2. Flash and urban flooding, some of which may be locally 
considerable, is likely across portions of the Texas Gulf Coast and 
eastern Texas beginning late Sunday through the middle of next week.

3. Rip currents will cause life-threatening beach conditions through 
the weekend across much of the Gulf Coast. Beachgoers should heed 
warning flags and the advice of lifeguards and local officials
before venturing into the water.
