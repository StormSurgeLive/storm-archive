Tropical Depression Beryl Discussion Number  42
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022024
1000 PM CDT Mon Jul 08 2024
 
Beryl continues to move farther inland, and the center is now near 
the border of Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas. Although the wind and 
storm surge hazards have largely subsided, there continues to be a 
significant threat of heavy rainfall and tornadoes along the 
forecast track for the next day or so. Visit weather.gov for details 
on these hazards.
 
Beryl is expected to move swiftly northeastward while weakening,
and it is forecast to become a remnant low on Tuesday. This is the
last tropical cyclone discussion issued by the National Hurricane
Center on Beryl. Future information on this system can be found in
discussions issued by the Weather Prediction Center beginning at
400 AM CDT, under AWIPS header TCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KWNH, and
on the web at www.hurricanes.gov.
 
Rainfall forecasts for the United States can always be found at
https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/qpf/qpf2.shtml
and outlooks of flash flood risks can be found at
https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/qpf/excessive_rainfall_outlook_ero.php

Key Messages:

1. Local flash and urban flooding is expected across portions of 
northeast Texas, far southeastern Oklahoma, Arkansas, and southern 
Missouri through Tuesday. Minor to moderate river flooding is also 
possible. 

2. Use caution after Beryl passes. Deadly hazards remain including 
downed power lines and flooded areas. Ensure generators are 
properly ventilated to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. Exercise 
caution when using chainsaws and power tools, and drink plenty of 
water to avoid heat exhaustion.
