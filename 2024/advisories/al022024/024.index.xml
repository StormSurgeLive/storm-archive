DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 19.0 North, longitude 82.6 West. Beryl is moving
toward the west-northwest near 18 mph (30 km/h). A westward to west-
northwestward motion is expected during the next day or two, taking
the core of Beryl away from the Cayman Islands through this 
afternoon and over the Yucatan Peninsula early Friday. Beryl is 
expected to emerge over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico Friday 
night and move northwestward across the southwestern Gulf of 
Mexico on Saturday.
 
Reports from Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds are now near 115 mph      
(185 km/h) with higher gusts.  Beryl is a category 3 hurricane on 
the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Weakening is forecast 
during the next day or two, though Beryl is forecast to remain a 
hurricane until it makes landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles
(260 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force 
Reserve Hurricane Hunter data is 971 mb (28.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected to subside over portions of
the Cayman Islands during the next few hours, with tropical storm
conditions subsiding this afternoon.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area on
the Yucatan Peninsula tonight or early Friday.  Winds are expected
to first reach tropical storm strength later today, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area along
the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula as early as tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area of the Yucatan Peninsula late today.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm watch
area along portions of the coast of Belize by tonight or early
Friday.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2
to 4 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along
the immediate coast of the Cayman Islands.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3 to 5 feet
above ground level in areas of onshore winds along the east coast of
the Yucatan Peninsula within the hurricane warning area and by as
much as 1 to 3 feet above ground level along the west coast of the
Yucatan Peninsula in the tropical storm warning area.
 
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 6
inches over the Cayman Islands today. Over the Yucatan Peninsula,
Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 6 inches, with
localized amounts of 10 inches, later today into Friday. Scattered
instances of flash flooding are anticipated.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are currently impacting
portions of the coast of Jamaica, Cuba, and the Cayman Islands.
These swells are expected to spread to the Yucatan Peninsula and
portions of Central America later today and to eastern Mexico and
much of the Gulf Coast of the U.S. by late Friday. These swells are
expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Hurricane Beryl Forecast Discussion Number 24</title>

Hurricane Beryl Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022024
1100 AM EDT Thu Jul 04 2024

Beryl continues to weaken due to the effects of westerly shear.  
Radar data from the Cayman Islands shows that the eyewall is open 
to the south and that there is very little precipitation occurring 
in the southwestern semicircle.  This matches the asymmetric cloud 
pattern seen in satellite imagery.  Data from the NOAA and Air 
Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters support surface winds of 90-100 kt, 
and that the central pressure has risen to near 971 mb.  Based on 
this, the initial intensity is reduced to a possibly generous 100 
kt.  The initial wind radii have be modified downward based on the 
aircraft data.

The initial motion is 285/16.  There is little change in either the 
track forecast philosophy or the track forecast from the previous 
advisory. A large ridge centered over the southeastern U.S. should 
cause Beryl to move westward or west-northwestward during the next 
day or two, with the model guidance tightly clustered about a 
landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula just before 24 h and emerging into 
the southwestern Gulf of Mexico just after 36 h.  After that, Beryl 
should turn northwest toward a developing break in the subtropical 
ridge caused by a mid-latitude trough over the central United 
States. This general motion should continue until the cyclone makes 
landfall on the western Gulf coast near 96 h.  While the guidance 
has come into better agreement, there is a spread in the guidance 
landfall points from northeastern Mexico to the middle Texas coast, 
and users are reminded that the average error at day 4 is about 150 
miles.  Thus, it is still too early to pinpoint a specific region 
for the worst hazards.  The new official forecast is similar to, but 
a touch slower than, the previous forecast and it lies close to the 
consensus models.

Water vapor imagery continues to show a upper-level trough moving 
west-southwestward over the southern Gulf of Mexico, with 
westerly flow on the south side of this system helping to impart
moderate-to-strong shear over Beryl.  While the shear could 
decrease some during the next 24 h, it is unlikely to decrease 
enough to stop Beryl from steadily weakening until landfall on the 
Yucatan Peninsula.  This part of the new intensity forecast follows 
the trend of the intensity guidance.  Beryl should weaken more 
after landfall.  There is uncertainty in how much shear the cyclone 
may encounter over the Gulf of Mexico, but the guidance shows slow 
intensification during that time.  This is reflected in the new 
intensity forecast that brings the system back to hurricane strength 
right at landfall on the western Gulf coast.


Key Messages:

1. Strong winds, dangerous storm surge, damaging waves, and areas of 
flooding are occurring in the Cayman Islands where a Hurricane 
Warning remains in effect.

2. Hurricane-force winds, dangerous storm surge, and heavy rainfall 
are expected over portions of the Yucatan Peninsula beginning 
tonight as Beryl approaches that area as a hurricane. Hurricane and 
Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect for portions of that area.

3. There is an increasing risk of strong winds, storm surge, and 
heavy rainfall in portions of northeastern Mexico and southern Texas 
later this weekend. Interests in these areas should closely monitor 
the progress of Beryl and updates to the forecast.

4. Rip currents could cause life-threatening beach conditions 
beginning late Friday and continuing through the weekend across much 
of the Gulf coast.
