WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warning for the Yucatan Peninsula.

The Hurricane Watch in Texas has been extended eastward to San Luis 
Pass.

The Storm Surge Watch in Texas has been extended eastward to High 
Island. 
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* The Texas coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande northward
to San Luis Pass
* The northeastern coast from mainland Mexico from Barra el
Mezquital to the mouth of the Rio Grande
 
A Storm Surge Watch is in effect for...
* The Texas coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande northward
to High Island
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.
 
Interests elsewhere in northeastern Mexico and the Texas coast
should closely monitor the progress of Beryl. Additional watches
and warnings will likely be issued for portions of this area
on Saturday.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area
outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by
your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beryl was
located near latitude 21.7 North, longitude 90.2 West.  Beryl is
moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h) and this 
motion is expected to continue through early Saturday.  A turn 
to the northwest is expected later on Saturday, with the center of 
Beryl expected to approach the Texas coast by late Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is expected through early Saturday.  
Steady strengthening seems likely later in the weekend, and Beryl 
is forecast to become a hurricane before it reaches the coast. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.  An observations in Isla Perez has recently 
reported a sustained wind of 43 mph (69 km/h) with a gust of 57 mph 
(92 km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches) estimated from 
Air Force Hurricane Hunter observations. 
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the NHC website at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area
along the Gulf coast of northeastern Mexico and Texas by early
Monday, with tropical storm conditions beginning Sunday night.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Baffin Bay, TX to San Luis Pass, TX...3-5 ft
Corpus Christi Bay...3-5 ft
Matagorda Bay...3-5 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Baffin Bay, TX...2-4 ft
San Luis Pass, TX to High Island, TX...2-4 ft
Galveston Bay...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?peakSurge.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet
above ground level in areas of onshore winds along the west and
north coasts of the Yucatan Peninsula in the tropical storm
warning area. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Heavy rainfall of 5 to 10 inches with localized amounts
of 15 inches is expected across portions of the Texas Gulf Coast and
eastern Texas beginning late Sunday through midweek.  This rainfall
is likely to produce areas of flash and urban flooding.
 
Through early Saturday morning, Beryl is expected to produce
rainfall totals of 4 to 6 inches, with localized amounts of 10
inches, across the Yucatan Peninsula, with scattered instances of
flash flooding anticipated.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Beryl, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?ero
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are currently impacting
portions of the coast the Yucatan Peninsula. The swells are
expected to reach eastern Mexico and much of the Gulf Coast of the
U.S. by early Saturday. These swells are expected to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 AM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Beryl Forecast Discussion Number 30</title>

Tropical Storm Beryl Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022024
1000 PM CDT Fri Jul 05 2024
 
The center of Beryl has emerged over the southern Gulf of Mexico
just northwest of Progreso in the Yucatan Peninsula.  Surface
observations and NOAA aircraft Tail Doppler Radar data indicate
that the storm has become significantly titled with the low-level
center located to the southwest of the mid-level vortex, with most
of the showers and thunderstorms located closer to the mid-level
center.  The latest flight-level wind data from the Air Force
Hurricane Hunter aircraft support lowering the initial intensity to
50 kt.  The minimum pressure is now up to 996 mb.
 
Beryl has been moving west-northwestward at about 11 kt as the 
system remains steered by a mid-level ridge located over the 
southeastern U.S.  This motion should continue through early 
Saturday,  After that time, a gradual turn to the northwest with a 
decrease in forward speed is predicted as Beryl moves toward a 
weakness in the ridge caused by a trough over the south-central U.S. 
The models show a shortwave trough reinforcing the weakness late in 
the weekend, which could cause a turn more toward the north just 
before Beryl makes landfall.  The latest guidance has again shifted 
to the right and is a little faster than the previous cycle, and the 
NHC track forecast has been adjusted in those directions.  The new 
track forecast is very close to the latest GFS model prediction, 
which has been the best performer for Beryl up to this point.  
 
Since Beryl's structure has degraded significantly from its passage 
over the Yucatan, it likely will take a little time for the storm to 
recover.  However, the overall environmental conditions are 
conducive for strengthening with increasing water temperatures and 
decreasing vertical wind shear along the expected track.  In 
addition, the global models are suggesting that the upper-level wind 
pattern might become more diffluent before the system reaches the 
coast, which could aid in the intensification process.  Although the 
global models are not particularly skillful in predicting the 
maximum winds of a tropical cyclone, they do assess the 
environmental factors well and the ECMWF and GFS models show 
significant decreases in the system's minimum pressure over the next 
couple of days.  Based on these fundamental factors, the NHC 
intensity forecast calls for slow strengthening during the next day 
or so, followed by more steady strengthening until Beryl makes 
landfall.  This forecast is similar to the previous one.
 
Based on the latest forecast, the Hurricane Watch has been extended 
eastward along the Texas coast.  It is important to note that the 
average NHC track error at 60-72 hours is 80-100 miles and the 
average intensity error is close to one category.  Users are 
reminded to consider these uncertainties when using the forecast 
information.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. There is an increasing risk of damaging hurricane-force winds and 
life-threatening storm surge in portions of northeastern Mexico and 
the lower and middle Texas Coast late Sunday and Monday, where 
Hurricane and Storm Surge Watches are in effect. Additional watches 
and warnings may be required on Saturday. Interests in these areas 
should follow any advice given by local officials.
 
2. Flash and urban flooding are possible across portions of the
Texas Gulf Coast and eastern Texas from Sunday through the middle of
next week.
 
3. Rip currents will cause life-threatening beach conditions through
the weekend across much of the Gulf Coast. Beachgoers should heed
warning flags and the advice of lifeguards and local officials
before venturing into the water.
