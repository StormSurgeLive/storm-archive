DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 16.9 North, longitude 75.3 West. Beryl is moving
toward the west-northwest near 20 mph (31 km/h), and this general
motion should continue through today, followed by a turn more toward
the west tonight or Thursday.  On the forecast track, the center of
Beryl will move rapidly across the central Caribbean Sea and is
forecast to pass near or over Jamaica later today.  The center is
expected to pass near or over the Cayman Islands tonight or early
Thursday and move over the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico early Friday.
 
Reports from NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Beryl is a category 4 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some weakening is forecast 
during the next day or two.  However, Beryl is forecast to be at or 
near major hurricane intensity while it passes near Jamaica later 
today and the Cayman Islands tonight or early Thursday. Additional 
weakening is expected thereafter, though Beryl is forecast to 
remain a hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185
miles (295 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure reported by the Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft is 952 mb (28.11 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast of
Jamaica within the warning area around midday.  Winds are expected
to first reach tropical storm strength during the next several 
hours, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.

Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains 
are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds 
indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be 
even greater.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the Cayman Islands
tonight or early Thursday.  Winds are expected to first reach
tropical storm strength late this afternoon, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible along portions of the east coast
of the Yucatan Peninsula as early as late Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area along the
south coast of Hispaniola today.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the coast
of Belize by late Thursday or early Friday.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 6
to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along
the immediate coast of Jamaica.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the immediate
coast of the Cayman Islands.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above
ground level in areas of onshore winds along the southern coast of
Hispaniola.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3 to 5 feet
above ground level in areas of onshore winds along the east coast of
the Yucatan Peninsula within the hurricane watch area.
 
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches, with localized amounts of 12 inches, across Jamaica through
this evening along with additional rainfall of 4 to 6 inches over
the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti. This heavy rainfall is expected to
cause life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides.
 
Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with
localized maxima of 6 inches over the Cayman Islands tonight into
Thursday. Over the Yucatan Peninsula into northern Belize, Beryl is
expected to produce rainfall totals of 2 to 6 inches with localized
amounts of 8 inches, along with at least localized flash flooding,
late Thursday through Friday.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are impacting the southern
coasts of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Jamaica and are expected to
impact the Cayman Islands later today through midweek.  Swell will
continue to affect the Windward and Leeward Islands during the next
day or so.  These swells are expected to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.

Hurricane Beryl Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022024
500 AM EDT Wed Jul 03 2024
 
Beryl appears to be experiencing the effects of moderate 
northwesterly shear.  The eye has become cloud-filled, and the 
hurricane's cloud pattern is elongated northeast to southwest.  
Still, very deep convection is present in the eyewall and the core  
of the hurricane remains intact.  Data from an earlier  Air Force 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft had maximum flight-level winds of 136 kt 
and a slightly higher minimum central pressure than the previous 
advisory.  Therefore, the initial intensity is held at 125 kt, 
pending data from the next set of reconnaissance aircraft.
 
The intensity forecast remains rather challenging.  The uncertainty 
starts right away due to noticeable discrepancies in the short-term 
evolution of the upper-level flow in the global models.  The ECMWF 
global model predicts strong westerly flow from an upper-level 
trough that would significantly increase the shear over Beryl in the 
next 24 h and result in rapid weakening.  However, the GFS model 
shows a very different upper-level wind pattern that would result in 
only moderate vertical wind shear near Beryl and thus, less 
weakening.  The official forecast shows a blend of these solutions 
and general weakening through 48 h.  It should be emphasized that 
Beryl is expected to remain a dangerous hurricane as it passes near 
Jamaica in the next 12 h, the Cayman Islands early on Thursday, and 
the Yucatan Peninsula on Friday.  As Beryl emerges over the warm 
waters of the Gulf Mexico in about 72 h, an upper-level ridge is 
forecast to build closer to the storm, and more numerical model 
guidance is showing restrengthening.  The official forecast now 
shows Beryl becoming a hurricane before making landfall along the 
western coast of the Gulf of Mexico, and lies a bit below the model 
consensus.

The hurricane has continued its rapid pace across the central 
Caribbean at around 285/17 kt.  A strong mid-level ridge centered 
over the southeastern US is expected to continue steering Beryl 
generally west-northwestward at a decreasing speed for the next 
couple of days or so.  The core of the hurricane should pass near or 
just south of Jamaica later today, with little change to the 
forecast near Yucatan.  Over the Gulf of Mexico, the storm should 
turn northwestward as a trough moving over the central US weakens 
the ridge over the weekend.  There is still significant uncertainty 
in the long-term track forecast, as numerical models showing 
stronger storms in the Gulf of Mexico are generally on the northern 
side of the guidance envelope and weaker storms on the southern 
side.  The NHC track forecast lies in the middle of the guidance 
envelope, near the multi-model consensus aids and is very similar to 
the previous forecast.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Devastating hurricane-force winds, life-threatening storm surge,
and damaging waves are expected in portions of Jamaica beginning 
this afternoon and in the Cayman Islands early on Thursday.  
Residents in these areas should listen to local government and 
emergency management officials for preparedness and/or evacuation 
orders.
 
2. Life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides from heavy rainfall 
are expected over much of Jamaica and southern Haiti through today.
 
3. Beryl is forecast to remain a hurricane when it approaches the
Yucatan Peninsula and Belize late Thursday, where hurricane and
tropical storm watches have been issued.
 
4. There remains uncertainty in the track and intensity forecast of
Beryl over the western Gulf of Mexico this weekend. Interests in the
western Gulf of Mexico should monitor the progress of Beryl.
