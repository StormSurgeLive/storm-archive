...EXPECTED TO BE A HURRICANE NEAR LANDFALL IN TEXAS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 700 AM CDT...1200 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...22.7N 91.9W
ABOUT 495 MI...795 KM SE OF CORPUS CHRISTI TEXAS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* The Texas coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande northward
to San Luis Pass
* The northeastern coast of mainland Mexico from Barra el
Mezquital to the mouth of the Rio Grande
 
A Storm Surge Watch is in effect for...
* The Texas coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande northward
to High Island
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.
 
Interests elsewhere in northeastern Mexico and the Texas coast
should closely monitor the progress of Beryl. Additional watches
and warnings will likely be issued for portions of this area later
today.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area
outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by
your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beryl was
located near latitude 22.7 North, longitude 91.9 West. Beryl is
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). A turn to
the northwest is expected later today and then north-northwestward
by Sunday night. On the forecast track, the center of Beryl is
expected to approach the Texas coast by late Sunday into Monday
morning.
 
Reports from NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Little change in strength is expected today, but 
strengthening is expected to begin by Sunday, and Beryl is forecast 
to become a hurricane before it reaches the Texas coast.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from the Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft data is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the NHC website at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area
along the Gulf coast of northeastern Mexico and Texas by early
Monday, with tropical storm conditions beginning Sunday night.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Baffin Bay, TX to San Luis Pass, TX...3-5 ft
Corpus Christi Bay...3-5 ft
Matagorda Bay...3-5 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Baffin Bay, TX...2-4 ft
San Luis Pass, TX to High Island, TX...2-4 ft
Galveston Bay...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL:  Heavy rainfall of 5 to 10 inches with localized amounts
of 15 inches is expected across portions of the Texas Gulf Coast and
eastern Texas beginning late Sunday through midweek.  This rainfall
is likely to produce areas of flash and urban flooding, some of
which may be locally considerable in nature.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Beryl, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?ero
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are currently impacting
portions of the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula. The swells are
expected to reach eastern Mexico and much of the Gulf Coast of the
U.S. shortly. These swells are expected to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

Tropical Storm Beryl Discussion Number  31
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022024
400 AM CDT Sat Jul 06 2024
 
Beryl's structure this morning is a shadow of its former self in the 
Caribbean, with the low-level center partially exposed and displaced 
south of the best mid-level rotation and deep convection. The final 
couple of Air Force Hurricane Hunter fixes indicated the pressure 
was rising, though the aircraft did also observe 850-mb flight level 
winds of 65 kt, which still supports maintaining an initial 
intensity of 50 kt. This value is between the Dvorak intensity 
estimates provided by TAFB and SAB. Beryl's wind radii were adjusted 
some from to a combination of aircraft, scatterometer, and synthetic 
aperture radar wind data.
 
Beryl is currently estimated to be moving west-northwest at 
300/10-kt. Soon, the tropical storm is expected to turn more 
northwestward and gradually slow down as the steering currents 
evolve due to both a weakness developing in the subtropical ridge to 
the north, in addition to an upper-level low positioned west of 
Beryl also imparting more poleward steering. After the significant 
rightward shifts in the track guidance over the past day or so, the 
latest cycle has come into better agreement very near the previous 
NHC forecast track. In fact, the latest forecast track is very close 
to the prior forecast, roughly between the latest GFS and ECMWF 
forecasts. This track also splits the difference between the 
reliable TVCN and HCCA consensus aids. However, it should be noted 
that there still remains a fair amount of across-track spread in the 
latest ECMWF ensemble guidance at the time Beryl is forecast to make 
landfall in Texas on Monday. 
 
The poor structure of the tropical storm this morning does not favor 
much intensification in the short-term, and I suspect it will take 
another day or so for convection to reorganize around the inner core 
of Beryl. This process could also be slowed by a decent amount of 
dry air in the southern Gulf of Mexico being imported into Beryl's 
circulation by about 20 kt of southerly wind shear. However, this 
wind shear decreases to under 10 kt per SHIPS guidance after 24 
hours as Beryl moves into very warm 29-30 C sea-surface 
temperatures. The upper-level low currently inducing the southerly 
shear will also become positioned farther southwest of Beryl, in a 
quadrant more favorable for TC intensification.  Thus, strengthening 
is expected to begin on Sunday with the rate of intensification 
likely to increase in the final 24 hours before landfall, in 
agreement with the most favorable conditions being prescribed by the 
GFS and ECMWF models. The intensity forecast remains on the high 
side of the guidance envelope, but is also similar to the prior 
forecast and shows Beryl becoming a hurricane before reaching the 
Texas coast on Monday.
 
It is important to note that the average NHC track error at 60 hours
is about 80 miles and the average intensity error is close to one
category.  Users are reminded to consider these uncertainties when
using the forecast information.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. There is an increasing risk of damaging hurricane-force winds and
life-threatening storm surge in portions of northeastern Mexico and
the Texas Coast late Sunday into Monday, where Hurricane and Storm
Surge Watches are in effect. Additional watches and warnings may be
required later today. Interests in these areas should follow any
advice given by local officials.

2. Flash and urban flooding, some of which may be locally 
considerable in nature, is likely across portions of the Texas Gulf 
Coast and eastern Texas beginning late Sunday through midweek.
 
3. Rip currents will cause life-threatening beach conditions through
the weekend across much of the Gulf Coast. Beachgoers should heed
warning flags and the advice of lifeguards and local officials
before venturing into the water.
