DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beryl was
located near latitude 26.8 North, longitude 95.5 West. Beryl is
moving toward the north-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  This
general motion is expected to continue through tonight, with a turn
toward the north forecast on Monday. On the forecast track, the
center of Beryl is expected to make landfall on the middle Texas
coast early Monday. Beryl is forecast to turn northeastward and move
farther inland over eastern Texas and Arkansas late Monday and
Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is expected, and Beryl is forecast to
become a hurricane again tonight. Additional strengthening is 
expected before Beryl reaches the Texas coast early Monday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 988 mb (29.18 inches) 
based on Air Force Reserve dropsonde data.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the NHC website at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area by early Monday.  Winds are first expected to reach tropical
storm strength by late today, making outdoor preparations difficult
or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch areas by
early Monday, with tropical storm conditions beginning by tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm
warning areas in south Texas starting within the next few hours.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm
warning area along the upper Texas coast early Monday.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Port O'Connor, TX to San Luis Pass, TX...4-7 ft
Matagorda Bay...4-7 ft
San Luis Pass, TX to High Island, TX...4-6 ft
Galveston Bay...4-6 ft
Mesquite Bay, TX to Port O'Connor, TX...3-5 ft
High Island, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?peakSurge.

RAINFALL:  Heavy rainfall of 5 to 10 inches with localized amounts 
of 15 inches is expected across portions of the middle and upper 
Texas Gulf Coast and eastern Texas through Monday night. 
Considerable flash and urban flooding as well as minor to isolated 
major river flooding is expected.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Tropical Storm Beryl, please see the National 
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?ero
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes could occur along the middle and upper
Texas Coast through tonight, and across eastern Texas into Louisiana
and Arkansas on Monday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Beryl are expected to affect eastern
Mexico and much of the Gulf Coast of the U.S. during the next day
or two.  These swells are expected to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Beryl Forecast Discussion Number 36</title>

Tropical Storm Beryl Discussion Number  36
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022024
1000 AM CDT Sun Jul 07 2024
 
Beryl has become better organized this morning.  Satellite images
show deep convection becoming more symmetric around the center, and
Brownsville radar has been showing an eyewall forming, although 
still open on the northwest side.  An Air Force Reserve Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft recently reported maximum flight-level winds of 62 
kt with the central pressure falling to 992 mb, so the initial wind 
speed is raised to 55 kt.
 
Further intensification is likely as Beryl moves over very warm
waters within light shear conditions.  Rapid intensification is a
distinct possibility if the core can become isolated from the dry 
air that has been inhibiting intensification during the last day or 
so. While there are no changes to the intensity forecast based on 
the latest guidance, we are expecting Beryl to be intensifying up 
until landfall early Monday, and people should be preparing for the
possibility of a category 2 hurricane landfall.
 
Beryl continues to move northwestward at 9 kt.  The storm 
should turn north-northwest this afternoon and make landfall 
along the middle Texas coast early on Monday.  The new forecast 
is very close to the previous one, just a shade to the east. After 
Beryl moves inland, the latest guidance still shows the system 
accelerating farther northeastward and become a post-tropical 
cyclone.  This should bring the threat of flash flooding well into 
Missouri.


Key Messages:

1.  There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation 
along the coast of Texas from the north entrance to the Padre Island 
National Seashore to Sabine Pass, including Matagorda Bay and 
Galveston Bay.  Residents in those areas should follow any advice 
given by local officials and follow evacuation orders.

2. Beryl is forecast to bring damaging hurricane-force winds to 
portions of the Texas coast tonight and early Monday. A Hurricane 
Warning is in effect from Baffin Bay to San Luis Pass. Preparations 
should be rushed to completion before tropical storm conditions 
begin late today.

3. Flash and urban flooding, some of which may be locally 
considerable, is expected across portions of the middle and upper 
Texas Gulf Coast and eastern Texas today through Monday night. 
River flooding is also expected.

4. Rip currents will cause life-threatening beach conditions through 
Monday across much of the Gulf Coast. Beachgoers should heed warning 
flags and the advice of lifeguards and local officials before 
venturing into the water.
