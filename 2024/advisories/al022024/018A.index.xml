DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located 
near latitude 16.3 North, longitude 73.5 West.  Beryl is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 22 mph (35 km/h), and this general 
motion should continue through today, followed by a turn more toward 
the west tonight or Thursday.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Beryl will move rapidly across the central Caribbean Sea and is 
forecast to pass near or over Jamaica on later today.  The center is 
expected to pass near or over the Cayman Islands tonight or early 
Thursday and approach the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico Thursday 
night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Beryl is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Weakening is forecast during the next day or 
two.  However, Beryl is forecast to be at or near major hurricane 
intensity while it passes near Jamaica later today and the Cayman 
Islands tonight. Additional weakening is expected thereafter, though 
Beryl is forecast to remain a hurricane in the northwestern 
Caribbean.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185
miles (295 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Hurricane Hunter
aircraft observations is 946 mb (28.00 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast of 
Jamaica within the warning area around midday.  Winds are expected 
to first reach tropical storm strength later this morning, making 
outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the Cayman Islands 
tonight or early Thursday.  Winds are expected to first reach 
tropical storm strength late this afternoon, making outside 
preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible along portions of the east coast
of the Yucatan Peninsula by late Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area along the
south coast of Hispaniola today.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the coast
of Belize by late Thursday or early Friday.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 6
to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along
the immediate coast of Jamaica.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above 
normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the immediate 
coast of the Cayman Islands.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above
ground level in areas of onshore winds along the southern coast of
Hispaniola.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3 to 5 feet
above ground level in areas of onshore winds along the east coast of
the Yucatan Peninsula within the hurricane watch area.
 
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Hurricane Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of
4 to 8 inches, with localized maxima of 12 inches, across Jamaica
and southwestern Haitian Peninsula through late today. Beryl
will also produce rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches with isolated
amounts of 10 inches across Barahona Peninsula in southwest
Dominican Republic. Isolated totals of 6 inches or more are also
anticipated across the mountainous terrain in the central Dominican
Republic. This rainfall is likely to cause flash flooding and
mudslides.
 
Beryl is also expected to produce rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches
with localized maxima of 6 inches over the Cayman Islands today
into Thursday. Over the Yucatan Peninsula into northern Belize,
Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with
localized maxima of 6 inches in the northeastern Yucatan Peninsula
Thursday into Friday.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are impacting the southern 
coasts of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Jamaica and are expected to 
impact the Cayman Islands later today through midweek.  Swell will 
continue to affect the Windward and Leeward Islands during the next 
day or so.  These swells are expected to cause life-threatening surf 
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local 
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Hurricane Beryl Forecast Discussion Number 18</title>

Hurricane Beryl Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022024
1100 PM EDT Tue Jul 02 2024
 
Both NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft have been
investigating Beryl this evening.  Data from the aircraft suggest
that Beryl hasn't weakened very much so far.  Flight-level winds
indicate that the intensity is still near 130 kt. Satellite- 
derived intensity estimates are below this value, and the
eye has become a little less well-defined on the imagery.
 
The rapid west-northwestward motion continues, at around 290/19 kt.
A strong mid-level ridge to the north of Beryl should continue to
steer the system on a west-northwestward heading across the central
and northwestern Caribbean for the next few days.  This motion
should bring the center near Jamaica in 12 to 24 hours, near the
Cayman Islands in 24 to 36 hours, and near the Yucatan Peninsula of
Mexico in 48 to 60 hours.  Beyond 72 hours, when Beryl should be
located over the western Gulf of Mexico, the track model spread
increases.  Therefore there is significant uncertainty in the 4-
and 5-day forecast points, when the system encounters a weakness in
the ridge.
 
There is also considerable uncertainty in the future intensity of
Beryl.  Vertical shear, associated with an upper-level low near the
Yucatan Channel, should increase over Beryl during the next day
or so.  Therefore some weakening seems likely during the next 48
hours.  However, the system should maintain hurricane strength
while it moves over the northwestern Caribbean.  Later in the
forecast period, when Beryl moves over the western Gulf of Mexico,
it is not clear how much the cyclone will re-intensify, but it
should at least be close to hurricane intensity around that time.
The official intensity forecast is on the high side of the model
guidance.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Devastating hurricane-force winds, life-threatening storm surge,
and damaging waves are expected in portions of Jamaica and the
Cayman Islands Wednesday and Wednesday night.  Residents in these
areas should listen to local government and emergency management
officials for preparedness and/or evacuation orders.
 
2. Heavy rainfall and life-threatening flash flooding are likely
over much of Jamaica and southern Hispaniola through late Wednesday.
 
3. Beryl is forecast to remain a hurricane when it approaches the
Yucatan Peninsula and Belize late Thursday, where hurricane and
tropical storm watches have been issued.
 
4. There remains uncertainty in the track and intensity forecast of
Beryl over the western Gulf of Mexico this weekend. Interests in the
western Gulf of Mexico should monitor the progress of Beryl.
