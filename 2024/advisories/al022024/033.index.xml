DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beryl was
located near latitude 23.9 North, longitude 93.0 West. Beryl is
moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this motion 
should continue through Sunday.  A turn toward the north-northwest 
is expected Sunday night, with a turn toward the north on Monday.  
On the forecast track, the center of Beryl will approach the Texas 
coast on Sunday and Sunday night and then make landfall on the 
Texas coast on Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is expected, and Beryl is forecast to become a 
hurricane again Sunday or Sunday night before it reaches the Texas 
coast.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the NHC website at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area by early Monday.  Winds are first expected to reach
tropical storm strength by late Sunday, making outdoor preparations
difficult or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch areas
in Texas by early Monday, with tropical storm conditions beginning
by late Sunday or Sunday night.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm
warning areas in Texas and northeastern Mexico late by Sunday or
Sunday night.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Mesquite Bay, TX to Sargent, TX...4-6 ft
Matagorda Bay...4-6 ft
Sargent, TX to San Luis Pass, TX...3-5 ft
N Entrance Padre Island NS, TX to Mesquite Bay, TX...3-5 ft
Corpus Christi Bay...3-5 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to N Entrance Padre Island NS, TX...2-4 
ft
San Luis Pass, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft
Galveston Bay...2-4 ft
Sabine Pass, TX to Cameron, LA...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL:  Heavy rainfall of 5 to 10 inches with localized amounts
of 15 inches is expected across portions of the Texas Gulf Coast and
eastern Texas beginning late Sunday through midweek.  This rainfall
will likely produce areas of flash and urban flooding, some of which
may be locally considerable. Minor to isolated moderate river
flooding is also possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Beryl, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?ero

TORNADOES: A few tornadoes could occur along the Texas Coast Sunday 
afternoon and Sunday night.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Beryl are expected to affect eastern 
Mexico and much of the Gulf Coast of the U.S. during the next few 
days.  These swells are expected to cause life-threatening surf and 
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local 
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Beryl Forecast Discussion Number 33</title>

WTNT42 KNHC 062041
TCDAT2
 
Tropical Storm Beryl Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022024
400 PM CDT Sat Jul 06 2024
 
Beryl's convective organization has increased since the last 
advisory, with a ragged band forming in the western semicircle.  
However, this band is best organized around what appears to be a 
mid-level center to the north or northeast of the low-level center. 
Earlier aircraft data indicated that the maximum winds were near 50 
kt and the central pressure was in the 997-999 mb range, and since 
that time various objective intensity estimates have shown little 
change.  Thus, the initial intensity remains 50 kt.  The next 
aircraft missions into the cyclone should arrive around 2300-0000Z.  
Beryl is still being affected by shear and dry air entrainment, 
which helped produce a large arc cloud that was visible for most of 
the day to the south and southwest of the convection.
 
The initial motion is now 310/11 kt.  Water vapor imagery 
continues to show a developing mid-latitude trough over the central 
United States that is opening a break in the subtropical ridge over 
Texas.  Beryl should move northwestward for the next 24 h or so, 
then gradually turn north and move into the break.  This motion 
should lead to the cyclone making landfall on the Texas coast 
between 36-48 h.  Recurvature to the northeast is subsequently 
expected after 60-72 h.  There has been a little bit of a northward 
shift in the guidance and track, due mainly to a more northward 
initial position.  While this has produced only a small change in 
the forecast landfall location, the landfall time is now a few 
hours earlier than in the previous advisory.  It should be noted 
that some erratic motion could occur tonight due to possible center 
reformations.

While Beryl remains in an area of southerly vertical shear and mid- 
to upper-level dry air, the convection has been persistent during 
the past several hours.  The shear is forecast to decrease by 
Sunday morning, which should allow Beryl to re-intensity as 
shown by all of the guidance.  The intensity forecast calls for 
Beryl to regain hurricane status Sunday or Sunday night, and to 
reach an intensity of around 75-kt near the time of the Texas 
landfall.  This intensity is based on the regional hurricane models, 
which have landfall intensities ranging from 65-85 kt.  After 
landfall, Beryl is expected to weaken, with the system forecast to 
decay to a remnant low pressure area by 96 h.
 
It is important to note that the average NHC track error at 36
hours is about 50-60 miles and the average intensity error is close 
to one category.  Users are reminded to consider these uncertainties
when using the forecast information.
 
 
Key Messages:

1.  There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation 
late Sunday night and Monday along the coast of Texas from the north 
entrance to the Padre Island National Seashore to San Luis Pass. 
Residents in that area should follow any advice given by local 
officials and follow evacuation orders. 

2. Beryl is forecast to bring damaging hurricane-force winds to 
portions of the lower and middle Texas coast late Sunday night and 
Monday. A Hurricane Warning is now in place from Baffin Bay to 
Sargent. Preparations should be rushed to completion before tropical 
storm conditions begin late Sunday. 
 
3. Flash and urban flooding, some of which may be locally 
considerable, is likely across portions of the Texas Gulf Coast and 
eastern Texas beginning late Sunday through the middle of next week. 
River flooding is also possible. 

4. Rip currents will cause life-threatening beach conditions through 
the weekend across much of the Gulf Coast. Beachgoers should heed 
warning flags and the advice of lifeguards and local officials
before venturing into the water.
