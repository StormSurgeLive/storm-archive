DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 20.4 North, longitude 87.6 West. Beryl is moving
toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h). A west-
northwestward motion is expected during the next day or so, with the
center expected to cross the northern Yucatan Peninsula today. Beryl 
is expected to emerge over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico tonight 
and then move northwestward toward northeastern Mexico and southern 
Texas by the end of the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 100 mph (160 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Rapid weakening is expected as Beryl moves 
farther inland and crosses the Yucatan Peninsula today, but slow 
re-intensification is expected once Beryl moves back over the Gulf 
of Mexico.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105
miles (165 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC, 
and on the NHC website at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are occurring in the hurricane warning
area on the Yucatan Peninsula and will continue this morning.  
Tropical storm conditions are occurring elsewhere in the hurricane 
warning area.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area along
the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula this morning.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area of the Yucatan Caribbean coast this morning and over the
Yucatan Gulf coast later today.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm watch
area along portions of the coast of Belize this morning.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 4 to
6 feet above ground level in areas of onshore winds along the east
coast of the Yucatan Peninsula within the hurricane warning area
and by as much as 1 to 3 feet above ground level along the west
coast of the Yucatan Peninsula in the tropical storm warning
area. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and 
destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: Through today Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals
of 4 to 6 inches, with localized amounts of 10 inches, across the
Yucatan Peninsula, with scattered instances of flash flooding
anticipated.
 
Heavy rainfall of 4 to 8 inches with locally higher amounts is
expected across portions of northeastern Mexico and South Texas by
Sunday into the coming week.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?ero
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are currently impacting
portions of the coast of Cuba, the Cayman Islands, and the
Yucatan Peninsula.  The swells are expected to reach eastern Mexico
and much of the Gulf Coast of the U.S. by late today. These swells
are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

Hurricane Beryl Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022024
400 AM CDT Fri Jul 05 2024
 
Beryl is nearing landfall in the Yucatan Peninsula this morning. 
After unexpectedly intensifying some last night against continued 
shear, Beryl has plateaued or filled a bit. The last few fixes from 
the Air Force Reserve Reconnaissance mission indicated the pressure 
rose 9 mb while the peak 700-mb wind in the final NE leg out of 
Beryl were down to 102 kt with lower SFMR values. In addition, the 
aircraft was no longer reporting an eyewall and the presentation of 
Beryl's inner core from radar out of Cancun, Mexico has become more 
degraded. On satellite, the hurricane has also become more 
amorphous, with a lack of an eye signature on infrared imagery, and 
evidence of southerly shear continuing to undercut its outflow. The 
initial intensity this advisory was adjusted to 95 kt, which is 
still higher than the satellite intensity estimates, out of respect 
of the earlier recon data.
 
The hurricane appears to now be moving more west-northwestward this 
morning, estimated at 285/13 kt. Beryl should maintain this 
west-northwest heading as it crosses the Yucatan Peninsula today and 
emerges over the Gulf of Mexico by tonight. Thereafter, the 
subtropical ridge north of Beryl that has been steering it for many 
days now will become eroded in the western Gulf of Mexico from a 
long-wave trough located over the Central U.S. In addition, an 
upper-level low seen retrograding westward in the Gulf of Mexico 
could also impart more poleward steering in the western Gulf of 
Mexico. How sharply Beryl turns poleward from 36-72 h will likely 
depend on the storm's vertical depth, with a more vertically deep 
system more likely to feel the ridge weakness and upper-level flow. 
In fact, that scenario has been highlighted by the last few cycles 
of the ECMWF ensembles which show stronger solutions on the north 
side of the track envelope. The overall guidance this cycle has also 
made a notable shift northward and is a bit slower than earlier, and 
the NHC forecast track has been shifted in that direction, quite 
close to the consensus aid TVCN. However, it is not quite as far 
north as the latest ECMWF or GFS tracks, and further adjustments in 
that direction may be necessary later today.
 
The intensity forecast for the next 24 hours is straightforward, as 
the small core of Beryl should quickly weaken over the Yucatan after 
it moves inland, likely into a tropical storm before it emerges over 
the Gulf of Mexico. However, it is after this period where the 
intensity forecast becomes more tricky. It will likely take a bit of 
time for Beryl's convective structure to recover in the Gulf of 
Mexico, and initially there will still be some residual southerly 
shear. However, both the GFS- and ECMWF-based SHIPS guidance shows 
shear dropping under 10 kt after 48 hours, while the storm traverses 
29-30 C sea-surface temperatures. Such an environment should favor 
strengthening, and the raw model output from the GFS and ECMWF 
suggests significant deepening as Beryl approaches the coastline of 
northeastern Mexico and south Texas. Somewhat surprisingly, the 
hurricane-regional models are more subdued and suggest less 
intensification this cycle, but these models have been oscillating 
between stronger and weaker solutions. The latest NHC intensity 
forecast will show a bit more intensification than the prior 
advisory, which is on the high end of the intensity guidance, but 
more in line with the expected favorable environment as Beryl 
approaches landfall.
 
Users are reminded that the average NHC track error at day 3 is 
around 100 miles, and it remains too soon to pinpoint where the 
largest impacts will be. However, watches for portions of 
northeastern Mexico and South Texas will likely be required later 
today.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane-force winds, dangerous storm surge, and heavy rainfall 
are beginning to occur across the Yucatan Peninsula within the 
hurricane warning area.  Residents there should shelter in place 
through the passage of these life-threatening conditions today. 

2. There is an increasing risk of strong winds, storm surge, and
heavy rainfall in portions of northeastern Mexico and southern Texas
late this weekend. Interests in these areas should closely monitor
the progress of Beryl and updates to the forecast.  Hurricane and
Tropical Storm Watches will likely be issued later today.
 
3. Rip currents could cause life-threatening beach conditions
beginning late today and continuing through the weekend across much
of the Gulf coast.
