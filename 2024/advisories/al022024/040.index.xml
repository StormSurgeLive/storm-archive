WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

The Storm Surge Warning has been discontinued from Port O'Connor to 
Mesquite Bay, TX
 
The Hurricane Warning from Mesquite Bay northward to Port O'Connor 
has been discontinued.

The Hurricane Warning from north of Port O'Connor to Port Bolivar 
has been changed to a Tropical Storm Warning.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

* Port O'Connor to Sabine Pass, including Matagorda Bay and 
Galveston Bay

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* The Texas coast from north of Port O'Connor northward to Sabine

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected within the warning area.
 
A Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening
inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline. For 
a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.  This is a life-threatening situation.  Persons
located within these areas should take all necessary actions to
protect life and property from rising water and the potential for
other dangerous conditions. 
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beryl was
located by NWS radar data near latitude 29.8 North, longitude 95.7 
West. Beryl is moving toward the north-northeast near 13 mph (20 
km/h). A turn toward the northeast with an increase in forward 
speed is expected tonight and Tuesday. On the forecast track, the 
center of Beryl will move over eastern Texas today, then move 
through the Lower Mississippi Valley into the Ohio Valley on 
Tuesday and Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Steady weakening is forecast, and Beryl is expected to 
become a post-tropical cyclone on Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center. Houston Hobby Airport recently reported a wind 
gust of 84 mph (135 km/h), and Bush Intercontinental Airport 
recently reported a wind gust of 83 mph (134 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 984 mb (29.06 inches) 
based on surface observations.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the NHC website at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions with damaging wind gusts will 
continue within the tropical storm warning area for the next 
several hours.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Freeport, TX to High Island, TX...4-6 ft
Galveston Bay...4-6 ft
High Island, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...3-5 ft
Matagorda, TX to Freeport, TX...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?peakSurge.

RAINFALL:  Heavy rainfall of 5 to 10 inches with localized amounts 
of 15 inches is expected across portions of the Upper Texas Coast 
and eastern Texas today into tonight. Considerable flash and urban 
flooding as well as minor to isolated major river flooding is 
expected.

Heavy rainfall of 3 to 5 inches, with locally higher amounts 
possible, is expected across portions of far southeastern Oklahoma, 
Arkansas and southern Missouri tonight into Tuesday. 

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Tropical Storm Beryl, please see the National 
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?ero

For a list of rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated 
this storm, see the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS2 with the 
WMO header ACUS42 KWBC or at the following link: 
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc2.html
 
TORNADOES: Several tornadoes are possible through tonight across 
parts of east Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Beryl are expected to affect eastern
Mexico and much of the northern and western Gulf Coast of the U.S. 
during the next day or so. These swells are expected to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Beryl Forecast Discussion Number 39</title>

Hurricane Beryl Discussion Number  39
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022024
400 AM CDT Mon Jul 08 2024
 
The strengthening forecast by the regional hurricane models began
in earnest just after the last advisory was issued.  Doppler radar
and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft data indicate that
Beryl regained hurricane strength near 04Z, and intensification
continued until the just-occurred landfall of the 28 n mi wide eye 
on the Texas coast.  The landfall central pressure was near 979 mb, 
and the maximum winds were near 70 kt.
 
The initial motion is 355/10. Beryl should move northward for the
next 12 h through a break in the subtropical ridge, with the
center moving through eastern Texas.  After that, the cyclone
should turn northeastward with an increase in forward speed, with
the cyclone accelerating across the lower Mississippi Valley and
into the Ohio Valley until dissipation occurs between 72-96 h.
The new forecast track is similar to the previous forecast.
 
Now that Beryl is moving inland, it should quickly weaken, with the
system becoming a tropical storm in the next few hours and a
tropical depression in a little over 24 hours.  After that, the
cyclone should merge with a frontal system over Mississippi Valley
and become an extratropical low before it dissipates.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. There is a continuing danger of life-threatening storm surge
inundation along the coast of Texas from Mesquite Bay to Sabine
Pass, including Matagorda Bay and Galveston Bay. Residents in those
areas should follow any advice given by local officials.
 
2. Beryl is bringing damaging hurricane-force winds to portions of
the Texas coast this morning. A Hurricane Warning is in effect from
Mesquite Bay to Port Bolivar.
 
3. Considerable flash and urban flooding is expected today into 
tonight across portions of the middle and upper Texas Gulf Coast and 
eastern Texas. Minor to isolated major river flooding is also 
expected.
 
4. Rip currents will cause life-threatening beach conditions through 
Tuesday across much of the Gulf Coast. Beachgoers should heed 
warning flags and the advice of lifeguards and local officials 
before venturing into the water.
