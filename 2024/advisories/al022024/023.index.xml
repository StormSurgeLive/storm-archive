<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems: <br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Beryl, located to the southeast of Grand Cayman Island.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Caribbean Sea (AL96):<br/>
A fast-moving tropical wave located over the eastern Caribbean Sea <br/>
continues to produce an area of disorganized shower and thunderstorm <br/>
activity. Development, if any, of this system should be slow to <br/>
occur while it moves quickly westward to west-northwestward at 20 to <br/>
25 mph across the Caribbean Sea during the next several days. This <br/>
system is then forecast to cross the Yucatan Peninsula and enter the <br/>
southwestern Gulf of Mexico by early next week where some <br/>
development could occur. Gusty winds and locally heavy rainfall are <br/>
possible across portions of the Greater Antilles over the next few <br/>
days.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 18.5 North, longitude 81.0 West. Beryl is moving
toward the west-northwest near 20 mph (31 km/h). A westward to west-
northwestward motion is expected during the next day or two, taking
the core of Beryl just south of the Cayman Islands early today and
over the Yucatan Peninsula early Friday. Beryl is expected to emerge
over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico Friday night and turn
northwestward.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 120 mph (195 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Beryl is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Weakening is forecast during 
the next day or two. However, Beryl is forecast to be near major 
hurricane intensity today as it passes by the Cayman Islands. 
Additional weakening is expected thereafter, though Beryl is 
forecast to remain a hurricane until it makes landfall on the 
Yucatan Peninsula.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 968 mb (28.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the Cayman Islands
soon, with tropical storm conditions ongoing.

Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area on
the Yucatan Peninsula late today or early Friday.  Winds are 
expected to first reach tropical storm strength later today, making
outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area along
the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula as early as late today.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area of the Yucatan Peninsula late today.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm watch
area along portions of the coast of Belize by late today or early
Friday.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2
to 4 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along
the immediate coast of the Cayman Islands.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet
above ground level in areas of onshore winds along the east coast of
the Yucatan Peninsula within the hurricane warning area and by as
much as 1 to 3 feet above ground level along the west coast of the
Yucatan Peninsula in the tropical storm warning area.
 
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.

RAINFALL:  Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 6 
inches over the Cayman Islands today. Over the Yucatan Peninsula, 
Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 6 inches, with 
localized amounts of 10 inches, later today into Friday. Scattered 
instances of flash flooding are anticipated. 

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are currently impacting
portions of the coast of Jamaica, Cuba, and the Cayman Islands.
These swells are expected to spread to the Yucatan Peninsula and
portions of Central America later today and to eastern Mexico and
much of the Gulf Coast of the U.S. by late Friday. These swells are
expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.

<title>Hurricane Beryl Forecast Discussion Number 23</title>

Hurricane Beryl Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022024
500 AM EDT Thu Jul 04 2024

Satellite images indicate that Beryl continues to have a large area 
of strong convection near the center, although the overall cloud 
pattern has become less symmetric.  This matches the radar imagery 
from Grand Cayman which shows a well-defined eyewall on the 
northern side but remains open on the southern side.  There isn't 
much reason to believe that the gradual filling seen in the last 
aircraft mission has stopped, and the initial wind speed is set to 
105 kt, a bit lower than what the last aircraft data supported.  
The NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunters should be in the cyclone 
within a few hours for a better intensity estimate.

Beryl appears to be moving west-northwestward or 285/17 kt.  
Overall, there are no significant changes to the track forecast.  A 
large ridge centered over the southeastern U.S. should cause Beryl 
to move westward or west-northwestward during the next couple of 
days.  Model guidance is tightly clustered on a course toward the 
Yucatan Peninsula early Friday and emerging into the southern Gulf 
of Mexico early Saturday.  The western periphery of the ridge is 
forecast to weaken due to a series of shortwaves moving over the 
Central Plains, causing Beryl to slow down and turn northwestward 
this weekend.  While there isn't an atypical amount of track spread 
by the time Beryl impacts the western Gulf Coast early next week, 
the average error at day 4 is about 150 miles, so it is too early to 
pinpoint a specific region for the worst hazards.  The new NHC 
forecast is close to the model consensus and the previous forecast.

Water vapor images show a upper-level trough moving west- 
southwestward over the southern Gulf of Mexico, helping to impart 
moderate-to-strong shear over Beryl.  While the hurricane has been 
an over-performer so far, this magnitude of shear should cause 
notable weakening over the next day or so, but Beryl is expected to 
still be a hurricane near the Yucatan tomorrow.  After emerging into 
the Gulf of Mexico, Beryl will likely have a couple of days to 
re-strengthen over warm waters with light or moderate shear.  Almost 
all of the model guidance show the system near hurricane strength as 
Beryl approaches the western Gulf Coast, and so does the official 
forecast.  The NHC intensity forecast is basically the same as the 
previous one, but should be considered of low confidence due to the 
inherent uncertainties of intensity forecasts in moderate shear.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Strong winds, dangerous storm surge, damaging waves, and areas of 
flooding are expected to occur in the Cayman Islands today where a 
Hurricane Warning remains in effect.
 
2. Hurricane-force winds, dangerous storm surge, and heavy rainfall
are expected over portions of the Yucatan Peninsula and Belize
beginning tonight as Beryl approaches that area as a hurricane. 
Hurricane and Tropical Storm Warnings are now in effect
for portions of that area.
 
3. There remains uncertainty in the track and intensity forecast of
Beryl over the western Gulf of Mexico this weekend. Interests in
eastern Mexico and southern Texas should monitor the progress of
Beryl.  Regardless of the exact track, rip currents could cause
life-threatening beach conditions beginning late Friday and
continuing through the weekend across much of the Gulf coast.
