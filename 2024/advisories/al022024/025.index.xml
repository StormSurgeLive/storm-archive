DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 19.5 North, longitude 84.3 West. Beryl is moving
toward the west-northwest near 20 mph (31 km/h). A westward to west-
northwestward motion is expected during the next day or so, with 
the center expected to make landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula of 
Mexico early Friday.  Beryl is expected to emerge over the 
southwestern Gulf of Mexico Friday night and move northwestward 
across the southwestern Gulf of Mexico on Saturday and Saturday 
night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 110 mph (175 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Slow weakening is forecast before the center makes 
landfall, with additional weakening expected while Beryl crosses 
the Yucatan Peninsula.  Slow re-intensification is expected when 
Beryl moves over the Gulf of Mexico.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles
(260 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 974 mb (28.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area on the Yucatan Peninsula tonight or early Friday.  Winds are
expected to first reach tropical storm strength as early as this
evening, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area along
the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula as early as tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area of the Yucatan Peninsula tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm watch
area along portions of the coast of Belize by tonight or early
Friday.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3 to
5 feet above ground level in areas of onshore winds along the east
coast of the Yucatan Peninsula within the hurricane warning area
and by as much as 1 to 3 feet above ground level along the west
coast of the Yucatan Peninsula in the tropical storm warning area.
 
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 6
inches, with localized amounts of 10 inches, later today into Friday
across the Yucatan Peninsula. Scattered instances of flash flooding
are anticipated across the Yucatan Peninsula.  Rainfall will be
diminishing across the Cayman Islands this evening.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are currently impacting
portions of the coast of Jamaica, Cuba, the Cayman Islands, the 
Yucatan Peninsula.  The swells are expected to reach eastern Mexico 
and much of the Gulf Coast of the U.S. by late Friday. These swells 
are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM EDT.

Hurricane Beryl Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022024
500 PM EDT Thu Jul 04 2024

The Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft that left the storm 
around 17Z reported that the central pressure had risen to near 974 
mb, and also reported flight-level and SFMR winds supporting an 
intensity of 95 kt.  Since that time, as happened yesterday 
afternoon, despite the ongoing shear the eye has become better 
defined in both satellite imagery and in radar data from Grand 
Cayman and Cuba.  Given this increase in central core organization, 
the initial intensity will be held at 95 kt pending the arrival of 
the next aircraft near 00Z.  Satellite imagery also shows that the 
outflow has become better defined in the northeastern semicircle.
 
The initial motion is 285/17, although the last several satellite 
images suggest a westward wobble is in progress.  There is again 
little change in either the track forecast philosophy or the track 
forecast from the previous advisory. A large ridge centered over 
the southeastern U.S. should cause Beryl to move westward or 
west-northwestward during the next day or so, with the model 
guidance tightly clustered about a landfall on the Yucatan 
Peninsula in 12-18 h and emerging into the southwestern Gulf of 
Mexico at around 30 h.  After that, Beryl should turn northwest 
toward a developing break in the subtropical ridge caused by a 
mid-latitude trough over the central United States. This general 
motion should continue until the cyclone makes landfall on the 
western Gulf coast between 72-96 h.  There is still some spread in 
the track guidance regarding a landfall location, with the range of 
possibilities from northeastern Mexico to the middle Texas coast.
Users are reminded that the average track forecast error at day 3 
is about 100 miles and at day 4 is about 150 miles, and so it is 
still too early to pinpoint a specific region for the worst hazards. 
The new official forecast is a little north of the previous 
forecast through 24 h and similar to the previous forecast after 
that.
 
It is unclear whether the current developments with the hurricane 
core and outflow are temporary or a sign that the westerly shear 
has somewhat abated.  The intensity forecast follows the premise 
that the shear has not fully abated and that Beryl will weaken 
before landfall.  However, even the intensity guidance that 
forecasts weakening keeps Beryl at hurricane strength at landfall 
on the Yucatan Peninsula.  Additional weakening should occur while 
the center is over land.  Over the Gulf of Mexico, the guidance 
does not forecast a lot of strengthening, but conditions appear 
generally favorable and the intensity forecast continues to show 
Beryl at hurricane strength before landfall on the western Gulf 
coast.  It should be noted that the dynamical models suggest that 
the best chance for re-intensification could be during the last 
12-18 hr before the western Gulf landfall, with the storm slow to 
intensify before that time.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane-force winds, dangerous storm surge, and heavy rainfall
are expected over portions of the Yucatan Peninsula beginning
tonight as Beryl approaches that area as a hurricane. Hurricane and
Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect for portions of that area.
 
2. There is an increasing risk of strong winds, storm surge, and
heavy rainfall in portions of northeastern Mexico and southern Texas
later this weekend. Interests in these areas should closely monitor
the progress of Beryl and updates to the forecast.
 
3. Rip currents could cause life-threatening beach conditions
beginning late Friday and continuing through the weekend across much
of the Gulf coast.
