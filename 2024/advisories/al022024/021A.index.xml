DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located
just offshore of the southwest part of Jamaica near latitude 17.8 
North, longitude 78.3 West. Beryl is moving toward the 
west-northwest near 20 mph (31 km/h). A westward to 
west-northwestward motion is expected during the next day or 
two, taking the core of Beryl just south of Cayman Islands tonight 
and over the Yucatan Peninsula late Thursday night and Friday.  
Beryl is expected to emerge over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico 
Friday night and turn northwestward.  
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Beryl is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some weakening is forecast during the next
day or two.  However, Beryl is forecast to be at or near major
hurricane intensity while it passes the Cayman Islands.  Additional
weakening is expected thereafter, though Beryl is forecast to remain
a hurricane until it makes landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185
miles (295 km). 
 
The minimum central pressure based on data from the Air Force and 
NOAA Hurricane Hunters is 960 mb (28.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions continue across southwestern portions of
Jamaica and in the mountainous areas.  Tropical storm conditions 
are occurring elsewhere on the island.
 
Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains
are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds
indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be
even greater.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the Cayman Islands
late tonight, with tropical storm conditions expected to begin 
within the next couple of hours.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area on
the Yucatan Peninsula Thursday night or early Friday morning.  Winds
are expected to first reach tropical storm strength by late
Thursday, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area
along the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula as early as late
Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area in the tropical storm warning area of the Yucatan Peninsula by
late Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm
watch area along portions of the coast of Belize by late Thursday
or early Friday, and in the tropical storm watch area along the
coast of the Yucatan Peninsula by Friday.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 6
to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along
the immediate coast of Jamaica.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the immediate
coast of the Cayman Islands.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet
above ground level in areas of onshore winds along the east coast of
the Yucatan Peninsula within the hurricane warning area.
 
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches with localized amounts of 12 inches across Jamaica through
Wednesday evening, along with additional rainfall of 4 to 6 inches
over the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti. This heavy rainfall is expected
to cause life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides.
 
Beryl is also expected to bring rainfall totals of 4 to 6 inches
over the Cayman Islands Wednesday night into Thursday. Over the
Yucatan Peninsula into northern Belize, Beryl is expected to produce
rainfall totals of 4 to 6 inches with localized amounts of 8 inches
late Thursday through Friday. Scattered instances of flash flooding
are anticipated.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are currently impacting 
portions of the coast of Jamaica, Cuba, and the Cayman Islands.  
These swells are expected to spread to the Yucatan Peninsula and 
portions of Central America on Thursday and to eastern Mexico and 
much of the Gulf Coast of the U.S. by late Friday. These swells are
expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Beryl Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022024
500 PM EDT Wed Jul 03 2024

While westerly shear continues to affect Beryl, the central core of 
the hurricane has made a bit of a comeback this afternoon with the 
eye becoming better defined in Cuban radar data and re-appearing in 
satellite imagery.  Whether this has resulted in any 
re-intensification is unclear, so the initial intensity will be 
held at 120 kt pending the arrival of the next reconnaissance 
aircraft.  The Cuban radar data shows that northern eyewall is 
brushing the southern coast of Jamaica at this time, with hurricane 
conditions occurring mainly on the south side of the island.

The initial motion is now 285/17.  A strong mid-level ridge centered
over the southeastern US is expected to continue steering Beryl
generally west-northwestward at a decreasing speed for the next
couple of days or so.  The motion should bring the center near or
just south of Jamaica during the next few hours and south of the 
Cayman Islands tonight.  After that, the system should reach the 
Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico in 36-48 h and emerge over the 
southwestern Gulf of Mexico by 60 h.  Once over the Gulf, Beryl 
should turn northwestward toward a break in the subtropical ridge 
caused by a large mid-latitude trough over the central United 
States.  There is a bit better agreement in the track guidance this 
cycle, as the GFS has shifted its track a little southward and the 
ECMWF has shifted its track a little northward.  Based on this and 
other guidance, the 96- and 120-h points have been shifted a 
little to the southwest of the previous forecast.  However, there 
is still uncertainty during this part of the forecast, and a 
landfall in Texas cannot yet be ruled out.

Beryl should continue to experience some westerly shear for the 
next 24 h, and the ECMWF forecasts moderate shear to persist until 
the hurricane makes landfall in Yucatan.  This portion of the 
intensity forecast calls for weakening as shown by the guidance.  
However, given that Beryl seems reluctant to weaken, the forecast 
is near the upper edge of the intensity guidance.  The cyclone 
should weaken to a tropical storm while crossing Yucatan.  The 
intensity guidance has become less enthusiastic about the potential 
for Beryl to re-intensify over the Gulf of Mexico.  However, the 
model forecast upper-level winds seem generally favorable, and 
based on this the intensity forecast continues to call for Beryl to 
re-gain hurricane strength over the Gulf. 
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Devastating hurricane-force winds, life-threatening storm surge,  
and damaging waves are expected to continue in Jamaica over the next 
several hours and spread into the Cayman Islands tonight. 
Mountainous locations in Jamaica are likely to experience 
destructive wind gusts.

2. Life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides from heavy rainfall 
are expected over much of Jamaica and southern Haiti through today.

3. Damaging winds, a dangerous storm surge, and heavy rainfall are
expected over portions of the Yucatan Peninsula and Belize 
beginning Thursday night as Beryl approaches that area as a 
hurricane. Hurricane and Tropical Storm Warnings are now in effect 
for portions of that area.

4. There remains uncertainty in the track and intensity forecast of 
Beryl over the western Gulf of Mexico this weekend. Interests in 
the western Gulf of Mexico, including southern Texas, should 
monitor the progress of Beryl.
