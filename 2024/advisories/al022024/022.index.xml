DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beryl was located
near latitude 18.0 North, longitude 79.2 West. Beryl is moving
toward the west-northwest near 21 mph (33 km/h). A westward to
west-northwestward motion is expected during the next day or
two, taking the core of Beryl just south of Cayman Islands overnight
and over the Yucatan Peninsula late Thursday night and Friday.
Beryl is expected to emerge over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico
Friday night and turn northwestward.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Beryl is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some weakening is forecast during the next
day or two, however, Beryl is forecast to be at or near major
hurricane intensity while it passes the Cayman Islands.  Additional
weakening is expected thereafter, though Beryl is forecast to remain
a hurricane until it makes landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).
 
The minimum central pressure based on data from the NOAA and Air 
Force Hurricane Hunters is 961 mb (28.38 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions will continue across the extreme
southwestern portions of Jamaica and in the mountainous areas for 
another few hours.  Tropical storm conditions are occurring 
elsewhere on the island.
 
Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains
are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds
indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be
even greater.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the Cayman Islands
overnight, with tropical storm conditions beginning.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area on
the Yucatan Peninsula Thursday night or early Friday morning.  Winds
are expected to first reach tropical storm strength by late
Thursday, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area
along the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula as early as late
Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area of the Yucatan Peninsula late Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm
watch area along portions of the coast of Belize by late Thursday
or early Friday.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 6
to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along
the immediate coast of Jamaica.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the immediate
coast of the Cayman Islands.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet
above ground level in areas of onshore winds along the east coast of
the Yucatan Peninsula within the hurricane warning area and by as
much as 1 to 3 feet above ground level along the west coast of the
Yucatan Peninsula in the tropical storm warning area.
 
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches with localized amounts of 12 inches across Jamaica through
Wednesday evening. This heavy rainfall is expected to cause
life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides.
 
Beryl is also expected to bring rainfall totals of 4 to 6 inches 
over the Cayman Islands through Thursday. Over the Yucatan Peninsula 
into northern Belize, Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals 
of 4 to 6 inches with localized amounts of 8 inches late Thursday 
through Friday. Scattered instances of flash flooding are 
anticipated.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are currently impacting
portions of the coast of Jamaica, Cuba, and the Cayman Islands.
These swells are expected to spread to the Yucatan Peninsula and
portions of Central America on Thursday and to eastern Mexico and
much of the Gulf Coast of the U.S. by late Friday. These swells are
expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Beryl Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022024
1100 PM EDT Wed Jul 03 2024
 
The core of Beryl has now passed through Jamaica and is approaching
the Cayman Islands.  Satellite images indicate that the eye has
become cloud filled, and reports from both the NOAA and Air Force
Hurricane Hunters indicate that the eyewall is open on the southwest
side.  Despite the degraded structure, a blend of the NOAA and Air
Force reconnaissance data indicates that Beryl is still an extremely
dangerous category 4 hurricane with an initial intensity of 115 kt.
The crews on board also reported that there was significant
turbulence in the northern eyewall.  NOAA's P-3 Tail Doppler Radar
data does suggest that there is some vertical tilt to the vortex,
likely due to moderate westerly vertical wind shear.
 
The center of Beryl is a little to the north of the previous track,
and the latest initial motion estimate is 295/16 kt. A ridge
centered over the southeastern U.S. should cause Beryl to turn more
westward during the next couple of days, taking the core of the
major hurricane just south of the Cayman Islands overnight and
across the Yucatan Peninsula late Thursday night and Friday.  The
ridge is expected to weaken late Friday, which should cause Beryl to
slow down and gain more latitude this weekend as it moves toward a
trough over the south-central U.S.  The models are tightly
clustered through the Yucatan landfall, and given the pronounced
steering currents through that time, the NHC track forecast is of
high confidence.  However, the spread in the models increase by the
time Beryl nears eastern Mexico and southern Texas and accordingly,
confidence in the details of the track forecast are low at long
range.  The NHC track forecast is a tad to the north of the
previous one and very near the various consensus aids.
 
Beryl is currently in an environment of about 20 kt of westerly
shear, and the models suggest that the shear will either hold
steady or increase a little during the next couple of days.  These
less favorable winds aloft combined with some intrusions of dry air
should cause weakening, but Beryl is still expected to be a
powerful hurricane by the time it reaches the Yucatan.  The
interaction with the landmass of the Yucatan should cause rapid
weakening, but gradual re-intensification is expected when Beryl
moves over the western Gulf of Mexico.  The NHC intensity forecast
is similar to the previous one and near the high end of the model
guidance.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Devastating hurricane-force winds, life-threatening storm surge,
and damaging waves are expected to continue in Jamaica for a few 
more hours and spread into the Cayman Islands tonight. Mountainous 
locations in Jamaica are likely to experience destructive wind 
gusts.
 
2. Life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides from heavy rainfall
are expected over much of Jamaica overnight.
 
3. Damaging winds, a dangerous storm surge, and heavy rainfall are
expected over portions of the Yucatan Peninsula and Belize
beginning Thursday night as Beryl approaches that area as a
hurricane. Hurricane and Tropical Storm Warnings are now in effect
for portions of that area.
 
4. There remains uncertainty in the track and intensity forecast of
Beryl over the western Gulf of Mexico this weekend. Interests in
eastern Mexico and southern Texas should monitor the progress of
Beryl.  Regardless of the exact track, rip currents could cause
life-threatening beach conditions beginning late Friday and
continuing through the weekend across much of the Gulf coast.
