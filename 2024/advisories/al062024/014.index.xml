Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Wed Sep 11 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Francine, located over southern Louisiana and on Tropical <br/>
Depression Seven located over the eastern Atlantic Ocean. <br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL92): <br/>
An area of low pressure located over the central tropical Atlantic <br/>
continues to produce disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity.  <br/>
Environmental conditions appear marginally conducive for some slight <br/>
development during the next day or so while the system moves <br/>
westward at 5 to 10 mph over the central tropical Atlantic.  The <br/>
disturbance is expected to reach an area of stronger upper-level <br/>
winds on Friday, likely ending its chances for development.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
East of the Leeward Islands (AL94):<br/>
A small area of low pressure located several hundred miles to the <br/>
east of the Leeward Islands is producing a limited area of <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms. The proximity of dry air <br/>
near the system is expected to limit additional development over the <br/>
next couple of days before environmental conditions become even less <br/>
conducive by this weekend as it moves slowly west-northwestward. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore the Southeastern U.S.:<br/>
In a few days, a non-tropical area of low pressure could form along <br/>
a residual frontal boundary a few hundred miles off the southeastern <br/>
U.S. coastline. Thereafter, some subtropical or tropical development <br/>
is possible during the early part of next week while the system <br/>
drifts to the north or northwest.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Francine was
located near latitude 30.2 North, longitude 90.6 West. Francine is
moving toward the northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h).  A slower 
north-northeastward motion is expected during the next couple of 
days.

Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Rapid weakening is forecast, and Francine is expected to 
become a tropical depression by late Thursday and a post-tropical 
cyclone Thursday night or early Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.  Gusts to hurricane-force have been occurring in 
the New Orleans area.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 982 mb (29.00 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Francine can be found in the Tropical Cyclone 
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue in
portions of the warning area through early Thursday.
 
RAINFALL: Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4 to
8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches across southeastern
Louisiana, Mississippi, far southern Alabama, and the Florida
Panhandle through Thursday night. This rainfall could lead to
considerable flash, urban and river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.  For a list of
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS1 with the WMO header ACUS41
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Burns Point, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-8 ft
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-6 ft
Mouth of the Pearl River, LA to Ocean Springs, MS...4-6 ft
Lake Pontchartrain...4-6 ft
Ocean Springs, MS to MS/AL Border...3-5 ft
Intracoastal City, LA to Burns Point, LA...3-5 ft
Lake Maurepas...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees.  However,
there may be some overtopping of local levees.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible overnight across
parts of southeast Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern
Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle. On Thursday, the tornado risk
will move into additional parts of Alabama, southwest Georgia and
the Florida Panhandle.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine are affecting much of the
northern Gulf Coast, likely causing life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 AM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

Tropical Storm Francine Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062024
1000 PM CDT Wed Sep 11 2024
 
Francine made landfall in Terrebonne Parish in southern Louisiana
around 5 pm CDT (2200 UTC) as a Category 2 hurricane. Maximum winds
at landfall were estimated to be around 85 kt based on data
collected by the Air Force Hurricane Hunters.  Since then, Francine
has been rapidly weakening, and the maximum winds are now estimated
to be near 60 kt, making it a tropical storm.  The convective
pattern has become quite asymmetric with nearly all of the heavy
rains confined to the north of the center.  Some of the heaviest
rainfall and tropical-storm-force winds are occurring in
metropolitan New Orleans, where there have been gusts to near 60 kt.
 
The storm continues to move northeastward at a relatively quick 14
kt.  However, a slow down is expected as the system weakens and
merges with a mid- to upper-level trough to its northwest, which
could cause flooding over portions of the southern U.S.  As Francine
continues inland, the storm will spin down and likely become a
tropical depression by late Thursday and a post-tropical cyclone
Thursday night or early Friday.
 
An experimental cone graphic that includes inland Hurricane and
Tropical Storm Watches and Warnings in the U.S. is now available on
the NHC website. Due to the time needed to compile the inland watch
and warning information, the experimental cone graphic will not be
available as quickly as the operational cone. Once it is available,
the experimental cone graphic can be found from a red weblink above
the operational cone graphic at
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?cone#contents. Users are
encouraged to take the experimental product survey found below the
experimental cone.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge during the
next several hours for portions of the Louisiana and Mississippi
coastlines, where a Storm Surge Warning remains in effect.
Residents in the warning area should continue to follow advice
given by local officials.
 
2. Damaging winds are expected to continue in portions of southern
Louisiana overnight. Remain in a safe location until conditions
improve.
 
3. Francine is expected to bring heavy rainfall and the risk of
considerable flash and urban flooding, along with river flooding,
across southeastern Louisiana, Mississippi, far southern Alabama,
and the Florida Panhandle through Thursday night. Flash and urban
flooding is probable across the Lower Tennessee Valley and Lower
Mississippi Valley into Friday morning.

Tropical Depression Seven Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072024
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 11 2024
 
Periodic bursts of convection have been growing and fading in the 
tropical depression this evening.  Earlier microwave imagery from 
SSMIS showed a fragmented curved band wrapping around the northern 
and western portion of the circulation.  Subjective estimates from 
TAFB and SAB were T-2.5/35 kt and T-1.5/25 kt respectively and based 
on a blend of these, the initial intensity is held at 30 kt.
 
The depression is moving west-northwestward at 285/15 kt along the 
southern side of a mid-level ridge centered over the northeastern 
Atlantic.  This motion should continue for the next day or so until 
the forward speed decreases when the ridge is eroded by an 
amplifying mid-level trough.  By the end of the forecast period, the 
system should begin to turn northward toward a break in the ridge.  
Beyond 72 h, there is quite a bit of spread in the track guidance 
due to the models varying the timing of the turn to the north.  The 
latest track forecast is similar to the previous prediction, and 
lies near the various consensus aids.  

Environmental conditions appear generally conducive for gradual 
strengthening for the next couple of days.  Afterwards  The 
depression is forecast to move into a drier air mass and it could 
experience moderate wind shear and possible dry air intrusions.  The 
long range intensity forecast is also rather uncertain and few 
changes have been made to the new NHC intensity forecast, which lies 
near HCCA.
