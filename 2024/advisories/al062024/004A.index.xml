within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area
outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by
your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Francine was 
located near latitude 23.7 North, longitude 95.8 West. Francine is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h) and a slow 
north-northwestward motion is expected for the remainder of the day, 
followed by a faster motion to the northeast beginning on Tuesday. 
On the forecast track, Francine is anticipated to be just offshore 
of the northern Gulf Coast of Mexico on Tuesday, and approaching the 
Louisiana and Upper Texas coastline on Wednesday.
 
Recent Air Force reconnaissance data indicates that maximum 
sustained winds have increased to 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Additional intensification is expected over the next day with 
more significant intensification forecast on Tuesday Night and 
Wednesday. Francine is expected to become a hurricane before it 
reaches the northwestern U.S. Gulf Coast on Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.41 inches) 
based on dropsonde data.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Francine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO
header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area by
Wednesday afternoon, with tropical storm conditions possible by
Wednesday morning.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area along
the northern coast of Mexico and extreme southern Texas beginning
Tuesday, and for the extreme northern Texas and portions of the
Louisiana coast on Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Francine is expected to bring storm
total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches,
from the coast of far northeast Mexico northward along portions of
the southern Texas coast, the far upper Texas coast and across
southern Louisiana and southern Mississippi into Thursday morning.
This rainfall could lead to the risk of considerable flash and urban
flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Francine, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Cameron, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-10 ft
Vermilion Bay...5-10 ft
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-7 ft
High Island, TX to Cameron, LA...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances. Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees. However, there
may be some overtopping of local levees. For information specific
to your area, please see products issued by your local National
Weather Service forecast office.
 
Minor coastal flooding is possible along the coast of Mexico in
areas of onshore winds.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by this system are affecting portions of the
Gulf coast of Mexico and are expected to spread northwestward across
the northwestern Gulf of Mexico coastline through midweek.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Francine Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062024
1000 AM CDT Mon Sep 09 2024
 
The structure of the system on satellite imagery has improved this 
morning, with a large circular region of cold convection between -70 
to -85 near the estimated center. An Air-Force Reconnaissance 
Aircraft is sampling the system this morning and earlier found a 
cyclonic wind shift from southeasterly to northwesterly flow near 
the center of the mass of deep convection. This data provides enough 
evidence that a well-defined circulation now exists, and thus PTC 
Six has become Tropical Storm Francine with sustained winds of    
45 kt this advisory.
 
The estimated motion is still tricky given the center only recently 
formed but is estimated still off to the north-northwest at    340/4 
kt. The system is expected to gradually turn northward and then 
north-northeastward as it moves between a mid-level ridge centered 
over Cuba and a broad mid- to upper-level trough located to its 
northwest over Texas. The guidance this cycle has shifted a little 
eastward and faster, and the NHC track forecast was once again 
nudged in that direction. The current track splits the difference 
between HCCA and TVCN and still shows Francine moving ashore of 
Louisiana sometime on Wednesday evening. There remains a decent 
amount of track uncertainty with the GEFS and EPS ensembles showing 
along-track spread implying some speed differences near landfall. 
 
While the system is now a tropical storm, the inner core wind field 
per reconnaissance observations is still broad and in the organizing 
stage, and initial intensification will be gradual. However, after 
an inner-core becomes established, and assuming the cyclone's 
vertical structure becomes aligned, a period of more significant 
intensification is possible while storm is embedded in a low shear, 
high mid-level moisture, and over very warm 30-31 C sea-surface 
temperatures.  The SHIPS rapid intensification (RI) indices are 
pretty elevated, and a period of RI could also occur between   24-48 
h. For now, the NHC intensity forecast will not explicitly forecast 
RI, but is higher than the previous cycle and shows a 75 kt peak in 
48 h, in good agreement with the intensity consensus aids. After 
that period, southwesterly vertical wind shear quickly increases 
from 10 kt to more than 30 kt and the intensity could plateau as it 
approaches the northwestern U.S. Gulf coastline, though the system 
is forecast to remain a hurricane at landfall. The NHC intensity 
forecast continues to be in good agreement with the consensus aids, 
but is a bit under the HAFS-A/B and COAMPS-TC models.
 
Given the latest forecast, a Hurricane Watch has been issued for
the Louisiana coastline from Cameron to Grand Isle, and a Storm 
Surge Watch has been issued from High Island, TX eastward to the 
Mississippi/Alabama Border.

With this advisory, the experimental cone graphic that includes 
inland Hurricane and Tropical Storm watches in the U.S. will be 
available on the NHC website. Due to the time needed to compile the 
inland watch information, the experimental cone graphic will not be 
available as quickly as the operational cone. The experimental cone 
graphic can be found from a link on the page with the operational 
cone graphic once it is available on hurricanes.gov. 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Francine is forecast to be a hurricane when it reaches the 
northwestern Gulf coast on Wednesday or Wednesday night and there is 
an increasing likelihood of life-threatening storm surge inundation 
for portions of the Upper Texas and Louisiana coastlines where a 
Storm Surge Watch is in effect.  Residents in the watch area should 
follow advice given by local officials. 

2. There is an increasing risk of damaging hurricane-force winds in 
portions of southern Louisiana beginning Wednesday, where a 
Hurricane Watch is now in effect. 

3. Francine is expected to bring heavy rainfall and the risk of 
considerable flash flooding along the coast of far northeast Mexico, 
portions of the southernmost Texas coast, the Upper Texas Coast, 
southern Louisiana, and southern Mississippi into Thursday morning.  
A risk of flash and urban flooding exists across portions of the 
Mid-South from Wednesday into Friday morning.
