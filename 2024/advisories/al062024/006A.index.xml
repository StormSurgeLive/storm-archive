200 AM EDT Tue Sep 10 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Francine, located about 100 miles offshore of northeastern <br/>
Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL92): <br/>
An elongated area of low pressure over the central tropical Atlantic <br/>
is producing some disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear only marginally conducive for some <br/>
slight development during the next couple of days, but a tropical <br/>
depression could still form during that time while the system moves <br/>
westward at 5 to 10 mph over the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A trough of low pressure located several hundred miles southwest of <br/>
the Cabo Verde Islands is expected to merge in a couple of days with <br/>
a strong tropical wave located between the west coast of Africa and <br/>
the Cabo Verde Islands. Environmental conditions appear favorable <br/>
for gradual development of this system, and a tropical depression <br/>
will likely form during the latter part of this week while the <br/>
system moves west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Francine was
located near latitude 24.3 North, longitude 96.3 West.  Francine 
has moved little over the past few hours, but it is expected to 
resume a motion toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h).  A
slow north-northwest motion is expected through this morning, 
followed by a turn to the northeast with an increase in forward
speed.  On the forecast track, Francine is anticipated to be just
offshore of the coasts of northeastern Mexico and southern Texas
through today, and make landfall in Louisiana on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Francine will likely become a hurricane today, with
significant strengthening expected before it reaches the coast.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft observations is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Francine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO
header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area on Wednesday.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the
hurricane watch area on Wednesday, with tropical storm conditions
expected by Wednesday morning within the warning areas.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in Mexico
and south Texas through this afternoon.  Tropical storm conditions
are possible within the watch area along the northeastern coast 
of Mexico for the next several hours.  Tropical storm conditions 
are also possible along portions of the Texas coast in the watch 
area today and tonight, and are possible in the watch area in 
eastern Louisiana on Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4 to
8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches, from the coast of far
northeast Mexico northward over the far lower and far upper Texas
coasts, and across much of Louisiana and Mississippi into Thursday
morning.  This rainfall could lead to considerable flash and urban
flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total 
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Cameron, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-10 ft
Vermilion Bay...5-10 ft
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-7 ft
High Island, TX to Cameron, LA...3-5 ft
Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA to MS/AL Border...2-4 ft
Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas...2-4 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to High Island, TX...1-3 ft
Galveston Bay...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees.  However, 
there may be some overtopping of local levees.  For information 
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local 
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
Minor coastal flooding is possible along the coast of Mexico in
areas of onshore winds.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine are affecting portions of the
coast of northeastern Mexico and southern Texas.  These swells are
expected to spread across the northwestern and northern Gulf of
Mexico coastline during the next day or so.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Francine Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062024
1000 PM CDT Mon Sep 09 2024
 
After strengthening this afternoon, Francine's intensity appears to 
have leveled off for now.  Around 18Z today, microwave images 
indicated that the storm had a closed low-level eyewall and a 
relatively symmetric cloud pattern.  However, an intrusion of dry 
air has caused the inner core convection to degrade.  The Air Force 
and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft have been investigating Francine 
this evening and have found that the maximum winds have changed 
little from earlier and remain around 55 kt.  However, the minimum 
pressure reported from the aircraft has dropped to 992 mb, which 
could indicate that strengthening will resume soon. The outer 
rainbands to the west and northwest of the center are very near the 
coast of northeastern Mexico and extreme southern Texas, and there 
are likely tropical-storm-force winds in those bands.
 
The storm has been moving slowly north-northwestward or 340 degrees
at 4 kt. A mid-level ridge situated over the southeastern Gulf of
Mexico should cause Francine to continue to move slowly
northwestward to northward just off the coast of northeastern Mexico
through Tuesday morning.  By late Tuesday, a trough over Texas is
expected to approach the system, and the stronger flow between the
trough and the aforementioned ridge should cause a turn to the
northeast with a pronounced increase in forward speed. This motion
should take the cyclone to the Louisiana coast Wednesday afternoon
or evening.  The models are in fairly good agreement on this
scenario, but there is a fair amount of along-track spread or
differences in when the storm reaches the coast.  The NHC track
forecast is similar to the previous one and near the TVCN aid.
 
Environmental conditions are forecast to remain quite favorable for
strengthening along Francine's path for the next 24 hours, with very
warm ocean waters while remaining in a low wind shear environment.
The SHIPS RII index for rapid intensification over the next 24 hours
has decreased a little due to some dry air in the environment around
Francine.  The NHC intensity forecast is similar to the previous
one, and lies near the high end of the intensity guidance suite.
Just prior to landfall, Francine should encounter increasing
west-southwesterly vertical wind shear, which will likely end the
intensification trend.  Rapid weakening is expected after the storm
moves inland.
 
An experimental cone graphic that includes inland Hurricane and
Tropical Storm Watches and Warnings in the U.S. is now available on
the NHC website. Due to the time needed to compile the inland watch
and warning information, the experimental cone graphic will not be
available as quickly as the operational cone. Once it is available,
the experimental cone graphic can be found from a red weblink above
the operational cone graphic at
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?cone#contents. Users are
encouraged to take the experimental product survey found below the
experimental cone.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge for portions
of the Upper Texas and Louisiana coastlines where a Storm Surge
Warning is in effect.  Residents in the warning area should follow
advice, including evacuation orders, given by local officials.
 
2. Damaging and life-threatening hurricane-force winds are expected
in portions of southern Louisiana Wednesday, where a Hurricane
Warning is in effect. Preparations to protect life and property
should be complete by Tuesday night since tropical storm conditions
are expected to begin within this area early Wednesday.
 
3. Francine is expected to bring heavy rainfall and the risk of
considerable flash flooding along the coast of northeast Mexico,
the far lower and far upper Texas coasts, much of Louisiana, and
Mississippi into Thursday morning. A risk of flash and urban
flooding exists across portions of the Mid-South from Wednesday
night into Friday morning.
