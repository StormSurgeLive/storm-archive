Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Fri Sep 13 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on <br/>
recently-upgraded Tropical Storm Gordon, located over the central <br/>
tropical Atlantic Ocean. The Weather Prediction Center is issuing <br/>
advisories on Post-Tropical Cyclone Francine, located inland over <br/>
northeastern Arkansas.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore the Southeastern U.S.:<br/>
A non-tropical area of low pressure could form along a frontal <br/>
boundary a few hundred miles off the southeastern U.S. coastline <br/>
this weekend. Thereafter, the low may develop some subtropical or <br/>
tropical characteristics, and a subtropical or tropical depression <br/>
could form early next week while the system moves generally <br/>
northwestward toward the coast. Additional information on this <br/>
system can be found in products issued by your local National <br/>
Weather Service Forecast Office and High Seas Forecasts issued by <br/>
the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Northern Leeward Islands (AL94):<br/>
An area of low pressure near the Northern Leeward Islands is <br/>
producing limited shower and thunderstorm activity. Environmental <br/>
conditions, including the proximity of dry air, do not favor <br/>
development of this system and development is no longer expected <br/>
while it moves west-northwestward at about 15 mph.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...near 0 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Gordon Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072024
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
1100 AM AST Fri Sep 13 2024
 
While some west-northwesterly shear exists over the cyclone, 
a combination of Dvorak satellite estimates and improved structure 
on satellite imagery since earlier this morning has led to the 
depression being upgraded to Tropical Storm Gordon.  The initial 
wind speed is set to 35 kt, based on consensus Dvorak estimates 
around that value.  
 
The initial motion is a little slower toward the west-northwest 
(295/10 kt).   While a weakness in the subtropical ridge to the 
north of Gordon is becoming more pronounced due to the possible 
retrogression of an upper low to its east-northeast, this appears to 
be only slowing the storm down.  The track guidance indicates that 
the cyclone should turn westward by tonight and move slowly 
throughout much of the forecast period.  By days 4 and 5, an 
amplifying shortwave trough to the north could cause Gordon to 
gradually turn northwestward, assuming the system can re-intensify.  
The official forecast is close to the previous prediction during the 
first 60 hours, but then is adjusted westward on days 3 through 5 
following the latest model trends.

Gordon has some chance to intensify today before moving deeper into 
the moisture-starved environment across the tropical Atlantic, and 
some weakening is anticipated this weekend.  While the shear isn't 
expected to be too hostile, any re-intensification during next week 
is expected to be slow, and there is a chance that Gordon could 
degenerate into a remnant low.  For now, the official forecast keeps 
the system as a tropical cyclone for the entire forecast period.  
Some recovery is possible by days 4 and 5 when the system reaches a 
slightly more moist, unstable and low-shear environment.
