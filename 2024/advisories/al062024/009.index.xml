Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD<br/>
200 PM EDT Tue Sep 10 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Francine, located in the western Gulf of Mexico offshore of <br/>
northeastern Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL92): <br/>
An elongated area of low pressure located over the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic continues to produce some disorganized shower and <br/>
thunderstorm activity. Environmental conditions appear only <br/>
marginally conducive for some slight development during the next <br/>
couple of days, but a tropical depression could still form during <br/>
that time while the system moves westward at 5 to 10 mph over the <br/>
central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A trough of low pressure over the eastern tropical Atlantic is <br/>
producing a large but disorganized area of showers and <br/>
thunderstorms from near the Cabo Verde Islands extending  <br/>
southwestward for several hundred miles.  Environmental conditions <br/>
appear favorable for gradual development of this system, and a <br/>
tropical depression will likely form during the latter part of this <br/>
week while the system moves west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Francine was
located near latitude 25.7 North, longitude 95.0 West. Francine is
moving toward the northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A continued
northeastward motion and a faster forward speed are expected 
tonight and Wednesday.  On the forecast track, Francine is
anticipated to move across the northwestern Gulf of Mexico tonight, 
and then make landfall in Louisiana on Wednesday or Wednesday 
night. After landfall, the center is expected to move northward 
into Mississippi on Wednesday night or Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is expected through Wednesday morning, and
Francine will likely become a hurricane tonight. Francine is 
expected to weaken quickly after landfall.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Francine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO
header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area on Wednesday, with tropical storm conditions arriving
in the warning area by early Wednesday. Hurricane conditions are 
possible in the Hurricane Watch area Wednesday and Wednesday night.
 
Tropical Storm conditions are expected in the warning area along
the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama Wednesday 
and Wednesday night.
 
RAINFALL:  Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4 
to 8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches across eastern 
Louisiana, Mississippi, far southern Alabama and the western
Florida Panhandle through Friday morning. This rainfall could lead
to considerable flash and urban flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-10 ft 
Vermilion Bay...5-10 ft 
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-7 ft 
Cameron, LA to Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, LA...3-5 ft 
Pointe a la Hache, LA to MS/AL Border...3-5 ft 
Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees.  However,
there may be some overtopping of local levees.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible Wednesday into Wednesday 
night across parts of southeast Louisiana, southern Mississippi, 
southern Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine are affecting much of 
the northwestern Gulf Coast.  These swells are expected to spread 
across the remainder of the northern Gulf of Mexico coastline 
during the next day or so.  These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Francine Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>
<description>Issued at 1000 AM CDT Tue Sep 10 2024  <![CDATA[<pre>

WTNT41 KNHC 101449
TCDAT1
 
Tropical Storm Francine Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062024
1000 AM CDT Tue Sep 10 2024
 
Satellite imagery and data from the WSR-88D Doppler radar in 
Brownsville indicate that the central core of Francine has become 
better organized, with the development of a central dense overcast 
and increased convective banding near the center.  In addition, 
reports from NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
show that the central pressure has fallen to around 988 mb. However, 
these developments have not yet resulted an increase in wind speed, 
as the aircraft-reported winds still support an intensity near    
55 kt this advisory.
 
After meandering last night, Francine is now moving 
north-northeastward with an initial motion of 020/7 kt.  An 
approaching mid-latitude shortwave trough over Texas should cause 
the storm to turn northeastward at a faster forward speed during the 
next 24-36 h, and this motion should bring the center to the 
Louisiana coast sometime Wednesday afternoon or evening.  After 
landfall, Francine should turn more northward between the trough and 
a mid-level ridge over the eastern United States.  The track 
guidance is generally in good agreement with this scenario. However, 
there has been an eastward shift of the guidance since the last 
advisory, and thus the new forecast track is also shifted eastward.  
In response to this eastward shift in track and southeastern wind 
radii, the hurricane warning in Louisiana was extended eastward at 
12Z, and this advisory has new tropical storm warnings and watches 
for the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama.
 
Francine has about 24-30 h to strengthen over warm water before it 
encounters strong shear near the Louisiana coast.  While there is a 
possibility that dry air entrainment could reduce the 
intensification rate, the intensity continues to call for steady to 
rapid strengthening during this time based on the otherwise 
favorable conditions.  While it is not explicitly shown in the 
latest forecast, the cyclone could reach a peak intensity near 85 kt 
between the 24 h point and landfall.  Intensification is expected to 
stop before landfall, and rapid weakening is expected after 
landfall.  The global models show the remnants of Francine 
dissipating after 96 h, and the intensity forecast follows that 
scenario. Overall, the intensity forecast is at the upper edge of 
the intensity guidance.
 
An experimental cone graphic that includes inland Hurricane and
Tropical Storm Watches and Warnings in the U.S. is now available on
the NHC website. Due to the time needed to compile the inland watch
and warning information, the experimental cone graphic will not be
available as quickly as the operational cone. Once it is available,
the experimental cone graphic can be found from a red weblink above
the operational cone graphic at
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?cone#contents. Users are
encouraged to take the experimental product survey found below the
experimental cone.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge for portions of 
the Upper Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi coastlines where a Storm 
Surge Warning is in effect.  Residents in the warning area should 
follow advice, including evacuation orders, given by local 
officials.
 
2. Damaging and life-threatening hurricane-force winds are expected
in portions of southern Louisiana Wednesday, where a Hurricane
Warning is in effect. Preparations to protect life and property
should be complete by tonight, since tropical storm conditions are
expected to begin within this area early Wednesday.
 
3. Francine is expected to bring heavy rainfall and the risk of 
considerable flash and urban flooding for far northeast Mexico into 
the far southern coast of Texas today and across much of Louisiana 
and Mississippi through Thursday.  Flash and urban flooding is 
probable across the Mid-South Wednesday night into Friday morning.
