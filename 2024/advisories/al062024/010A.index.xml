For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Francine, located over the western Gulf of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL92): <br/>
An elongated area of low pressure located over the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic continues to produce some disorganized shower and <br/>
thunderstorm activity.  Environmental conditions appear marginally <br/>
conducive for some slight development during the next day or two <br/>
while the system moves westward at 5 to 10 mph over the central <br/>
tropical Atlantic.  The disturbance is expected to reach an area of <br/>
stronger upper-level winds on Thursday, likely ending its chances <br/>
for development.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic (AL93):<br/>
A trough of low pressure over the eastern tropical Atlantic is <br/>
producing a large but disorganized area of showers and thunderstorms <br/>
from near the Cabo Verde Islands extending southwestward for <br/>
several hundred miles.  Environmental conditions appear favorable <br/>
for gradual development of this system, and a tropical depression <br/>
will likely form during the latter part of this week while the <br/>
system moves west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Francine was
located near latitude 26.6 North, longitude 94.1 West. Francine is
moving toward the northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h). A faster
northeastward motion is expected today, and Francine is anticipated 
to make landfall in Louisiana within the warning area this 
afternoon or evening. After landfall, the center is expected to 
move northward into Mississippi tonight and Thursday.
 
Data from the Air Force Hurricane Hunters indicate that maximum 
sustained winds have increased to near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Some additional strengthening is expected this morning. 
Francine is expected to weaken quickly after it moves inland.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115
miles (185 km).
 
The minimum central pressure based on data from the Air Force 
Hurricane Hunters is 977 mb (28.85 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Francine can be found in the Tropical 
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header 
WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane 
warning area this afternoon, with tropical storm conditions arriving 
in the warning area this morning. Hurricane conditions are possible 
in the hurricane watch area this afternoon and tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area along the 
coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama today and tonight.
 
RAINFALL:  Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4
to 8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches across eastern
Louisiana, Mississippi, far southern Alabama and the western
Florida Panhandle through Friday morning. This rainfall could lead
to considerable flash and urban flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Vermilion/Cameron Line, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-10 ft
Vermilion Bay...5-10 ft
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-7 ft
Cameron, LA to Vermilion/Cameron Line, LA...3-5 ft
Pointe a la Hache, LA to MS/AL Border...3-5 ft
Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees.  However,
there may be some overtopping of local levees.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation, 
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic, 
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible today into tonight across 
parts of southeast Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern 
Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine are affecting much of the 
northern and northwestern Gulf Coast, likely causing 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

<title>Hurricane Francine Forecast Discussion Number 10</title>

Hurricane Francine Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062024
1000 PM CDT Tue Sep 10 2024
 
Both the NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunters have been
investigating Francine tonight, and the data they collected were the
basis for upgrading it to a hurricane a few hours ago.  The
maximum 700 mb flight-level wind measured was 76 kt, which supports
an intensity of about 65 kt.  The aircraft data also indicated that
the minimum pressure has fallen several millibars to 980 mb.  Deep
convection has been increasing near the center, and radar images
indicate that an inner core has developed.  There is still some dry
air, however, outside of the core region.
 
Francine is starting to move a little faster to the northeast, with 
the latest initial motion estimated to be 035/9 kt.  A mid- to 
upper-level trough over Texas is approaching the hurricane, and that 
should cause it to accelerate northeastward toward the Louisiana 
coast, with landfall expected there late Wednesday afternoon or 
evening.  After Francine moves inland, a turn to the north-northeast 
and a decrease in forward speed is predicted while it moves across 
eastern Louisiana and Mississippi.  The models are in good 
agreement, and little change was made to the previous track 
forecast.
 
Now that Francine has a well organized core, significant
strengthening seems likely through Wednesday morning while the
system remains over very warm waters and in low wind shear
conditions.  The hurricane regional models are quite aggressive and
show Francine strengthening quickly, while the dynamical-statistical
models show much less intensification.  The NHC intensity forecast
is between those solutions and continues to show Francine nearing
category 2 strength Wednesday morning. A notable increase in shear
and intrusions of dry air should end the opportunity for
strengthening just before Francine reaches the coast. Rapid
weakening is expected after the cyclone moves inland.
 
An experimental cone graphic that includes inland Hurricane and
Tropical Storm Watches and Warnings in the U.S. is now available on
the NHC website. Due to the time needed to compile the inland watch
and warning information, the experimental cone graphic will not be
available as quickly as the operational cone. Once it is available,
the experimental cone graphic can be found from a red weblink above
the operational cone graphic at
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?cone#contents. Users are
encouraged to take the experimental product survey found below the
experimental cone.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge on
Wednesday for the Louisiana and Mississippi coastlines, where a
Storm Surge Warning is in effect.  Residents in the warning area
should follow advice, including evacuation orders, given by local
officials.
 
2. Damaging and life-threatening hurricane-force winds are expected
in portions of southern Louisiana on Wednesday, where a Hurricane
Warning is in effect. Preparations to protect life and property
should be complete, since tropical storm conditions are expected to
begin within this area early Wednesday.
 
3. Francine is expected to bring heavy rainfall and the risk of
considerable flash and urban flooding across eastern Louisiana,
Mississippi, far southern Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle
through Thursday.  Flash and urban flooding is probable across the
Lower Tennessee Valley and Lower Mississippi Valley Wednesday night
into Friday morning.
