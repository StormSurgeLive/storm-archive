within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area
outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by
your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Francine was 
located near latitude 23.0 North, longitude 94.9 West. Francine is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h) and a slow 
north-northwestward motion is expected for the remainder of the day, 
followed by a faster motion to the northeast beginning on Tuesday. 
On the forecast track, Francine is expected to be just offshore of 
the northern Gulf Coast of Mexico through Tuesday, and approach the 
Louisiana and Upper Texas coastline on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Gradual intensification is expected over the next day with 
more significant intensification on Tuesday Night and Wednesday. 
Francine is expected to become a hurricane before it reaches the 
northwestern U.S. Gulf Coast on Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Francine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO
header WTNT41 KNHC.

WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area by
Wednesday afternoon, with tropical storm conditions possible by 
Wednesday morning.

Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area along 
the northern coast of Mexico and extreme southern Texas beginning 
Tuesday, and for the extreme northern Texas and portions of the 
Louisiana coast on Wednesday. 

RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Francine is expected to bring storm 
total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches, 
from the coast of far northeast Mexico northward along portions of 
the southern Texas coast, the far upper Texas coast and across 
southern Louisiana and southern Mississippi into Thursday morning. 
This rainfall could lead to the risk of considerable flash and urban 
flooding. 

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Tropical Storm Francine, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Cameron, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-10 ft
Vermilion Bay...5-10 ft
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-7 ft
High Island, TX to Cameron, LA...3-5 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to 
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be 
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding 
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and 
can vary greatly over short distances. Storm surge is not expected 
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees. However, there 
may be some overtopping of local levees. For information specific 
to your area, please see products issued by your local National 
Weather Service forecast office.

Minor coastal flooding is possible along the coast of Mexico in 
areas of onshore winds.

For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge 
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by this system are affecting portions of the
Gulf coast of Mexico and are expected to spread northwestward across
the northwestern Gulf of Mexico coastline through midweek.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

TCDAT1
 
Potential Tropical Cyclone Six Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062024
400 AM CDT Mon Sep 09 2024

Satellite imagery shows that the disturbance is producing 
considerable deep convection with cloud tops colder than -70 deg C. 
However, the cloud pattern is still in the organizing stage with not 
much evidence of banding features at this time.  Upper-level outflow 
is becoming established over the area.  Observations from an Air 
Force reconnaissance aircraft, data buoy 42055, and a partial ASCAT 
overpass suggest that the system has not yet developed a well- 
defined center of circulation.  The intensity is held at 45 kt for 
this advisory with the assumption of some undersampling of the winds 
over the western part of the circulation.  However, this could be 
generous.

Since the center is still not well defined, the initial motion is a 
rather uncertain, but slow, 340/4 kt.  During the next day or so, 
the system is expected to move along the western side of a mid-level 
ridge over the Gulf of Mexico.  This motion should keep the core of 
the system off the coast of northeastern Mexico and southern Texas 
for the next 24-36 hours.  Then, a shortwave trough over Texas is 
expected to induce a turn toward the northeast with an increase in 
forward speed, which would take the center of the system near and 
across the northwestern or northern Gulf coast late Wednesday.  The 
official track forecast has again been nudged eastward in the 48-72 
hour period, but not quite as far east as the ECMWF and corrected 
consensus model predictions.  It should be noted that confidence in 
the track forecast is lower than normal since the system lacks a 
well-defined center. 

Since the system is still not very well-organized and lacks an inner 
core structure, only slow strengthening is expected through this 
morning.  However, the disturbance is expected to soon become better 
organized while remaining over very warm waters, with high low- to 
mid-tropospheric humidity, and low vertical shear for the next 48 
hours.  Therefore steady strengthening is likely to begin by later 
today.  This is also shown by most of the numerical guidance.  When 
the system nears landfall, the global models show increasing 
upper-level westerlies near the northwestern Gulf coast, and this 
could lead to stronger vertical wind shear over the cyclone.  
Therefore the rate of strengthening could at least level off as the 
center nears the coast.  The official intensity forecast is similar 
to the previous NHC prediction, close to the Decay-SHIPS guidance, 
and continues to show the system as a hurricane at landfall.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The system is forecast to become a tropical storm today as it
moves near the western Gulf of Mexico coast.  Tropical Storm Watches
are in effect for northeastern Mexico and extreme southern Texas.
 
2. The system is forecast to become a hurricane before it reaches
the northwestern Gulf Coast by the middle of the week.  While it is
too soon to pinpoint the exact location and magnitude of impacts,
the potential for life-threatening storm surge and damaging winds
are increasing for portions of the Louisiana and Upper Texas
coastlines beginning Tuesday night.  Hurricane and Storm Surge
Watches will likely be issued for a portion of that area later 
today, and residents should ensure they have their hurricane plan in
place.

3. Potential Tropical Cyclone Six is expected to bring heavy 
rainfall and the risk of considerable flash flooding along the coast 
of far northeast Mexico, portions of southernmost Texas, southern 
Louisiana, and southern Mississippi into Thursday morning.  A risk 
of flash and urban flooding exists across portions of the Mid-South 
from Wednesday into Friday morning.
