Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD<br/>
200 PM EDT Wed Sep 11 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Francine, located just south of Louisiana, and on newly formed <br/>
Tropical Depression Seven located over the eastern Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL92): <br/>
An area of low pressure located over the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic continues to produce some disorganized shower and <br/>
thunderstorm activity.  Environmental conditions appear marginally <br/>
conducive for some slight development during the next day or two <br/>
while the system moves west-northwestward at 5 to 10 mph over the <br/>
central tropical Atlantic.  The disturbance is expected to reach an <br/>
area of stronger upper-level winds on Friday, likely ending its <br/>
chances for development.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
East of the Leeward Islands (AL94):<br/>
A small but well-defined area of low pressure located several <br/>
hundred miles to the east of the Leeward Islands is producing  <br/>
limited shower and thunderstorm activity. The proximity of dry <br/>
air near the system is expected to limit additional development <br/>
over the next couple of days before environmental conditions <br/>
become even less conducive by this weekend while it moves slowly <br/>
west-northwestward. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore the Southeastern U.S. over the Western Atlantic:<br/>
In a few days, a non-tropical area of low pressure could form along <br/>
a residual frontal boundary a few hundred miles off the <br/>
southeastern U.S. coastline. Thereafter, some subtropical or <br/>
tropical development is possible during the early part of next week <br/>
while the system drifts to the north or northwest.  <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>

Public Advisories on Tropical Depression Seven are issued <br/>
under WMO header WTNT32 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCPAT2. <br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Francine was
located near latitude 29.2 North, longitude 91.5 West. Francine is
moving toward the northeast near 17 mph (28 km/h). This general
motion should continue through this afternoon, and Francine is
anticipated to make landfall in Louisiana within the warning area
in the next few hours. After landfall, the center is expected to
cross southeastern Louisiana tonight, then move northward across
Mississippi on Thursday and Thursday night.
 
Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds are now near 100 mph      
(155 km/h) with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is 
expected before landfall. Francine is expected to rapidly weaken 
after landfall, and the system is forecast to become post-tropical 
Thursday night or Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km). An oil platform southeast of the center recently
reported sustained winds of 79 mph (127 km/h) and a peak gust of
93 mph (150 km/h) at an elevation of 82 ft (25 m).  The National
Ocean Service station at Eugene Island, Louisiana, recently
reported sustained winds of 76 mph (122 km/h) and a wind gust of   
99 mph (159 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft data is 972 mb (28.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Francine can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header
WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are spreading into the hurricane
warning area, with tropical storm conditions already ongoing. 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area this 
evening and tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area along
the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama this evening and
tonight.
 
RAINFALL: Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4 to
8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches across southeastern
Louisiana, Mississippi, far southern Alabama and the Florida
Panhandle through Thursday night. This rainfall could lead to
considerable flash, urban and river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.  For a list of
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS1 with the WMO header ACUS41
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Burns Point, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-10 ft
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-7 ft
Mouth of the Pearl River, LA to Ocean Springs, MS...4-6 ft
Lake Pontchartrain...4-6 ft
Ocean Springs, MS to MS/AL Border...3-5 ft
Intracoastal City, LA to Burns Point, LA...3-5 ft
Lake Maurepas...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees.  However,
there may be some overtopping of local levees.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible through tonight across
parts of southeast Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern
Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle. On Thursday, the tornado risk
will move into additional parts of Alabama, southwest Georgia and
the Florida Panhandle.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine are affecting much of the
northern and northwestern Gulf Coast, likely causing
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.

Hurricane Francine Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062024
400 PM CDT Wed Sep 11 2024
 
Satellite, radar, and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft
data indicate that not only has Francine stayed well organized 
during the past six hours despite increasing westerly shear, it has 
strengthened a little. The latest reports from the aircraft showed 
the central pressure has fallen to near 972 mb with maximum 700
mb flight-level winds of 99 kt to the southeast of the center.
Based on these data, the initial intensity is increased to 85 kt.
 
The initial motion is now 045/15 kt.  The flow between a mid- to
upper-level ridge over the Gulf of Mexico and a mid- to upper-level
trough over Texas should steer Francine northeastward for the next
12 h or so.  The hurricane is expected to make landfall along the
Louisiana coast in the next few hours and move across southeastern
Louisiana tonight.  After that, a turn toward the north on the east
side of the trough will bring the center of Francine across
southwestern and central Mississippi on Thursday. This should be
followed by a northward motion with a decrease in forward speed
until the cyclone dissipates.  The new track guidance is a little
faster than for the previous advisory, so the new forecast track is
similar to, but faster than, the previous track.
 
Little change in strength is expected during the final hours before
landfall. After landfall, Francine is expected to quickly weaken
while also losing tropical characteristics. Transition to an
extratropical cyclone is expected to be complete by Friday morning,
with the cyclone forecast to dissipate after 60 h.
 
An experimental cone graphic that includes inland Hurricane and
Tropical Storm Watches and Warnings in the U.S. is now available on
the NHC website. Due to the time needed to compile the inland watch
and warning information, the experimental cone graphic will not be
available as quickly as the operational cone. Once it is available,
the experimental cone graphic can be found from a red weblink above
the operational cone graphic at
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?cone#contents. Users are
encouraged to take the experimental product survey found below the
experimental cone.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge through 
tonight for the Louisiana and Mississippi coastlines, where a
Storm Surge Warning is in effect. Residents in the warning area
should continue to follow advice given by local officials.
 
2. Damaging and life-threatening hurricane-force winds are expected
in portions of southern Louisiana this evening and tonight, where a
Hurricane Warning is in effect. Ensure you are in a safe location
before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
 
3. Francine is expected to bring heavy rainfall and the risk of
considerable flash and urban flooding, along with river flooding,
across southeastern Louisiana, Mississippi, far southern Alabama and
the Florida Panhandle through Thursday night. Flash and urban
flooding is probable across the Lower Tennessee Valley and Lower
Mississippi Valley tonight into Friday morning.

Tropical Depression Seven Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072024
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
500 PM AST Wed Sep 11 2024
 
Satellite images show there has been little change with the 
depression this afternoon.  Although deep convection has faded 
some, this is pretty typical at this time of day.  The initial wind 
speed will stay 30 kt, similar to the recent objective and 
subjective Dvorak classifications. 
 
The depression is still moving 285/16, and little change to the 
motion is expected over the next 36 to 48 hours before its forward 
speed slows in response to the approach of an amplifying 
mid-level trough over the Atlantic.   The big change to note is 
that most of the guidance is significantly slower and now start to 
recurve the system around day 5 (rather than continue westward).  
The new forecast is a lot slower than the previous one and future 
adjustments could be made if later guidance continue this trend 
(continuity prevents a larger change).

Generally low wind shear and warm waters for the first couple of 
days should allow the depression to strengthen during that time.  
Thereafter, an increase in westerly shear and possible dry air 
intrusions could prevent further intensification, but this is still 
a pretty uncertain forecast at long range due to the track 
uncertainty. Most of the models are a bit lower beyond 2 days, and 
the new NHC intensity forecast is nudged downward at long range.
