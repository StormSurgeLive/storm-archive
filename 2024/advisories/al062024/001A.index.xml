NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Sun Sep 8 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Potential <br/>
Tropical Cyclone Six, located over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL92): <br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure <br/>
over the central tropical Atlantic have changed little in <br/>
organization since earlier today. Environmental conditions appear <br/>
conducive for additional development during the next couple of days, <br/>
and a tropical depression is likely to form during that time while <br/>
the system meanders over the central tropical Atlantic. By the <br/>
middle of the week, the system should begin moving more westward at <br/>
around 10 mph.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A trough of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands is producing a broad area <br/>
of disorganized showers and thunderstorms. This system is expected <br/>
to move little during the next couple of days until it potentially <br/>
interacts with a tropical wave that is forecast to move off the west <br/>
coast of Africa on Monday. Environmental conditions thereafter are <br/>
expected to be favorable for gradual development of this system, and <br/>
a tropical depression could form during the middle or latter part of <br/>
the week while the system begins moving slowly west-northwestward. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

None
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Barra del Tordo northward to the Mouth of the Rio Grande
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the elongated disturbance was centered
near latitude 21.9 North, longitude 94.7 West.  The system is moving
toward the northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h).  A slow northwestward
to northward motion is expected over the next day or so, followed 
by a faster motion to the northeast beginning late Tuesday. On the 
forecast track, the disturbance is expected to move just offshore of 
the northern Gulf Coast of Mexico through Tuesday, and approach the 
Upper Texas and Louisiana coastline on Wednesday.
 
Air Force reconnaissance data indicate that maximum sustained winds
are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. The system is expected
to become a tropical storm on Monday, with more significant
intensification forecast to occur on Tuesday.  The system is
forecast to become a hurricane before it reaches the northwestern
U.S. Gulf Coast.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.  

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km),
primarily west of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area along the northern coast of Mexico beginning Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL: Potential Tropical Cyclone Six is expected to bring
storm total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches, with local amounts to 12
inches, from the coast of far northeast Mexico northward along
portions of the Texas Coast and into Louisiana through Thursday.
This rainfall would lead to the risk of flash and urban flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Potential Tropical Cyclone Six, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.
 
STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding is possible along the Mexico
coast within areas of onshore flow.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by this system are affecting portions of the
Gulf coast of Mexico and are expected to spread northwestward across
the northwestern Gulf of Mexico coastline through midweek.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Potential Tropical Cyclone Six Forecast Discussion Number 1</title>

Potential Tropical Cyclone Six Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062024
400 PM CDT Sun Sep 08 2024
 
The area of disturbed weather located over the southwestern Gulf of 
Mexico does not possess a well-defined circulation yet.  
Scatterometer and aircraft data indicate that it consists of an 
elongated trough of low pressure oriented north-northwest to 
south-southeast. However, there is a large area of 35-45 kt winds 
located southwest of the trough axis. These tropical-storm-force 
winds are also confirmed by an ongoing Air Force Reserve 
reconnaissance mission, which found 975 mb flight-level winds up to 
56 kt, with SFMR winds also quite high in the same vicinity. Some of 
these high winds are likely enhanced in part due to a barrier jet 
offshore of the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico. Because the system 
is expected to become a tropical storm over the next day or so, and 
tropical-storm-force winds are forecast to be near the coast of 
Mexico within 48 hours, advisories are being initiated on Potential 
Tropical Cyclone Six. The initial intensity is set to 45 kt for this 
advisory based on a blend of scatterometer and aircraft data. 
 
The initial motion is highly uncertain given the fact that a 
well-defined center does not yet exist, but our best estimate is 
320/4 kt. The track guidance shows this slow northwest drift 
continuing, though the center could reform or redevelop anywhere 
along the current trough axis as the center becomes better defined. 
Afterwards, the system is expected to turn northward and then 
north-northeastward as it rounds the periphery of a mid-level ridge 
centered over Cuba. The track guidance this cycle shifted east, with 
the GFS and ECMWF models notably on the east side of the guidance 
envelope. The initial NHC track forecast won't go quite that far 
east, but splits the difference between the consensus aid TVCN and 
these eastward model solutions. Future adjustments could be 
necessary if these eastward trends continue. Given the current 
structure, the track forecast is of lower confidence than usual. 

Given that the current circulation is quite elongated, it will 
likely take a day or even longer for intensification to begin, and 
much of the wind enhancement on its southwestern side is more of a 
reflection of a barrier jet rather than the true intensity of the 
stretched out vorticity maxima. Both the global model and 
hurricane-regional model guidance suggest the circulation will 
become well-defined by tomorrow afternoon, and the NHC intensity 
forecast shows the system becoming a tropical storm by that time. 
Until then, the intensity guidance, especially the 
statistical-dynamical guidance SHIPS and LGEM, likely show too much 
short-term intensification because these tools are designed for 
tropical cyclones and not elongated troughs. The hurricane-regional 
models HAFS-A/B seem to have a fairly realistic depiction of the 
system's current structure, and show little intensification for the 
next 36 h or so. Afterwards, as they depict the center becoming 
well-defined with contracting wind radii, they show more significant 
intensification. Between 48-72 h, PTC Six could interact with an 
upper-level trough centered over Texas, and its intensity as it 
approaches the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast will be governed by 
its inner-core structure and if it undergoes a favorable trough 
interaction. This initial forecast shows the system becoming a 
hurricane just before landfall. 

KEY MESSAGES:

1. The system is forecast to become a tropical storm on Monday as 
it moves northwestward to northward near or along the western Gulf 
of Mexico coast. Tropical Storm Watches have been issued for a 
portion of northeastern Mexico and additional watches may be needed 
for the southern Texas coast tonight. 

2. The system is forecast to become a hurricane before it reaches 
the northwestern Gulf Coast by the middle of the week.  While it is 
too soon to pinpoint the exact location and magnitude of impacts, 
the potential for life-threatening storm surge and damaging winds 
are increasing for portions of the Upper Texas and Louisiana 
coastlines beginning Tuesday night.  Hurricane and Storm Surge 
Watches will likely be issued for a portion of that area on Monday, 
and residents should ensure they have their hurricane plan in 
place. 

3. Potential Tropical Cyclone Six is expected to bring heavy 
rainfall and the risk of flash flooding from the coast of far 
northeast Mexico into portions of coastal Texas and Louisiana 
through Thursday.
