Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Sun Sep 8 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Potential <br/>
Tropical Cyclone Six, located over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL92): <br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure <br/>
over the central tropical Atlantic have changed little in <br/>
organization since earlier today. Environmental conditions appear <br/>
conducive for additional development during the next couple of days, <br/>
and a tropical depression is likely to form during that time while <br/>
the system meanders over the central tropical Atlantic. By the <br/>
middle of the week, the system should begin moving more westward at <br/>
around 10 mph.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A trough of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands is producing a broad area <br/>
of disorganized showers and thunderstorms. This system is expected <br/>
to move little during the next couple of days until it potentially <br/>
interacts with a tropical wave that is forecast to move off the west <br/>
coast of Africa on Monday. Environmental conditions thereafter are <br/>
expected to be favorable for gradual development of this system, and <br/>
a tropical depression could form during the middle or latter part of <br/>
the week while the system begins moving slowly west-northwestward. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area
outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by
your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the disturbance was estimated to be near 
latitude 22.0 North, longitude 94.7 West.  The system is moving 
toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h).  A slow 
northwestward to northward motion is expected over the next day or 
so, followed by a faster motion to the northeast beginning late 
Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the disturbance is expected to move 
just offshore of the northern Gulf Coast of Mexico through Tuesday, 
and approach the Louisiana and Upper Texas coastline on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts.  The disturbance is expected to become a tropical storm 
today, with more significant intensification forecast to occur on 
Tuesday.  The system is forecast to become a hurricane before it 
reaches the northwestern U.S. Gulf Coast.
* Formation chance through 48 hours... high...90 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
west of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area along the northern coast of Mexico and extreme southern Texas
beginning Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL: Potential Tropical Cyclone Six is expected to bring storm
total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches,
from the coast of far northeast Mexico northward along portions of
the Texas coast and into Louisiana through Thursday. This rainfall
would lead to the risk of flash and urban flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Potential Tropical Cyclone Six, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.
 
STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding is possible along the coast of 
Mexico in areas of onshore winds.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by this system are affecting portions of the
Gulf coast of Mexico and are expected to spread northwestward across
the northwestern Gulf of Mexico coastline through midweek.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

Potential Tropical Cyclone Six Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062024
1000 PM CDT Sun Sep 08 2024
 
The system is gradually becoming better organized with deep
convection increasing in coverage and intensity over the
southwestern Gulf of Mexico.  However, earlier visible satellite
imagery and aircraft data from the Air Force Hurricane Hunters
indicate that the disturbance does not have a well-defined center
and still resembles an elongated trough.  The initial intensity
remains 45 kt based on the aircraft data.  The strongest winds are
occurring on the system's west side, and are likely enhanced by the
barrier jet associated with the Sierra Madre Mountains in Mexico.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be 320/4 kt.  A mid-level ridge
situated over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and western Atlantic
should steer the disturbance slowly northward or north-northwestward
through Tuesday morning, likely keeping the core of the system off
the coast of Mexico and southern Texas through that time.  By late
Tuesday, a turn to the northeast with an increase in forward speed
is forecast as the system moves in the flow between the ridge and an
approaching shortwave trough.  That motion should take the cyclone
to the Louisiana or Upper Texas coast on Wednesday.  A
north-northeastward motion is forecast after landfall when the
system merges with the trough. The NHC track forecast has been
nudged eastward toward the latest runs of the GFS and ECMWF models.
It should be noted that confidence in the track forecast is lower
than normal since the system does not have a well-defined center.
 
Little change in strength is expected during the next 12 to 24 hours
as it will likely take some time for the system to consolidate and
develop a well organized circulation.  Once the system is able to
close off and contract, steady strengthening is forecast as the
cyclone will be over warm waters and within a region of high
moisture and upper-level diffluence.  However, some of the models
show an increase in shear and slightly drier air affecting the
system around the time it reaches the coast.  The NHC intensity
forecast is raised from the previous one and lies roughly near the
middle of the guidance envelope.
 
The highest winds are expected to remain on the west side of the
system during the next day or so, but these winds should shift to
the eastern side of the circulation before the cyclone reaches the
Gulf Coast.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The system is forecast to become a tropical storm on Monday as it
moves near the western Gulf of Mexico coast. Tropical Storm Watches
are in effect for northeastern Mexico and extreme southern Texas.
 
2. The system is forecast to become a hurricane before it reaches
the northwestern Gulf Coast by the middle of the week.  While it is
too soon to pinpoint the exact location and magnitude of impacts,
the potential for life-threatening storm surge and damaging winds
are increasing for portions of the Louisiana and Upper Texas
coastlines beginning Tuesday night.  Hurricane and Storm Surge
Watches will likely be issued for a portion of that area on Monday,
and residents should ensure they have their hurricane plan in
place.
 
3. Potential Tropical Cyclone Six is expected to bring heavy
rainfall and the risk of flash flooding from the coast of far
northeast Mexico into portions of coastal Texas and Louisiana
through Thursday.
