200 PM EDT Tue Sep 10 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Francine, located in the western Gulf of Mexico offshore of <br/>
northeastern Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL92): <br/>
An elongated area of low pressure located over the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic continues to produce some disorganized shower and <br/>
thunderstorm activity. Environmental conditions appear only <br/>
marginally conducive for some slight development during the next <br/>
couple of days, but a tropical depression could still form during <br/>
that time while the system moves westward at 5 to 10 mph over the <br/>
central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A trough of low pressure over the eastern tropical Atlantic is <br/>
producing a large but disorganized area of showers and <br/>
thunderstorms from near the Cabo Verde Islands extending  <br/>
southwestward for several hundred miles.  Environmental conditions <br/>
appear favorable for gradual development of this system, and a <br/>
tropical depression will likely form during the latter part of this <br/>
week while the system moves west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Francine was 
located near latitude 25.8 North, longitude 94.8 West. Francine is 
moving toward the northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A faster 
northeastward motion is expected tonight and Wednesday.  On the 
forecast track, Francine is anticipated to make landfall in 
Louisiana Wednesday afternoon or evening. After landfall, the center 
is expected to move northward into the Mississippi Wednesday night 
and Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is expected through 
Wednesday morning.  Francine is expected to weaken quickly after it 
moves inland.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure based on data from the Air Force and 
NOAA Hurricane Hunters is 982 mb (29.00 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Francine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO
header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area Wednesday afternoon, with tropical storm conditions 
arriving in the warning area Wednesday morning. Hurricane 
conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch area Wednesday 
afternoon and Wednesday night.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area along
the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama Wednesday
and Wednesday night.
 
RAINFALL:  Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4
to 8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches across eastern
Louisiana, Mississippi, far southern Alabama and the western
Florida Panhandle through Friday morning. This rainfall could lead
to considerable flash and urban flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-10 ft
Vermilion Bay...5-10 ft
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-7 ft
Cameron, LA to Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, LA...3-5 ft
Pointe a la Hache, LA to MS/AL Border...3-5 ft
Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees.  However,
there may be some overtopping of local levees.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible Wednesday into Wednesday
night across parts of southeast Louisiana, southern Mississippi,
southern Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine are affecting much of
the northern and northwestern Gulf Coast.  These swells are likely 
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.

<title>Hurricane Francine Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Tropical Storm Francine Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062024
400 PM CDT Tue Sep 10 2024
 
The convection associated with Francine has not changed much in 
organization during the past six hours.  Radar data from the 
WSR-88D Doppler radar in Brownsville shows good curved banding 
around the center, but the convection is having trouble persisting,
possibly due to continued dry air entrainment.  Reports from an Air 
Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft prior to 18Z showed that 
the central pressure had dropped to near 987 mb, and that the 
maximum 700-mb flight-level winds were 63 kt.  Based on these data 
and satellite intensity estimates from SAB and TAFB, the initial 
intensity is set at 55 kt.
 
The initial motion is now 035/9 kt.  An approaching mid-latitude 
shortwave trough over Texas should cause the storm to move 
northeastward at a faster forward speed during the next 24-36 h, 
and this motion should bring the center to the Louisiana coast 
sometime Wednesday afternoon or evening.  After that time, Francine 
should turn more northward between the trough and a mid-level ridge 
over the eastern United States.  While there is little change to 
the track forecast scenario since the last advisory, the track 
guidance has again shifted to the east, most notably between   
12-48 h.  Based on this change, the forecast track during that 
period is again nudged a little to the east.  The new track lies 
just to the left of the various consensus models.
 
Francine has about 24 h to strengthen over warm water before it 
encounters strong shear near the Louisiana coast.  While there 
remains a possibility that dry air entrainment could continue to 
reduce the intensification rate, the intensity forecast continues 
to call for steady to rapid strengthening during this time based on 
the otherwise favorable conditions, and the forecast peak intensity 
of 80 kt is at the high end of the intensity guidance.  
Intensification is expected to stop near or just before landfall, 
and rapid weakening is expected after landfall.  The global models 
continue to show the remnants of Francine dissipating after 96 h, 
and the intensity forecast again follows that scenario. 

An experimental cone graphic that includes inland Hurricane and
Tropical Storm Watches and Warnings in the U.S. is now available on
the NHC website. Due to the time needed to compile the inland watch
and warning information, the experimental cone graphic will not be
available as quickly as the operational cone. Once it is available,
the experimental cone graphic can be found from a red weblink above
the operational cone graphic at
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?cone#contents. Users are
encouraged to take the experimental product survey found below the
experimental cone.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge for the 
Louisiana and Mississippi coastlines, where a Storm Surge Warning 
is in effect.  Residents in the warning area should follow advice, 
including evacuation orders, given by local officials.
 
2. Damaging and life-threatening hurricane-force winds are expected
in portions of southern Louisiana Wednesday, where a Hurricane
Warning is in effect. Preparations to protect life and property
should be complete by tonight, since tropical storm conditions are
expected to begin within this area early Wednesday.
 
3. Francine is expected to bring heavy rainfall and the risk of 
considerable flash and urban flooding across eastern Louisiana,  
Mississippi, far southern Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle 
through Thursday.  Flash and urban flooding is probable across the 
Lower Tennessee Valley and Lower Mississippi Valley Wednesday night 
into Friday morning.
