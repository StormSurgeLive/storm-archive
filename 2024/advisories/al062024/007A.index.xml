800 AM EDT Tue Sep 10 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Francine, located in the Gulf of Mexico about 100 miles <br/>
offshore of northeastern Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL92): <br/>
An elongated area of low pressure located over the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic continues to produce some disorganized shower and <br/>
thunderstorm activity. Environmental conditions appear only <br/>
marginally conducive for some slight development during the next <br/>
couple of days, but a tropical depression could still form during <br/>
that time while the system moves westward at 5 to 10 mph over the <br/>
central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A trough of low pressure located several hundred miles southwest of <br/>
the Cabo Verde Islands is expected to interact and merge with a <br/>
strong tropical wave located between the west coast of Africa and <br/>
the Cabo Verde Islands over the next couple of days. Thereafter, <br/>
Environmental conditions appear favorable for gradual development of <br/>
this combined system, and a tropical depression will likely form <br/>
during the latter part of this week while the system moves <br/>
west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Francine was
located near latitude 24.5 North, longitude 95.9 West. Francine is
moving toward the north near 5 mph (7 km/h).  A slow northward 
motion is expected through this morning, followed by a turn to the 
northeast with an increase in forward speed.  On the forecast 
track, Francine is anticipated to be just offshore of the coasts of 
northeastern Mexico and southern Texas through today, and make 
landfall in Louisiana on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Francine will likely become a hurricane today, with
significant strengthening expected before it reaches the coast.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure just reported by a NOAA Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft is 990 mb (29.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Francine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO
header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area on Wednesday.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the
hurricane watch area on Wednesday, with tropical storm conditions
expected by Wednesday morning within the warning areas.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in Mexico
and south Texas through this afternoon.  Tropical storm conditions
are possible within the watch area along the northeastern coast
of Mexico for the next several hours.  Tropical storm conditions
are also possible along portions of the Texas coast in the watch
area today and tonight, and are possible in the watch area in
eastern Louisiana on Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4 to
8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches across much of Louisiana
and Mississippi through Friday morning.  This rainfall could lead
to considerable flash and urban flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Cameron, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-10 ft
Vermilion Bay...5-10 ft
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-7 ft
High Island, TX to Cameron, LA...3-5 ft
Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA to MS/AL Border...2-4 ft
Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas...2-4 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to High Island, TX...1-3 ft
Galveston Bay...1-3 ft
MS/AL Border to AL/FL Border...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees.  However,
there may be some overtopping of local levees.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
Minor coastal flooding is possible along the coast of Mexico in
areas of onshore winds.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible Wednesday morning through
Wednesday night over near-coastal areas of Louisiana, Mississippi,
Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine are affecting portions of the
coast of northeastern Mexico and southern Texas.  These swells are
expected to spread across the northwestern and northern Gulf of
Mexico coastline during the next day or so.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Francine Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062024
400 AM CDT Tue Sep 10 2024
 
Francine has not become appreciably better organized overnight.  
There is a large cluster of cold-topped convection located well to 
the northeast of the center, but the central deep convection is 
still not very strong.  Some banding features appear to be 
developing over the northeastern portion of the circulation.  The 
advisory intensity is held at 55 kt for now, in agreement with 
earlier data from an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft, and a 
subjective Dvorak Current Intensity number from TAFB.  Objective 
Dvorak intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS are a little lower.  Air 
Force and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft are scheduled to 
investigate the storm in a few hours and should provide a good 
estimate of Francine's intensity.
 
Center fixes from an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft and ASCAT 
data showed little motion a few hours ago, but recent satellite 
imagery suggest a slow north-northwestward motion at around 340/4 
kt.  The general steering scenario for the next couple of days 
remains about the same as in the previous advisory.  Francine should 
move mostly northward today along the western periphery of a mid 
level high over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico.  By late tonight, a 
shortwave trough over Texas is expected to cause a turn toward the 
northeast with an increase in forward speed.  This motion should 
bring the center of the system to the Louisiana coast tomorrow 
afternoon or evening.  The model tracks are in fairly good agreement 
on this scenario, although there is still some cross- and 
along-track spread.  The official track forecast in the 36- to 
48-hour time frame has been nudged just a few tenths to the east of 
the previous one, and lies between the ECMWF solution and the 
multi-model consensus prediction.

The tropical cyclone should be over very warm waters before 
landfall, although west-southwesterly vertical wind shear over the 
system is likely to increase.  The latter environmental influence 
will probably limit Francine's strengthening.  Nonetheless, the 
SHIPS-RI Index shows a significant probability of at least a 25-kt 
increase in maximum winds during the next 24 hours.  The official 
intensity forecast is now at the high end of the model guidance.

An experimental cone graphic that includes inland Hurricane and
Tropical Storm Watches and Warnings in the U.S. is now available on
the NHC website. Due to the time needed to compile the inland watch
and warning information, the experimental cone graphic will not be
available as quickly as the operational cone. Once it is available,
the experimental cone graphic can be found from a red weblink above
the operational cone graphic at
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?cone#contents. Users are
encouraged to take the experimental product survey found below the
experimental cone.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge for portions
of the Upper Texas and Louisiana coastlines where a Storm Surge
Warning is in effect.  Residents in the warning area should follow
advice, including evacuation orders, given by local officials.
 
2. Damaging and life-threatening hurricane-force winds are expected
in portions of southern Louisiana Wednesday, where a Hurricane
Warning is in effect. Preparations to protect life and property
should be complete by tonight, since tropical storm conditions are 
expected to begin within this area early Wednesday.
 
3. Francine is expected to bring heavy rainfall and the risk of 
considerable flash flooding for much of Louisiana and Mississippi 
through Thursday.  Flash and urban flooding is probable across 
portions of northeast Mexico and far southern Texas into early 
Wednesday, and the Mid-South Wednesday night into Friday morning.
