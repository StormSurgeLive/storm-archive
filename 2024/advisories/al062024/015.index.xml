Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Thu Sep 12 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Francine, located over southern Louisiana, and on Tropical <br/>
Depression Seven, located over the eastern Atlantic Ocean. <br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL92): <br/>
A weak area of low pressure located over the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic is producing disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity. <br/>
Development of this system is not likely while it moves westward at <br/>
around 10 mph over the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
East of the Leeward Islands (AL94):<br/>
A small area of low pressure located several hundred miles to the <br/>
east of the Leeward Islands is producing a few disorganized showers <br/>
and thunderstorms. The proximity of dry air near the system is <br/>
expected to limit additional development over the next couple of <br/>
days before environmental conditions become even less conducive by <br/>
this weekend while the system moves slowly west-northwestward. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore the Southeastern U.S.:<br/>
In a few days, a non-tropical area of low pressure could form along <br/>
a residual frontal boundary a few hundred miles off the southeastern <br/>
U.S. coastline. Thereafter, some subtropical or tropical development <br/>
is possible during the early part of next week while the system <br/>
drifts to the north or northwest.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Francine was
located near latitude 30.9 North, longitude 90.1 West. Francine is
moving toward the northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h). A turn toward 
the north-northeast and north is expected during the next day or 
so, with some decrease in forward speed. On the forecast track, the 
center of Francine will move over central and northern portions of 
Mississippi through early Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Continued weakening is forecast, and Francine is expected to become 
a tropical depression this morning and degenerate to a post-tropical 
cyclone today.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km) 
from the center. A National Ocean Service weather station at 
Southwest Pass, Louisiana recently reported a wind gust of 39 mph 
(63 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Francine can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions, especially in gusts, are expected 
to continue in portions of the warning area for the next few hours.
 
RAINFALL: Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 3 to
6 inches across portions of Mississippi, eastern Arkansas,
Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, and the Florida Panhandle. Localized
amounts up to 10 inches are possible within rain bands over portions
of central and northern Alabama and over the Florida Panhandle. This
rainfall could lead to locally considerable flash and urban
flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.  For a list of
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS1 with the WMO header ACUS41
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Mouth of the Pearl River, LA to Ocean Springs, MS...4-6 ft
Lake Pontchartrain...4-6 ft
Ocean Springs, MS to MS/AL Border...3-5 ft
Lake Maurepas...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees.  However,
there may be some overtopping of local levees.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible today, mainly in the
morning and afternoon from the Florida Panhandle to north-central
Alabama.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine will continue to affect much of
the northern Gulf coast through today. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 AM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

Tropical Storm Francine Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062024
400 AM CDT Thu Sep 12 2024
 
Francine has continued to rapidly weaken overnight while moving 
inland across eastern Louisiana. The system is highly sheared due to 
its interaction with a mid- to upper-level trough to the northwest. 
Francine is quickly losing tropical characteristics, and surface 
observations indicate the surface center is located south and west 
of the heaviest rainfall. Tropical storm conditions, especially in 
gusts, continue over portions of the northern Gulf Coast within the 
warning area. Earlier scatterometer data showed 35-40 kt offshore 
winds, and the initial intensity is lowered to 40 kt.
 
The storm has slowed down a bit and is now moving northeastward at
about 10 kt. Francine is expected to turn north-northeastward and
northward today, bringing the center across central and northern
Mississippi. Continued weakening is expected, and tropical storm
conditions along the coasts of southeastern Louisiana, Mississippi,
and Alabama are likely to subside this morning as the low weakens
and moves further inland. Given its degraded satellite structure,
Francine is likely to degenerate to a post-tropical low as early as 
this morning, with dissipation forecast to occur by 48 h.
 
An experimental cone graphic that includes inland Hurricane and
Tropical Storm Watches and Warnings in the U.S. is now available on
the NHC website. Due to the time needed to compile the inland watch
and warning information, the experimental cone graphic will not be
available as quickly as the operational cone. Once it is available,
the experimental cone graphic can be found from a red weblink above
the operational cone graphic at
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?cone#contents. Users are
encouraged to take the experimental product survey found below the
experimental cone.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge during the next 
several hours for portions of the eastern Louisiana and Mississippi 
coastlines, where a Storm Surge Warning remains in effect. Residents 
in the warning area should continue to follow advice given by local 
officials.
 
2. A Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect for coastal portions
of southeastern Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, where tropical
storm conditions could continue for the next few hours.
 
3. Francine will continue to bring heavy rainfall and the risk of 
flash and urban flooding, along with river flooding, across portions 
of the Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, and the 
Southeast. Locally considerable flash and urban flooding is possible 
today and tonight over portions of central and northern Alabama and 
the Florida Panhandle.

<title>Tropical Depression Seven Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>

Tropical Depression Seven Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072024
500 AM AST Thu Sep 12 2024

The system has changed little in organization overnight, with 
limited deep convection and slight banding features.  An 
AMSR-2 microwave image suggested that the circulation was still 
somewhat broad since the cloud bands were not very tightly curved.  
Subjective Dvorak classifications from TAFB and SAB were T2.5/35 kt 
and T2.0/30 kt, respectively.  The advisory intensity is held at 30 
kt given the depression's lack of increased organization.  This is 
also in agreement with a DMINT objective intensity estimate from 
UW-CIMSS based on the AMSR data.

The cyclone continues on a west-northwestward heading with an 
estimated motion of 290/15 kt.  A gradually weakening ridge over the 
eastern subtropical Atlantic should maintain this general motion 
with decreasing forward speed over the next 2-3 days.  Later in the 
forecast period, an amplifying trough is expected to erode the 
ridge, which should cause the cyclone to turn at least a little to 
the right.  The track guidance becomes somewhat divergent in the 4- 
to 5-day time frame, but is in overall agreement on a rather slow 
motion.  The official track forecast is similar to the previous NHC 
prediction and close to the various dynamical model consensus 
solutions.

Environmental conditions seem fairly conducive for at least gradual 
strengthening during the next few days, with low- to 
moderate-vertical wind shear and marginally warm SSTs.  However, the 
models are not very bullish on strengthening until near the end of 
the forecast period.  This may be due to a somewhat stable air mass 
over the eastern Atlantic.  The official intensity forecast is 
similar to the Decay-SHIPS model guidance through 72 hours, but 
shows no change after that time given the uncertainties in intensity 
prediction.
