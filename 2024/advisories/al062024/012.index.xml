Special Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
945 AM EDT Wed Sep 11 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Special Outlook issued to update the system in the eastern Tropical <br/>
Atlantic west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands (AL93).<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Francine, located over the western Gulf of Mexico a couple hundred <br/>
miles off the coast of Louisiana. <br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic (AL93):<br/>
Updated: Recent satellite-wind data indicates that the system <br/>
located a few hundred miles to the west-southwest of the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands has developed a well-defined circulation. In addition, <br/>
showers and thunderstorms continue to show signs of organization, <br/>
and if these trends continue, advisories will be issued on a <br/>
tropical depression later this morning. The system is moving to the <br/>
west-northwest at 10 to 15 mph and will be moving into the central <br/>
Tropical Atlantic by the end of the week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL92): <br/>
An elongated area of low pressure located over the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic continues to produce some disorganized shower and <br/>
thunderstorm activity.  Environmental conditions appear marginally <br/>
conducive for some slight development during the next day or two <br/>
while the system moves westward at 5 to 10 mph over the central <br/>
tropical Atlantic.  The disturbance is expected to reach an area of <br/>
stronger upper-level winds on Thursday, likely ending its chances <br/>
for development.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
East of the Leeward Islands (AL94):<br/>
A small but well-defined area of low pressure located several <br/>
hundred miles to the east of the Leeward Islands is producing an <br/>
area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms. The proximity of dry <br/>
air near the system is expected to limit additional development over <br/>
the next couple of days before environmental conditions become even <br/>
less conducive by this weekend as it moves slowly <br/>
west-northwestward. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore the Southeastern U.S. over the Western Atlantic:<br/>
In a few days, a non-tropical area of low pressure could form along <br/>
a residual frontal boundary a few hundred miles off the southeastern <br/>
U.S. coastline. Thereafter, some subtropical or tropical development <br/>
is possible during the early part of next week as the system <br/>
meanders over the Gulf Stream or drifts slowly northward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Francine was
located near latitude 28.0 North, longitude 92.7 West. Francine is
moving toward the northeast near 13 mph (20 km/h). A faster
northeastward motion is expected this afternoon, and Francine is
anticipated to make landfall in Louisiana within the warning area
late this afternoon or this evening. After landfall, the center is
expected to cross southeastern Louisiana tonight, then move
northward across Mississippi on Thursday and Thursday night.
 
Reports from Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is expected before 
landfall. Francine is expected to rapidly weaken after landfall, and 
the system is forecast to become post-tropical on Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km). An oil platform north of the center recently reported
sustained winds of 87 mph (141 km/h) and a peak gust of 105 mph  
(169 km/h) at an elevation of 98 ft (30 m).
 
The minimum central pressure based on the Hurricane Hunter
aircraft data is 976 mb (28.82 inches).  An oil platform located 
east of the center recently reported a pressure of 978.7 mb (28.90 
inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Francine can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header
WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area this afternoon and tonight, with tropical storm
conditions arriving in the warning area during the next several
hours. Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch
area this afternoon and tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area along the
coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama this afternoon and
tonight.
 
RAINFALL: Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4 to 
8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches across southeastern 
Louisiana, Mississippi, far southern Alabama and the Florida 
Panhandle through Thursday night. This rainfall could lead to 
considerable flash, urban and river flooding.   

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total 
Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.  For a list of 
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see 
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS1 with the WMO header ACUS41 
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html. 

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Intracoastal City, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-10 ft
Vermilion Bay...5-10 ft
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-7 ft
Mouth of the Pearl River, LA to Ocean Springs, MS...4-6 ft
Lake Pontchartrain...4-6 ft
Ocean Springs, MS to MS/AL Border...3-5 ft
Cameron, LA to Intracoastal City, LA...3-5 ft
Lake Maurepas...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees.  However,
there may be some overtopping of local levees.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible today and tonight across
parts of southeast Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern
Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine are affecting much of the
northern and northwestern Gulf Coast, likely causing
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Francine Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062024
400 AM CDT Wed Sep 11 2024
 
As expected, Francine has strengthened and become better organized 
overnight. Radar data and earlier reports from the Air Force 
Hurricane Hunters indicate the eyewall is better defined, with deep 
convection wrapping around the center of the hurricane. The eyewall 
has contracted a bit from earlier, although it was open to the south 
on the last fix and in more recent GMI passive microwave images. 
The microwave data also showed some northeastward vortex tilt with 
height, a sign that Francine is experiencing some effects of 
southwesterly shear. Based on the earlier peak 700-mb flight-level 
winds of 89 kt, the initial intensity is set at 80 kt, with a 
minimum pressure of 977 mb based on aircraft data. Air Force and 
NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft are scheduled to investigate Francine 
again this morning. 

The hurricane is moving northeastward at 035/9 kt. A slightly faster 
northeastward motion is forecast today and tonight as the hurricane 
is steered by a mid- to upper-level trough over Texas. This will 
bring the core of Francine toward the Louisiana coast today, with 
landfall expected within the hurricane warning area late this 
afternoon or evening. After landfall, a gradual turn toward the 
north will bring the center of Francine across eastern Louisiana and 
Mississippi. The track guidance is fairly tightly clustered, and the 
latest NHC forecast lies near the center of the guidance envelope 
and very close to the consensus aids.

The structure of Francine could allow for some additional short-term 
strengthening this morning over the very warm Gulf waters, and this 
is reflected in the updated NHC forecast. Southwesterly shear is 
expected to increase over the hurricane later today, and interaction 
with an upper trough should cause drier air to wrap around the 
southern portion of Francine as it nears the coast. Thus, the 
hurricane is not expected to continue strengthening through 
landfall, but will continue to pose a significant risk of 
life-threatening storm surge and damaging winds to locations in the 
warning areas. Once inland, Francine is expected to rapidly weaken, 
quickly lose tropical characteristics, and transition to an 
extratropical cyclone over northern Mississippi.
 
An experimental cone graphic that includes inland Hurricane and
Tropical Storm Watches and Warnings in the U.S. is now available on
the NHC website. Due to the time needed to compile the inland watch
and warning information, the experimental cone graphic will not be
available as quickly as the operational cone. Once it is available,
the experimental cone graphic can be found from a red weblink above
the operational cone graphic at
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?cone#contents. Users are
encouraged to take the experimental product survey found below the
experimental cone.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge today for the 
Louisiana and Mississippi coastlines, where a Storm Surge Warning is 
in effect. Residents in the warning area should follow advice, 
including evacuation orders, given by local officials.

2. Damaging and life-threatening hurricane-force winds are expected 
in portions of southern Louisiana later today, where a Hurricane 
Warning is in effect. Tropical storm conditions are expected to 
begin within this area later this morning, and preparations to 
protect life and property should be complete.

3. Francine is expected to bring heavy rainfall and the risk of 
considerable flash and urban flooding across southeastern Louisiana, 
Mississippi, far southern Alabama and northern Florida through 
Thursday night. Flash and urban flooding is probable across the 
Lower Tennessee Valley and Lower Mississippi Valley Wednesday night 
into Friday morning.
