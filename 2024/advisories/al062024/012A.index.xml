Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD<br/>
200 PM EDT Wed Sep 11 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Francine, located just south of Louisiana, and on newly formed <br/>
Tropical Depression Seven located over the eastern Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL92): <br/>
An area of low pressure located over the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic continues to produce some disorganized shower and <br/>
thunderstorm activity.  Environmental conditions appear marginally <br/>
conducive for some slight development during the next day or two <br/>
while the system moves west-northwestward at 5 to 10 mph over the <br/>
central tropical Atlantic.  The disturbance is expected to reach an <br/>
area of stronger upper-level winds on Friday, likely ending its <br/>
chances for development.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
East of the Leeward Islands (AL94):<br/>
A small but well-defined area of low pressure located several <br/>
hundred miles to the east of the Leeward Islands is producing  <br/>
limited shower and thunderstorm activity. The proximity of dry <br/>
air near the system is expected to limit additional development <br/>
over the next couple of days before environmental conditions <br/>
become even less conducive by this weekend while it moves slowly <br/>
west-northwestward. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore the Southeastern U.S. over the Western Atlantic:<br/>
In a few days, a non-tropical area of low pressure could form along <br/>
a residual frontal boundary a few hundred miles off the <br/>
southeastern U.S. coastline. Thereafter, some subtropical or <br/>
tropical development is possible during the early part of next week <br/>
while the system drifts to the north or northwest.  <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Francine was 
located near latitude 28.6 North, longitude 92.1 West. Francine is 
moving toward the northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h). This general 
motion should continue through this afternoon, and Francine is 
anticipated to make landfall in Louisiana within the warning area 
later this afternoon or this evening. After landfall, the center is 
expected to cross southeastern Louisiana tonight, then move 
northward across Mississippi on Thursday and Thursday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected before landfall. 
Francine is expected to rapidly weaken after landfall, and the 
system is forecast to become post-tropical on Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115
miles (185 km). An oil platform east of the center recently
reported sustained winds of 83 mph (134 km/h) and a peak gust of   
102 mph (164 km/h) at an elevation of 102 ft (31 m).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 976 mb (28.82 inches).  
The oil platform with the winds reported above also reported a 
pressure of 983.3 mb (29.04 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Francine can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header
WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane 
warning area in the next few hours, with tropical storm conditions 
ongoing. Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch 
area later this afternoon and tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area along 
the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama this afternoon and
tonight.
 
RAINFALL: Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4 to
8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches across southeastern
Louisiana, Mississippi, far southern Alabama and the Florida
Panhandle through Thursday night. This rainfall could lead to
considerable flash, urban and river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.  

For a list of rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated 
this storm, see the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS1 with the 
WMO header ACUS41 KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Intracoastal City, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-10 ft
Vermilion Bay...5-10 ft
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-7 ft
Mouth of the Pearl River, LA to Ocean Springs, MS...4-6 ft
Lake Pontchartrain...4-6 ft
Ocean Springs, MS to MS/AL Border...3-5 ft
Cameron, LA to Intracoastal City, LA...3-5 ft
Lake Maurepas...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees.  However,
there may be some overtopping of local levees.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible this afternoon and tonight 
across parts of southeast Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern 
Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine are affecting much of the
northern and northwestern Gulf Coast, likely causing
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Francine Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062024
1000 AM CDT Wed Sep 11 2024
 
Reports from Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft
indicate that Francine has changed little in intensity during the
last several hours.  Flight-level winds from the aircraft 
and a northwest eyewall dropsonde suggest that the maximum 
sustained surface winds are near 80 kt, and the central pressure is 
near 976 mb.  The aircraft have been reporting a large elliptical 
eye open to the south, which matches the depiction of the eye in 
WSR-88D Doppler radar data from Lake Charles.  Satellite imagery 
does show that the cloud pattern is becoming elongated from 
northeast to southwest due to the increasing effects of 
southwesterly shear.
 
The initial motion is now 040/10 kt. A slightly faster northeastward 
motion is forecast this afternoon and tonight as the hurricane 
becomes steered by a mid- to upper-level trough over Texas. This 
will bring the core of Francine toward the Louisiana coast, with 
landfall expected within the hurricane warning area late this 
afternoon or evening. After landfall, a gradual turn toward the 
north will bring the center of Francine across southeastern 
Louisiana and southwestern and central Mississippi on Thursday. 
After that, a northward motion with a decrease in forward speed is 
expected until the cyclone dissipates. There is little change to 
either the track guidance or the track forecast from the previous 
advisory.
 
Due to the increasing shear and the possibility that drier air will 
wrap around the south side of the center, little change in strength 
is expected before landfall.  However, Francine will continue to 
pose a significant risk of life-threatening storm surge and damaging 
winds to locations in the warning areas. Once inland, Francine is 
expected to quickly weaken while also losing tropical 
characteristics. Transition to an extratropical cyclone is expected 
to be complete by Friday morning.
 
An experimental cone graphic that includes inland Hurricane and
Tropical Storm Watches and Warnings in the U.S. is now available on
the NHC website. Due to the time needed to compile the inland watch
and warning information, the experimental cone graphic will not be
available as quickly as the operational cone. Once it is available,
the experimental cone graphic can be found from a red weblink above
the operational cone graphic at
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?cone#contents. Users are
encouraged to take the experimental product survey found below the
experimental cone.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge today for the
Louisiana and Mississippi coastlines, where a Storm Surge Warning is
in effect. Residents in the warning area should continue to follow 
advice given by local officials.
 
2. Damaging and life-threatening hurricane-force winds are expected
in portions of southern Louisiana later today, where a Hurricane
Warning is in effect. Ensure you are in a safe location before the 
onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
 
3. Francine is expected to bring heavy rainfall and the risk of
considerable flash and urban flooding, along with river flooding,
across southeastern Louisiana, Mississippi, far southern Alabama and
the Florida Panhandle through Thursday night. Flash and urban
flooding is probable across the Lower Tennessee Valley and Lower
Mississippi Valley tonight into Friday morning.

Tropical Depression Seven Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072024
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
200 PM CVT Wed Sep 11 2024

Tropical Depression Seven has formed in the eastern Atlantic 
today.  This formation is based on scatterometer depicting a 
closed circulation center, and organized deep convection based on 
TAFB/SAB satellite classifications. Satellite imagery also 
indicates that the low-level circulation has consolidated beneath 
the mid-level center based upon visible imagery  The initial 
intensity is set to 30 kt, based on the scatterometer data.

The depression is estimated to be moving 285/16 kt.  The system 
should move to the west or west-northwest over the next few days 
with the storm being steered by a subtropical ridge to the north of 
the Azores.  Confidence in the depression's track gradually lessens 
beyond forecast hour 72 as the synoptic scale flow becomes more 
complex. The depression will probably gradually slow down between 
hours 72-120 as it becomes caught between a pair of upper level 
ridges; one north of the Azores and another north of the Lesser 
Antilles. Meanwhile, an amplifying upper trough in the North 
Atlantic will attempt to deepen far enough south to steer the 
depression northward. How much the upper trough digs southward 
will determine if and when the storm takes on a more northerly 
track, or if it remains at a lower latitude longer. The forecast 
was placed just south of consensus this forecast period.

Wind shear is not expected to be a big hindrance in its 
development initially while SSTs along its forecast path will 
generally be around 27C.  Thus gradually intensification is shown 
for the first couple of days.  However, shear is forecast to 
increase thereafter along with more marginal dry air conditions. 
This forecast leans more heavily on the regional hurricane models 
which show more modest intensification than the statistical 
dynamical tools but could be conservative at the end depending on 
how much latitude the system gains.
