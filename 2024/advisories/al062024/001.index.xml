Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Sun Sep 8 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Western Gulf of Mexico (AL91):<br/>
An elongated area of low pressure located over the southwestern Gulf <br/>
of Mexico continues to produce a large area of showers and <br/>
thunderstorms. Satellite-derived winds show this system does not yet <br/>
have a well-defined center, but is producing winds of 40 to 45 mph <br/>
on its western side. Environmental conditions appear conducive for <br/>
additional development and a tropical storm is expected to form <br/>
during the next day or so.  The system is forecast to move generally <br/>
northwestward and then northward near or along the Gulf coast of <br/>
Mexico, upper Texas, and Louisiana coasts with additional <br/>
strengthening possible by the middle of this week. <br/>
<br/>
Interests along the Gulf coast of Mexico, upper Texas, and Louisiana <br/>
coasts should closely monitor the progress of this system. Tropical <br/>
Storm Watches could be required for portions of the coast of <br/>
northeastern Mexico and southern Texas later this afternoon or <br/>
tonight, with additional watches possible along the coast of Texas <br/>
and Louisiana later tonight or Monday. An Air-Force Reserve <br/>
Hurricane Hunter aircraft is currently in route to to investigate <br/>
the system this afternoon. Additional information on this system, <br/>
including gale warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued <br/>
by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL92): <br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure <br/>
over the central tropical Atlantic continue to show signs of <br/>
organization. Environmental conditions appear conducive for <br/>
additional development of this system over the next couple of days, <br/>
and a tropical depression is now likely to form during that time <br/>
while the system meanders over the central tropical Atlantic.  By <br/>
the middle of this week the system should begin moving more westward <br/>
at around 10 mph through the rest of the week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A trough of low pressure located several hundred miles southwest of <br/>
the Cabo Verde Islands is producing a broad area of disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms. This system is expected to move very <br/>
little during the next couple of days until it potentially interacts <br/>
with a tropical wave that is forecast to move off the west coast of <br/>
Africa on Monday. Environmental conditions thereafter are expected <br/>
to be favorable for gradual development of this system, and a <br/>
tropical depression could form by the middle or latter part of the <br/>
week while the system begins moving slowly west-northwestward. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>

At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the elongated disturbance was centered 
near latitude 21.6 North, longitude 94.6 West. The system is moving 
toward the northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h) and a slow northwestward  
motion followed by a turn more northward is expected over the next 
day or two. On the forecast track, the disturbance is expected to 
move near the northern Gulf Coast of Mexico on Tuesday, and 
approach the Upper Texas and Louisiana coastline on Wednesday.
 
Air Force reconnaissance data indicate that maximum sustained 
winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. The system is 
expected to become a tropical storm on Monday, with more 
significant intensification forecast to occur on Tuesday.  The 
system is forecast to become a hurricane before it reaches the 
northwestern U.S. Gulf Coast.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km), 
primarily west of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area along the northern coast of Mexico beginning Tuesday.

RAINFALL: Potential Tropical Cyclone Six is expected to bring 
storm total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches, with local amounts to 12 
inches, from the coast of far northeast Mexico northward along 
portions of the Texas Coast and into Louisiana through Thursday. 
This rainfall would lead to the risk of flash and urban flooding. 

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Potential Tropical Cyclone Six, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.

STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding is possible along the Mexico 
coast within areas of onshore flow. 

SURF:  Swells generated by this system are affecting portions of the 
Gulf coast of Mexico and are expected to spread northwestward across 
the northwestern Gulf of Mexico coastline through midweek.  These 
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions .  Please consult products from your local weather 
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Potential Tropical Cyclone Six Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062024
400 PM CDT Sun Sep 08 2024
 
The area of disturbed weather located over the southwestern Gulf of 
Mexico does not possess a well-defined circulation yet.  
Scatterometer and aircraft data indicate that it consists of an 
elongated trough of low pressure oriented north-northwest to 
south-southeast. However, there is a large area of 35-45 kt winds 
located southwest of the trough axis. These tropical-storm-force 
winds are also confirmed by an ongoing Air Force Reserve 
reconnaissance mission, which found 975 mb flight-level winds up to 
56 kt, with SFMR winds also quite high in the same vicinity. Some of 
these high winds are likely enhanced in part due to a barrier jet 
offshore of the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico. Because the system 
is expected to become a tropical storm over the next day or so, and 
tropical-storm-force winds are forecast to be near the coast of 
Mexico within 48 hours, advisories are being initiated on Potential 
Tropical Cyclone Six. The initial intensity is set to 45 kt for this 
advisory based on a blend of scatterometer and aircraft data. 
 
The initial motion is highly uncertain given the fact that a 
well-defined center does not yet exist, but our best estimate is 
320/4 kt. The track guidance shows this slow northwest drift 
continuing, though the center could reform or redevelop anywhere 
along the current trough axis as the center becomes better defined. 
Afterwards, the system is expected to turn northward and then 
north-northeastward as it rounds the periphery of a mid-level ridge 
centered over Cuba. The track guidance this cycle shifted east, with 
the GFS and ECMWF models notably on the east side of the guidance 
envelope. The initial NHC track forecast won't go quite that far 
east, but splits the difference between the consensus aid TVCN and 
these eastward model solutions. Future adjustments could be 
necessary if these eastward trends continue. Given the current 
structure, the track forecast is of lower confidence than usual. 

Given that the current circulation is quite elongated, it will 
likely take a day or even longer for intensification to begin, and 
much of the wind enhancement on its southwestern side is more of a 
reflection of a barrier jet rather than the true intensity of the 
stretched out vorticity maxima. Both the global model and 
hurricane-regional model guidance suggest the circulation will 
become well-defined by tomorrow afternoon, and the NHC intensity 
forecast shows the system becoming a tropical storm by that time. 
Until then, the intensity guidance, especially the 
statistical-dynamical guidance SHIPS and LGEM, likely show too much 
short-term intensification because these tools are designed for 
tropical cyclones and not elongated troughs. The hurricane-regional 
models HAFS-A/B seem to have a fairly realistic depiction of the 
system's current structure, and show little intensification for the 
next 36 h or so. Afterwards, as they depict the center becoming 
well-defined with contracting wind radii, they show more significant 
intensification. Between 48-72 h, PTC Six could interact with an 
upper-level trough centered over Texas, and its intensity as it 
approaches the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast will be governed by 
its inner-core structure and if it undergoes a favorable trough 
interaction. This initial forecast shows the system becoming a 
hurricane just before landfall. 

KEY MESSAGES:

1. The system is forecast to become a tropical storm on Monday as 
it moves northwestward to northward near or along the western Gulf 
of Mexico coast. Tropical Storm Watches have been issued for a 
portion of northeastern Mexico and additional watches may be needed 
for the southern Texas coast tonight. 

2. The system is forecast to become a hurricane before it reaches 
the northwestern Gulf Coast by the middle of the week.  While it is 
too soon to pinpoint the exact location and magnitude of impacts, 
the potential for life-threatening storm surge and damaging winds 
are increasing for portions of the Upper Texas and Louisiana 
coastlines beginning Tuesday night.  Hurricane and Storm Surge 
Watches will likely be issued for a portion of that area on Monday, 
and residents should ensure they have their hurricane plan in 
place. 

3. Potential Tropical Cyclone Six is expected to bring heavy 
rainfall and the risk of flash flooding from the coast of far 
northeast Mexico into portions of coastal Texas and Louisiana 
through Thursday.
