Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Sun Sep 15 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gordon, located over the central tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore the Southeastern U.S. Coast (AL95):<br/>
A non-tropical low pressure area is located along a frontal <br/>
boundary a couple of hundred miles off the southeastern U.S. coast, <br/>
and is producing winds to gale force north of its center.  The low <br/>
is forecast to move northwestward or northward over the warm waters <br/>
of the Gulf Stream toward the coasts of North Carolina and South <br/>
Carolina, and it could become a subtropical or tropical storm during <br/>
the next day or two if the associated front dissipates and showers <br/>
and thunderstorms become sufficiently organized.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of tropical or subtropical development, the low is <br/>
likely to bring gusty winds, heavy rains with the potential for <br/>
flash flooding, coastal flooding, and dangerous beach conditions to <br/>
portions of the U.S. Southeast and Mid-Atlantic coast during the <br/>
next couple of days, and interests in these areas should monitor <br/>
the system's progress.  Additional information can be found in <br/>
products issued by your local National Weather Service Forecast <br/>
Office and High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather <br/>
Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and <br/>

Tropical Storm Gordon Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072024
1100 AM AST Sun Sep 15 2024

Gordon's center remains displaced at least 120 n mi to the west of a 
ragged-looking area of deep convection.  Using a shear pattern from 
satellite imagery, Dvorak data T-numbers correspond to an intensity 
below tropical storm strength.  However,scatterometer data, which 
did not completely sample the circulation, suggest that the system's 
intensity may still be close to to 35 kt, so Gordon is kept at 
tropical storm status for this advisory.

The cyclone continues to move west-southwestward, with a current 
motion estimate of 250/8 kt.  Gordon is being steered by a mid-level 
high pressure system to its north and northwest.  This high is 
forecast to gradually weaken which should result in a slowing of the 
cyclone's forward speed over the next few days.  In 3-4 days, the 
high is predicted to shift farther west, resulting in a turn toward 
the north.  By late in the forecast period, a broad trough becomes 
established to the west-northwest of Gordon.  This is expected to 
cause the tropical cyclone to turn toward the north-northeast.  The 
official track forecast is similar to the previous one and is 
reasonably close to the latest HFIP Corrected Consensus.

Gordon has been experiencing strong westerly vertical wind shear 
for the past couple of days, associated with a large upper-level 
trough over the eastern Atlantic.  The global models show this 
trough moving eastward, away from the tropical cyclone.  As a 
result, there may be some relaxation of the shear over the next 
several days.  Although Gordon has been disrupted so much by the 
shear that it could degenerate into a remnant low soon, the more 
conducive upper-level environment predicted by the dynamical 
guidance could result in some restrengthening.  This is also 
indicated by the latest SHIPS model output.  As a compromise, the 
official forecast shows little change in strength through the 
forecast period.
