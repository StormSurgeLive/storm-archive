Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Sun Sep 15 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gordon, located over the central tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore the Southeastern U.S. Coast:<br/>
A non-tropical low pressure area has formed along a frontal boundary <br/>
a couple of hundred miles off the southeastern U.S. coast and is <br/>
producing winds to gale force north of its center.  The low is <br/>
forecast to move northwestward or northward over the warm waters of <br/>
the Gulf Stream toward the coasts of North Carolina and South <br/>
Carolina, and it could become a subtropical or tropical storm during <br/>
the next day or two if the associated front dissipates and showers <br/>
and thunderstorms become sufficiently organized.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of tropical or subtropical development, the low is <br/>
likely to bring gusty winds, heavy rains with the potential for <br/>
flash flooding, coastal flooding, and dangerous beach conditions to <br/>
portions of the U.S. Southeast and Mid-Atlantic coast during the <br/>
next couple of days, and interests in these areas should monitor <br/>
the system's progress.  Additional information can be found in <br/>
products issued by your local National Weather Service Forecast <br/>
Office and High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather <br/>
Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and <br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gordon was
located near latitude 19.6 North, longitude 44.8 West.  Gordon is
moving toward the west-southwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A west to 
west-southwest motion is expected during the next few days, with 
Gordon forecast to slow down considerably through the middle of the 
week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gordon is expected to weaken to a tropical depression later today,
and it could degenerate into a remnant low at any time during the
next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
to the north of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).

<title>Tropical Storm Gordon Forecast Discussion Number 15</title>

Tropical Storm Gordon Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072024
1100 PM AST Sat Sep 14 2024
 
Gordon's surface circulation has become fully exposed this evening 
and is displaced about 150 mi west of the remaining deep convective 
mass.  The deep-layer westerly shear likely has increased during the 
past few hours.  The initial intensity is lowered to 35 kt for this 
advisory and is based on constrained subjective satellite intensity 
T-number estimates from TAFB and SAB.
 
Based on the statistical GFS/ECMWF SHIPS intensity guidance and 
global model sounding forecasts, Gordon should continue to struggle 
and weaken during the next few days while moving through a harsh 
thermodynamic environment.  In fact, the global models agree that 
the cyclone will become a remnant low toward the end of the week as 
it commences a gradual north-northwestward turn.  For now, the 
surface circulation is expected to remain intact, and Gordon is 
expected to continue moving generally northward, where atmospheric 
conditions could become less hostile.  The official intensity 
forecast shows Gordon maintaining depression strength through day 5 
in deference to the global model and HCCA solutions.  The 
Decay-SHIPS, LGEM, and IVCN intensity aids, however, continue to 
show significant re-strengthening late in the period.  Consequently, 
subsequent advisories may need changes, particularly if the global 
models align more with the intensity aids mentioned above.  
 
Gordon's initial motion is estimated to be west-southwestward or 
245/9 kt and is steered by a low- to mid-tropospheric ridge 
extending west-southwestward from high pressure over the North 
Atlantic.  Gordon should continue toward the west-southwest or west 
during the next 60-72 hours.  Afterward, a weakness in the 
subtropical ridge over the central Atlantic is forecast in response 
to an amplifying mid- to upper-tropospheric trough.  As the cyclone 
approaches this break in the ridge, the cyclone should gradually 
turn toward the north-northwest by the end of the period.  This 
forecast track scenario once again assumes that the cyclone 
will survive during the next several days.
