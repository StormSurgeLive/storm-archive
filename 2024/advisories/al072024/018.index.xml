Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Sun Sep 15 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gordon, located over the central tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore the Southeastern U.S. Coast (AL95):<br/>
A non-tropical low pressure area is located along a frontal <br/>
boundary a couple of hundred miles off the southeastern U.S. coast, <br/>
and is producing winds to gale force north of its center.  The low <br/>
is forecast to move northwestward or northward over the warm waters <br/>
of the Gulf Stream toward the coasts of North Carolina and South <br/>
Carolina, and it could become a subtropical or tropical storm during <br/>
the next day or so if the associated front dissipates and showers <br/>
and thunderstorms become sufficiently organized.  An Air Force <br/>
Hurricane Hunter aircraft is currently investigating the system.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of tropical or subtropical development, the low is <br/>
likely to bring gusty winds, heavy rains with the potential for <br/>
flash flooding, coastal flooding, and dangerous beach conditions to <br/>
portions of the U.S. Southeast and Mid-Atlantic coast during the <br/>
next couple of days, and interests in these areas should monitor <br/>
the system's progress.  Additional information can be found in <br/>
products issued by your local National Weather Service Forecast <br/>
Office and High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather <br/>
Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and <br/>
online at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php<br/>

Tropical Depression Gordon Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072024
500 PM AST Sun Sep 15 2024
 
Gordon's center remains well displaced to the west of the area of 
deep convection. There recently was a convective burst near the 
center, and it remains to be seen if this is an intermittent pulse 
of convection or if the system will try to maintain convection. 
Subjective and objective Dvorak estimates have decreased between 25 
to 35 kt. Using an average of these estimates, the intensity for 
this advisory is set to 30 kt, and Gordon has weakened into a 
tropical depression.
 
The cyclone continues to move west-southwestward, with a current 
motion estimate of 260/7 kt.  Gordon is being steered by a mid-level 
ridge to to the north.  The steering flow is expected to weaken as 
the ridge to the north becomes less pronounced, which should result 
in Gordon slowing down considerably. By late in the forecast period, 
a trough develops to the west-northwest of Gordon. This is expected 
to cause the tropical cyclone to turn toward the north-northeast.  
The official track forecast is similar to the previous one, nudged 
slightly to the right and a little faster towards the end of the 
period near the HFIP corrected consensus.
 
Gordon continues to experience strong westerly vertical wind shear 
and is within fairly stable airmass. It still remains possible that 
the the system could degenerate into a remnant low, as it struggles 
to produce convection. The environmental conditions improve towards 
the end of the forecast period that depicts that the system could 
re-strengthen. The current intensity forecast is similar to the 
previous forecast but does show Gordon becoming a tropical storm 
again towards the end of the period, if it can survive the next few 
days.
