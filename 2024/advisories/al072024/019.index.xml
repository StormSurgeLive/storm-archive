Gordon forecast to slow down considerably through the middle of the
week.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 30 mph (45 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Little change in strength is forecast over the next 
several days, though Gordon could become a post-tropical remnant low 
at any time. 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).

Tropical Depression Gordon Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072024
1100 PM AST Sun Sep 15 2024
 
Gordon is barely hanging on as a tropical cyclone tonight. While
the low-level circulation continues to be well-defined, the
convection associated with this circulation is meager, and barely
meets the definition of a tropical cyclone. Subjective and
objective estimates continue to decrease this evening, and the
initial intensity is set to 25 kt this advisory.
 
The tropical depression continues to move south of due west,
estimated at 260/6 kt. This motion should continue for the next day
or so as the shallow cyclone is primarily steered by a low to
mid-level ridge positioned to its west-northwest. Thereafter, a
significant weakness in this steering flow is forecast to develop,
related to a non-tropical low expected to drop equatorward towards
Gordon. This steering change is expected to cause the tropical
cyclone to first slow its forward motion, and then gradually turn
poleward, moving north-northeastward by the end of the forecast
period. The track guidance this cycle is a bit more poleward and
faster compared to the previous one, and the NHC track is once
again nudged a bit more right and faster compared to the prior
advisory.
 
Gordon is struggling mightily against very dry mid-level air, and 
this environment is unlikely to change much over the next few days. 
In fact, it would not be surprising to see Gordon become a remnant 
low at any time if convection does not soon return in a more 
prominent way near the center. After 48 h, the environment is 
forecast to begin moistening some while vertical wind shear is 
expected to be fairly low, providing an opportunity for Gordon to 
re-intensify, presuming there is enough of a system left to take 
advantage of the improving environmental conditions. The NHC 
intensity forecast is not much different from the prior one aside 
from the weaker initial intensity, and assumes Gordon will survive 
in the short-term, which is not a forgone conclusion.

local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the disturbance was centered near latitude 
32.1 North, longitude 77.8 West.  The system has been moving 
erratically this evening, but the disturbance is expected to start 
moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h) overnight.  On the 
forecast track, the center of the system should reach the coast 
within the warning area on Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher 
gusts. This system is likely to become a tropical storm tonight or 
tomorrow morning and some strengthening is possible before the 
system makes landfall.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight can be found in 
the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO 
header WTNT43 KNHC.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area beginning late tonight.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will 
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising 
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the 
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if 
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
South Santee River, SC to Oregon Inlet, NC... 1-3 ft
Neuse and Bay Rivers, NC... 1-3 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers, NC... 1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to
your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Through Wednesday, Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight will
bring 3 to 6 inches of rainfall with isolated totals near 8 inches
across northern and northeast portions of South Carolina along with
the North Carolina Coastal Plain. Across the rest of North Carolina
and much of Virginia, the Potential Tropical Cyclone will bring 2 to
4 inches of rain, with isolated totals near 6 inches. This rainfall
could lead to isolated to scattered flash and urban flooding and
minor river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?ero
 
TORNADOES: A couple of tornadoes may occur Monday across eastern 
North Carolina and the vicinity.
 
SURF: Swells are forecast to affect portions of the coast of the
southeastern United States during the next couple of days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight Forecast Discussion Number 1</title>

Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082024
500 PM EDT Sun Sep 15 2024

Reports from an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that 
the non-tropical low pressure system off the South Carolina coast 
has a broad low-level circulation center, but could be in the 
process of reforming closer to the mid-level circulation currently 
seen on radar from Wilmington, NC.  However, the system may not have 
yet completely shed its frontal characteristics. Since there is deep 
convection over and around the center, it is becoming more
likely the cyclone could become either a tropical or subtropical 
cyclone within the next day or so. Therefore the disturbance is 
being designated as Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight at this time 
with an initial intensity of 40 kt. 

There has been significant uncertainty in the center positions since 
last night, and the best guess at initial motion is northwestward or 
320/6 kt.  Over the next couple of days, the disturbance is expected 
to be steered by the flow on the southern or southwestern side of a 
mid-level high pressure system over the northeastern United States. 
This motion should bring the center inland over the southeastern 
U.S. coast in 24 hours or so.  The NHC forecast track is close to 
the simple and corrected dynamical consensus model solutions.

the system will be traversing warm waters for the next 24 hours or 
so and it may be situated within an area of relatively low shear 
near the axis of an upper-level trough.  Therefore some 
strengthening is possible before landfall, and the official forecast 
is similar to the latest decay-SHIPS model guidance.

Key Messages:

1. An area of low pressure off the southeastern U.S. coast is 
expected to bring impacts from tropical-storm-force winds, heavy 
rain, coastal flooding, and high surf to portions of the southeast 
United States coast beginning tonight and continuing during the next 
couple of days.  

2. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the 
coasts of South Carolina and North Carolina within the Tropical 
Storm Warning area beginning tonight through tomorrow night. 

3. The system will bring the potential for scattered flash and urban 
flooding and minor river flooding across eastern North Carolina and 
northeast South Carolina from tonight into early Tuesday. There is 
also a risk of isolated flash and urban flooding across much of the 
Mid-Atlantic region through Wednesday.
