Tropical Depression Gordon Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072024
500 PM AST Mon Sep 16 2024

Gordon is producing only a few sporadic bursts of deep convection, 
mainly over the southern and eastern portion of its circulation.  
The vertical wind shear does not appear to be very strong at this 
time, as evidenced by the relatively slow motions of the cirrus 
clouds over the system.  Since the cyclone is situated over a 
warm ocean, the suppression of convection is probably due to a 
stable air mass and/or dry air.  The advisory intensity is held at 
30 kt in accordance with an objective estimate of 32 kt from 
UW-CIMSS and a subjective Dvorak Current Intensity number of 30 kt 
from TAFB.

Gordon continues to move slowly westward with a current motion 
estimate of 270/5 kt.  A high pressure area that was north of the 
system over the past couple of days is shifting westward, and being 
replaced by a mid-level trough within the next day or two.  Also, 
there is a frontal cyclone located about 10 degrees to the north of 
Gordon.  This feature, along with the trough, should cause the 
tropical cyclone to turn northward and north-northeastward during 
the next couple of days.  Although Gordon is expected to at least 
briefly  interact with the frontal wave, the global model guidance 
indicates that it will retain its identity and move farther 
north-northeastward over the Atlantic during the forecast period.
The official forecast is shifted a little more to the east of the 
previous NHC prediction and is close to the corrected model 
consensus, HCCA.

Output from the statistical-dynamical SHIPS models shows some 
increase in the low- to mid-level relative humidity and also 
suggests some increase in instability during the forecast period.  
The SHIPS output also shows generally low to moderate vertical 
shear for the next few days.  The official forecast shows some 
restrengthening after 48 hours, but not as much of an intensity 
increase as called for by the SHIPS/LGEM predictions.

* South Santee River, South Carolina northward to Ocracoke Inlet,
North Carolina
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within the
next few hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the disturbance was centered near latitude 
33.1 North, longitude 78.3 West. The system is moving toward the 
north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h). A northwestward motion is 
expected during the next day or two. On the forecast track, the low 
will reach the coast of South Carolina by this evening and then 
move inland across the Carolinas tonight through early Wednesday.
 
Surface observations indicate that maximum sustained winds have 
decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. Continued 
weakening is expected during the next day or so, especially after 
the system moves inland. The low is forecast to dissipate over the 
Carolinas by early Wednesday.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km) 
from the center. A NOS station at Wrightsville Beach, North 
Carolina, recently reported a sustained wind of 35 mph (56 km/h) and 
a gust of 40 mph (65 km/h). A C-MAN station at Masonboro Inlet, 
North Carolina, recently reported a sustained wind of 32 mph (52 
km/h) and a gust of 40 mph (65 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight can be found in
the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO
header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions within the warning area are 
expected to diminish through late this afternoon.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
South Santee River, SC to Oregon Inlet, NC... 1-3 ft
Neuse and Bay Rivers, NC... 1-3 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers, NC... 1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves. Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances. For information specific to
your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight will bring 4 to 8 inches
of rainfall, with isolated totals near 10 inches, across portions of
northeast South Carolina and southeast North Carolina into tonight.
Across the remainder of North Carolina, 2 to 4 inches of rainfall,
with isolated totals near 6 inches, is expected through Tuesday.
Over much of Virginia, 1 to 3 inches of rainfall, with locally
higher amounts, is expected tonight through Wednesday. This rainfall
could lead to a risk of flash and urban flooding and minor river
flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?ero.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes may occur through this evening across
eastern North Carolina.
 
SURF: Swells are forecast to affect portions of the coast of the
southeastern United States through Tuesday. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>

Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082024
1100 AM EDT Mon Sep 16 2024
 
The low pressure system that the NHC has been monitoring off the 
Carolina coast has not become better organized this morning. The 
low-level circulation remains elongated and not well defined, based 
on overnight data from the Air Force Hurricane Hunters and recent 
visible satellite images. The flight-level temperature data from the 
aircraft also suggested a frontal boundary remains in close 
proximity to the low, which is consistent with the cloud pattern of 
the system. The strongest winds and heaviest rains lie to the north 
and northeast of the estimated center and are currently spreading 
across southeastern North Carolina. Based on surface synoptic 
observations, the initial intensity is set at 45 kt.

Aircraft data and satellite images indicate the elongated center 
lies a bit north of previous estimates, with an uncertain initial 
motion of north-northwestward at 4 kt. This general motion should 
continue today, bringing the center toward the coast of South 
Carolina and inland within the warning area later today. However, it 
should be noted that much of the hazardous weather conditions extend 
well to the northeast of the center and are currently moving onshore 
over the Cape Fear region of North Carolina. A northwestward motion 
is forecast to continue over land while the weakening low spins 
down. The updated NHC track forecast lies a bit to the right of the 
previous prediction based on the latest track consensus aids.

With limited time before it moves inland, the chances of this system 
becoming a tropical or subtropical cyclone continue to decrease. The 
intensity guidance shows quick weakening once the low crosses the 
coastline, and the official NHC intensity forecast brings the system 
down to 30 kt in 12 h, on the lower end of the guidance envelope but 
consistent with the global model fields. Weakening should continue 
through dissipation, which is forecast to occur on Wednesday.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
coasts of South Carolina and North Carolina within the Tropical
Storm Warning area during the next several hours.
 
2. Locally considerable flash and urban flooding and minor river 
flooding is possible across southeast North Carolina and northeast 
South Carolina through tonight. There is also a risk of isolated 
flash and urban flooding across much of the Mid-Atlantic region 
through Wednesday.
 
3. Coastal flooding and high surf are likely along portions of
the southeastern U.S. coast through this afternoon.
