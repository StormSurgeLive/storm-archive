Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Thu Sep 12 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Seven, located over the central Atlantic Ocean.  The <br/>
Weather Prediction Center is issuing advisories on Post-Tropical <br/>
Cyclone Francine, located inland over the Mississippi, Missouri, <br/>
and Tennessee tri-state area.  <br/>
<br/>
East of the Leeward Islands (AL94):<br/>
Scattered showers and thunderstorms continue in association with a <br/>
small area of low pressure located a couple of hundred miles east of <br/>
the Leeward Islands. The proximity of dry air near the system is <br/>
expected to limit additional development over the next couple of <br/>
days. Environmental conditions are expected to become even less <br/>
conducive over the weekend while the system moves slowly <br/>
west-northwestward.  Regardless of development, this system could <br/>
produce locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds across the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands on Friday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore the Southeastern U.S.:<br/>
A non-tropical area of low pressure could form along a residual <br/>
frontal boundary a few hundred miles off the southeastern U.S. <br/>
coastline this weekend. Thereafter, some subtropical or tropical <br/>
development is possible during the early part of next week while the <br/>
system drifts to the north or northwest.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Seven Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072024
1100 PM AST Thu Sep 12 2024
 
The depression has been holding steady this evening.  After a lull 
in the convective activity which exposed the low-level circulation, 
thunderstorms have been building steadily to the east of the center. 
Unfortunately, the scatterometer pass missed the core of the system 
once again.  The initial intensity remains at 30 kt, close to the 
subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB.

A subtropical ridge to the north of the depression is steering the 
system west-northwestward at about 14 kt.  As the ridge weakens 
during the next few days, the cyclone should gradually slow and turn 
more westward.  There is still a large spread in the track guidance 
envelope early next week, which seems partially related to the depth 
of the vortex.  The ECMWF solution shows a much stronger system that 
turns the cyclone to the north sooner compared to the GFS and 
GFS-based regional models showing a weaker system that moves faster 
and stays in the low-level westerly flow.  The latest NHC track 
forecast has been nudged a little to the south and lies between the 
previous prediction and the consensus aids. 

Marginal environmental conditions appear to be preventing the 
depression from making any appreciable intensity changes.  Visible 
satellite imagery from earlier today showed a band of Saharan dust 
wrapping around the northern semicircle of the circulation.  The 
intensity guidance has shifted downward again this cycle, with many 
models showing a steady-to-weakening system over the next 3-4 days.  
By the end of the forecast period, there is quite a bit of spread in 
the intensity guidance as noted earlier.  The latest NHC intensity 
forecast has been decreased slightly but remains on the high side of 
the various aids.
