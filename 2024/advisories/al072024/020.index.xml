Tropical Depression Gordon Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072024
500 AM AST Mon Sep 16 2024

The convection that developed during the evening hours on the east 
side of Gordon has persisted through the night.  Nighttime CIRA 
proxy vis imagery suggests that the low-level center of Gordon is 
near the western edge of this convection.  Subjective and objective 
intensity estimates range from 25 to 33 kt.  In the absence of 
ASCAT data, no change is made to the 25-kt intensity carried in 
the previous NHC advisory.

The initial motion is estimated to be westward, or 270/7 kt. 
Gordon is being steered westward by the subtropical ridge, situated 
to the north of the tropical depression.  This setup should 
continue to steer Gordon slowly westward through today.  
Thereafter, a frontal low located to the north of the ridge is 
forecast to drop equatorward towards Gordon, creating a weakness 
in the subtropical ridge.  As a result of this steering change, 
Gordon should initially slow its forward motion, and then turn 
toward the north-northeast while gradually accelerating.  The 
consensus track models have continued to shift a bit to the right 
and faster, and the latest NHC forecast is again nudged in that 
direction.

Gordon has been doing a remarkable job fighting off environmental 
dry air given how the area of convection has maintained itself 
overnight relatively close to the low-level center.  Gordon is 
forecast to remain in a dry mid-level environment for the next few 
days, although some slight moistening of the environment is 
possible beyond 24 h while the vertical shear is forecast to remain 
relatively low.  Although it is still possible that Gordon could 
degenerate to a remnant low, if the cyclone is able to survive the 
next 24 h, then its chances of surviving the next 5 days would seem 
to increase.  There is also some uncertainty as to how Gordon's 
circulation could potentially interact with a non-tropical low in 3 
to 4 days.  If Gordon then survives its interaction with the 
non-tropical low, some strengthening would be possible in 4 to 5 
days as shown by some of the global models.  No changes were made to 
the previous NHC intensity prediction, which still assumes Gordon 
will survive in the short term.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Edisto Beach, South Carolina northward to Ocracoke Inlet, North
Carolina
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within the
next 24 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the disturbance was centered near latitude
32.4 North, longitude 78.3 West.  The system is moving toward the
northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A faster motion toward the 
northwest is expected today and Tuesday, followed by a gradual turn 
toward the north by Wednesday.  On the forecast track, the low will 
reach the coast of South Carolina this afternoon and then move 
inland across the Carolinas tonight through Wednesday.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 
km/h) with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is expected 
before the system reaches the coast, and the low still has a 
chance of becoming a tropical or subtropical storm.  Weakening is 
forecast after the system moves inland, and it is likely to 
dissipate over the Carolinas by late Wednesday.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.  A sustained wind of 35 mph (56 km/h) and a gust 
to 40 mph (65 km/h) were recently reported at Cape Lookout, North 
Carolina.
 
The minimum central pressure based on aircraft dropsonde data is 
1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight can be found in
the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO
header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area through this evening.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
South Santee River, SC to Oregon Inlet, NC... 1-3 ft
Neuse and Bay Rivers, NC... 1-3 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers, NC... 1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to
your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight will bring 4 to 8 inches 
of rainfall, with isolated totals near 10 inches, across portions of 
northeast South Carolina into southeast North Carolina today into 
tonight. Across the remainder of North Carolina, 2 to 4 inches of 
rainfall, with isolated totals near 6 inches, are expected through 
Tuesday. Over much of Virginia, 1 to 3 inches of rainfall, with 
locally higher amounts, are expected tonight through Wednesday. 
This rainfall could lead to a risk flash and urban flooding and 
minor river flooding.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?ero.
 
TORNADOES:  A couple of tornadoes may occur through this evening
across the eastern Carolinas.
 
SURF: Swells are forecast to affect portions of the coast of the
southeastern United States during the next couple of days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight Forecast Discussion Number 2</title>

Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082024
1100 PM EDT Sun Sep 15 2024

The Potential Tropical Cyclone (PTC) has become a bit better 
organized tonight, with deep convection on the northeast side of the 
circulation.  Additionally, the last aircraft pass just north of the 
estimated center of the system indicated that the temperature 
gradient from east-to-west had weakened.  However, it is still 
unclear whether a well-defined center exists looking at the latest 
satellite and radar animations, with the center that the plane found 
earlier looking somewhat elongated.  For now, the system will remain 
a Potential Tropical Cyclone, and the winds are set to 40 kt. An Air 
Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft is scheduled to be in the area 
overnight for a better look at the system's structure.
 
It appears the system has only drifted northwest since this
afternoon.  The PTC should move a bit faster to the northwest on
Monday and Tuesday due to flow from a ridge over the northeastern
United States.  There is general agreement on this track in the
models, though they differ on the speed.  The new forecast is 
trended a bit slower than the last one, but not as slow as the 
ECMWF model.

The system has a high chance of being a tropical cyclone early 
tomorrow, and some strengthening is possible before landfall as it 
moves over warm waters with a conducive upper-level trough 
interaction.  The official forecast is similar to the latest 
decay-SHIPS model guidance and the prior forecast.

Key Messages:
 
1. An area of low pressure off the southeastern U.S. coast is
expected to bring impacts from tropical-storm-force winds, heavy
rain, coastal flooding, and high surf to portions of the southeast
United States coast beginning tonight and continuing during the next
couple of days.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
coasts of South Carolina and North Carolina within the Tropical
Storm Warning area beginning tonight through tomorrow night.
 
3. The system will bring the potential for scattered flash and urban
flooding and minor river flooding across eastern North Carolina and
northeast South Carolina from tonight into early Tuesday. There is
also a risk of isolated flash and urban flooding across much of the
Mid-Atlantic region through Wednesday.
