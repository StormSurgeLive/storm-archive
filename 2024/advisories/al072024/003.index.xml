Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Wed Sep 11 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Francine, located over southern Louisiana and on Tropical <br/>
Depression Seven located over the eastern Atlantic Ocean. <br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL92): <br/>
An area of low pressure located over the central tropical Atlantic <br/>
continues to produce disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity.  <br/>
Environmental conditions appear marginally conducive for some slight <br/>
development during the next day or so while the system moves <br/>
westward at 5 to 10 mph over the central tropical Atlantic.  The <br/>
disturbance is expected to reach an area of stronger upper-level <br/>
winds on Friday, likely ending its chances for development.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
East of the Leeward Islands (AL94):<br/>
A small area of low pressure located several hundred miles to the <br/>
east of the Leeward Islands is producing a limited area of <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms. The proximity of dry air <br/>
near the system is expected to limit additional development over the <br/>
next couple of days before environmental conditions become even less <br/>
conducive by this weekend as it moves slowly west-northwestward. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore the Southeastern U.S.:<br/>
In a few days, a non-tropical area of low pressure could form along <br/>
a residual frontal boundary a few hundred miles off the southeastern <br/>
U.S. coastline. Thereafter, some subtropical or tropical development <br/>
is possible during the early part of next week while the system <br/>
drifts to the north or northwest.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Francine was 
located inland near latitude 29.6 North, longitude 90.9 West. 
Francine is moving toward the northeast near 17 mph (28 km/h). This 
general motion should continue, taking the system across 
southeastern Louisiana tonight and across Mississippi Thursday 
and Thursday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are now near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Rapid weakening is expected, and the system is forecast 
to become post-tropical Thursday night or Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140
miles (220 km). 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 978 mb (28.88 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Francine can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header
WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are occurring in portions of the 
hurricane warning area, with tropical storm conditions spreading 
inland. Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch 
area tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area along
the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama tonight.
 
RAINFALL: Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4 to
8 inches, with local amounts to 12 inches across southeastern
Louisiana, Mississippi, far southern Alabama and the Florida
Panhandle through Thursday night. This rainfall could lead to
considerable flash, urban and river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.  For a list of
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS1 with the WMO header ACUS41
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Burns Point, LA to Port Fourchon, LA...5-10 ft
Port Fourchon, LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River, LA...4-7 ft
Mouth of the Pearl River, LA to Ocean Springs, MS...4-6 ft
Lake Pontchartrain...4-6 ft
Ocean Springs, MS to MS/AL Border...3-5 ft
Intracoastal City, LA to Burns Point, LA...3-5 ft
Lake Maurepas...3-5 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  Storm surge is not expected
to pose a threat to the risk reduction system levees.  However,
there may be some overtopping of local levees.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible through tonight across
parts of southeast Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern
Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle. On Thursday, the tornado risk
will move into additional parts of Alabama, southwest Georgia and
the Florida Panhandle.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine are affecting much of the
northern Gulf Coast, likely causing life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather 
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Francine Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062024
400 PM CDT Wed Sep 11 2024
 
Satellite, radar, and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft
data indicate that not only has Francine stayed well organized 
during the past six hours despite increasing westerly shear, it has 
strengthened a little. The latest reports from the aircraft showed 
the central pressure has fallen to near 972 mb with maximum 700
mb flight-level winds of 99 kt to the southeast of the center.
Based on these data, the initial intensity is increased to 85 kt.
 
The initial motion is now 045/15 kt.  The flow between a mid- to
upper-level ridge over the Gulf of Mexico and a mid- to upper-level
trough over Texas should steer Francine northeastward for the next
12 h or so.  The hurricane is expected to make landfall along the
Louisiana coast in the next few hours and move across southeastern
Louisiana tonight.  After that, a turn toward the north on the east
side of the trough will bring the center of Francine across
southwestern and central Mississippi on Thursday. This should be
followed by a northward motion with a decrease in forward speed
until the cyclone dissipates.  The new track guidance is a little
faster than for the previous advisory, so the new forecast track is
similar to, but faster than, the previous track.
 
Little change in strength is expected during the final hours before
landfall. After landfall, Francine is expected to quickly weaken
while also losing tropical characteristics. Transition to an
extratropical cyclone is expected to be complete by Friday morning,
with the cyclone forecast to dissipate after 60 h.
 
An experimental cone graphic that includes inland Hurricane and
Tropical Storm Watches and Warnings in the U.S. is now available on
the NHC website. Due to the time needed to compile the inland watch
and warning information, the experimental cone graphic will not be
available as quickly as the operational cone. Once it is available,
the experimental cone graphic can be found from a red weblink above
the operational cone graphic at
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?cone#contents. Users are
encouraged to take the experimental product survey found below the
experimental cone.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge through 
tonight for the Louisiana and Mississippi coastlines, where a
Storm Surge Warning is in effect. Residents in the warning area
should continue to follow advice given by local officials.
 
2. Damaging and life-threatening hurricane-force winds are expected
in portions of southern Louisiana this evening and tonight, where a
Hurricane Warning is in effect. Ensure you are in a safe location
before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.
 
3. Francine is expected to bring heavy rainfall and the risk of
considerable flash and urban flooding, along with river flooding,
across southeastern Louisiana, Mississippi, far southern Alabama and
the Florida Panhandle through Thursday night. Flash and urban
flooding is probable across the Lower Tennessee Valley and Lower
Mississippi Valley tonight into Friday morning.

Tropical Depression Seven Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072024
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 11 2024
 
Periodic bursts of convection have been growing and fading in the 
tropical depression this evening.  Earlier microwave imagery from 
SSMIS showed a fragmented curved band wrapping around the northern 
and western portion of the circulation.  Subjective estimates from 
TAFB and SAB were T-2.5/35 kt and T-1.5/25 kt respectively and based 
on a blend of these, the initial intensity is held at 30 kt.
 
The depression is moving west-northwestward at 285/15 kt along the 
southern side of a mid-level ridge centered over the northeastern 
Atlantic.  This motion should continue for the next day or so until 
the forward speed decreases when the ridge is eroded by an 
amplifying mid-level trough.  By the end of the forecast period, the 
system should begin to turn northward toward a break in the ridge.  
Beyond 72 h, there is quite a bit of spread in the track guidance 
due to the models varying the timing of the turn to the north.  The 
latest track forecast is similar to the previous prediction, and 
lies near the various consensus aids.  

Environmental conditions appear generally conducive for gradual 
strengthening for the next couple of days.  Afterwards  The 
depression is forecast to move into a drier air mass and it could 
experience moderate wind shear and possible dry air intrusions.  The 
long range intensity forecast is also rather uncertain and few 
changes have been made to the new NHC intensity forecast, which lies 
near HCCA.
