Tropical Depression Gordon Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072024
500 PM AST Mon Sep 16 2024

Gordon is producing only a few sporadic bursts of deep convection, 
mainly over the southern and eastern portion of its circulation.  
The vertical wind shear does not appear to be very strong at this 
time, as evidenced by the relatively slow motions of the cirrus 
clouds over the system.  Since the cyclone is situated over a 
warm ocean, the suppression of convection is probably due to a 
stable air mass and/or dry air.  The advisory intensity is held at 
30 kt in accordance with an objective estimate of 32 kt from 
UW-CIMSS and a subjective Dvorak Current Intensity number of 30 kt 
from TAFB.

Gordon continues to move slowly westward with a current motion 
estimate of 270/5 kt.  A high pressure area that was north of the 
system over the past couple of days is shifting westward, and being 
replaced by a mid-level trough within the next day or two.  Also, 
there is a frontal cyclone located about 10 degrees to the north of 
Gordon.  This feature, along with the trough, should cause the 
tropical cyclone to turn northward and north-northeastward during 
the next couple of days.  Although Gordon is expected to at least 
briefly  interact with the frontal wave, the global model guidance 
indicates that it will retain its identity and move farther 
north-northeastward over the Atlantic during the forecast period.
The official forecast is shifted a little more to the east of the 
previous NHC prediction and is close to the corrected model 
consensus, HCCA.

Output from the statistical-dynamical SHIPS models shows some 
increase in the low- to mid-level relative humidity and also 
suggests some increase in instability during the forecast period.  
The SHIPS output also shows generally low to moderate vertical 
shear for the next few days.  The official forecast shows some 
restrengthening after 48 hours, but not as much of an intensity 
increase as called for by the SHIPS/LGEM predictions.

decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. Continued
weakening is expected during the next day or so, and the low is
forecast to dissipate over the Carolinas by early Wednesday.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...near 0 percent.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface observations

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight can be found in
the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO
header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Gusty winds are expected to diminish this evening along the
coast of North Carolina.
 
STORM SURGE:  Water levels remain elevated along portions of the
southeastern North Carolina coast and will begin to subside after
the next high tide cycle. Refer to your local National Weather
Service office for additional information.
 
RAINFALL: The system will bring an additional 4 to 8 inches of
rainfall, with isolated totals of 10 inches, across portions of
southeast North Carolina into tonight. Across northern South
Carolina and the remainder of North Carolina, 2 to 4 inches of
rainfall, with isolated totals near 8 inches, particularly in the
North Carolina Blue Ridge, are possible through Tuesday. Over
southeast Virginia and the Virginia Blue Ridge, expect 2 to 4 inches
of rainfall, with locally higher amounts, tonight through Wednesday.
This rainfall brings a risk of flash and urban flooding and minor
river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with this 
system, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall 
Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?ero.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes may occur through this evening across
eastern North Carolina.
 
SURF: Swells are forecast to affect portions of the coast of the
southeastern United States through tonight. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system. For more information, see products from your 
local National Weather Service forecast office.

Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082024
500 PM EDT Mon Sep 16 2024
 
Scatterometer data earlier today showed a very elongated surface 
circulation with frontal features extending from the low, confirming 
the non-tropical structure of the system. In fact, current 
observations show a significant temperature and dewpoint gradient 
remains along the boundary. Based on radar data and surface 
observations, the poorly-defined low center is likely near the coast 
or just inland over northeastern South Carolina. Although it failed 
to develop a well-defined center and the necessary organization to 
become a tropical cyclone, the low has produced significant impacts 
today, with life-threatening flash flooding reported in portions of 
southeastern North Carolina and wind gusts in excess of 60 mph along 
the coast. Another band of heavy rainfall is currently moving 
onshore over the Cape Fear region, with heavy rains also spreading 
farther inland. Recent surface observations show the sustained winds 
have diminished below tropical storm force, and the initial 
intensity is lowered to 30 kt.
 
The system is moving north-northwestward at about 6 kt. This motion 
will bring the system farther inland over the Carolinas tonight and 
Tuesday, where it is expected to quickly weaken and dissipate. 
Although the wind threat has subsided, heavy rainfall and flash 
flooding remain a serious concern for portions of the Carolinas. For 
more information on this system, see products issued by the Weather 
Prediction Center and your local National Weather Service office.
 
Since the system is no longer producing sustained
tropical-storm-force winds, the Tropical Storm Warnings for the
Carolinas have been discontinued. Therefore, this will be the final
NHC advisory on the system.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Additional considerable flash and urban flooding and minor river 
flooding is possible across southern North Carolina and northeast 
South Carolina through tonight. There is also a risk of isolated 
flash and urban flooding for the southern Mid-Atlantic region and 
southern Appalachians through Wednesday.
 
2. Gusty winds will continue along portions of the coasts of South
Carolina and North Carolina into this evening.
