Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Thu Sep 12 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Francine, located inland over south-central Mississippi, <br/>
and on Tropical Depression Seven, located over the eastern Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL92): <br/>
A weak area of low pressure located several hundred miles east of <br/>
the Leeward Islands is producing limited shower and thunderstorm <br/>
activity. Development of this system is not expected while it moves <br/>
westward at around 10 mph over the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
<br/>
East of the Leeward Islands (AL94):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms have become a bit more concentrated in <br/>
association with a small area of low pressure located a few hundred <br/>
miles east of the Leeward Islands. However, the proximity of dry <br/>
air near the system is expected to limit additional development <br/>
over the next couple of days. Environmental conditions are expected <br/>
to become even less conducive over the weekend while the system <br/>
moves slowly west-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore the Southeastern U.S.:<br/>
In a few days, a non-tropical area of low pressure could form along <br/>
a residual frontal boundary a few hundred miles off the southeastern <br/>
U.S. coastline. Thereafter, some subtropical or tropical development <br/>
is possible during the early part of next week while the system <br/>
drifts to the north or northwest.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast, and Francine is expected to become a 
post-tropical cyclone later today or tonight.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface observations 
from the Jackson area is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Francine can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Wind gusts to tropical-storm force are possible for the next
few hours over portions of central Mississippi and western Alabama.
 
RAINFALL: Francine is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 4 to 
8 inches across portions of Mississippi, eastern Arkansas, 
Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia and the Florida Panhandle. Localized 
amounts of 12 inches are possible over portions of Alabama, the 
Florida Panhandle, and Georgia. This rainfall could lead to 
considerable flash and urban flooding.   

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Francine, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total 
Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero.  For a list of 
rainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see 
the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS1 with the WMO header ACUS41 
KWBC or at the following link:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html. 
 
STORM SURGE:  Water levels remain elevated along the Gulf coast 
between eastern Louisiana and Alabama but will recede through this 
afternoon.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible today across the Florida 
Panhandle, southern and central Alabama, and southwest Georgia.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Francine should subside along the 
northern Gulf coast through today. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Depression Francine Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062024
1000 AM CDT Thu Sep 12 2024

Frances has continued to weaken this morning as the center moves 
across central Mississippi. Surface observations indicate that the 
central pressure has risen to near 996 mb, with winds of 25-30 kt 
observed about 80 n mi east and northeast of the center.  Based on 
these data, the initial intensity is decreased to 30 kt.  The 
surface observations and satellite imagery also suggest that 
Francine is merging with a frontal zone, and it is expected to 
become a post-tropical low later today or tonight. It should be 
noted that while the forecast shows the surface cyclone dissipating 
by 48 h, the remnants of the circulation above the surface will 
persist beyond that time and continue the heavy rainfall threat.
 
The initial motion is now 360/12.  A continued northward to 
north-northwestward motion with a decrease in forward speed is 
expected before dissipation, bringing Francine or its remnants 
across northern Mississippi into northeastern Arkansas. 

This is the last Tropical Cyclone Discussion issued by the 
National Hurricane Center on this system.  Future information on 
this system can be found in discussions issued by the Weather 
Prediction Center beginning at 400 PM CDT, under AWIPS header 
TCDAT1, WMO header WTNT41 KWNH, and on the web at 
www.hurricanes.gov.

Rainfall forecasts for the United States can always be found at 
https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/qpf/qpf2.shtml 
and outlooks of flash flood risks can be found at 
https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/qpf/excessive_rainfall_outlook_ero.php
  
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Elevated water levels and high surf along portions of the 
Louisiana and Mississippi coasts should subside today. Until this 
occurs, residents in the affected area should continue to follow 
advice given by local officials.
 
2. Francine will continue to bring heavy rainfall and the risk of 
flash and urban flooding, along with river flooding, across portions 
of the Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley and the Southeast. 
Considerable flash and urban flooding is possible through tonight 
over portions of Alabama and the Florida Panhandle, expanding into 
Georgia and middle Tennessee Friday.

Tropical Depression Seven Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072024
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
1100 AM AST Thu Sep 12 2024
 
Tropical Depression Seven looks more organized on satellite imagery 
this morning, with a compact circulation and a small curved band 
with some deep convection. Subjective and objective Dvorak numbers 
indicate the system is close to becoming a tropical storm. However,
given the relatively small size of ongoing convection near the 
center, the initial intensity was conservatively held at 30 knots, 
or at the lower end of the estimates.

The cyclone continues on a west-northwestward heading, and the 
general motion is expected to continue over the next 2-3 days. The 
forward speed should gradually slow as the subtropical ridge to the 
north of the system weakens. Track guidance diverges considerably 
early next week, related to uncertainties with an amplifying trough 
over the north-central Atlantic Ocean and another ridge centered 
northeast of the Leeward Islands. This track forecast stays close 
to the global model consensus and places less weight on the 
regional hurricane models which depict a considerably weaker 
and less organized system. This produces a track forecast that is 
slightly faster and to the left of the previous forecast.

While environmental conditions are somewhat favorable for gradual 
strengthening, with low-moderate vertical wind shear and 
marginally warm SSTs, intensity guidance came in lower for this 
cycle. We show the system becoming a tropical storm in the next 
day, followed by the intensity only slowly increasing to 45 knots in 
the next five days. However, there is potential for greater 
strengthening beyond what is shown early next week as the cyclone 
will be in an environment characterized by lower shear, warmer SSTs 
around 28C, slightly more instability, but plentiful dry air aloft. 
 The new forecast is a little lower than the previous one, but 
above the latest model consensus.
