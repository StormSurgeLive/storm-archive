Remnants Of Gordon Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072024
1100 AM AST Tue Sep 17 2024
 
Gordon is no longer a tropical cyclone. The convective structure has 
degraded since the overnight hours, with only small bursts of 
convection occurring to the south and east of the estimated center 
position. More importantly, recent scatterometer data indicate the 
system does not possess a well-defined, trackable center, with an 
elongated structure more indicative of a trough of low pressure. 
Therefore, this will be the final NHC advisory on the remnants of 
Gordon. The initial intensity is set at 25 kt based on the 
scatterometer data, although this could be generous.

The remnants are expected to move northward to north-northeastward 
over open waters during the next few days while rotating around a 
non-tropical low currently positioned to its north. While the 
structure is unlikely to improve in the short term, there are 
indications in the global models that the remnants of Gordon could 
redevelop later this week once the system moves into a more moist 
environment and gains some distance from the nearby frontal low. NHC 
will continue to monitor the remnants of Gordon for signs of 
organization and the possibility of redevelopment later this week. 
Information on the potential for regeneration will be contained in 
the Tropical Weather Outlook.

Additional information on this system can be found in High Seas 
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header 
NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
