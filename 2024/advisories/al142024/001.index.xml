Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Sat Oct 5 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Kirk, located over the central subtropical Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
Hurricane Leslie, located over the eastern tropical Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Gulf of Mexico (AL92):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a broad area of low <br/>
pressure located over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico are gradually <br/>
becoming better organized.  Development of this system is expected, <br/>
and a tropical depression or storm is likely to form later today or <br/>
on Sunday while it moves slowly eastward over the southwestern Gulf <br/>
of Mexico.  By early next week, the system is forecast to move <br/>
faster eastward or northeastward across the central and eastern Gulf <br/>
of Mexico where additional strengthening is likely.  Interests on <br/>
the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, the  Florida Peninsula, the Florida <br/>
Keys, and the northwestern Bahamas should monitor the progress of <br/>
this system. Regardless of development, locally heavy rains could <br/>
occur over portions of Mexico during the next day or two, and over <br/>
much of Florida late this weekend through the middle of next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Far Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa on <br/>
Monday or Tuesday.  Some development of this system is possible <br/>
thereafter while it moves westward or west-northwestward across the <br/>
eastern tropical Atlantic.  The system is expected to move near or <br/>
over the Cabo Verde Islands on Wednesday and Thursday, and interests <br/>
there should monitor its progress.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located 
near latitude 27.6 North, longitude 50.3 West. Kirk is moving toward 
the north near 16 mph (26 km/h) and this motion is expected to 
continue through tonight. A faster northeastward motion is expected 
on Sunday and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Kirk is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Weakening is forecast through early next week, 
but Kirk will remain a large hurricane for the next couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles
(370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 949 mb (28.03 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
1100 AM AST Sat Oct 05 2024
 
The inner core of Kirk has become a little less pronounced and 
ragged on satellite imagery, with the eye becoming more cloud 
filled. Shear is starting to increase over the system with some 
drier air intrusions becoming evident. The latest subjective and 
objective satellite intensity estimates have come down with this 
cycle, and the initial intensity is lowered to 105 kt.
 
Kirk continues to turn more northward (355/14 kt) within the flow 
between a shortwave trough over the west-central Atlantic and a 
subtropical ridge to the east Atlantic  Model guidance is in fairly 
good agreement that Kirk should keep turning to the northeast and 
east-northeast through early next week and increasing forward 
motion. The NHC forecast track shows the center of Kirk passing to 
the north of the Azores on Monday as an extratropical cyclone, and 
then moving across the northeastern Atlantic and over western Europe 
by the middle of next week. The official NHC track forecast is very 
similar to the previous advisory.
 
The hurricane is getting ready to move into a hostile environment 
with increasing shear and drier air. The system will also be 
traversing cooler sea surface temperatures throughout the forecast 
period. Therefore, steady weakening is forecast through early next 
week. The system should lose tropical characteristics and 
transition to a strong extratropical cyclone around 60 h, which is 
supported by the global model fields and simulated satellite 
imagery. The updated NHC intensity forecast is near the previous in 
the near term, with a slightly faster rate of weakening beyond 60 h 
in agreement with the latest HCCA and simple consensus aids.
 
Kirk is producing ocean swells that are propagating far away from 
the hurricane. These large swells will likely increase the risk of 
dangerous surf and rip currents across the Leeward Islands, Bermuda, 
and the Greater Antilles beginning later today, much of the U.S. 
East Coast, Atlantic Canada, and the Bahamas by Sunday, and the 
Azores by Monday. For more information on this hazard, see products 
issued by your local weather office.

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
1100 AM AST Sat Oct 05 2024
 
Deep convection continues to burst over the center of Leslie this 
morning. Some of the latest satellite images depict a little bit of 
shear starting to impact the system, with a sharper convective edge 
on the western side. Subjective and objective satellite intensity 
estimates range from 65 to 75 kt.  Using a blend of these estimates, 
the initial intensity is held at 70 kt for this advisory.
 
Leslie continues to move slowly west-northwestward (295/6 kt), 
steered by a mid-level subtropical ridge over the eastern Atlantic. 
The ridge will continue to steer Leslie the next several days with a 
turn more northwestward, with an increase in forward speed by the 
middle of the forecast period. The NHC track forecast is very close 
to the previous, and lies near the simple and corrected consensus 
aids.

The intensity forecast continues to trend downward with Leslie. The 
system has about 12-24 hours left within a favorable environment 
where some slight additional strengthening may occur. By Sunday, 
increased shear, drier mid-level, and the track taking Leslie over 
Kirk's cold wake, this could cause some weakening after 24 hours. 
There is better agreement with the weakening trend, however they 
differ on how significantly and how quickly weakening will occur. 
Therefore, downward adjustments were made to the NHC intensity 
forecast and now has Leslie weakening below hurricane strength 
beyond 48 h.  If trends continue further downward adjustments may be 
required in future advisories.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.

Interests in the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, the Florida Peninsula, 
the Florida Keys, and the northwestern Bahamas should monitor the 
progress of this system. 

Hurricane and Storm Surge watches will likely be required for 
portions of Florida on Sunday.
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression 
Fourteen was located near latitude 22.1 North, longitude 95.1 West. 
The depression is moving toward the north-northeast near 3 mph (6 
km/h).  A slow northeastward or east-northeastward motion is 
expected during the next day or so.  A faster east-northeastward to 
northeastward motion is forecast by Monday and Tuesday.  On the 
forecast track, the depression is forecast to remain over the 
southwestern Gulf of Mexico through Sunday night, then move across 
the south-central Gulf of Mexico on Monday and Tuesday, and approach 
the west coast of the Florida Peninsula by midweek. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Rapid strengthening is forecast during the next few days.  The 
depression is forecast to become a tropical storm later today and a 
hurricane by early Monday. The system could become a major 
hurricane while it moves across the central and eastern Gulf of 
Mexico. 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Tropical Depression Fourteen can be found in the 
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO 
header WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at 
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml

Rainfall: The system may produce rainfall of 2 to 4 inches across 
portions of the northern Yucatan Peninsula and western Cuba.

Areas of heavy rainfall will also impact portions of Florida Sunday 
and Monday well ahead of the tropical system, with heavy rainfall 
more directly related to the system expected by later Tuesday 
through Wednesday. This rainfall brings the risk of flash, urban, 
and areal flooding, along with minor to isolated moderate river 
flooding.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Tropical Depression Fourteen, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf.

SURF:  Swells generated by the system will begin to affect the coast 
of the southwestern Gulf of Mexico today.  These swells are expected 
to spread northward and eastward along much of the Gulf Coast by 
early next week. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening 
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your 
local weather office.

Tropical Depression Fourteen Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
1000 AM CDT Sat Oct 05 2024
 
Early morning one-minute GOES-East satellite imagery shows that the 
circulation associated with the area of low pressure over the 
southwestern Gulf of Mexico has become better defined. Deep 
convection has been persistent over the northwestern portion of the 
circulation with some increase in banding also noted.  Based on the 
recent increase in organization, advisories are being initiated on 
Tropical Depression Fourteen.  The initial intensity is set at 30 
kt which is supported by overnight ASCAT data.  Another ASCAT pass 
is expected over the system later this morning. 

The depression is moving north-northeastward or 025/3 kt. The 
system is forecast to drift northeastward or east-northeastward 
during the next day or so.  After that time, a trough moving 
southward over the northwestern Gulf of Mexico is expected to cause 
the system to turn east-northeastward to northeastward at a 
slightly faster forward speed.  By Tuesday the cyclone is expected 
to move northeastward at an increasingly faster forward speed and 
this track will bring the system across the west coast of the 
Florida Peninsula by midweek.  The track guidance is in good 
agreement on this overall scenario, but there are differences in 
the forward speed.  The NHC track lies near the various consensus 
aids, but it slightly faster since the typically reliable GFS and 
ECMWF global models are on the faster side of the guidance. Users 
are reminded to not focus on the exact forecast track or timing at 
the longer range as the average NHC 4-day track error is about 150 
miles.

The depression is within a favorable environment of low vertical 
wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures.  These conditions are 
expected to allow for steady to rapid strengthening over the next 
few days.  The intensification is likely to be slower during the 
next 12 to 24 hours until an inner core can become established, but 
after that time a faster rate of strengthening is anticipated.  The 
global models predicted significant deepening when the system moves 
across the central and eastern Gulf of Mexico and the regional 
hurricane models show the potential for rapid strengthening during 
that time.  The NHC forecast follows suit and calls for a period of 
rapid intensification after 36 h.  The official forecast shows 
the system nearing major hurricane strength over the central and 
eastern Gulf of Mexico.  This forecast is near the intensity 
consensus aids but some upward adjustment may be required as it lies 
a little below the regional hurricane models. Regardless of the 
exact details of the intensity forecast, an intense hurricane with 
multiple life-threatening hazards is likely to affect the west coast 
of the Florida Peninsula next week.

Key Messages:
1.  The depression is forecast to quickly intensify while it moves 
eastward to northeastward across the Gulf of Mexico and be at or 
near major hurricane strength when it reaches the west coast of the 
Florida Peninsula mid week. 

2.  There is an increasing risk of life-threatening storm surge and 
wind impacts for portions of the west coast of the Florida 
Peninsula beginning late Tuesday or Wednesday. Residents in these 
areas should ensure they have their hurricane plan in place, follow 
any advice given by local officials, and check back for updates to 
the forecast. 

3.  Areas of heavy rainfall will impact portions of Florida Sunday 
and Monday well ahead of the tropical system, with heavy rainfall 
more directly related to the system expected by later Tuesday 
through Wednesday. This rainfall brings the risk of flash, urban, 
and areal flooding, along with minor to isolated moderate river 
flooding.
