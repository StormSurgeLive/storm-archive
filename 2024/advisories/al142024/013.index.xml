Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Tue Oct 8 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Leslie, located over the central tropical Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
Hurricane Milton, located over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. <br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure has formed near the northern Bahamas <br/>
and is expected to move northeastward into the southwestern Atlantic <br/>
later today.  Some additional development of this system is possible <br/>
during the next day or so while the low moves northeastward to <br/>
east-northeastward around 15 mph.  Upper-level winds are likely to <br/>
increase later in the week, which should limit further development.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa in <br/>
a couple of days. Afterward, environmental conditions appear only <br/>
marginally favorable for some limited development of this system <br/>
while it moves westward or west-northwestward across the eastern <br/>
tropical Atlantic, moving near the Cabo Verde Islands on Thursday or <br/>
early Friday. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
1100 PM AST Mon Oct 07 2024
 
Deep convection has continued to pulse this evening in Leslie, 
with the larger cirrus shield taking on an amorphous shape. Under 
the cirrus canopy, the last few SSMIS microwave passes suggest that 
the hurricane's structure continues to degrade, with the tighter 
inner-core seen yesterday at this time no longer observed. The 
subjective Dvorak estimates this evening were T4.0/65 kt from SAB 
and T4.5 from TAFB. However, the objective intensity estimates have 
decreased further, with the most recent DMINT down to 61 kt. Thus, 
the initial intensity was lowered slightly to 65 kt this advisory. 
The wind radii were adjusted a bit outward thanks to a helpful 
ASCAT-B pass earlier this evening. 
 
Leslie has maintained its northwestward motion, currently estimated 
at 310/12 kt. There is not a lot of new information to provide for 
the track reasoning this cycle, with Leslie rounding the western 
side of a subtropical ridge to its northeast. The hurricane should 
maintain its northwestward motion over the next day or two, followed 
by a turn northward towards the end of this week once it reaches the 
western edge of this synoptic steering feature. The track guidance 
this cycle is just a notch left of the prior forecast, and the NHC 
track has been nudged in that direction, but is still quite close to 
the prior track forecast.
 
Leslie is currently battling a fairly marginal environment with 
mid-level southerly shear of 20-25 kt continuing to undercut the 
seemingly more favorable 200 mb upper-level flow. A ribbon of very 
dry environmental air that can be seen on GOES-16 water vapor 
imagery, which is likely being imported near Leslie's center, 
contributing to its degraded inner-core structure seen on microwave 
imagery. This shear is expected to persist, before quickly shifting 
out of the north and increasing above 40 kt after 48 h. Intensity 
guidance remains insistent that Leslie will weaken slowly at first, 
and then more dramatically after this shear increases. The GFS, 
ECMWF, and HAFS-A/B runs show Leslie quickly becoming devoid of 
convection after 72 h due to this shear, and the NHC forecast 
continues to show Leslie becoming a post-tropical cyclone in 96 h.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Milton was located
near latitude 22.3 North, longitude 88.9 West. Milton is moving
toward the east-northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h). A turn toward the
east-northeast and northeast is expected today and Wednesday.  On
the forecast track, the center of Milton is forecast to move just
north of the Yucatan Peninsula today and approach the west coast of
the Florida Peninsula on Wednesday.  The hurricane is forecast to
make landfall in Florida Wednesday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 155 mph (250 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Milton is an extremely dangerous category 4 hurricane on
the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  While fluctuations in
intensity are expected, Milton is forecast to remain an extremely
dangerous hurricane through landfall in Florida.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles
(165 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 924 mb (27.29 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Milton can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 4
to 6 feet above ground level along the northern coast of the
Yucatan Peninsula in areas of onshore winds.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Anclote River, FL to Englewood, FL...10-15 ft
Tampa Bay...10-15 ft
Englewood, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...6-10 ft
Charlotte Harbor...6-10 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Anclote River, FL...5-10 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...4-7 ft
Suwannee River, FL to Yankeetown, FL...3-5 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL to Altamaha Sound, GA...3-5 ft
Sebastian Inlet, FL to Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL...2-4 ft
Altamaha Sound, GA to Edisto Beach, SC...2-4 ft
Dry Tortugas...2-4 ft
St. Johns River...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the south of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 5 to 12 inches, with localized totals
up to 18 inches, are expected across central to northern portions of
the  Florida Peninsula through Thursday.  This rainfall brings the
risk of  life-threatening flash, urban and aerial  flooding along
with moderate to major river flooding.
 
Milton will also produce rainfall totals 2 to 4 inches across the
Florida Keys through Thursday. In addition, rainfall amounts of  2
to 4 inches with isolated totals around 6 inches are expected across
northern portions of the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are occurring in the warning area in
Mexico today.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the watch areas
in Mexico today, and tropical storm conditions are expected to 
continue in tropical storm warning area today.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in the warning area on the west
coast of Florida as early as Wednesday afternoon, with tropical
storm conditions beginning early Wednesday.  Hurricane conditions
could begin along the east coast of Florida in the watch areas on
Wednesday night, with tropical storm conditions possible beginning
Wednesday afternoon.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the
tropical storm warning areas in Florida beginning early Wednesday
and will spread northward through the day. Tropical storm conditions
are possible within the watch area on the east coast of Florida by
Wednesday night and along the Georgia and South Carolina coasts on
Thursday.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible over central and southern 
Florida beginning late tonight and continuing through Wednesday 
night.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Milton are expected to continue to
affect much of the Gulf Coast within the next day or two, and are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Milton Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
1000 PM CDT Mon Oct 07 2024
 
Both Air Force and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft have been 
investigating Milton.  Earlier, the Hurricane Hunters found that the 
minimum central pressure in the eye had dropped to an estimated 897 
mb. Based on this, Milton had the fifth lowest central pressure in 
the Atlantic basin hurricane record.  Subsequent center penetrations 
by the aircraft indicated somewhat higher central pressures.  Also, 
flight-level and dropsonde data from the aircraft suggested some 
decrease in intensity, and the advisory intensity is set to 145 kt. 
The decrease is likely the result of an eyewall replacement reported 
by the Hurricane Hunters, leading to a double wind maximum radially 
from the center.  Notwithstanding, Milton still remains an extremely 
dangerous Category 5 hurricane.
 
The initial motion is eastward, or 090/8 kt.  Milton should continue 
to pass close to the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula tonight 
and early Tuesday.  Then, the flow on the eastern side of a 
mid-tropospheric shortwave trough dropping into the northwestern 
Gulf of Mexico should cause Milton to move east-northeastward to 
northeastward at a faster forward speed later on Tuesday and 
Wednesday.  This motion should take the system across the Florida 
peninsula on Thursday.  Later in the forecast period, Milton is 
expected to move east-northeastward to eastward over the Atlantic 
waters off the southeast U.S. coast while gradually losing tropical 
characteristics.  The official track forecast is close to, but a 
little faster than, the model consensus.  This is also very similar 
to the previous NHC forecast.  As noted earlier, the track is closer 
to the model predicted fields rather than the model trackers which 
appear to be too far south.
 
So long as Milton remains in an environment of light shear and over 
very high oceanic heat content, its maximum intensity should be 
governed more by inner-core fluctuations.  However the SHIPS 
diagnostics indicate a significant increase in vertical wind shear 
within 24 hours, likely associated with increasing southwesterly 
upper-level flow over the eastern Gulf of Mexico.  Therefore a 
decrease in intensity is predicted before Milton reaches the western 
coast of the Florida Peninsula.  Regardless of the peak intensity, 
the eyewall replacement cycle will likely lead to an expansion of 
the destructive inner core of the hurricane during the next day or 
two.  The system is expected to be a large and powerful hurricane at 
landfall in Florida, with life-threatening hazards at the coastline 
and well inland.  Residents in Florida should closely follow the 
orders from their local emergency management officials, as Milton 
has the potential to be one of the most destructive hurricanes on 
record for west-central Florida.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Damaging hurricane-force winds and a life-threatening storm surge
with destructive waves are expected across portions of the northern
coast of the Yucatan Peninsula through tonight.
 
2. Milton is expected to grow in size and remain an extremely
dangerous hurricane when it approaches the west coast of Florida on
Wednesday. A large area of destructive storm surge will occur along
parts of the west coast of Florida on Wednesday.  This is an
extremely life-threatening situation and residents in those areas
should follow advice given by local officials and evacuate
immediately if told to do so.
 
3. Potentially devastating hurricane-force winds are expected along
portions of the west coast of Florida where a Hurricane Warning is
in effect.  Milton is forecast to remain a hurricane as it crosses
the Florida Peninsula and life-threatening hurricane-force winds,
especially in gusts, are expected to spread inland across a portion
of the entire Florida Peninsula.  Preparations to protect life and
property in the warning areas should be complete by Tuesday night
since tropical storm conditions are expected to begin within this
area early Wednesday.
 
4. Areas of heavy rainfall will continue to impact portions of
Florida well ahead of Milton, with heavy rainfall more directly
related to the system expected Tuesday night through early Thursday.
This rainfall brings the risk of considerable flash, urban, and
areal flooding, along with moderate to major river flooding.
Flooding will be exacerbated in areas where coastal and inland
flooding combine to increase the overall threat.
