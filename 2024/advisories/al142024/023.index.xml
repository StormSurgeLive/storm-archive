200 PM EDT Thu Oct 10 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Leslie, located over the central subtropical Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
Post-Tropical Cyclone Milton, located off the east coast of central <br/>
Florida.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
A tropical wave over the far eastern tropical Atlantic continues to <br/>
produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental <br/>
conditions appear marginal for limited development of this system <br/>
while it moves westward or west-northwestward across the eastern <br/>
tropical Atlantic and the Cabo Verde Islands on Friday.  By <br/>
Saturday, upper-level winds are forecast to become less favorable, <br/>
and further development is unlikely after that time.  Regardless of <br/>
development, localized areas of heavy rain are possible across <br/>
portions of the Cabo Verde Islands tonight through Friday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Leslie Discussion Number  34
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 PM AST Thu Oct 10 2024

The center of Leslie has been exposed for the past 6 h, thanks to 
strong northerly wind shear.  The center has continued to move 
farther away from the convection as the afternoon has progressed.  
The initial intensity is brought down to 60 kt, which agrees with a 
blend of the various objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS.
 
Leslie continues to plow through a zone of strong northerly shear, 
and the SHIPS guidance and model fields indicate Leslie will 
continue to experience 40 kt of northerly to northeasterly shear for 
another 12 to 24 h.  In addition, Leslie is forecast to continue 
moving through a relatively dry environment.  Rapid weakening is 
expected to continue over the next 12 to 24 h, and the latest NHC 
intensity forecast is lower than the previous one due to the weaker 
initial intensity.  If Leslie survives as a tropical cyclone for 
another two days, which is not guaranteed, it will approach a 
frontal zone in 2 to 3 days and could take on some frontal 
characteristics.  While all of the models show Leslie dissipating 
by 4 to 5 days, there is significant uncertainty on whether Leslie 
will become extratropical or just dissipate.
 
Leslie is moving northwestward, or 315/7 kt.  Model guidance is in 
good agreement that a northward turn will happen very soon as 
Leslie moves around the southwestern periphery of a subtropical 
ridge over the eastern Atlantic.  On Friday and Friday night, the 
hurricane should speed up and turn to the northeast, followed by an 
east-northeastward turn as it accelerates further over the weekend.  
There is a bit of along-track spread in the guidance after 48 h, as 
some of the models show Leslie accelerating faster toward the 
east-northeast.  Only minor changes are made to the previous NHC 
track to account for the models being slightly farther west during 
the first 36 h of the forecast.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Milton

post-tropical cyclone will pass to the south of Bermuda late Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast during the 
next several days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310 miles (500 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 983 mb (29.03 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Milton can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: Coastal flooding is expected to continue along 
portions of the southeastern U.S. coast through tonight.  The water 
could reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the 
indicated areas...
 
Altamaha Sound, GA to Port Canaveral, FL...1-3 ft

For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Additional rainfall amounts up to an inch are possible 
along the northeastern coast of Florida through this evening. In the 
wake of heavy rainfall from Milton, the risk of considerable urban 
flooding will linger through this evening across east central 
Florida. Moderate to major river flooding is ongoing and forecast 
throughout central Florida.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall 
Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and 
the Flash Flood Risk graphic at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero. 
 
WIND: Gusty winds will likely continue along portions of the
southeastern U.S. coast through tonight.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Milton are expected to continue to
affect portions of the southeast U.S. and the Bahamas during the
next couple of days.  These swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Milton Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
500 PM EDT Thu Oct 10 2024
 
Milton's satellite appearance has continued to take on an 
extratropical appearance, and ASCAT data from a few hours ago 
confirmed that the cyclone has become frontal.  Based on that 
information, Milton was declared post tropical in the 2 pm 
intermediate advisory.  The ASCAT passes showed maximum winds of 
55-60 kt to the northwest of the center, so the initial intensity 
is set to 60 kt.

Milton has turned eastward and sped up a bit (080/18 kt).  A 
general eastward motion with an increase in forward speed is 
expected during the next several days, with the extratropical low 
forecast to pass south of Bermuda in 24-36 hours.  Global model 
fields and intensity models indicate that the intensity should 
gradually decrease during the next several days, and this is 
reflected in the official forecast.  Dissipation is shown by day 4, 
although there is still some uncertainty if Milton will become 
absorbed by the frontal zone before that time, or retain its 
identity beyond 4 days.

Since all storm surge and tropical storm warnings have been 
discontinued, this will be the last advisory on Milton.  Additional 
information on this system can be found in High Seas Forecasts 
issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header 
NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Gusty winds and coastal flooding will gradually diminish along
portions of the southeastern U.S. coast through tonight.
 
2. In the wake of heavy rainfall from Milton, the risk of 
considerable urban flooding will linger through this evening across 
east central Florida. Moderate to major river flooding is ongoing 
and forecast throughout central Florida.
 
3. In Florida, continue to use caution since deadly hazards remain, 
including downed power lines and flooded areas.  Ensure generators 
are properly ventilated and placed outside at least 20 feet away 
from doors, windows, and garages to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.
If you are cleaning up storm damage, be careful when using
chainsaws and power tools, and drink plenty of water to avoid heat
exhaustion.
