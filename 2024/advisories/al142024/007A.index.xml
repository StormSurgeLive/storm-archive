DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM GMT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located
near latitude 38.6 North, longitude 43.6 West. Kirk is moving toward
the northeast near 25 mph (41 km/h).  An even faster 
east-northeastward motion is expected during the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Although gradual weakening is expected, Kirk is forecast to 
become a large and strong extratropical low during the next couple 
of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310
miles (500 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 964 mb (28.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Bermuda, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, the east coast of the
United States, portions of Atlantic Canada, and the Azores. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  31
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
300 AM GMT Mon Oct 07 2024
 
Kirk is in the process of transitioning into an extratropical 
cyclone.  Satellite images show that the associated deep convection 
is now confined to the northern side of the circulation and that the 
inner core has been eroding.  In addition, there appears to be some 
frontal features beginning to form.  The initial intensity is 
lowered to 70 kt following a blend of the latest satellite intensity 
estimates.  The 34-kt wind radii have been tweaked on the system's 
east side based on recent ASCAT data.

Extratropical transition should be complete on Monday when the 
system moves over water temperatures in the low 20's C and into an 
environment of nearly 40 kt of vertical wind shear.  These 
parameters will also cause steady weakening during the next few 
days, and dissipation seems likely by day 4.  The models are in 
good agreement, and this forecast is closest to the latest GFS 
solution.

Kirk is gradually turning to the right, and the latest initial 
motion is 045/22 kt.  A turn to the east-northeast with a notable 
increase in forward speed is expected during the next few days as 
the system moves within the mid-latitude westerly flow.  This 
should take the extratropical low to the north of the Azores on 
Tuesday and across western Europe on Wednesday.

Although Kirk is over the open ocean, it is still producing large 
swells that could lead to life-threatening rip currents across 
portions of the Caribbean, Bermuda, the east coast of the U.S., and 
Atlantic Canada.

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
1100 PM AST Sun Oct 06 2024

Leslie has been more or less status quo this evening, with the 
hurricane characterized by a small central dense overcast that 
occasionally has a warm spot appearing on infrared images. 
Subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB remain unchanged for 
00 UTC, while the objective intensity estimates are a tad lower 
than earlier. For now, Leslie's intensity will be held at 80 kt 
until there is a more distinct degradation in its satellite 
appearance. 

Leslie continues to move northwestward, with its motion estimated at 
315/10 kt this advisory. The hurricane has been primarily steered by 
a mid-level ridge to its northeast which should continue for the 
next several days, followed by a turn to the north-northwest or 
north by the end of the forecast period as it reaches the westward 
extent of the ridge. There has been a slight rightward shift in the 
guidance this cycle, and the NHC track forecast is a little  north 
and east of the prior track forecast, roughly in between the latest 
TVCA and HCCA consensus aids. 

There are a couple of negative factors likely to influence Leslie's 
intensity over the next few days. First, while 200-850 mb vertical 
wind shear is forecast to be fairly low, undercutting this outflow 
layer is stronger 20-25 kt mid-level southwesterly shear. This shear 
appears likely to import some very dry mid-level air, seen on water 
vapor GOES-16 imagery southwest of Leslie, into the hurricane's 
small inner core. At the same time, sea-surface temperatures along 
Leslie's path are likely to be at least somewhat cooler thanks in 
part to upwelling from Hurricane Kirk last week. The intensity 
guidance, especially the regional-hurricane models, show quite a bit 
of weakening due to these negative factors, and the NHC intensity 
forecast also will show weakening through the forecast period. In 
fact, the latest NHC forecast shows a bit more weakening than the 
prior advisory, as Leslie's small core could be more prone to these 
negative conditions. However, this forecast is still a little above 
the latest HAFS-A/B forecasts which show more rapid weakening over 
the next few days.

100 AM CDT Mon Oct 07 2024
 
...MILTON MOVING ERRATICALLY EASTWARD THROUGH THE SOUTHERN GULF OF 
MEXICO...
...LIKELY TO BECOME A MAJOR HURRICANE ON LATER TODAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 100 AM CDT...0600 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...22.2N 93.0W
ABOUT 220 MI...355 KM WNW OF PROGRESO MEXICO
ABOUT 770 MI...1240 KM WSW OF TAMPA FLORIDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...E OR 100 DEGREES AT 6 MPH...10 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...975 MB...28.79 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Celestun to Cabo Catoche
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Celestun to Cancun
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests in the remainder of the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, the
Florida Peninsula, the Florida Keys, and the northwestern Bahamas
should monitor the progress of this system.
 
Storm Surge and Hurricane Watches will likely be issued for portions
of Florida later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Milton was located
near latitude 22.2 North, longitude 93.0 West.  Milton is moving
toward the east near 6 mph (10 km/h).  An eastward to
east-northeastward motion is forecast through tonight, followed by a
faster northeastward motion on Tuesday and Wednesday.  On the
forecast track, Milton is forecast to move just north of the Yucatan
Peninsula and across the southern Gulf of Mexico today and Tuesday 
and approach the west coast of the Florida Peninsula by Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Milton is forecast to intensify rapidly and become a major 
hurricane later today.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80
miles (130 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft observations is 975 mb (28.79 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Hurricane Milton can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 2
to 4 feet above ground level along the northern coast of the
Yucatan Peninsula in areas of onshore winds.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches, with localized totals
up to 15 inches, are expected across portions of the Florida
Peninsula and the Keys through Wednesday night. This rainfall brings
the risk of considerable flash, urban, and areal flooding, along
with the potential for moderate to major river flooding.
 
Milton will also produce rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches across
portions of the northern Yucatan Peninsula.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin as early as
this morning in the warning area, and hurricane conditions are
possible beginning this afternoon.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the system are affecting the coast of the
southwestern Gulf of Mexico.  These swells are expected to spread
northward and eastward along much of the Gulf Coast within the next
day or two, and are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.

<title>Hurricane Milton Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Hurricane Milton Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
1000 PM CDT Sun Oct 06 2024
 
Milton continues to intensify.  The hurricane's center is embedded 
within a circular Central Dense Overcast containing very intense 
convection with cloud tops colder than -80 deg C.  Tail Doppler wind 
data from the NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft show that the 
circulation is quite symmetric, with very little vertical tilt from 
1 to 5 km elevation.  Observations from both Air Force and NOAA 
Hurricane Hunters indicate that the central pressure is falling and 
that the intensity has increased to near 80 kt.
 
Fixes from the aircraft and satellite imagery indicate that the
hurricane is moving generally eastward with an initial motion
estimate of 100/6 kt.  Milton is moving within the southern portion
of a broad mid-level trough over the Gulf of Mexico, and is also
being influenced by the flow on the southwest side of a low- to
mid-level cyclone currently over the eastern Gulf.  The
numerical guidance indicates that this cyclone will shift east
of Florida within the next day or two, so that its influence
on Milton will gradually lessen with time.  As the  mid-level
trough digs over the central Gulf, the hurricane should turn
northeastward with some increase in forward speed during the
next 2-3 days and be near the west coast of Florida in the 72
hour time frame.  After crossing Florida, the cyclone should turn
east-northeastward to eastward over the Atlantic waters off the
southeastern United States.  The official track forecast follows
essentially the same trajectory as the previous NHC prediction but
is a bit slower, in accordance with the latest dynamical model
consensus guidance.  Again it should be noted that the average NHC
track error at day 3 is around 100 miles, and users should not focus
on the exact track.
 
Milton should continue to traverse waters of very high oceanic heat 
content within an environment of light vertical wind shear and moist 
low- to mid-level air for the next 1-2 days.  The official intensity 
forecast is similar to the previous one and shows Milton rapidly 
strengthening to category 4 intensity within the next couple of 
days.  Thereafter, stronger upper-level westerlies over the northern 
Gulf of Mexico should result in increasing shear.  The latest SHIPS 
model output shows the shear over Milton increasing significantly in 
60-72 hours.  Therefore, some weakening is anticipated before the 
hurricane reaches the Florida Gulf coast.  However, the system is 
still likely to be a large and powerful hurricane at landfall in 
Florida, with life-threatening hazards along portions of the the 
coastline.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Milton is forecast to be a major hurricane when it reaches the
west coast of the Florida Peninsula by midweek. Users are reminded
to not focus on the details of the forecast as there remains
significant uncertainty in the eventual track and intensity of
Milton.
 
2. While it is too soon to specify the exact magnitude and location
of the greatest impacts, there is an increasing risk of life-
threatening storm surge and damaging winds for portions of the west
coast of the Florida Peninsula beginning early Wednesday and Storm
Surge and Hurricane Watches will likely be issued early Monday.
Residents in the Florida Peninsula should follow any advice given
by local officials and monitor updates to the forecast.
 
3. Areas of heavy rainfall will impact portions of Florida Monday
well ahead of Milton, with heavy rainfall more directly related to
the system expected later on Tuesday through Wednesday night. This
rainfall brings the risk of considerable flash, urban, and areal
flooding, along with the potential for moderate to major river
flooding.
 
4. Tropical storm conditions are expected with hurricane conditions
possible beginning Monday across portions of the northern Yucatan
Peninsula of Mexico where a Tropical Storm Warning and Hurricane
Watch are in effect.
