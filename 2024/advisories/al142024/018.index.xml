Leslie, located over the central subtropical Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
Hurricane Milton, located over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. <br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic (AL93):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a gale-force non-tropical <br/>
low pressure system located about 375 miles west-southwest of <br/>
Bermuda have become less organized during the last several hours.  <br/>
Although environmental conditions are becoming less favorable for <br/>
development, a short-lived tropical or subtropical storm could <br/>
still form today or this evening while the low moves northeastward <br/>
to east-northeastward at around 15 mph.  Upper-level winds are <br/>
forecast to become too strong for further development later tonight. <br/>
Additional information on this system, including gale warnings, <br/>
can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather <br/>

<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa <br/>
tonight or early Thursday.  Afterward, environmental conditions <br/>
appear only marginally favorable for some limited development of <br/>
this system while it moves westward or west-northwestward across <br/>
the eastern tropical Atlantic and through the Cabo Verde Islands on <br/>
Friday. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
1100 AM AST Wed Oct 09 2024
 
Visible, infrared and some recent microwave images suggest that the
center of the small tropical cyclone continues to be located
underneath the middle of the central dense overcast.  In fact, some 
of the recent frames have hinted at a ragged eye feature.  The TAFB 
and SAB subjective Dvorak estimates are a consensus T-4.5/77 kt.  
The initial intensity is increased to 75 kt, in best agreement with 
the Dvorak estimates.
 
Leslie's initial motion is estimated to be northwestward, or 305/9
kt.  A gradual turn to the north is expected in about 36 h as
Leslie rounds the southwestern and western periphery of a
subtropical ridge to the east.  Afterward, Leslie should accelerate
toward the northeast in response to a strong trough approaching the
cyclone from the northwest.  The NHC forecast is nearly identical
to the previous one and lies near the TVCN and HCCA consensus
models.
 
Leslie is forecast to remain in a favorable environment for another
12-18 h.  The intensity forecast has been increased to an 85-kt
peak at hour 12 and 24, and it is possible that it could strengthen
a bit more than that, as suggested by the HAFS-B model.  By hour
24, Leslie is expected to run into a wall of strong northerly
shear caused by a strengthening upper-level anticyclone in between
Milton and Leslie.  The shear is expected to cause Leslie to
rapidly weaken during the 24 to 48 h period.  While it is possible
that Leslie could lose most of its convection in 2 to 3 days, the
latest GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite imagery show periodic 
bursts of convection continuing into Day 4.  However, Leslie is 
likely to merge with a front and become extratropical in 3 to 4 
days, and a transition to an extratropical cyclone is 
forecast at the end of that period.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Milton was
located near latitude 25.8 North, longitude 84.3 West.  Milton is
moving toward the northeast near 17 mph (28 km/h).  A northeastward
motion with some decrease in forward speed is expected through this
evening.  A turn toward the east-northeast and east is expected on
Thursday and Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of Milton
will move across the eastern Gulf of Mexico today, make landfall
along the west-central coast of Florida tonight, and move off the
east coast of Florida over the western Atlantic Ocean on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Milton is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Milton is expected to remain an extremely
dangerous major hurricane when it reaches the west-central coast of
Florida tonight, and remain at hurricane strength while it moves
across the Florida peninsula through Thursday.  Gradual weakening
is forecast while Milton moves eastward over the western Atlantic,
and it is likely to become an extratropical storm by early Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km). A NOAA saildrone (SD-1083) located approximately 80 miles
northeast of the center recently reported a sustained wind of 44 mph
(71 km/h) with a gust of 57 mph (91 km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure based on Air Force Reserve Hurricane 
Hunter data is 931 mb (27.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Milton can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Anna Maria Island, FL to Boca Grande, FL...10-15 ft
Anclote River, FL to Anna Maria Island, FL...8-12 ft
Tampa Bay...8-12 ft
Boca Grande, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...8-12 ft
Charlotte Harbor...8-12 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...5-8 ft
Aripeka, FL to Anclote River, FL...3-5 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Sebastian Inlet, FL to Altamaha Sound, GA...3-5 ft
Altamaha Sound, GA to Edisto Beach, SC...2-4 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Aripeka, FL...2-4 ft
Dry Tortugas...2-4 ft
St. Johns River...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the south of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 6 to 12 inches, with localized totals
up to 18 inches, are expected across central to northern portions of
the Florida Peninsula through Thursday.  This rainfall brings the
risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding,
along with moderate to major river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area across Florida beginning this evening through Thursday morning
and are possible in the hurricane watch area on Thursday.  Tropical
storm conditions are expected to begin in the warning area on the
west coast of Florida in a few hours, spreading across the peninsula
and reaching the east coast tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected to begin in the warning area along the Georgia coast on
Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the
northwestern Bahamas on Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
on the South Carolina coast on Thursday.
 
TORNADOES: Several tornadoes are likely today and tonight across
parts of central and southern Florida.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Milton are expected to continue to affect
much of the Gulf Coast and will increase along the southeastern U.S.
coast during the next day or two.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Milton Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
1100 AM EDT Wed Oct 09 2024
 
Milton's structure has begun to change due to the onset of strong
southwesterly shear, which UW-CIMSS is analyzing to be 30-35 kt.
The cloud canopy has become more asymmetric with dry air
infiltrating the western side of the circulation, and the eye has
also become cloud filled.  The NOAA and Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunters observed that the eye is open to the south, and a 
very recent dropsonde indicates that the minimum pressure is up to 
931 mb.  Milton's intensity is therefore set at 125 kt on this 
advisory.
 
Deep-layer shear is expected to increase further today and this
evening, and continued weakening is anticipated.  However, since
Milton only has another 12 hours or so over water, it is expected
to still be a major hurricane when it makes landfall tonight.  The
NHC intensity forecast lies between the statistical-dynamical models
and the consensus aids at 12 hours, meaning that Milton is likely
to be a category 3 or 4 strength at landfall.  A slow decay in the
winds is expected after landfall, but Milton is anticipated to move
off the east coast of Florida on Thursday still as a hurricane.  On
another note, Milton is expected to begin interacting with a front
later this evening, which is likely to cause the wind field to
expand on the hurricane's northwestern side.  This will likely
cause very strong, gusty winds to occur even to the north of where
Milton makes landfall.
 
Milton is moving quickly toward the northeast (035/15 kt).  The
track models insist that the hurricane will continue to move
northeastward but slow down through the rest of today, with a turn
toward the east-northeast occurring overnight.  The NHC track
forecast maintains continuity with the previous predictions, lying
near the northern boundary of the guidance envelope and close to
where the raw model fields bring the center onshore.
 
We would like to emphasize that Milton's exact landfall location is
not possible to predict even at this time, particularly if the
hurricane wobbles during the day and into this evening.  Even at
12-24 hours, NHC's track forecasts can be off by an average of 20-30
nm.  Since storm surge forecasts are highly sensitive to the exact
track, this means that the realized storm surge heights across the
Tampa Bay region and south may vary widely, and there will likely be
a noticeable gradient of surge heights to the north of the landfall
location.  However, the risk of devastating storm surge still exists
across much of the west-central and southwest coast of Florida given
the size of the storm and the uncertainties in exactly where
landfall will occur.
 
Finally, damaging winds, life-threatening storm surge, and heavy
rainfall will extend well outside the forecast cone.  This is a very
serious situation and residents in Florida should closely follow
orders from their local emergency management officials.  Evacuations
and other preparations should be completed over the next couple of
hours.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. A large area of destructive storm surge, with highest inundations
of 10 ft or greater, is expected along a portion of the west-central
coast of the Florida Peninsula.  If you are in the Storm Surge
Warning area, this is an extremely life-threatening situation.  The
time to evacuate, if told to do so by local officials, is quickly
coming to a close.
 
2. Devastating hurricane-force winds are expected along portions of
the west coast of Florida, where a Hurricane Warning is in effect.
Milton is forecast to remain a hurricane while it crosses the
Florida Peninsula and life-threatening hurricane-force winds,
especially in gusts, are expected to spread inland across the
peninsula.  Preparations to protect life and property, including
being ready for long-duration power outages, should be rushed to
completion.
 
3. Heavy rainfall across the Florida Peninsula through Thursday
brings the risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban
flooding along with moderate to major river flooding, especially in
areas where coastal and inland flooding combine to increase the
overall flood threat.
