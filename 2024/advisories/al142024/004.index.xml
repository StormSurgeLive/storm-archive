...KIRK SENDING LARGE SWELL TOWARDS THE U.S. EAST COAST...
...INCREASED RISK OF LIFE-THREATENING RIP CURRENTS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...31.3N 49.3W
ABOUT 1345 MI...2165 KM WSW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...115 MPH...185 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 5 DEGREES AT 20 MPH...31 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...951 MB...28.09 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the Azores should monitor the progress of Kirk.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located 
near latitude 31.3 North, longitude 49.3 West. Kirk is moving toward 
the north near 20 mph (31 km/h).  On Sunday, Kirk should accelerate 
and turn toward the north-northeast and northeast, followed by an 
east-northeastward to eastward motion on Monday and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 115 mph (185 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Kirk is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Weakening is forecast through 
early next week, but Kirk will remain a large hurricane for the next 
couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles
(370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 951 mb (28.09 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Bermuda, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, and portions of the east
coast of the United States. These swells are expected to spread
northward along the east coast of the United States, Atlantic Canada
on Sunday, and to the Azores on Monday. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
1100 PM AST Sat Oct 05 2024
 
Kirk is gradually succumbing to the effects of increasing vertical 
wind shear.  Based on geostationary satellite imagery, the eye is 
becoming more ragged and cloud-filled, and the southwestern quadrant 
is wrapping in more dry air.  Dvorak estimates have decreased this 
cycle and the initial intensity is lowered to 100 kt, closest to the 
TAFB estimate of 102 kt.

The hurricane is moving northward at 17 kt in the flow between a 
deep-layer trough over the western Atlantic and a subtropical ridge 
centered over the eastern Atlantic.  Model guidance remains tightly 
clustered, and very few changes have been made to the latest 
official track forecast which lie close to the various consensus 
aids.  Kirk is expected to move north of the Azores on Monday and 
move over western Europe Tuesday evening or Wednesday.
 
Atmospheric and oceanic conditions are expected to become less 
conducive in the coming days.  Vertical wind shear should become 
quite strong later Sunday, and Kirk is expected to cross the 26 
degree C isotherm Sunday evening.  Global models predict Kirk to 
become an extratropical cyclone on Tuesday and to then be absorbed 
into a larger extratropical system later this week over northern 
Europe.  The latest NHC intensity forecast now reflects these 
changes.

Kirk is producing ocean swells that are propagating far away from 
the hurricane. These large swells have increased the risk of 
dangerous surf and rip currents across the Leeward Islands, Bermuda, 
and the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, and portions of the U.S. East 
Coast. By Sunday, swells are expected to spread northward along the 
eastern seaboard and reach the Azores by Monday. For more 
information on this hazard, see products issued by your local 
weather office.

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
1100 PM AST Sat Oct 05 2024
 
Leslie is holding steady this evening.  Geostationary imagery 
shows a growing Central Dense Overcast (CDO) with periodic burst 
of embedded deep convection.  An ASCAT pass from earlier showed 
that has a small core with the center near the southern side of 
the deep convection.  Objective and subjective satellite estimates 
range from 50 to 77 kt.  The initial intensity is held at an 
uncertain 70 kt, favoring the SAB and TAFB estimates.   
 
The hurricane is moving at an estimated 310/8 kt.  A subtropical 
ridge centered over the eastern Atlantic has turned Leslie to the 
northwest, and this motion is expected to continue, with a slight 
increase in forward speed, for the entire forecast period.  Model 
guidance is in relatively good agreement about this forecast and 
only small adjustments have been made to the latest NHC track 
prediction.
 
According to the SHIP diagnostics, Leslie only has a few more hours 
in the low vertical wind shear environment.  On Sunday, increasing 
wind shear and dry mid-level humidities should induce a gradual 
weakening trend for the entire forecast period.  Some model 
guidance is showing that Leslie could weaken quicker than forecast, 
and adjustments to the intensity forecast could be necessary in 
subsequent advisories.  The latest NHC forecast has been nudged 
downward, slightly above the consensus aid IVCN.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Milton was
located near latitude 23.0 North, longitude 94.9 West. Milton is
moving toward the east near 5 mph (7 km/h).  An eastward to
east-northeastward motion is forecast during the next couple of
days, followed by a faster northeastward motion.  On the forecast
track, Milton is forecast to move across the Gulf of Mexico and
approach the west coast of the Florida Peninsula by midweek.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Steady to rapid strengthening is forecast during 
the next few days. Milton is forecast to become a hurricane 
tonight, and it could become a major hurricane while it moves across 
the central and eastern Gulf of Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).

Tropical Storm Milton Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
1000 PM CDT Sat Oct 05 2024
 
Milton appears to be slowly organizing.  The storm has a central
dense overcast pattern with deep convection persisting near and to
the south of the center.  The latest satellite intensity estimates
range from 30 to 50 kt, and based on that data, the initial
intensity is nudged upward to 40 kt.  Milton is a small storm at the
moment, with its estimated tropical-storm-force winds extending only
about 30 n mi from the center.
 
The storm is moving slowly northeastward at 4 kt as it remains
embedded in weak steering currents.  However, a shortwave trough is
expected to push southward into the northern Gulf of Mexico.  This
trough and a reinforcing one should cause Milton to turn eastward on
Sunday, and move progressively faster to the east and then northeast
across the Gulf of Mexico and Florida during the next 3 to 4 days.
The guidance is in fair agreement, but there is some spread in
both direction and timing.  Overall, the models have trended slower
this cycle, and the NHC track forecast has been adjusted in that
direction.  This prediction is near the middle of the guidance
envelope and close to the typically best-performing consensus aids.
It should be noted that the average NHC track error at day 4 is
around 150 miles.  Therefore, users are reminded to not focus on the
exact track.
 
Milton will likely steadily strengthen during the next few days as
it moves over the very warm Gulf of Mexico waters, remains in a
moist air mass, and in a diffluent and low to moderate wind shear
environment.  The big question is how quickly and by how much will
the storm intensify.  There is a big spread in the intensity
models, with the hurricane regional models notably above the
global and statistical-dynamical models.  The new intensity
forecast is a little higher than the previous one and in good
agreement with the HCCA and IVCN aids.  It is hoped that the models
will come into better agreement tomorrow after ingesting some of the
Hurricane Hunter aircraft observations.
 
Regardless of the details, there is increasing confidence that a
powerful hurricane with life-threatening hazards will be affecting
portions of the Florida west coast around the middle of next week.
Residents there should closely monitor this system and listen
to local officials.
 
Key Messages:
1.  Milton is forecast to quickly intensify while it moves
eastward to northeastward across the Gulf of Mexico and be at or
near major hurricane strength when it reaches the west coast of the
Florida Peninsula mid week.  Hurricane Watches could be issued as
early as late Sunday for portions of Florida.
 
2.  There is an increasing risk of life-threatening storm surge and
wind impacts for portions of the west coast of the Florida
Peninsula beginning late Tuesday or Wednesday. Residents in these
areas should ensure they have their hurricane plan in place, follow
any advice given by local officials, and check back for updates to
the forecast.
 
3. Areas of heavy rainfall will impact portions of Florida Sunday
and Monday well ahead of Milton, with heavy rainfall more directly
related to the system expected later on Tuesday through Wednesday
night. This rainfall brings the risk of flash, urban, and areal
flooding, along with minor to moderate river flooding.
