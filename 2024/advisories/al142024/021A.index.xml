Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Thu Oct 10 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Leslie, located over the central subtropical Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
Hurricane Milton, located off the east coast of central Florida.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave that has now emerged off of the west coast of Africa <br/>
continues to produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear marginal for limited development of <br/>
this system while it moves westward or west-northwestward across the <br/>
eastern tropical Atlantic and the Cabo Verde Islands on Friday.  By <br/>
Saturday, upper-level winds are forecast to become less favorable, <br/>
and further development is unlikely after that time.  Regardless of <br/>
development, localized areas of heavy rain are possible across <br/>
portions of the Cabo Verde Islands late Thursday through Friday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 AM AST Thu Oct 10 2024
 
The satellite presentation of Leslie has degraded since the previous 
advisory.  Based on geostationary satellite imagery, the eye feature 
has filled, deep convection have shifted to the southern side of the 
circulation, and the outflow appears to be impinged in the northwest 
quadrant.  Subjective and objective Dvorak intensity estimates have 
plateaued, with final-T numbers coming down.  The initial intensity 
is held at a possibly generous 90 kt, in agreement with the latest 
TAFB and SAB estimates.
 
The window for intensification seems to have closed.  Vertical wind 
shear appears to be strengthening significantly over Leslie.  Global 
models insist the strong upper-level winds will strip away deep 
convection and force in the surrounding dry mid-level humidities 
into the circulation quickly.  Given the relatively small size of 
the hurricane, rapid weakening is expected over the next few days.  
Leslie is now forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone by Sunday 
and open into a trough by early next week. 

Leslie is moving northwestward at about 5 kt.  This motion should 
continue through today as Leslie moves around the southwestern 
periphery of a subtropical ridge over the eastern Atlantic.  On 
Friday, the hurricane should speed up and turn to the north and 
north-northeast, followed by a turn northeastward and 
east-northeastward as it accelerates further over the weekend.  
There have been only minor changes to the latest NHC track forecast, 
which lies essentially on top of the previous prediction and between 
the various consensus aids.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Milton was located
near latitude 28.9 North, longitude 79.5 West.  Milton is moving
toward the east-northeast near 18 mph (30 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue today, followed by a turn toward the 
east tonight.  On the forecast track, the center of Milton will 
continue to move away from Florida and pass to the north of the 
Bahamas today.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is expected, but Milton is forecast to
become a powerful extratropical low tonight.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km).  A sustained wind of 58 mph (93 km/h) and a gust to
76 mph (122 km/h) was recently reported at a Weatherstem station in
Marineland.  A sustained wind of 46 mph (74 km/h) and a gust to 67 
mph (108 km/h) was recently reported at the Cocoa-Patrick Air Force 
Base.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Milton can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Sebastian Inlet, FL to Altamaha Sound, GA...3-5 ft
St. Johns River...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of 
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and 
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative 
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over 
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see 
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast 
office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Additional rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches are expected
across portions of the east-central to northeast Florida coast
through this morning.  This rainfall will continue to bring the risk
of considerable flash and urban flooding, along with moderate to
major river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions, especially in gusts, are occurring 
within the hurricane warning area in Florida.  Tropical storm 
conditions are occurring in the tropical storm warning areas in 
Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and the Bahamas.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Milton are expected to continue to
affect portions of the southeast U.S. and the Bahamas during the
next couple of days.  These swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.

Hurricane Milton Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
500 AM EDT Thu Oct 10 2024
 
Milton moved quickly across central Florida overnight, producing
significant flooding and damaging winds near its path.  The center
of the hurricane is now exiting the state near Cape Canaveral, and
the worst conditions have shifted to east-central and northeastern
Florida.  The initial intensity is set to 75 kt based on Doppler
radar velocity data and surface observations, with the strongest
winds likely occurring just offshore of east-central Florida.
 
Milton is expected to remain a hurricane a little longer, but the
models are in good agreement that it will develop frontal
characteristics by tonight, and therefore, the official forecast
shows the system becoming extratropical in 24 hours.  The
extratropical low is expected to gradually weaken and dissipate in
about 4 days.  The NHC intensity forecast is in best agreement with
the GFS model, which typically performs better than the standard
hurricane models for transitioning systems.
 
The hurricane is moving quickly northeastward between a trough just
to its west and a ridge near the Greater Antilles.  A turn to the
east is expected to occur soon as the flow becomes more zonal,
taking the system to the north of the Bahamas later today and south
of Bermuda on Saturday.  The NHC track forecast is a little faster
than the previous one to be in better agreement with the latest
models.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge along the
coast from east-central Florida northward to southern Georgia,
where a Storm Surge Warning remains in effect.
 
2. Damaging hurricane-force winds, especially in gusts, will
continue for a few more hours in east-central and northeastern
Florida. Residents are urged to remain in an interior room and away
from windows.
 
3. Heavy rainfall across the central to northern Florida Peninsula
through this morning continues to bring the risk of considerable
flash and urban flooding along with moderate to major river
flooding, especially in areas where coastal and inland flooding
combine to increase the overall flood threat.
