Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Leslie, located over the central subtropical Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
Hurricane Milton, located over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. <br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic (AL93):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a gale-force non-tropical <br/>
low pressure system located about 375 miles west-southwest of <br/>
Bermuda have become less organized during the last several hours.  <br/>
Although environmental conditions are becoming less favorable for <br/>
development, a short-lived tropical or subtropical storm could <br/>
still form today or this evening while the low moves northeastward <br/>
to east-northeastward at around 15 mph.  Upper-level winds are <br/>
forecast to become too strong for further development later tonight. <br/>
Additional information on this system, including gale warnings, <br/>
can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather <br/>

<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa <br/>
tonight or early Thursday.  Afterward, environmental conditions <br/>
appear only marginally favorable for some limited development of <br/>
this system while it moves westward or west-northwestward across <br/>
the eastern tropical Atlantic and through the Cabo Verde Islands on <br/>
Friday. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 AM AST Wed Oct 09 2024
 
Conventional satellite imagery shows that Leslie's cloud pattern has 
changed little during the past few hours.  Earlier SSMIS and AMSU-B 
microwaves overpasses, however, indicated that Leslie's structure 
has become vertically tilted southeast to northwest, indicative of 
the previously mentioned mid-level southerly shear component.  A 
blend of the Dvorak satellite intensity estimates from TAFB and 
SAB and a 0610 UTC UW-CIMSS 72 kt SATCON analysis yield an 
initial intensity at 70 kt.
 
Although the undercutting shear is expected to persist, slight 
intensity fluctuations are possible today and tonight while Leslie 
moves through a marginally conducive thermodynamic environment and 
over warm oceanic surface temperatures.  Afterward, the global 
models show an upper-tropospheric anticyclone developing over the SW 
Atlantic, between Milton and Leslie.  This feature is expected to 
spread moderate northerly shear over the central subtropical 
Atlantic inhibiting ventilation aloft over the north portion of the 
cyclone.  Consequently, weakening is expected, and Leslie is 
forecast to quickly lose its associated convection and become a 
post-tropical cyclone in 3 days.
 
Leslie's initial motion is estimated to be northwestward, 310/9 kt, 
and this general motion is expected to continue during the next 
couple of days.  By mid-period, the cyclone is forecast to slow in 
forward speed and turn toward the north while rounding the 
southwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge to the northeast.  
Afterward, Leslie should accelerate and turn toward the northeast in 
response to a major shortwave trough approaching the cyclone from 
the northeast.  The NHC forecast is close to the previous one and is 
based on a compromise of the TVCN and HCCA consensus models.
 
Leslie's wind radii were adjusted based on 2354 UTC METOP-B and 0049 
UTC METOP-C scatterometer passes.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Milton was located
near latitude 25.0 North, longitude 84.8 West. Milton is moving
toward the northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h).  A northeastward motion
is expected through tonight.  A turn toward the east-northeast and 
east is expected on Thursday and Friday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Milton will move across the eastern Gulf of Mexico today, 
make landfall along the west-central coast of Florida late tonight 
or early Thursday morning, and move off the east coast of Florida 
over the western Atlantic Ocean Thursday afternoon.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 155 mph (250 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Milton is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Milton is expected to remain an extremely
dangerous major hurricane when it reaches the west-central coast of
Florida tonight.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125
miles (205 km).
 
The minimum central pressure based on NOAA and Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter data is 915 mb (27.02 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Key Messages for Milton can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Anna Maria Island, FL to Boca Grande, FL...10-15 ft
Anclote River, FL to Anna Maria Island, FL...8-12 ft
Tampa Bay...8-12 ft
Boca Grande, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...8-12 ft
Charlotte Harbor...8-12 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...5-8 ft
Aripeka, FL to Anclote River, FL...4-7 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Sebastian Inlet, FL to Altamaha Sound, GA...3-5 ft
Altamaha Sound, GA to Edisto Beach, SC...2-4 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Aripeka, FL...2-4 ft
Dry Tortugas...2-4 ft
St. Johns River...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the south of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 6 to 12 inches, with localized totals
up to 18 inches, are expected across central to northern portions of
the Florida Peninsula through Thursday.  This rainfall brings the
risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding,
along with moderate to major river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area across Florida beginning this evening through early Thursday
and are possible in the hurricane watch area on Thursday. Tropical
storm conditions are expected to begin in the warning area on the
west coast of Florida around midday, spreading across the peninsula
and reaching the east coast tonight. Tropical storm conditions are
expected to begin in the warning area on the east coast of Florida
tonight and along the Georgia coast on Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the
northwestern Bahamas on Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
on the South Carolina coast on Thursday.
 
TORNADOES: Several tornadoes are likely today and tonight across
parts of central and southern Florida.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Milton are expected to continue to affect 
much of the Gulf Coast and will increase along the southeastern U.S. 
coast during the next day or two.  These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Milton Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
400 AM CDT Wed Oct 09 2024
 
Milton has been maintaining its strength as a catastrophic category
5 hurricane over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico.  Satellite and
Doppler radar images indicate that the major hurricane has a
compact, symmetric, and very powerful inner core.  Based on
aircraft data, the minimum pressure has dropped to 907 mb and the
maximum sustained winds remain near 140 kt.  The wind field of
Milton is gradually expanding, and the wind radii have been adjusted
based on a combination of the Hurricane Hunter data and ASCAT
passes.  There is an area of heavy rain beginning to spread across
portions of southwestern and west-central Florida out ahead of
Milton, and weather conditions will steadily deteriorate across
portions of the Florida Gulf Coast throughout the day.
 
Milton is moving northeastward at 12 kt in the flow between a mid-
to upper-level trough over the northern Gulf and a ridge located
over the Greater Antilles.  This motion should generally continue
until Milton makes landfall in Florida, which is likely to occur
late tonight or early Thursday morning.  After the hurricane reaches
the coast, a turn to the east-northeast is expected as another
trough approaches the system from the west.  Milton should exit
Florida and move over the Atlantic waters Thursday afternoon and
accelerate eastward after that.  The NHC track forecast is nudged a
little to the north of the previous one to be in better agreement
with the latest models.  It should be noted that this forecast is
based on the model fields, not the interpolated models which
appear to be too far south.  Users are urged not to focus on the
exact landfall point as the average error at 24 hours is about 40
miles.
 
The global models agree that vertical wind shear is expected begin 
to increase over Milton later today, and that should cause some
weakening.  However, there is high confidence that Milton will 
remain a very dangerous hurricane when it reaches Florida, and 
maintain hurricane status as it moves across the state.  The 
cyclone is expected to become extratropical over the Atlantic on 
Friday and gradually weaken.  The NHC intensity forecast is similar 
to the previous one and near the high end of the model guidance.
 
Milton's wind field is expected to grow considerably in size while 
it moves across Florida.  Additionally, a large region of tropical 
storm and hurricane-force winds could occur on the northwest/back 
side of the storm since Milton will be interacting with a frontal 
boundary and beginning extratropical transition.  Damaging winds,
life-threatening storm surge, and heavy rainfall will extend well
outside the forecast cone.  This is a very serious situation and
residents in Florida should closely follow orders from their local
emergency management officials.  Evacuations and other preparations
should be rushed to completion.  Milton has the potential to be one
of the most destructive hurricanes on record for west-central
Florida.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. A large area of destructive storm surge, with highest inundations
of 10 ft or greater, is expected along a portion of the west-central
coast of the Florida Peninsula.  If you are in the Storm Surge
Warning area, this is an extremely life-threatening situation, and
you should evacuate as soon as possible if ordered by local
officials.
 
2. Devastating hurricane-force winds are expected along portions of
the west coast of Florida, where a Hurricane Warning is in effect.
Milton is forecast to remain a hurricane while it crosses the
Florida Peninsula and life-threatening hurricane-force winds,
especially in gusts, are expected to spread inland across the
peninsula.  Preparations to protect life and property, including
being ready for long-duration power outages, should be rushed to
completion.
 
3. Heavy rainfall across the Florida Peninsula through Thursday
brings the risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban
flooding along with moderate to major river flooding, especially in
areas where coastal and inland flooding combine to increase the
overall flood threat.
