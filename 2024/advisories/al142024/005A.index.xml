...KIRK ACCELERATING NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD OVER OPEN WATERS...
...LARGE SWELLS ARE PRODUCING AN INCREASED RISK OF LIFE-THREATENING
RIP CURRENTS ALONG THE U.S. EAST COAST...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...35.6N 47.7W
ABOUT 1155 MI...1855 KM W OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...100 MPH...155 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 35 DEGREES AT 25 MPH...41 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...960 MB...28.35 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the Azores should monitor the progress of Kirk.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located
near latitude 35.6 North, longitude 47.7 West. Kirk is moving toward
the northeast near 25 mph (41 km/h). An acceleration toward the 
northeast and east-northeast is expected over the next few days
while Kirk moves across the northeastern Atlantic.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Although weakening is expected through midweek, Kirk will
remain a large hurricane for the next next day or so before
transitioning to an extratropical cyclone by Monday night.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 290
miles (465 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 960 mb (28.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Bermuda, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, and the east coast of
the United States. These swells will continue spreading northward
along the east coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada today,
and to the Azores on Monday. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
1100 AM AST Sun Oct 06 2024
 
Most of Kirk's convection is now located in its northeastern
semicircle as a result of increasing southwesterly vertical wind
shear over the cyclone.  Satellite intensity estimates continue to
decrease, with the latest subjective estimates from TAFB and SAB at
T-4.5/77 kt.  Some of the objective CIMSS intensity estimates are
still a bit higher, and the initial intensity is set to 85 kt, in
agreement with the objective estimates.
 
Kirk is expected to continue to weaken during the next several days
due to strong southwesterly wind shear, which is expected to
increase even more after 24 h.  Also, the hurricane will reach
cooler sea-surface temperature below 26C in about 12 hours.  Global
models indicate that Kirk should undergo extratropical transition
soon, and the transition should be complete in about 36 h.  Kirk's
wind field is expected to remain quite large, which will continue to
generate a very large area of dangerous seas over the Atlantic. The
NHC intensity forecast is similar to the previous prediction and
lies near the middle of the guidance.
 
Kirk is moving toward the north-northeast, or 020/22 kt within the
flow between an eastern Atlantic subtropical ridge and a deep-layer
trough to the west of Kirk.  The track guidance continues to be in
fairly good agreement that Kirk will accelerate while turning
northeastward and east-northeastward over the next couple of days.  
The NHC forecast is close to the previous prediction, and shows Kirk
passing north of the Azores Monday night and Tuesday as an
extratropical cyclone, then moving over portions of western Europe
Wednesday afternoon through Thursday.
 
Large swells from Kirk are propagating far away from the hurricane
and bringing an increased risk of dangerous surf and rip currents to
portions of the Leeward Islands, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas,
Bermuda, the U.S. East Coast, and Atlantic Canada. These swells are
expected to spread toward the Azores on Monday. For more information
on this hazard, see products issued by your local weather office.

The initial wind radii have been increased based on data from a 
recent ASCAT pass.

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
1100 AM AST Sun Oct 06 2024
 
Leslie has continued to produce a deep ring of convection around the 
center, with a faint eye becoming more apparent on infrared and 
visible satellite imagery, and GLM lightning data depicts lightning 
occuring in the northern eyewall. These satellite trends all 
depict Leslie is still strengthening within a marginally favorable 
environment. Dvorak subjective and objective satellite intensity 
estimates have continued to increase this cycle and range from 70 
to 85 kt.  Based on these satellite data, the initial intensity 
is raised to 80 kt.
 
Leslie is moving northwestward (310/8 kt) while being steered by a 
subtropical ridge centered to the northeast of the hurricane. The 
ridge will remain anchored over the eastern Atlantic and continue to 
steer the hurricane northwestward throughout the forecast period. As 
a result, model guidance is fairly tightly clustered with only a few 
slight leftward adjustments made towards the end of the forecast 
period, closer to the HCCA corrected consensus.

The hurricane has been able to maintain its core even though wind 
shear is gradually increasing over the system. Leslie has about 12 
more hours before it begins to move into an increasingly unfavorable 
environment. In the near term the forecast allows for some 
additional strengthening, especially if Leslie's eye can clear. 
However, drier mid-level air is nearby as is depicted on water vapor 
imagery, as well as a less difluent upper-level pattern, and 
southwesterly shear will persist. The latest NHC forecast follows 
the latest model trends with gradual weakening beginning on Monday. 
Since Leslie is a relatively small tropical cyclone, it could be 
more susceptible to these negative factors and weaken even faster 
than the NHC forecast later in the period, as suggested by some of 
the global and hurricane regional models.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Milton was
located by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near 
latitude 22.5 North, longitude 94.0 West. Milton is moving toward 
the east near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this general motion is expected 
today. An eastward to east-northeastward motion is forecast on 
Monday, followed by a faster northeastward motion on Tuesday and 
Wednesday.  On the forecast track, Milton is forecast to move north 
of the Yucatan Peninsula and to move across the Gulf of Mexico and 
approach the west coast of the Florida Peninsula by midweek.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 80 mph (130 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Milton is forecast to rapidly intensify during

<title>Hurricane Milton Forecast Discussion Number 5</title>

Tropical Storm Milton Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
1000 AM CDT Sun Oct 06 2024
 
Satellite and aircraft data indicate that Milton is strengthening.
A large burst of convection is occurring in the northern semicircle 
of the storm, with lots of expanding outflow.  The last fix from the
NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft showed a pressure down to 991 mb
with maximum 500m low-level winds of about 65 kt.  These winds 
reduce down to the surface to about 55 kt, and this value will be 
the initial intensity.
 
The fixes from the aircraft indicate that Milton is south of the
previously anticipated and has been moving east-southeastward or
105/5 kt.  Milton is forecast to move a little south of due east
today in westerly flow from a shortwave trough over the northern
Gulf of Mexico.  The storm should then turn northeastward and
accelerate on Tuesday and Wednesday toward the Florida Peninsula.  
As a result of this re-positioning and initial motion, there's been 
a southward change to most of the guidance this morning.  The new 
NHC forecast is adjusted south of the previous one, especially early
on, and further southward adjustments could be required if the
guidance trend continues.  The Mexican government has issued a
Tropical Storm Warning for the north coast of the Yucatan Peninsula
as a result of the forecast change. It should be noted that the
average NHC track error at day 3 is around 100 miles, and users
should not focus on the exact track.
 
The NOAA Hurricane Hunter crew reported that an eyewall has formed 
on the last center fix, suggesting that this system is ready to 
intensify quickly.  Given the track over the very deep warm waters 
of the Gulf of Mexico and little shear for the next couple of days, 
rapid intensification is explicitly forecast, and the new NHC 
prediction could still be conservative over the central Gulf of 
Mexico.  The biggest question actually seems to be the intensity as 
Milton approaches Florida, with much of the guidance showing a 
notable increase in shear.  While some weakening is anticipated, 
the shear could help transition Milton to be a large hurricane at 
landfall, with impacts spread out over a big area. Regardless of 
the details, there is increasing confidence that a powerful 
hurricane with life-threatening hazards will be affecting portions 
of the Florida west coast around the middle of this week. Residents 
there should closely monitor this system and listen to local 
officials.
 
 
Key Messages:

1. Milton is forecast to quickly intensify while it moves eastward 
to northeastward across the Gulf of Mexico and be a major hurricane 
when it reaches the west coast of the Florida Peninsula mid week. 
Users are reminded to not focus on the details of the forecast as 
there remains significant uncertainty in the eventual track and 
intensity of Milton. 

2. While it is too soon to specify the exact magnitude and location 
of the greatest impacts, there is an increasing risk of 
life-threatening storm surge and damaging winds for portions of the 
west coast of the Florida Peninsula beginning Tuesday night or early 
Wednesday.  Storm Surge and Hurricane Watches could be issued later 
today or tonight.  Residents in the Florida Peninsula should follow 
any advice given by local officials and check back for updates to 
the forecast. 

3.  Areas of heavy rainfall will impact portions of Florida today 
and Monday well ahead of Milton, with heavy rainfall more directly 
related to the system expected later on Tuesday through Wednesday 
night. This rainfall will bring the risk of flash, urban, and areal 
flooding, along with the potential of moderate to major river 
flooding. 

4. Tropical storm conditions are expected beginning Monday across 
portions of the northern Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico where a 
Tropical Storm Warning is in effect.
