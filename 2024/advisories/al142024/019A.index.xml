Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 PM AST Wed Oct 09 2024

Leslie continues to take advantage of the little time it has left 
under favorable environmental conditions.  Although an eye is not 
currently seen on visible or infrared imagery, a 1611 UTC AMSR2 
image shows that an eye exists on microwave imagery, and it is 
located underneath the middle of the central dense overcast.  
Subjective Dvorak numbers from TAFB and SAB are a unanimous T-4.5/77 
kt, whereas recent objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS have 
been averaging in the 78-85 kt range for the past several hours.  
The initial intensity is bumped up to 80 kt, using a blend of the 
subjective and objective estimates.

Leslie's initial motion estimate is northwestward, or 310/8 kt. 
There has been no change to the track forecast reasoning.  Leslie is 
expected to turn northward in 24-36 h as it rounds the southwestern 
and western periphery of a subtropical ridge to the east.  
Afterward, Leslie should accelerate toward the northeast in response 
to a strong trough approaching the cyclone from the northwest.  The 
guidance is a bit farther west this cycle, and the new NHC forecast 
has shifted west of the previous one.

Saildrone data from the last several hours indicates that Leslie is 
over sea-surface temperatures approximately 1 to 2 degrees warmer 
than other data sources are indicating, and this could be the main 
reason why Leslie has strengthened a bit more than anticipated over 
the past 12 to 24 h.  A bit more strengthening is forecast during 
the next 12 h while the vertical wind shear remains relatively 
low.  In about 12 to 18 h, Leslie is expected to run into a wall of 
strong northerly shear caused by a strengthening upper-level 
anticyclone in between Milton and Leslie.  The shear is expected to 
cause Leslie to rapidly weaken during the 24 to 48 h period.  While 
it is possible that Leslie could lose most of its convection in 2 to 
3 days, the latest GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite imagery now 
show several periodic bursts of convection continuing into Day 4.  
Leslie might also merge with a front and become extratropical in 3 
to 4 days.  Regardless, Leslie will be traveling over much colder 
water by that time, and the official forecast calls for Leslie to 
become post-tropical in 3 to 4 days.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Milton was located
near latitude 27.2 North, longitude 82.8 West.  Milton is moving
toward the east-northeast near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue through Thursday, followed by a turn 
toward the east on Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Milton will make landfall just south of the Tampa Bay region 
within the next hour or two, and then move across the central part 
of the Florida peninsula overnight, and emerge off the east coast of 
Florida on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Milton is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in strength is likely 
until landfall, and Milton is expected to remain a hurricane 
while it moves across central Florida through Thursday.  The system 
is forecast to weaken over the western Atlantic and become 
extratropical by Thursday night.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 255
miles (405 km). A sustained wind of 54 mph (87 km/h) and a gust of 
96 mph (154 km/h) was recently reported at the Sarasota-Bradenton 
International Airport. A C-MAN Station in Venice, Florida recently 
reported a sustained wind of 71 mph (115 km/h) with a gust to 90 
mph (145 km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft observations is 954 mb (28.17 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Milton can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Anna Maria Island, FL to Boca Grande, FL...9-13 ft
Anclote River, FL to Anna Maria Island, FL...6-9 ft
Tampa Bay...6-9 ft
Boca Grande, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...8-12 ft
Charlotte Harbor...8-12 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...5-8 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Sebastian Inlet, FL to Altamaha Sound, GA...3-5 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Anclote River, FL...2-4 ft
Dry Tortugas...2-4 ft
St. Johns River...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the south of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 6 to 12 inches, with localized totals
up to 18 inches, are expected across central to northern portions of
the Florida Peninsula through Thursday.  This rainfall brings the
risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding,
along with moderate to major river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are occurring within the hurricane 
warning area and will spread east-northeastward across the Florida 
peninsula overnight.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the 
hurricane watch area tonight and on Thursday.  Tropical storm 
conditions are occurring along the west coast of Florida and are 
forecast to spread across the peninsula and reach the east coast 
tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the 
warning area along the Georgia and South Carolina coast on Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the
northwestern Bahamas on Thursday.
 
TORNADOES: Several tornadoes, possibly including a few strong
tornadoes, are likely this evening and tonight across parts of
central Florida.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Milton are expected to continue to affect
much of the Gulf Coast and will increase along the southeastern U.S.
coast during the next day or two.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Milton Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
500 PM EDT Wed Oct 09 2024
 
WSR-88D radar images from Tampa and Key West show that Milton is a 
sheared hurricane, with the heaviest precipitation to the north of 
the center, and the eye open on the south side.  This structure was 
confirmed by a recent Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter mission, 
where the eyewall was reported open to the southwest.  The plane 
reported that the pressure has risen during the past few hours, with 
the latest center drop supporting a minimum pressure of 948 mb.  
Based on this pressure, and the reduction of measured flight-level 
winds, the intensity is estimated to be 105 kt.  The highest 
Doppler velocities from the Tampa radar have been between 100 and 
105 kt.
 
Milton's recent motion has been northeastward (035 degrees) at 
about 15 kt.  Track model guidance continues to insist that the 
hurricane will slow down a bit and turn more to the right very 
soon, taking the center near or just south of Tampa Bay later this 
evening.  Milton's center is then expected to cross central Florida 
and turn east-northeastward as it emerges over the western Atlantic.

Milton is likely to be right near the threshold of a major 
hurricane when it reaches the west-central coast of Florida this 
evening.  Milton has grown in size today, particularly in the extent 
of 34- and 50-kt winds to the northwest of the center, and the 
northern eyewall appears most severe at the moment due to 
southwesterly shear.  As a result, significant wind impacts are 
likely to occur north of the center, as well as to the south, 
regardless of the exact intensity at landfall.  There will likely be
a noticeable gradient of surge heights to the north of the landfall
location, however, the risk of devastating storm surge still 
exists across much of the west-central and southwest coast of 
Florida given the size of the storm.
 
Earlier scatterometer data suggested that Milton is already 
beginning to interact with a frontal boundary, and global model 
guidance suggests that the cyclone will become extratropical in 
about 36 hours over the western Atlantic.  This is reflected in the 
new NHC forecast.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. A large area of destructive storm surge, with highest 
inundations of 10 ft or greater, is expected along a portion of the 
west-central coast of the Florida Peninsula. Near the coast the 
surge will be accompanied by damaging waves.  Water levels will rise 
rapidly as the eye approaches, and strong onshore winds on the 
backside of the hurricane will also cause a rapid rise in water as 
the center makes landfall. 

2. Devastating hurricane-force winds are expected along portions of 
the west coast of Florida within the Hurricane Warning area. 
Life-threatening hurricane-force winds, especially in gusts, are 
expected to spread inland across the peninsula and to portions of 
the Florida east coast within the Hurricane Warning area tonight and 
early Thursday.  Residents should be prepared to take shelter in an 
interior room, away from windows, as the core of the hurricane moves 
across the central Florida Peninsula. 

3. The risk of strong tornadoes will continue into the evening 
hours across the southern and central portions of the Florida 
Peninsula.  Be prepared to take immediate shelter in an interior 
room if a Tornado Warning is issued for your area. 

4. Heavy rainfall across the Florida Peninsula through Thursday 
brings the risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban 
flooding along with moderate to major river flooding, especially in 
areas where coastal and inland flooding combine to increase the 
overall flood threat.
