Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  31
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
1100 PM AST Wed Oct 09 2024
 
Since the previous advisory, a small eye feature has started 
appearing on geostationary infrared imagery with Leslie, surrounded 
by a ring of very cold (below -70 C) cloud top temperatures. This 
structure is also supported by an earlier SAR-RCM2 pass that showed 
a tight inner core with a radius of maximum wind that had contracted 
from yesterday. 00 UTC subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB 
were T5.0/90-kt and T5.5/102-kt, respectively. Objective intensity 
estimates were somewhat lower, between 79-86 kt, and blending the 
data results in a 90 kt intensity this cycle. A Saildrone (SD-1036) 
appears to be near the path of Leslie, and is currently reporting 
sustained tropical-storm-force winds that are quickly increasing 
about 50 n mi northwest of the center. 
 
As noted previously, another saildrone (SD-1040) indicated that 
sea-surface temperatures near Leslie are warmer than expected, near 
29 C. At the same time, the hurricane is in a very narrow region of 
low vertical wind shear that should persist for another 6-12 h. 
While the interpolated intensity guidance is a bit lower, the raw 
model output of all four of the hurricane-regional models (HAFS-A/B, 
HMON, HWRF) show Leslie briefly becoming a major hurricane in 12 h. 
Because the raw model output from these intensity aids has been 
outperforming the interpolated guidance over the past day, the NHC 
intensity forecast will now show a 100 kt peak tomorrow morning. 
However, this peak is likely to be short-lived, as strong 
upper-level northerly flow, via outflow from Milton and Invest 93L, 
will soon overtake the hurricane, likely leading to rapid weakening. 
Those same hurricane-regional models show Leslie weakening below 
hurricane intensity in 36 h, and that rapid weakening continues to 
be reflected in the latest intensity forecast. While sheared puffs 
of deep convection may continue for a subsequent day or two, 
eventually Leslie is likely to lose the necessary convective 
organization to be classified as a tropical cyclone. The NHC 
forecast continues to show Leslie becoming post-tropical by the end 
of the weekend, though this could occur sooner than forecast given 
the proximity of very dry environmental air and high shear affecting 
the system.
 
Leslie continues to move northwestward, estimated at 315/7 kt this
evening. The track forecast is more straightforward, with Leslie
rounding the western edge of a subtropical ridge to its east,
resulting in a gradual turn northward and then northeastward over
the forecast period. With that said, there has been a notable
westward and poleward shift in the guidance this cycle, and the NHC
track forecast was moved in that direction, but not as far as the
latest TVCN and HCCA consensus aids.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Milton was
located inland near latitude 27.6 North, longitude 82.0 West.  
Milton is moving toward the east-northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h), 
and this general motion is expected to continue through Thursday, 
followed by a turn toward the east on late Thursday.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Milton will continue to move across 
the central part of the Florida peninsula overnight, and emerge off 
the east coast of Florida on Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Milton is forecast to maintain hurricane intensity while 
crossing Florida overnight.  After moving into the Atlantic, Milton 
is expected to gradually lose tropical characteristics and slowly 
weaken.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 255 miles 
(405 km).  A sustained wind of 92 mph (148 km/h) and a gust of 107 
mph (172 km/h) was recently reported at a UF Sentinel/WeatherFlow 
station in Venice.  A sustained wind of 58 mph (93 km/h) and a gust 
of 82 mph (131 km/h) was recently reported at Tampa International 
Airport.  A gust of 94 mph (152 km/h) was recently reported at a 
Citizen Weather Observer Program station in Bartow.  A sustained 
wind of 52 mph (84 km/h) and a gust of 77 mph (124 km/h) was 
recently reported at Winter Haven Regional Airport.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 960 mb (28.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Milton can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Anna Maria Island, FL to Boca Grande, FL...9-13 ft
Boca Grande, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...8-12 ft
Charlotte Harbor...8-12 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...5-8 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Sebastian Inlet, FL to Altamaha Sound, GA...3-5 ft
Anclote River, FL to Anna Maria Island, FL...3-5 ft
Tampa Bay...3-5 ft
St. Johns River...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the south of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 8 to 14 inches, with localized totals 
up to 18 inches, are expected across central to northern portions of 
the Florida Peninsula through Thursday.  This rainfall will continue 
to bring the risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flash and 
urban flooding, along with moderate to major river flooding.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero. 
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are occurring within the hurricane
warning area and are spreading east-northeastward across the
Florida peninsula.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the 
hurricane watch area tonight and on Thursday.  Tropical storm
conditions are occurring along the west coast of Florida and have 
already reached the east coast of Florida.  Tropical storm 
conditions are expected to begin in the warning area along the 
Georgia and South Carolina coast on Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the
northwestern Bahamas on Thursday.
 
TORNADOES: A tornado or two is possible through early Thursday 
morning over parts of central and eastern Florida.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Milton are expected to continue to affect
much of the Gulf Coast and will increase along the southeastern U.S.
coast during the next day or two.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Milton Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
1100 PM EDT Wed Oct 09 2024
 
Earlier Hurricane Hunter aircraft observations, WSR-88D radar 
imagery and velocities, and surface synoptic data indicate that 
Milton made landfall along the Florida Gulf coast just south of 
Tampa around 0030 UTC.  The center is now moving over central 
Florida.  While aircraft and Doppler velocity data indicated 
a landfall intensity of near 105 kt, assuming some inland decrease 
in intensity, the maximum winds are now estimated to be around 90 
kt.  There have been a number of surface reports of inland winds 
at damaging velocities.  There have also been several reports of 
extreme rainfall rates, including one measurement of 5.09 inches in 
an hour at St. Petersburg.
 
Center fixes indicate that the motion is east-northeastward, or
060/14 kt.  Milton is now embedded within a belt of subtropical
mid-tropospheric westerlies, and it should move across the Florida
peninsula overnight.  Afterward, the cyclone is likely to turn
generally eastward during the ensuing few days while moving over the
southwestern Atlantic waters and losing tropical characteristics.
The official track forecast is similar to the dynamical model
consensus early in the period and follows a blend of the GFS and
ECMWF solutions in 2-4 days.
 
The intensity guidance and the relatively fast forward speed of
Milton indicate that the system will maintain hurricane intensity
while crossing Florida.  Milton is already interacting with a
frontal zone and the global models show the system becoming embedded
within the front in 24-36 hours.  This guidance also suggests that
Milton will not have sufficient baroclinic forcing to maintain its
strength and will gradually spin down over the Atlantic,
dissipating after 96 hours.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. A large area of life-threatening storm surge is occurring along
portions of the west-central coast of the Florida Peninsula and
southwest Florida.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied
by damaging waves.  Water levels will remain elevated into Thursday
morning.
 
2. Damaging and life-threatening hurricane-force winds, especially
in gusts, will spread inland across portions of the central Florida
Peninsula to the Florida east coast within the Hurricane Warning
area overnight and early Thursday.  Residents should be prepared to
take shelter in an interior room and away from windows.
 
3. Heavy rainfall across the Florida Peninsula through Thursday
continues to bring the risk of catastrophic and life-threatening
flash and urban flooding along with moderate to major river
flooding, especially in areas where coastal and inland flooding
combine to increase the overall flood threat.
