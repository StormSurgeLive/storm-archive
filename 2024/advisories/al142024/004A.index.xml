...KIRK ACCELERATING NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD OVER OPEN WATERS...
...LARGE SWELLS ARE PRODUCING AN INCREASED RISK OF LIFE-THREATENING
RIP CURRENTS ALONG THE U.S. EAST COAST...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...33.5N 49.0W
ABOUT 1270 MI...2040 KM W OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...105 MPH...165 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 15 DEGREES AT 23 MPH...37 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...957 MB...28.26 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the Azores should monitor the progress of Kirk.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located 
near latitude 33.5 North, longitude 49.0 West. Kirk is moving toward 
the north-northeast near 23 mph (37 km/h). An acceleration toward 
the northeast and east-northeast is expected over the next few days 
while Kirk moves across the northeastern Atlantic.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Although weakening is expected through midweek, Kirk will 
remain a large hurricane for the next next day or so before 
transitioning to an extratropical cyclone by early Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230
miles (370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 957 mb (28.26 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Bermuda, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, and the east coast of
the United States. These swells will continue spreading northward
along the east coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada today,
and to the Azores on Monday. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
500 AM AST Sun Oct 06 2024
 
Kirk continues to show the ill effects of increasing southwesterly 
shear. Earlier scatterometer data and recent satellite images 
suggest the hurricane is vertically tilted, with the low-level 
center displaced to the southwest of the mid-level circulation. The 
eye feature that was evident earlier today has filled, and satellite 
intensity estimates are decreasing. Kirk's initial intensity is 
estimated to be 90 kt, in best agreement with a T5.0 Dvorak Current 
Intensity estimate from TAFB and recent UW-CIMSS D-MINT and D-PRINT 
estimates. The wind radii of Kirk were made slightly larger based 
on partial data from a 0014 UTC ASCAT-C overpass.

Kirk is expected to continue weakening during the next several days 
due to the negative influences of increasing vertical wind shear, 
decreasing SSTs, and a progressively drier mid-level environment. 
However, the expansive wind field of Kirk should remain large while 
the cyclone acquires frontal characteristics and transitions to an 
extratropical cyclone by 48 h. It is possible that the hostile 
conditions could cause Kirk to lose organized convection and become 
post-tropical even sooner than forecast. The updated NHC intensity 
forecast was adjusted downward to follow the latest HCCA and IVCN 
consensus trends. 
 
The hurricane is moving north-northeastward (015/20 kt) within the 
flow between an eastern Atlantic subtropical ridge and a deep-layer 
trough to the west of Kirk. The various track models agree that Kirk 
will continue accelerating deeper into the mid-latitudes while 
turning northeastward and east-northwestward over the next few days. 
The NHC forecast is very similar to the previous prediction, showing 
the center of Kirk passing north of the Azores Monday night into 
Tuesday as an extratropical cyclone and moving over western Europe 
during the middle of the week.   

Large swells from Kirk are propagating far away from the hurricane 
and bringing an increased risk of dangerous surf and rip currents to 
portions of the Leeward Islands, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, 
Bermuda, the U.S. East Coast, and Atlantic Canada. These swells are 
expected to spread toward the Azores on Monday. For more information 
on this hazard, see products issued by your local weather office.

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 AM AST Sun Oct 06 2024
 
The center of Leslie was embedded within a cold, asymmetric central
dense overcast for much of the overnight hours. But recently,
geostationary satellite images indicate an eye feature is trying to
emerge, with a warm spot in infrared imagery surrounded by a ring of
deep, cold convection. Based on these satellite trends, the initial
intensity is raised to 75 kt, in best agreement with T4.5 Dvorak
estimates from TAFB and SAB.
 
Leslie is moving northwestward (310/9 kt) while being steered by a
subtropical ridge centered to the north and northeast of the
hurricane. This ridge is expected to build eastward over the eastern
Atlantic and remain the primary steering feature for much of the
5-day forecast period. As a result, the NHC forecast shows a
continued northwestward motion, remaining near the center of the
track guidance envelope. Only small right-of-track adjustments
were made to the previous forecast, mainly beyond 48 h.
 
Some near-term intensity fluctuations are possible today, depending
on whether Leslie is able to fully clear out an eye this morning.
But overall, the environmental conditions are still forecast to
become less favorable for further development in the coming days.
Drier mid-level air, a more convergent upper-level environment, and
increasing southwesterly shear should induce at least a gradual
weakening trend in the coming days, and this is reflected in the
latest NHC prediction. Since Leslie is a relatively small tropical
cyclone, it could be more susceptible to these negative factors and
weaken even faster than the NHC forecast later in the period, as 
suggested by the regional hurricane models.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Milton was 
located by NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 22.6 North, 
longitude 94.9 West. Milton has been moving slowly eastward 
overnight, and an eastward to east-northeastward motion is forecast 
during the next couple of days, followed by a faster northeastward 
motion.  On the forecast track, Milton is forecast to move across 
the Gulf of Mexico and approach the west coast of the Florida 
Peninsula by midweek.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h)
with higher gusts. Steady to rapid strengthening is forecast during
the next few days. Milton is forecast to become a hurricane later 
today, and it could become a major hurricane while it moves across 
the central and eastern Gulf of Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.26 inches) 
based on NOAA dropsonde data.

Tropical Storm Milton Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
400 AM CDT Sun Oct 06 2024
 
Satellite imagery this morning suggests that Milton is getting
better organized, with the central dense overcast getting larger
and some outer banding forming in the western semicircle.
Satellite intensity estimates currently range between 30-45 kt, and
based on this and the increasing organization the initial intensity 
is set at 45 kt. A NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft is currently 
enroute to investigate Milton.
 
Milton has turned eastward with the initial motion of 090/4 kt. 
Westerly flow on the south side of a shortwave trough over the 
northern Gulf of Mexico should steer the storm generally eastward 
during the next 36-48 h.  After that, a second trough moving over 
the northwestern Gulf should cause the storm to turn northeastward 
toward the Florida Peninsula at a faster forward speed.  While the 
track guidance is generally in good agreement on this scenario, 
there remains some spread in both the track and forward speed, so it 
is too early to specify which portions of the Florida Peninsula will 
get the worst impacts.  After crossing Florida, Milton should turn 
eastward over the Atlantic in the mid-latitude westerly flow.  The 
new forecast track is nudged a little south of the previous track 
and lies between the GFS and ECMWF models. It should be noted that 
the average NHC track error at day 4 is around 150 miles.  
Therefore, users are reminded to not focus on the exact track.
 
The intensity forecast has a lot of complexities. First, Milton is a 
small cyclone, and such systems can both strengthen and weaken very 
rapidly. Second, while the cyclone is going to be in a favorable 
environment through about 60 h, it will encounter strong shear and 
dry air entrainment after that time.  Third, the proximity of a 
frontal system over the northern Gulf of Mexico and Florida suggests 
the possibility that Milton will undergo extratropical transition at 
some point during the forecast period. The intensity guidance 
continues to show a significant spread in the forecast peak 
intensity in 60-72 h, with possibilities ranging from category 1 to 
category 5 strength. Also, some of the intensity guidance forecasts 
Milton to rapidly weaken over water after peak intensity, while 
other models suggest the storm will only weaken slightly.  The new 
intensity forecast follows the trend of the guidance and shows 
Milton reaching a peak intensity of 105 kt at 72 h. However, this is 
below the intensity consensus, and it would not be surprising if the 
storm gets stronger.  Milton is expected to weaken and start 
extratropical transition while over Florida, with the transition 
completed by 120 h.
 
Regardless of the details, there is increasing confidence that a
powerful hurricane with life-threatening hazards will be affecting
portions of the Florida west coast around the middle of this week.
Residents there should closely monitor this system and listen
to local officials.
 
 
Key Messages:
1.  Milton is forecast to quickly intensify while it moves
eastward to northeastward across the Gulf of Mexico and be at or
near major hurricane strength when it reaches the west coast of the
Florida Peninsula mid week.  Hurricane Watches could be issued as
early as late today for portions of Florida.
 
2.  There is an increasing risk of life-threatening storm surge and
wind impacts for portions of the west coast of the Florida
Peninsula beginning late Tuesday or Wednesday. Residents in these
areas should ensure they have their hurricane plan in place, follow
any advice given by local officials, and check back for updates to
the forecast.
 
3. Areas of heavy rainfall will impact portions of Florida Sunday
and Monday well ahead of Milton, with heavy rainfall more directly
related to the system expected later on Tuesday through Wednesday
night. This rainfall brings the risk of flash, urban, and areal
flooding, along with minor to moderate river flooding.
