DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located
near latitude 37.0 North, longitude 46.2 West. Kirk is moving toward
the north-northeast near 23 mph (37 km/h). A turn toward the 
northeast is expected tonight. An acceleration toward the 
east-northeast or east is expected by Monday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Although gradual weakening is expected over the next few 
days and Kirk is expected to become post-tropical on Monday, it will 
remain a large cyclone with a large wind field through the early 
part of this week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 300
miles (480 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 961 mb (28.38 inches).

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
500 PM AST Sun Oct 06 2024

Satellite imagery suggests that Kirk has begun the process 
of extratropical transition.  Most of the convection is 
located on the north side of the low-level center due to strong 
south-southwesterly wind shear.  Subjective Dvorak estimates from 
SAB and TAFB range from 65-75 kt, while the latest objective 
intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS range from 65-80 kt.  The 
intensity has been lowered to 75 kt for this advisory.  ASCAT data 
from earlier this morning necessitated an increase in the initial 
wind radii, showing that Kirk is a very large hurricane.

There have been no significant changes to the track reasoning.  A 
narrow mid- to upper-level ridge east of Kirk will weaken over the 
next 24-36 h, allowing Kirk to turn east-northeastward or eastward 
within the zonal mid-latitude westerly flow.  The new NHC track 
forecast lies nearly on top of the previous NHC track, although the 
new track is a bit slower.  This track is relatively close to the 
TVCA and a bit slower than the HCCA corrected consensus guidance.  
The NHC forecast shows Kirk passing north of the Azores Monday night 
and Tuesday as an extratropical cyclone, and should reach western 
Europe late Wednesday, where it could bring gale force winds.

Kirk is forecast to continue to gradually weaken as it reaches 
cooler waters by tonight.  Additionally, the southwesterly vertical 
wind shear is forecast to increase significantly over the system by 
early Monday morning.  Global models show the development of frontal 
features on Monday, and extratropical transition has been moved up 
to 24 h in the latest official forecast.  Despite gradual weakening 
as Kirk becomes post-tropical, the cyclone is expected to remain a 
large and powerful cyclone until it reaches the coast of western 
Europe.  Therefore, the system will continue to spread very large 
swells across a large portion of the North Atlantic Ocean for a few 
more days.  The latest NHC intensity forecast is at the high end of 
the guidance during the extratropical portion of the forecast, in 
best agreement with the GFS and ECMWF global models.  By early 
Thursday, the cyclone will become elongated over western Europe, and 
the latest NHC forecast shows dissipation in 96 h.

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 PM AST Sun Oct 06 2024
 
Leslie's satellite imagery has become a little more ragged as 
southwesterly shear has disrupted the overall convective pattern. 
The deep inner core convection has become a little more broken the 
last few hours. Subjective and objective estimates range from 75 to 
85 kt, with a T4.5 from both TAFB and SAB. Based on these 
satellite estimates, the initial intensity is held at 80 kt.
 
Leslie is moving northwestward (310/8 kt) while being steered by a 
subtropical ridge over the eastern Atlantic. The ridge will continue 
to build to the northeast of the system, which should steer the 
hurricane northwestward throughout the forecast period. Models 
continue to be in good agreement, the NHC track forecast is very 
similar to the previous which remains near the latest consensus 
aids.
 
The hurricane has started to enter a more hostile environment. 
Southwesterly shear has started to increase, with drier mid-levels, 
and upper-level convergence along the forecast path. The latest NHC 
forecast follows the latest model trends with gradual weakening 
beginning on Monday. Since Leslie is a relatively small tropical 
cyclone, it could be more susceptible to these negative factors and 
weaken even faster than the NHC forecast later in the period, as 
suggested by some of the global and hurricane regional models.

NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
400 PM CDT Sun Oct 06 2024

...MILTON CONTINUING TO RAPIDLY INTENSIFY...
...HURRICANE WATCH ISSUED FOR THE NORTHERN COAST OF YUCATAN 
PENINSULA...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 400 PM CDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...22.4N 93.8W
ABOUT 275 MI...440 KM WNW OF PROGRESO MEXICO
ABOUT 805 MI...1295 KM WSW OF TAMPA FLORIDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...85 MPH...140 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...E OR 100 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...983 MB...29.03 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has issued a Hurricane Watch for the north 
coast of the Yucatan Peninsula from Celestun to Cabo Catoche and a 
Tropical Storm Warning from east of Cabo Catoche to Cancun.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Celestun to Cabo Catoche
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Celestun to Cancun
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests in the remainder of the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, the
Florida Peninsula, the Florida Keys, and the northwestern Bahamas
should monitor the progress of this system.
 
Storm Surge and Hurricane Watches will likely be issued for portions 
of Florida tonight or early Monday.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Milton was located
near latitude 22.4 North, longitude 93.8 West. Milton is moving
toward the east near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general motion is 
expected today. An eastward to east-northeastward motion is 
forecast on Monday, followed by a faster northeastward motion on 
Tuesday and Wednesday.  On the forecast track, Milton is forecast 
to move just north of the Yucatan Peninsula and across the southern 
Gulf of Mexico Monday and Tuesday and approach the west coast of 
the Florida Peninsula by Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts.   Milton is forecast to rapidly intensify during
the next couple of days and become a major hurricane on Monday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 983 mb (29.03 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Hurricane Milton can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml

STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 2 
to 4 feet above ground level along the northern coast of the 
Yucatan Peninsula in areas of onshore flow.  Near the coast, the 
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.

RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches, with localized totals 
up to 15 inches, are expected across portions of the Florida 
Peninsula and the Keys through Wednesday night. This rainfall brings 
the risk of considerable flash, urban, and areal flooding, along 
with the potential for moderate to major river flooding.

Milton will also produce rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches across 
portions of the northern Yucatan Peninsula.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero. 
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin as early as 
Monday morning in the warning area, and hurricane conditions are 
possible beginning Monday afternoon.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the system are affecting the coast of the 
southwestern Gulf of Mexico today.  These swells are expected to 
spread northward and eastward along much of the Gulf Coast within 
the next day or two, and are likely to cause life-threatening surf 
and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local 
weather office.

<title>Hurricane Milton Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Hurricane Milton Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
400 PM CDT Sun Oct 06 2024
 
Milton is rapidly intensifying.  Satellite images indicate very
deep convection in the eyewall and hints of an eye starting to
appear.  The last fix from the aircraft showed that the
central pressure was down to 985 mb, about 3 mb less than 80
minutes prior, and winds supporting 70 kt at the surface.  Since
that time, satellite images continue to show further organization,
and the initial wind speed is set to 75 kt.
 
Milton is moving just south of due east at about 6 kt.  This
equatorward motion has been more than expected probably due to a
stronger low/ mid-level frontal low over the northeastern Gulf of 
Mexico. The frontal feature is forecast to weaken while it moves 
across Florida and gradually lose its influence on Milton.  This 
evolution should allow the hurricane to turn eastward on Monday and 
then accelerate to the northeast on Tuesday and Wednesday toward the 
Florida Peninsula ahead of a trough moving offshore of Texas.  The 
NHC forecast is a bit south of the previous one through 48 hours, 
following the trend of the guidance at that time, and the government 
of Mexico has issued a Hurricane Watch for a portion of the northern 
coast of Yucatan.  Later on, the guidance is similar to, or slightly 
north of the last cycle, and very little change is made to the 
forecast near Florida. It should be noted that the average NHC track 
error at day 3 is around 100 miles, and users should not focus on 
the exact track.
 
The intensity forecast appears straightforward at first, with rapid 
intensification likely while the small hurricane remains within 
light shear and over very deep warm waters.  Intensity guidance is 
about as bullish as I've seen in this part of the basin, with 
almost everything showing a peak intensity of category 4 or 5 in 
the southern Gulf of Mexico in a day or two.  The NHC forecast is 
raised from the previous one and lies near the intensity consensus 
model and still could be too low.  Later on, vertical wind shear is
forecast to markedly increase as Milton approaches Florida, and 
some weakening is anticipated.  However, the regional hurricane 
models are showing the system growing even if it weakens, and we are 
expecting Milton to be a large hurricane at landfall, with very 
dangerous impacts spread out over a big area. There is increasing 
confidence that a powerful hurricane with life- threatening hazards 
will be affecting portions of the Florida west coast around the 
middle of this week. Residents there should closely monitor this 
system and listen to local officials.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Milton is forecast to be a major hurricane when it reaches the 
west coast of the Florida Peninsula midweek. Users are reminded to 
not focus on the details of the forecast as there remains 
significant uncertainty in the eventual track and intensity of 
Milton. 

2. While it is too soon to specify the exact magnitude and location 
of the greatest impacts, there is an increasing risk of life- 
threatening storm surge and damaging winds for portions of the west 
coast of the Florida Peninsula beginning early Wednesday and Storm 
Surge and Hurricane Watches will likely be issued tonight or early 
Monday.  Residents in the Florida Peninsula should follow any advice 
given by local officials and monitor updates to the forecast. 

3. Areas of heavy rainfall will impact portions of Florida through 
Monday well ahead of Milton, with heavy rainfall more directly 
related to Milton expected on Tuesday through Wednesday night. This 
rainfall will bring the risk of considerable flash, urban, and areal 
flooding, along with the potential for moderate to major river 
flooding.

4. Tropical storm conditions are expected with hurricane conditions 
possible beginning Monday across portions of the northern Yucatan 
Peninsula of Mexico where a Tropical Storm Warning and Hurricane 
Watch are in effect.
