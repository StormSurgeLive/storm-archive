Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Tue Oct 8 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Leslie, located over the central tropical Atlantic Ocean, and <br/>
on Hurricane Milton, located over the southern Gulf of Mexico. <br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
A non-tropical area of low pressure located just northeast of the <br/>
northwestern Bahamas is producing gale-force winds.  This system <br/>
could acquire some tropical or subtropical characteristics over the <br/>
next day or so while the low moves northeastward to east- <br/>
northeastward around 15 mph.  Upper-level winds are likely to <br/>
increase by Wednesday night, which should end any chances for <br/>
further development.  Additional information on this system, <br/>
including gale warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued <br/>
by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa in <br/>
a day or two.  Afterward, environmental conditions appear only <br/>
marginally favorable for some limited development of this system <br/>
while it moves westward or west-northwestward across the eastern <br/>
tropical Atlantic, moving near the Cabo Verde Islands late Thursday <br/>
through Friday. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
<br/>
High Seas Forecasts are issued by the National Weather Service <br/>
under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1 and WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online <br/>

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 PM AST Tue Oct 08 2024

Leslie appears to have made a bit of a comeback today.  A couple of 
fortuitous microwave images from the past few hours show a closed 
eyewall.  The latest subjective Dvorak classifications from TAFB and 
SAB range from 55-77 kt, and recent objective estimates range from 
65-74 kt.  The microwave passes, the objective intensity estimates, 
and the TAFB current intensity number all suggest that Leslie is a 
hurricane.  Therefore, the initial intensity is bumped back up to 
65 kt.

The initial motion estimate is northwestward, or 305/12.  A gradual 
turn to the north is expected in a day or two as Leslie rounds the 
southwestern and western side of a subtropical ridge.  After that, 
as Leslie gains latitude late this week, the cyclone will 
increasingly come under the influence of the mid-latitude 
westerlies, causing a turn toward the northeast.  Very minor changes 
have been made to the official track forecast, which lies near the 
various consensus guidance.

Leslie is forecast to remain in an environment of very weak vertical 
wind shear for another 24-36 h.  Given the closed eyewall observed 
on recent microwave images, Leslie may be able to prevent dry 
environmental air from entraining into its inner-core during that 
time.  Leslie will be traveling over Kirk's cold wake over the next 
day or so, which will limit the instability.  The hurricane should 
remain fairly steady during this time, and the NHC forecast is near 
the high end of the intensity guidance during the first 24 h.  By 36 
h, models show Leslie running into a wall of strong northerly wind 
shear, which is forecast to cause Leslie to decouple and degenerate 
to a post-tropical cyclone by this weekend.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Milton was located
near latitude 22.7 North, longitude 87.5 West.  Milton wobbled
earlier today, but the longer-term motion is toward the
east-northeast near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A turn toward the northeast
with an increase in forward speed is expected to begin tonight and
continue through early Thursday.  A turn toward the east-northeast
and east is expected on Thursday and Friday.  On the forecast
track, the center of Milton will move across the eastern Gulf of
Mexico through Wednesday, make landfall along the west-central
coast of Florida Wednesday night, and move off the east coast of
Florida over the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday.
 
Satellite images indicate that maximum sustained winds have
increased to near 165 mph (270 km/h) with higher gusts.  Milton is a
category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.
Fluctuations in intensity are likely while Milton moves across the
eastern Gulf of Mexico, but Milton is expected to be a dangerous
major hurricane when it reaches the west-central coast of Florida
Wednesday night.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 918 mb (27.11 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Milton can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 2
to 4 feet above ground level along the northern coast of the
Yucatan Peninsula in areas of onshore winds.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Anclote River, FL to Englewood, FL...10-15 ft
Tampa Bay...10-15 ft
Englewood, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...8-12 ft
Charlotte Harbor...8-12 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...5-10 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...5-8 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...3-5 ft
Sebastian Inlet, FL to Altamaha Sound, GA...3-5 ft
Altamaha Sound, GA to Edisto Beach, SC...2-4 ft
Suwannee River, FL to Yankeetown, FL...2-4 ft
Dry Tortugas...2-4 ft
St. Johns River...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the south of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 6 to 12 inches, with localized totals
up to 18 inches, are expected across central to northern portions of
the Florida Peninsula through Thursday.  This rainfall brings the
risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding,
along with moderate to major river flooding.
 
Additional rainfall amounts of  2 to 4 inches, with isolated totals
around 6 inches, are expected across northern portions of the
Yucatan Peninsula.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue in the warning areas
in Mexico this evening.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area
across Florida beginning late Wednesday through early Thursday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the warning area
on the west coast of Florida around midday Wednesday, spreading
across the peninsula and reaching the east coast Wednesday evening.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
on the Georgia and South Carolina coasts on Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the extreme northwestern
Bahamas on Thursday.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible over central and southern
Florida beginning late tonight and continuing through early Thursday
morning.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Milton are expected to continue to
affect much of the Gulf Coast within the next day or two, and are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Milton Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
400 PM CDT Tue Oct 08 2024
 
The Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters found that Milton's central
pressure had fallen to 923 mb in the last pass they made through
the eye a few hours ago.  The satellite presentation has improved
since that time, with a thick ring of cold cloud tops surrounding a
10-mile-wide eye.  This pattern yielded a T7.0/140 kt from TAFB,
with several of the objective satellite estimates between 140 and
145 kt.  Milton has again become a category 5 hurricane, with
maximum winds estimated to be 145 kt.  Another Air Force mission is
entering Milton as we speak.
 
Milton wobbled a bit to the southeast today, but the longer-term
12-hour motion is east-northeastward (075/8 kt).  Milton is forecast
to turn northeastward and begin accelerating later today as it moves
between a trough digging into the Gulf of Mexico and a ridge near
the Greater Antilles.  Because of the wobble, the track guidance
has been initialized a bit to the south of where many of the raw
model fields think the hurricane was centered at 1800 UTC, and this
has caused the entire guidance envelope to shift a bit south on
this cycle.  It is still critical to remember that even at 36 hours
(around the time of potential landfall), NHC's track forecasts
can be off by an average of 60 n mi, which means we still can't
pinpoint an exact landfall location, especially if additional
wobbles occur in the short term.  After landfall, Milton is
forecast to cross Florida and emerge over the Atlantic waters on
Thursday.
 
Milton is expected to maintain major hurricane strength while it
moves across the Gulf of Mexico and approaches the west coast of
Florida.  Stronger vertical shear is expected to increase in about
24 hours, but even if this causes some weakening, it will likely not
be enough to keep Milton from being an extremely dangerous hurricane
when it reaches shore.  Additionally, the first stages of
extratropical transition may be just underway as Milton is reaching
the coast, which could impart some baroclinic energy and slow the
rate of weakening.  The NHC intensity forecast is close to the top
end of the model envelope, which includes the GFS and ECMWF models,
since these models should have a better handle on a potential
positive trough interaction.
 
Milton's wind field is expected to expand as it approaches Florida.
In fact, the official forecast shows the hurricane and
tropical-storm-force winds roughly doubling in size by the time it
makes landfall.  In addition, the stronger-than-normal winds could
occur on the northwest/back side of the storm since Milton will be
interacting with a frontal boundary and beginning extratropical
transition.  Damaging winds, life-threatening storm surge, and heavy
rainfall will extend well outside the forecast cone.  This is a
very serious situation and residents in Florida should closely
follow orders from their local emergency management officials.
Evacuations and other preparations should be completed today.
Milton has the potential to be one of the most destructive
hurricanes on record for west-central Florida.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. A large area of destructive storm surge,  with highest
inundations of 10 ft or greater, is expected along a portion of the
west-central coast of the Florida Peninsula.  If you are in the
Storm Surge Warning area, this is an extremely life-threatening
situation, and you should evacuate today if ordered by local
officials.  There will likely not be enough time to wait to leave on
Wednesday.
 
2. Devastating hurricane-force winds are expected along portions of
the west coast of Florida, where a Hurricane Warning is in effect.
Milton is forecast to remain a hurricane as it crosses the Florida
Peninsula and life-threatening hurricane-force winds, especially in
gusts, are expected to spread inland across the peninsula.
Preparations to protect life and property, including being ready for
long-duration power outages, should be complete by tonight.
 
3. Heavy rainfall across the Florida Peninsula through Thursday
brings the risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban
flooding along with moderate to major river flooding, especially in
areas where coastal and inland flooding combine to increase the
overall flood threat.
 
4. Tropical storm conditions and a dangerous storm surge with
destructive waves will continue across portions of the northern
coast of the Yucatan Peninsula this evening.
