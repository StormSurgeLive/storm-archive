SUMMARY OF 900 AM GMT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...40.2N 41.0W
ABOUT 765 MI...1230 KM WNW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 50 DEGREES AT 30 MPH...48 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...966 MB...28.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the Azores should monitor the progress of Kirk.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM GMT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kirk was located
near latitude 40.2 North, longitude 41.0 West. Kirk is moving toward
the northeast near 30 mph (48 km/h).  An even faster 
east-northeastward motion is expected during the next couple of 
days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Although gradual weakening is expected, Kirk is forecast to
become a large and strong extratropical low during the next couple
of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310
miles (500 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 966 mb (28.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kirk are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Bermuda, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, the east coast of the
United States, portions of Atlantic Canada, and the Azores. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Kirk Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122024
900 AM GMT Mon Oct 07 2024
 
Kirk has almost completed extratropical transition.  The inner core
of the system has basically collapsed and deep convection is
limited to the northern half of the circulation.  The system is
moving into a baroclinic zone, and it is expected to be an
extratropical cyclone later today.  The initial intensity is nudged
downward to 65 kt based on a blend of the latest satellite 
intensity estimates.
 
Strong shear, dry air, cool waters, and a decrease in upper-level
dynamics should cause Kirk to gradually lose strength.  However, the
system's wind field will remain large and Kirk is still expected to
be a strong extratropical low during the next couple of days.  The
intensity forecast is in good agreement with the latest GFS
solution.
 
Kirk is gradually turning to the right, and the latest initial
motion is 050/26 kt.  A turn to the east-northeast with an
increase in forward speed is expected during the next couple of days
as the system moves within the fast mid-latitude westerly flow.
This should take the extratropical low to the north of the Azores on
Tuesday and across western Europe on Wednesday.
 
Although Kirk is over the open ocean, it is still producing large
swells that could lead to life-threatening rip currents across
portions of the Caribbean, Bermuda, the east coast of the U.S., and
Atlantic Canada.

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 AM AST Mon Oct 07 2024
 
Conventional satellite imagery indicates that Leslie's cloud
pattern has changed little during the past few hours.  A fortuitous
SSMIS microwave image revealed a compact inner core with the
eyewall partially open in the south side.  Most of the
convective curve bands remain confined to the north side of the
cyclone.  The TAFB and SAB subjective and the UW-CIMSS objective
satellite intensity estimates support holding the initial intensity
at 80 kt for this advisory.
 
Although the statistical GFS/ECMWF SHIPS intensity models
indicate a low-shear surrounding environment through the 60 hr 
period, the global model forecast sounding reveals 15-20 kt of 
400-250 mb mid-tropospheric westerly shear undercutting the 
diffluent flow aloft.  This mid-level disrupting flow could force 
the drier, stable air identified in the water vapor imagery into 
Leslie's deep convective core.  This negative thermodynamic 
contribution, along with gradually decreasing oceanic surface 
temperatures ahead of the cyclone's predicted path should cause 
Leslie to weaken through the period.  The ECMWF and GFS model 
simulated infrared forecast now indicates that Leslie will lose its 
organized convection within inhibiting environmental conditions and 
become a post-tropical cyclone by day 5, and the NHC intensity 
forecast follows suit.
 
Based on the above-mentioned microwave pass, the initial motion is 
estimated to be northwestward, or 315/11 kt, just a little left of 
the previous track.  Leslie is expected to move around the
southwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge to the northeast of
the cyclone and turn gradually north-northwestward to northward 
toward the end of the week.  The official forecast is an update of 
the previous one and closely follows the various consensus aids.
 
Leslie's wind radii were adjusted based on an earlier CSA/RCM-3 SAR
overpass.

A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests in the remainder of the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, the
Florida Peninsula, the Florida Keys, and the northwestern Bahamas
should monitor the progress of this system. Additional watches and
warnings will likely be issued later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Milton was located
near latitude 22.1 North, longitude 92.6 West. Milton is moving
toward the east-southeast near 8 mph (13 km/h).  An eastward to
east-southeastward motion is forecast through tonight, followed by a
turn toward the east and northeast on Tuesday and Wednesday.  On the
forecast track, Milton is forecast to move near or just north of 
the Yucatan Peninsula today and Tuesday, then cross the eastern 
Gulf of Mexico and approach the west coast of the Florida Peninsula 
by Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are now near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Milton is forecast to intensify rapidly and become a major
hurricane later today.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 972 mb (28.71 inches).

Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 2
to 4 feet above ground level along the northern coast of the
Yucatan Peninsula in areas of onshore winds.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.

The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause 
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters 
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the 
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if 
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Anclote River, FL to Englewood, FL...8-12 ft
Tampa Bay...8-12 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Anclote River, FL...5-10 ft
Englewood, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...5-10 ft
Charlotte Harbor...5-10 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...4-7 ft
Suwannee River, FL to Yankeetown, FL...3-5 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the south of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding 
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, 
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.

For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge 
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm 
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches, with localized totals 
up to 15 inches, are expected across portions of the Florida 
Peninsula and the Keys through Wednesday night. This rainfall brings 
the risk of considerable flash, urban, and areal flooding, along 
with the potential for moderate to major river flooding.

Milton will also produce rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches across 
portions of the northern Yucatan Peninsula..

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero. 
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the warning area in 
Mexico beginning late today or tonight, with tropical storm 
conditions expected to begin as early as this morning. Hurricane 
conditions are possible in the watch area in Mexico beginning 
tonight and Tuesday, and tropical storm conditions are expected in 
the tropical storm warning area beginning later today. Hurricane 
conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch area in Florida on 
Wednesday, and tropical storm conditions are possible in the 
Tropical Storm Watch area on Wednesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the system are affecting the coast of the
southwestern Gulf of Mexico.  These swells are expected to spread
northward and eastward along much of the Gulf Coast within the next
day or two, and are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.

<title>Hurricane Milton Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Hurricane Milton Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
400 AM CDT Mon Oct 07 2024

Milton continues to produce a central dense overcast with 
cloud tops colder than -80C, and since the last advisory a small 
ragged eye has been present. Satellite intensity estimates have 
increased to the 80-100 kt range, and based on this the initial 
intensity is raised to 85 kt.

The center has nudged a little southward over the past several 
hours, and the initial motion is now 105/7 kt.  Milton is moving 
within the southern portion of a broad mid-level trough over the 
Gulf of Mexico, and is also being influenced by the flow on the 
southwest side of a low pressure area over the eastern Gulf of 
Mexico.  The global models suggest the mid-level trough and surface 
low should move eastward into the Atlantic during the next 48 h, 
with a second mid- to upper-level trough digging into the 
northwestern Gulf of Mexico.  This evolution should cause Milton to 
move east-southeastward to eastward for the next 36 h or so, 
followed by a turn toward the northeast at a faster forward speed. 
The track guidance is in good agreement that the hurricane will 
cross the Florida Peninsula, but there remains significant 
differences in both the location and timing of landfall. The UKMET 
is fastest and farthest to the east, the GFS is slower and much 
farther north, and the Canadian being the slowest and keeping the 
storm offshore more than 24 h longer than the other models.  The 
new forecast track calls for the center to reach the Florida west 
coast between 60-72 h in best agreement with the ECMWF and the 
multimodel consensus. It should be noted that the average NHC track 
error at day 3 is around 100 miles, and users should not focus
on the exact track.  After landfall, Milton should turn more 
eastward as it becomes extratropical.

For the first 36 h or so, Milton should be on an environment of 
moderate shear over warm sea surface temperatures.  Thus, steady to 
rapid intensification is expected, and the intensity forecast 
continues to call for the cyclone to become a category 4 hurricane. 
After 36 h, Milton is expected to encounter a much less favorable 
environment with strong shear and dry air entrainment. Therefore, 
some weakening is anticipated before the hurricane reaches the 
Florida Gulf coast.  However, the system is still likely to be a 
large and powerful hurricane at landfall in Florida, with 
life-threatening hazards along portions of the the coastline.  After 
landfall, Milton should weaken and start extratropical transition, 
which should be complete by 96 h.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane conditions are expected across portions of the northern 
coast of the Yucatan Peninsula.  A dangerous storm surge with 
damaging waves is also likely along portions of the coast of the 
northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula. 

2. There is an increasing risk of life-threatening storm surge and 
damaging winds for portions of the west coast of the Florida 
Peninsula beginning Tuesday night or early Wednesday.  Storm Surge 
and Hurricane Watches are now in effect for portions of the west 
coast of the Florida Peninsula and residents in that area should 
follow any advice given by local officials and evacuate if told to 
do so. 

3. Areas of heavy rainfall will impact portions of Florida today 
well ahead of Milton, with heavy rainfall more directly related to 
the system expected later on Tuesday through Wednesday night. This 
rainfall will bring the risk of considerable flash, urban, and 
areal flooding, along with the potential for moderate to major 
river flooding.
