Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Mon Oct 7 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Leslie, located over the central tropical Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
Hurricane Milton, located over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. <br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
An elongated area of low pressure located across portions of South <br/>
Florida, the Florida Straits, and the northwestern Bahamas is <br/>
expected to move northeastward into the southwestern Atlantic by <br/>
tomorrow. Some additional tropical or subtropical development is <br/>
possible while the low moves northeastward to east-northeastward <br/>
around 15 mph. However, upper-level winds are likely to increase by <br/>
Wednesday, which should limit any further development after that <br/>
time.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Far Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa in <br/>
a couple days. Afterward, environmental conditions appear only <br/>
marginally favorable for some limited development of this system <br/>
while it moves westward or west-northwestward across the eastern <br/>
tropical Atlantic, crossing the Cabo Verde Islands on Thursday or <br/>
early Friday. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
500 PM AST Mon Oct 07 2024
 
Leslie's convective organization continues to become a little less 
organized this afternoon, although deep convection has persisted 
over the center with cloud tops near -80C. A recent AMSR2 microwave 
pass shows that the inner core has deteriorated from imagery earlier 
today. Subjective and objective Dvorak estimates range from 60 to 75 
kt. Using a blend of these estimates, the initial intensity for this 
advisory is set to 70 kt.
 
The system is moving northwestward, or 315/12 kt. The hurricane is 
rounding the edge of a subtropical ridge over the central/east 
Atlantic. The system should continue to move northwestward with a 
gradual turn more north-northwestward then northward by the end of 
the forecast period. The NHC track forecast is slightly faster than 
the previous forecast and was adjusted slightly to the right towards 
the latest consensus aids.
 
Leslie will remain in a marginal environment for the next day or 
two, with warm sea surface temperatures and low to moderate wind 
shear. However, the system is entering a much drier air mass. Beyond 
48 h, shear will also increase as the mid-levels will continue to be 
dry. Intensity guidance is in fairly good agreement with gradual 
then steady weakening throughout the forecast period. The NHC 
intensity forecast follows these weakening trends and lies near the 
model consensus. Model simulated satellite imagery depicts that by 
day 4, the shear and drier air will cause Leslie to lose convection 
and the system is forecast to become a post-tropical remnant low at 
that time.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Milton was located
near latitude 21.9 North, longitude 90.4 West.  Milton is moving
toward the east near 10 mph (17 km/h).  This general motion is
expected through tonight followed by a turn toward the east-
northeast and northeast on Tuesday and Wednesday.  On the forecast
track, the center of Milton is forecast to move near or just north
of the Yucatan Peninsula tonight and Tuesday, then cross the eastern
Gulf of Mexico and approach the west coast of the Florida Peninsula
on Wednesday.
 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the maximum sustained winds 
remain near 180 mph (285 km/h) with higher gusts.  Milton is a 
potentially catastrophic category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  While fluctuations in intensity are expected, 
Milton is forecast to remain an extremely dangerous hurricane 
through landfall in Florida.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80
miles (130 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft observations is 897 mb (26.49 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Milton can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 4
to 6 feet above ground level along the northern coast of the
Yucatan Peninsula in areas of onshore winds.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Anclote River, FL to Englewood, FL...10-15 ft
Tampa Bay...10-15 ft
Englewood, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...6-10 ft
Charlotte Harbor...6-10 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Anclote River, FL...5-10 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...4-7 ft
Suwannee River, FL to Yankeetown, FL...3-5 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL to Altamaha Sound, GA...3-5 ft
Sebastian Inlet, FL to Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL...2-4 ft
Altamaha Sound, GA to Edisto Beach, SC...2-4 ft
Dry Tortugas...2-4 ft
St. Johns River...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the south of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches, with localized totals
up to 15 inches, are expected across portions of the Florida
Peninsula through Thursday. This rainfall brings the risk of
considerable flash, urban, and areal flooding, along with the
potential for moderate to major river flooding.
 
Milton will also produce rainfall totals 4 to 7 inches across the
Florida Keys through Thursday. In addition, rainfall amounts of
2 to 4 inches with isolated totals around 6 inches are expected
across northern portions of the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the warning area in 
Mexico within a few hours, with tropical storm conditions currently 
occurring.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the watch areas in 
Mexico beginning tonight and Tuesday, and tropical storm conditions 
are expected in the tropical storm warning area beginning tonight.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in the warning area on the west 
coast of Florida as early as Wednesday afternoon, with tropical 
storm conditions beginning early Wednesday.  Hurricane conditions 
could begin along the east coast of Florida in the watch areas on 
Wednesday night, with tropical storm conditions possible beginning 
Wednesday afternoon.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the 
tropical storm warning areas in Florida beginning early Wednesday 
and will spread northward through the day. Tropical storm conditions 
are possible within the watch area on the east coast of Florida by 
Wednesday night and along the Georgia and South Carolina coasts on 
Thursday. 
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Milton are expected to continue to
affect much of the Gulf Coast within the next day or two, and are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Milton Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
400 PM CDT Mon Oct 07 2024
 
Satellite images indicate that Milton is quite a powerful hurricane.
The small eye has become even more distinct than earlier today, and
radar data from Sabancuy show a small, closed eye with a very 
strong eyewall presentation.  On the last fix before the plane
departed a few hours ago, the Air Force Hurricane Hunter crew
reported that the pressure had fallen to 911 mb, which is 77 mb
lower than yesterday at the same time, with other data to support
150 kt.  Since the satellite imagery continues to show
intensification, the initial wind speed is set to 155 kt, and a pair
of Hurricane Hunters should be in the area this evening for more 
information.

The hurricane is moving eastward at about 9 kt.  Milton should move 
close to the northern portion of Yucatan Peninsula tonight and early 
Tuesday ahead of a mid-level trough dropping into the northwestern 
Gulf of Mexico.  This feature should then cause Milton to move 
east-northeastward to northeastward at a faster forward speed 
later on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Little change was made to the 
previous forecast, with the latest model guidance very close to the 
previous forecast cycle, and this forecast remains close to a 
consensus of the latest GFS, ECMWF and regional hurricane models. 
Note that this track is closer to the model fields rather than the 
model trackers which appear to be too far south.

Milton could strengthen even more tonight with light shear and 
very warm waters providing a conducive environment.  However, radar 
data indicate that Milton could be at the beginning of an eyewall 
replacement cycle, with some signs of a moat and a partial outer 
eyewall.  The evolution will likely cause the system to gradually 
weaken on Tuesday but grow larger.  On Wednesday, Milton is expected 
to encounter a less favorable environment with strong shear and dry 
air entrainment, with further weakening forecast.  Regardless, the 
system is expected to be a large and powerful hurricane at landfall 
in Florida, with life-threatening hazards at the coastline and well 
inland.  Residents in Florida should closely follow the orders from 
their local emergency management officials, as Milton has the 
potential to be one of the most destructive hurricanes on record 
for west-central Florida.

 
Key Messages:

1. Damaging hurricane-force winds and a life-threatening storm surge 
with destructive waves are expected across portions of the northern 
coast of the Yucatan Peninsula through tonight.   

2. Milton is expected to grow in size and remain an extremely 
dangerous hurricane when it approaches the west coast of Florida on 
Wednesday. A large area of destructive storm surge will occur along 
parts of the west coast of Florida on Wednesday.  This is an 
extremely life-threatening situation and residents in those areas 
should follow advice given by local officials and evacuate 
immediately if told to do so.
  
3. Potentially devastating hurricane-force winds are expected along 
portions of the west coast of Florida where a Hurricane Warning is 
in effect.  Milton is forecast to remain a hurricane as it crosses 
the Florida Peninsula and life-threatening hurricane-force winds, 
especially in gusts, are expected to spread inland across a portion 
of the entire Florida Peninsula.  Preparations to protect life and 
property in the warning areas should be complete by Tuesday night 
since tropical storm conditions are expected to begin within this 
area early Wednesday. 

4. Areas of heavy rainfall will impact portions of Florida today 
well ahead of Milton, with heavy rainfall more directly related to 
the system expected later on Tuesday through Wednesday night. This 
rainfall will bring the risk of considerable flash, urban, and areal 
flooding, along with the potential for moderate to major river 
flooding.
