Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Wed Oct 9 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Leslie, located over the central subtropical Atlantic Ocean, and on <br/>
Hurricane Milton, located over the southern Gulf of Mexico. <br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic (AL93):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a gale-force non-tropical <br/>
low pressure system located northeast of the northwestern Bahamas <br/>
continue to become better organized.  Although environmental <br/>
conditions appear only marginally favorable for additional <br/>
development, a short-lived tropical or subtropical storm could form <br/>
today or this evening while the low moves northeastward to <br/>
east-northeastward at around 15 mph.  Upper-level winds are forecast <br/>
to increase later tonight, which should limit any chances for <br/>
further development.  Additional information on this system, <br/>
including gale warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued <br/>
by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa in <br/>
the next couple of days.  Afterward, environmental conditions appear <br/>
only marginally favorable for some limited development of this <br/>
system while it moves westward or west-northwestward across the <br/>
eastern tropical Atlantic and through the Cabo Verde Islands late <br/>
Thursday into Friday. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>

Hurricane Leslie Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132024
1100 PM AST Tue Oct 08 2024

This evening, Leslie's structure has improved further as deep 
convection can be seen wrapping around the center on GOES-16 
infrared imagery. An earlier ISS-COWVR microwave pass at 2021 UTC 
also showed a small inner-core eyewall feature. Subjective Dvorak 
fixes from TAFB and SAB were both T4.0/65-kt, but objective 
estimates from ADT and SATCON have jumped up to 79 and 74 kt 
respectively, and thus the initial intensity is raised to 70 kt, in 
between the subjective and objective estimates.

One thing that hasn't changed is Leslie's current motion, still off 
to the northwest at 310/10 kt. Over the next couple of days, Leslie 
will be approaching the westward extent of the subtropical ridge 
that has been its primary steering mechanism, resulting in a gradual 
slow down and turn northward by the end of this week. Leslie is then 
expected to be captured by an approaching long-wave trough, leading 
to a northeastward motion by the end of the forecast period. The NHC 
track continues to be in good agreement with the track guidance, and 
is just a touch west compared to the prior forecast.

Leslie's intensity prospects in the short-term have undergone a 
reversal from yesterday. The shear that had been affecting the 
hurricane has subsided, and SHIPS guidance now shows deep-layer 
shear reaming under 10 kt for at least the next 24 hours. Even 
though Leslie has been traveling over a cooler ocean left behind 
from Kirk last week, the sea-surface temperatures still appear to be 
warm enough (27-28 C) to promote intensification, as evidence of its 
continued deep convective bursts which have helped reform its inner 
core. The intensity guidance has responded to these changes by now 
showing more intensification. In fact, the raw 18 UTC HAFS-A/B runs 
now show intensification up to 80-85 kt in 36 hours. In addition, 
the latest ECMWF run, not usually known for being at the upper-end 
of the intensity guidance, shows significant deepening in the 
short-term, with a forecast pressure down to 969 mb by early 
Thursday morning. Based on these signals, the intensity guidance was 
raised upward significantly in the short term, and now shows Leslie 
peaking as an 80 kt hurricane in 24-36 hours. After that time, a 
large upper-level anticyclone approaching from the northwest 
(partially related to outflow from both AL93 and Milton) should lead 
to an abrupt increase in northerly shear. Thus, rapid weakening is 
still anticipated beyond that time, and Leslie still appears likely 
to become a post-tropical cyclone in about 3 days, as its convection 
is stripped away by the shear. The intensity forecast is on the 
upper-end of the guidance over the first 36 h, but falls back to the 
guidance mean by the end of the forecast period.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Milton was located 
near latitude 23.8 North, longitude 86.0 West.  Milton is moving 
toward the northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A northeastward motion 
with some increase in forward speed is expected through tonight.  A 
turn toward the east-northeast and east is expected on Thursday and 
Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of Milton will move 
across the eastern Gulf of Mexico today, make landfall along the 
west-central coast of Florida late tonight or early Thursday 
morning, and move off the east coast of Florida over the Atlantic 
Ocean Thursday afternoon.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 160 mph (260 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Milton is a category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Fluctuations in intensity are likely while
Milton moves across the eastern Gulf of Mexico, but Milton is
expected to be a dangerous major hurricane when it reaches the
west-central coast of Florida.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140
miles (220 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Hurricane Hunter
aircraft observations is 914 mb (26.99 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Milton can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Egmont Key, FL to Boca Grande, FL...10-15 ft
Tampa Bay...10-15 ft
Anclote River, FL to Egmont Key, FL...9-13 ft
Boca Grande, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...8-12 ft
Charlotte Harbor...8-12 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...5-8 ft
Aripeka, FL to Anclote River, FL...5-8 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to Flamingo, FL...3-5 ft
Sebastian Inlet, FL to Altamaha Sound, GA...3-5 ft
Altamaha Sound, GA to Edisto Beach, SC...2-4 ft
Suwannee River, FL to Aripeka, FL...2-4 ft
Dry Tortugas...2-4 ft
St. Johns River...2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the south of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm
Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 6 to 12 inches, with localized totals
up to 18 inches, are expected across central to northern portions of
the Florida Peninsula through Thursday.  This rainfall brings the
risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding,
along with moderate to major river flooding.
 
Additional rainfall amounts of  2 to 4 inches, with isolated totals
around 6 inches, are expected across northern portions of the
Yucatan Peninsula.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Milton, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning 
area across Florida beginning this evening through early Thursday 
and are possible in the hurricane watch area on Thursday. Tropical 
storm conditions are expected to begin in the warning area on the 
west coast of Florida around midday, spreading across the peninsula 
and reaching the east coast tonight. Tropical storm conditions are 
expected to begin in the warning area on the east coast of Florida 
tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the
northwestern Bahamas on Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
on the Georgia and South Carolina coasts on Thursday.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible over central and southern
Florida through Thursday night.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Milton are expected to continue to
affect much of the Gulf Coast during the next day or two, and are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Milton Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142024
1000 PM CDT Tue Oct 08 2024
 
NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft have been investigating
Milton again this evening, providing a number of center fixes,
flight-level wind data, dropsonde measurements, and other valuable
observations.  Data from the aircraft confirmed that the hurricane
had regained category 5 intensity, with maximum winds near 145 kt
and the central pressure as low as 902 mb. More recent aircraft
observations showed that the central pressure had risen somewhat, so
the advisory intensity is adjusted slightly down, to 140 kt.  This
is also consistent with the latest subjective Dvorak intensity
estimates from both TAFB and SAB.
 
Center fixes from the aircraft and satellite images indicate that
Milton's heading is gradually turning toward the left and the
initial motion estimate is now about 055/10 kt.  The system is being
steered by the flow between a trough digging over the Gulf of Mexico
and a ridge near the Greater Antilles.  Milton should move
northeastward on Wednesday with a slight increase in forward speed,
with the center of the hurricane reaching the Florida Gulf coast in
24 hours or so.  Thereafter, the system should turn
east-northeastward to eastward and move over the southwestern
Atlantic off the southeast U.S. coast.  The official track forecast
is very similar to the previous one, and is generally a little north
of the model trackers, but follows the actual model predicted
cyclone center locations.  This is close to a blend of the latest
GFS and ECMWF model solutions.  Again, it is critical to remember
that even at 24 hours out, it is still not possible to pinpoint an
an exact landfall location.
 
Milton is expected to maintain major hurricane strength while it
moves across the eastern Gulf of Mexico and approaches the west
coast of Florida.  Although an expected increase in vertical wind
shear should cause some weakening, Milton is expected to still be an
extremely dangerous major hurricane when it reaches shore.  Also,
the first stages of extratropical transition may be just underway as
Milton reaches the coast, which could impart some baroclinic energy
and slow the rate of weakening.  The NHC intensity forecast is near
the upper side of the intensity model guidance.  After Milton moves
over the Atlantic, the global models show the system becoming
embedded within a frontal zone, so the official forecast shows the
system becoming extratropical by 72 hours.
 
Milton's wind field is expected to grow considerably in size by the
time the center moves over Florida.  In addition, a large region of
tropical storm and hurricane force winds could occur on the
northwest/back side of the storm since Milton will be interacting
with a frontal boundary and beginning extratropical transition.
Damaging winds, life-threatening storm surge, and heavy rainfall
will extend well outside the forecast cone.  This is a very serious
situation and residents in Florida should closely follow orders from
their local emergency management officials.  Evacuations and other
preparations should be completed tonight.  Milton has the potential
to be one of the most destructive hurricanes on record for
west-central Florida.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. A large area of destructive storm surge, with highest inundations
of 10 ft or greater, is expected along a portion of the west-central
coast of the Florida Peninsula.  If you are in the Storm Surge
Warning area, this is an extremely life-threatening situation, and
you should evacuate as soon as possible if ordered by local
officials.  There will likely not be enough time to wait to leave on
Wednesday.
 
2. Devastating hurricane-force winds are expected along portions of
the west coast of Florida, where a Hurricane Warning is in effect.
Milton is forecast to remain a hurricane while it crosses the
Florida Peninsula and life-threatening hurricane-force winds,
especially in gusts, are expected to spread inland across the
peninsula.  Preparations to protect life and property, including
being ready for long-duration power outages, should be rushed to
completion.
 
3. Heavy rainfall across the Florida Peninsula through Thursday
brings the risk of catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban
flooding along with moderate to major river flooding, especially in
areas where coastal and inland flooding combine to increase the
overall flood threat.
