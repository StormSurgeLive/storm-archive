Hurricane Kristy Advisory Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
800 AM PDT Fri Oct 25 2024
 
...KRISTY WEAKENING...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM PDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.8N 124.8W
ABOUT 1085 MI...1750 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...125 MPH...205 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...952 MB...28.12 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM PDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kristy was located
near latitude 15.8 North, longitude 124.8 West. Kristy is moving
toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). A turn toward the
northwest is expected later today, and a northwestward to
north-northwestward motion at a slower forward speed is expected
over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Kristy is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Steady to rapid weakening is expected during 
the next few days, with Kristy expected to become a post-tropical 
cyclone on Sunday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles
(165 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 952 mb (28.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kristy will affect portions of the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula beginning today and
continuing into the weekend. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM PDT.

Hurricane Kristy Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
800 AM PDT Fri Oct 25 2024
 
Southerly to southwesterly wind shear is starting to take its toll
on Kristy as the system is losing organization. The eye has become
cloud filled during the last several hours, with the convective
pattern becoming more asymmetric. Deep convection continues to wrap
within the eyewall, although a recent AMSR2 microwave pass
depicts the inner core is starting to erode. Objective and
subjective intensity estimates have been decreasing steadily this
morning and range from 105-115 kt. Using a blend of these
estimates, the initial intensity for this advisory is set to 110 kt.
 
Kristy is moving toward the west-northwest with an estimated motion
of 300/12 kt. The system will move more northwestward to
north-northwestward for the next few days, steered along the
southwestern periphery of a ridge located over the eastern Pacific.
Towards the end of the period, as the system weakens and becomes a
remnant low, Kristy's forward speed will also decrease with a turn
toward the west-southwest within the low-level flow. The NHC
forecast is very near the previous one with a slight nudge
northward, towards the corrected and simple consensus track aids.
 
The environment along the forecast path of Kristy is only becoming
increasingly hostile. Vertical wind shear is forecast to continue to
rise, with cooling sea-surface temperatures and drier mid-levels of
the atmosphere. Thus, steady to rapid weakening is anticipated
through the forecast period. Model simulated satellite data depicts
that Kristy will struggle to produce convection late this
weekend, becoming a post-tropical cyclone in 60 h, and dissipating
into a trough by 96 h. The latest NHC intensity forecast follows
these model trends.
