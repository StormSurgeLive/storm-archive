<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Kristy, located over the western portion of the eastern Pacific <br/>
basin.<br/>
<br/>
Western East Pacific:<br/>
A large area of disturbed weather is located well to the southwest <br/>
of the southwestern coast of Mexico.  An area of low pressure could <br/>
form from this disturbance over the western part of the basin <br/>
during the early to middle part of next week, and environmental <br/>
conditions appear conducive for subsequent development while the <br/>
system moves westward or west-northwestward at about 15 mph.  This <br/>
system is expected to move into the central Pacific basin on <br/>
Wednesday or Thursday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>

BULLETIN
Hurricane Kristy Advisory Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
800 PM PDT Fri Oct 25 2024
 
...KRISTY WEAKENING RAPIDLY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 PM PDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.6N 126.9W
ABOUT 1160 MI...1865 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...105 MPH...165 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...968 MB...28.59 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM PDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kristy was located
near latitude 17.6 North, longitude 126.9 West.  Kristy is moving
toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h).  A northwestward or 
north-northwestward motion at a slower forward speed is expected 
through early Sunday, followed by a turn toward the west by late 
Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 105 mph (165 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Rapid weakening is expected to continue over 
the next couple of days, and Kristy is forecast to degenerate into 
a remnant low on Sunday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 968 mb (28.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kristy are affecting portions of the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula and will likely continue to
impact the region through the weekend. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM PDT.

<title>Hurricane Kristy Forecast Discussion Number 17</title>

Hurricane Kristy Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
200 PM PDT Fri Oct 25 2024
 
Latest satellite images continue to depict that Kristy is 
struggling within an increasingly hostile environment. The 
convective pattern has continued to become more asymmetric, as 
southerly vertical wind shear continues to increase, displacing most 
of the convection over the northern semicircle. The eyewall has 
weakened as well, with convective cloud tops warming. The inner core 
degradation was further confirmed by a recent GMI microwave pass. 
Subjective and objective intensity estimates continue to plummet 
this afternoon and range between 90-105 kt. Given the satellite 
presentation, inner structure degradation, and these estimates, the 
initial intensity is lowered to 100 kt for this advisory. 
 
Kristy is moving toward the northwest with an estimated motion of 
305/12 kt. The system will move northwestward to north-northwestward 
for the next couple of days, steered along the southwestern 
periphery of a ridge located over the eastern Pacific. Towards the 
end of the period, as the system weakens and becomes a remnant low, 
the system's forward speed will also decrease with a turn toward the 
west-southwest within the low-level flow. The NHC track forecast is 
very near the previous one.
 
The environment surrounding Kristy continues to become more and more 
unfavorable. Vertical wind shear is forecast to continue to 
increase, with cooling sea-surface temperatures and drier mid-levels 
of the atmosphere. Therefore, steady to rapid weakening is 
anticipated through the forecast period. Model simulated satellite 
data depict that Kristy will struggle to produce convection late 
this weekend, becoming a post-tropical cyclone in 48 h, and 
dissipating into a trough by 72 h. The latest NHC intensity forecast 
follows these model trends.
