...KRISTY REMAINS A VERY POWERFUL CATEGORY 4 HURRICANE...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 PM PDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.2N 117.2W
ABOUT 765 MI...1235 KM SW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
ABOUT 520 MI...835 KM SW OF SOCORRO ISLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...155 MPH...250 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 270 DEGREES AT 20 MPH...31 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...928 MB...27.41 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM PDT (0300 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Kristy was located 
near latitude 14.2 North, longitude 117.2 West.  Kristy is moving 
toward the west near 20 mph (31 km/h), and a westward to 
west-northwestward motion is forecast through Thursday.  A slower 
northwest to north-northwest motion is expected by late Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 155 mph (250 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Kristy is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Kristy is expected to fluctuate in strength 
over the next day or so.  Steady to rapid weakening should begin by 
early Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 928 mb (27.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kristy will affect portions of the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula late this week and over the
weekend.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM PDT.

<title>Hurricane Kristy Forecast Discussion Number 10</title>

Hurricane Kristy Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
800 PM PDT Wed Oct 23 2024
 
After rapidly intensifying throughout the day, Kristy's impressive 
strengthening trend appears to have paused.  The very powerful major 
hurricane remains quite compact and symmetric with a ring of intense 
deep convection surrounding its tiny eye.  The initial wind speed is 
held at 135 kt based on a blend of the latest satellite intensity 
estimates that range between 125 and 140 kt.  However, it is 
possible that Kristy is a little stronger as the maximum wind speed 
of compact hurricanes are sometimes underestimated.  There are also 
signs that Kristy could be beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, 
which is common in strong hurricanes in near ideal environmental 
conditions.
 
Kristy continues to move swiftly westward at 17 kt on the south side 
of a strong ridge centered near Baja California.   A turn to the 
west-northwest with some decrease in forward speed is expected 
during the next day or two as the hurricane moves along the 
southwestern periphery of the ridge.  A sharper turn to the 
northwest or north-northwest is expected Friday night and continuing 
through the weekend when the hurricane moves in the flow between the 
ridge and a large-scale trough.  The NHC track forecast is nudged to 
the north of the previous one to come into better agreement with the 
latest models.
 
The major hurricane is expected to remain in generally conducive 
environmental conditions for about another day, so the intensity 
changes will be largely governed by internal dynamics during that 
time.  However, steady to rapid weakening should begin by early 
Friday when Kristy moves into an environment of progressively 
stronger shear, cooler waters, and notably drier air.  The models 
are in fairly good agreement, and this forecast is close to the 
latest HCCA guidance.
