For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Kristy, located over the western portion of the eastern <br/>
Pacific basin.<br/>
<br/>
Western East Pacific (EP91):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located more than 1000 miles southwest <br/>
of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula is producing <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions <br/>
appear conducive for gradual development of this system, and a <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form within the next few days while <br/>
it moves westward or west-northwestward at about 15 mph over the <br/>
western portion of the eastern Pacific basin.  This system is <br/>
expected to move into the central Pacific basin on Wednesday or <br/>
Thursday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>

Post-Tropical Cyclone Kristy Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
800 AM PDT Sun Oct 27 2024
 
Very strong southwesterly vertical wind shear, dry air entrainment,
and cool waters have taken a toll on Kristy.  The storm has lacked
organized deep convection since about 03Z, and it has generally
consisted of a low-level cloud swirl since that time.  Therefore,
Kristy no longer meets the criteria of a tropical cyclone, and this
is the last advisory on this system.  The initial wind speed is
lowered to 40 kt, assuming some decrease in winds from the ASCAT
pass overnight that showed maximum winds close to 50 kt.
 
The gale-force low is still moving north-northwestward at about 7
kt, but it is expected to turn to the west and west-southwest later
today and Monday when it moves in the low-level flow.  The
post-tropical cyclone is also expected to continue to weaken and
dissipate completely on Monday.
 
This is the last NHC advisory on Kristy.  For more details on this
system, including gale warnings, see High Seas Forecasts issued by
the National Weather Service.  This information can be found under
AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php
