Hurricane Kristy Advisory Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
200 PM PDT Fri Oct 25 2024
 
...KRISTY CONTINUES TO WEAKEN...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM PDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.8N 125.8W
ABOUT 1115 MI...1795 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...115 MPH...185 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...963 MB...28.44 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM PDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kristy was located 
near latitude 16.8 North, longitude 125.8 West. Kristy is moving 
toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). A northwestward to 
north-northwestward motion at a slightly slower forward speed is 
expected over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Kristy is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Steady to rapid weakening is expected during 
the next few days, with Kristy expected to become a post-tropical 
cyclone on Sunday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles
(165 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 963 mb (28.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kristy are affecting portions of the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula and will likely continue to
impact the region through the weekend. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM PDT.

Hurricane Kristy Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
200 PM PDT Fri Oct 25 2024
 
Latest satellite images continue to depict that Kristy is 
struggling within an increasingly hostile environment. The 
convective pattern has continued to become more asymmetric, as 
southerly vertical wind shear continues to increase, displacing most 
of the convection over the northern semicircle. The eyewall has 
weakened as well, with convective cloud tops warming. The inner core 
degradation was further confirmed by a recent GMI microwave pass. 
Subjective and objective intensity estimates continue to plummet 
this afternoon and range between 90-105 kt. Given the satellite 
presentation, inner structure degradation, and these estimates, the 
initial intensity is lowered to 100 kt for this advisory. 
 
Kristy is moving toward the northwest with an estimated motion of 
305/12 kt. The system will move northwestward to north-northwestward 
for the next couple of days, steered along the southwestern 
periphery of a ridge located over the eastern Pacific. Towards the 
end of the period, as the system weakens and becomes a remnant low, 
the system's forward speed will also decrease with a turn toward the 
west-southwest within the low-level flow. The NHC track forecast is 
very near the previous one.
 
The environment surrounding Kristy continues to become more and more 
unfavorable. Vertical wind shear is forecast to continue to 
increase, with cooling sea-surface temperatures and drier mid-levels 
of the atmosphere. Therefore, steady to rapid weakening is 
anticipated through the forecast period. Model simulated satellite 
data depict that Kristy will struggle to produce convection late 
this weekend, becoming a post-tropical cyclone in 48 h, and 
dissipating into a trough by 72 h. The latest NHC intensity forecast 
follows these model trends.
