MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...928 MB...27.41 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM PDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kristy was located 
near latitude 14.1 North, longitude 115.5 West. Kristy is moving 
toward the west near 20 mph (31 km/h), and this motion is expected 
to continue through Thursday. A gradual turn toward the 
west-northwest and northwest is expected on Friday and into the 
weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 155 mph (250 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Kristy is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Some additional strengthening is expected 
through early Thursday. Gradual weakening should begin on Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 928 mb (27.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kristy will affect portions of the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula late this week. These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Hurricane Kristy Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Hurricane Kristy Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
200 PM PDT Wed Oct 23 2024
 
Kristy continues to rapidly intensify this afternoon. The eye has 
cleared over the past few hours, and surrounding very deep 
convection prevails with infrared cloud tops as cold as -75 to -80 
deg C. Satellite data suggests continued strengthening since SAB 
provided a T6.5 Dvorak classification at 18z, and the initial 
intensity is set to 135 kt, in best agreement with recent UW-CIMSS 
ADT estimates.
 
Major Hurricane Kristy is moving westward around 17 kt along the
southern periphery of a subtropical ridge over the Eastern Pacific
and Western United States. This fast westward motion is forecast to
continue over the next 24-30 h before turning to the west-northwest
this weekend as an upper-level trough impinges on the western extent
of the ridge. Kristy is forecast to encounter a highly sheared
environment this weekend and the system will become decoupled, with
the vertically shallow vortex steered by the low-level ridge late in
the forecast period. No significant changes were made to the latest
NHC track forecast.
 
Kristy remains a small hurricane in a weak shear environment over 
warm SSTs. The satellite presentation shows persistent convection, 
showing the potential for additional near-term strengthening as long 
as an eyewall replacement cycle does not commence soon. The latest 
NHC forecast remains near the top of the guidance envelope and has 
max winds around 140 kt, peaking at Category 5 strength. Slow 
weakening will begin on Friday as Kristy encounters increasing 
shear, and more rapid weakening will set in this weekend as the 
storm moves into an increasingly hostile environment with high shear 
and cooler SSTs. The storm is forecast to weaken to a post-tropical 
low by 96 h.
