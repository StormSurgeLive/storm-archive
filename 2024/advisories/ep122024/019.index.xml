Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 PM PDT Fri Oct 25 2024<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Kristy, located over the western portion of the eastern Pacific <br/>
basin.<br/>
<br/>
Western East Pacific:<br/>
A large area of showers and thunderstorms is currently located well <br/>
to the southwest of the southwestern coast of Mexico. An area of low <br/>
pressure could develop from this system over the next couple of days <br/>
as it moves into the western part of the East Pacific. Environmental <br/>
conditions are then forecast to be conducive for additional <br/>
development, and a tropical depression could form by the middle of <br/>
next week while the system moves westward or west-northwestward at <br/>
about 15 mph. This system is expected to move into the central <br/>
Pacific basin on Wednesday or Thursday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>

BULLETIN
Hurricane Kristy Advisory Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
200 AM PDT Sat Oct 26 2024
 
...KRISTY CONTINUES TO WEAKEN...
...EXPECTED TO BECOME A REMNANT LOW ON SUNDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM PDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.7N 127.6W
ABOUT 1180 MI...1895 KM W OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...100 MPH...155 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 320 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...972 MB...28.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM PDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kristy was located 
near latitude 18.7 North, longitude 127.6 West. Kristy is moving 
toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h). A northwestward or 
north-northwestward motion at a slower forward speed is expected 
today, followed by a turn toward the west by Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 100 mph (155 km/h)
with higher gusts. Rapid weakening is expected to continue over the
next couple of days, and Kristy is forecast to degenerate into a
remnant low on Sunday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 972 mb (28.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kristy are affecting portions of the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula and will likely continue to
impact the region through the weekend. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM PDT.

Hurricane Kristy Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
800 PM PDT Fri Oct 25 2024
 
Kristy's deepest convection is being displaced to the north of the 
center due to strong southerly shear, diagnosed at 30 kt by 
UW-CIMSS, although some convective elements are still trying to  
form within the southern eyewall.  Subjective Dvorak CI numbers and 
objective satellite estimates now range between 80-100 kt, and 
Kristy's intensity is therefore set at a blend of 90 kt.  Rapid 
weakening is forecast to continue as the hurricane encounters even 
stronger shear--and cooler sea surface temperatures--over the next 
couple of days.  The NHC intensity forecast closely follows previous 
official forecast trends and the latest consensus aids.  
Model-simulated satellite data indicate that Kristy should lose its 
deep convection by Sunday, and the cyclone is therefore expected to 
degenerate into a remnant low by 48 hours.  The low is forecast to 
open up into a trough on Monday.

Kristy is moving northwestward (310/13 kt), steered by a strong 
mid-level ridge centered over the Baja California peninsula.  The 
ridge should keep Kristy on a northwestward or north-northwestward 
trajectory for the next 36 hours, but once the cyclone weakens to a 
remnant low, it is expected to turn westward and slow down 
considerably when it runs into a low-level ridge to the north.    
The track models are in good agreement on this scenario, and no 
significant track changes were made from the previous forecast.
