LOCATION...14.1N 118.9W
ABOUT 845 MI...1360 KM SW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
ABOUT 615 MI...990 KM WSW OF SOCORRO ISLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...150 MPH...240 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 270 DEGREES AT 17 MPH...28 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...933 MB...27.55 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM PDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kristy was located
near latitude 14.1 North, longitude 118.9 West. Kristy is moving
toward the west near 17 mph (28 km/h), and a westward to
west-northwestward motion is forecast through Thursday.  A slower
northwest to north-northwest motion is expected by late Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 150 mph (240 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Kristy is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Some fluctuations in strength are expected 
through Thursday, with rapid weakening expected to begin Thursday 
night or Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles
(165 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 933 mb (27.55 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kristy will affect portions of the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula late this week and over the
weekend.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Hurricane Kristy Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Hurricane Kristy Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
200 AM PDT Thu Oct 24 2024

Kristy looks a little less impressive this evening, as satellite 
imagery indicates that the eye has clouded over.  There are hints 
in infrared imagery that the hurricane is undergoing an eyewall 
replacement cycle, although there are no recent microwave images to 
definitively show this.  The subjective and objective satellite 
intensity estimates have decreased a little over the past 6 h, and 
based on this the initial intensity is decreased to 130 kt.  The 
wind radii have been revised based on recent scatterometer 
overpasses showing that Kristy has gotten a little larger in size.

The initial motion is now 270/17 kt.  Kristy is currently on the 
south side of a deep-layer ridge over the northeastern Pacific.  A 
turn to the west-northwest with some decrease in forward speed is 
expected during the next day or two as the hurricane moves along the
southwestern periphery of the ridge.  A sharper turn to the 
northwest or north-northwest is expected by 48 h as Kristy moves 
between the ridge and a large mid- to -upper-level trough located 
east and northeast of the Hawaiian Islands.  By the end of the 
forecast period, Kristy is expected to shear apart, with the 
cyclone or its remnants turning west-southwestward in the 
low-level flow. The new forecast track is similar to the previous 
track, and it lies near or just to the southwest of the consensus 
models.

Kristy is expected to remain over warm water and in a conducive 
light shear environment for the next 24-36 h.  Based on this and an 
expectation that the hurricane will complete an eyewall 
replacement, the intensity forecast shows some re-intensification 
during this time. After 36 h, the environment becomes much more 
hostile, with strong shear, a much drier air mass, and cooler sea 
surface temperatures along the forecast track.  All guidance agrees 
that rapid weakening should occur, and the new intensity forecast 
follows the trend of the guidance.  Kristy should lose its 
convection and become post-tropical by 96 h, and while the forecast 
includes a 120 h point as a remnant low there is a possibility the 
system will degenerate to a trough by that time.
