WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM PDT (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Kristy was located
near latitude 14.1 North, longitude 120.3 West. Kristy is moving
toward the west near 17 mph (28 km/h), and this motion is forecast
to continue through tonight. A turn toward the northwest then
north-northwest, with a slower forward speed, is expected Friday
through the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 150 mph (240 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Kristy is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Some fluctuations in intensity are expected
through tonight, with rapid weakening expected to begin Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles
(165 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 933 mb (27.55 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kristy will affect portions of the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula late this week and over the

Hurricane Kristy Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
800 AM PDT Thu Oct 24 2024
 
Kristy's satellite presentation has improved this morning as the eye
has reappeared on infrared and visible imagery, with deep convection
wrapping around the center. A recent AMSR2 microwave pass depicted
that the system has completed an eyewall replacement cycle, with an
inner core becoming re-established and contracting towards the
center. Subjective Dvorak satellite intensity estimate data-T values
have increased since the previous advisory with T6.5 from both
TAFB and SAB. Given these intensity estimates and recent satellite
images, the intensity is set to 130 kt for this advisory.
 
The hurricane is moving westward at an estimated motion of 270/15
kt, being steered by a ridge located over the northeastern Pacific.
Kristy will gradually round the southwestern portion of the ridge
over the next day or so, with a turn to the northwest then
north-northwest continuing through the weekend between the flow of
the aforementioned ridge and a trough to the west. By the end of the
weekend, Kristy is forecast to rapidly weaken with the remnants
turning west-southwestward within the low-level steering flow. The
NHC forecast was nudged slightly to the right of the previous
forecast, closer to the simple consensus aids.
 
Kristy is forecast to remain within a favorable environment for the
next 24 hours or so, with warm sea surface temperatures and light
vertical wind shear. The intensity forecast calls for some slight
re-intensification during this time, although recent microwave
imagery depicts that another eyewall replacement cycle could occur,
which would cause some intensity fluctuations in the short term.
Thereafter, the environment quickly becomes hostile with strong wind
shear, drier air and cooler sea surface temperatures along the
forecast track of Kristy. Guidance is in fairly good agreement that
rapid weakening should occur through the end of the forecast period.
Model simulated satellite imagery depicts that Kristy will begin to
lose convection and become a post-tropical remnant low around 72 h,
and depicts the system opening into a trough by 120 h. The NHC
intensity forecast follows these trends, showing rapid weakening,
and now has the remnant low status at 72h, and dissipation at 120 h.
