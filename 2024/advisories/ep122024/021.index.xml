Tropical Storm Kristy Advisory Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
200 PM PDT Sat Oct 26 2024
 
...KRISTY FORECAST TO BECOME A REMNANT LOW ON SUNDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM PDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.7N 129.2W
ABOUT 1245 MI...2005 KM W OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 325 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...993 MB...29.33 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM PDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Kristy was
located near latitude 20.7 North, longitude 129.2 West. Kristy is
moving toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). A northwestward 
or north-northwestward motion at a slower forward speed is expected
today, followed by a turn toward the west on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Rapid weakening is expected to continue over
the weekend, and Kristy is forecast to degenerate into a remnant
low on Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 993 mb (29.33 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kristy are affecting portions of the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula and will likely continue to
impact the region through the weekend. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM PDT.

Tropical Storm Kristy Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
200 PM PDT Sat Oct 26 2024

The cloud pattern of Kristy continues to decay, with the low-level 
center now exposed to the south of what remains of the mid-level 
circulation due to strong shear.  The current intensity is set to 55 
kt using a blend of the most recent Dvorak estimates.  A 
continuation of this shear along with cool water temps should 
lead to further weakening, and Kristy is forecast to become a 
remnant low early on Sunday.  The new intensity forecast is similar 
to the previous one and the latest consensus aids.
 
The storm continues to move northwestward at about 12 kt.  Kristy 
should turn more westward overnight as the circulation becomes more 
vertically shallow and steered by a low-level ridge.  Other than 
a small westward adjustment, little change was made to the NHC 
track forecast, and the new prediction lies just west of the 
consensus guidance.
