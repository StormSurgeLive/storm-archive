a few hundred miles offshore of the coast of southern Mexico.  <br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity associated with this system also <br/>
continues to become better organized.  If these trends continue, <br/>
advisories will likely be initiated on this system as a tropical <br/>
depression or storm at 2 PM PDT.  This system is forecast to move <br/>
westward at around 15 mph away from the coast of Mexico. Additional <br/>
information on this system, including storm warnings, can be found <br/>
in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...near 100 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Kristy Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
300 PM CST Mon Oct 21 2024
 
The low pressure system located offshore the southern coast of
Mexico has quickly become better organized since last night based on
available GOES-West imagery and wind-derived satellite data. An
ASCAT wind pass from a few hours ago indicated that the surface
circulation had become well-defined and sustained winds were already
around 30-35 kt. Subjective Dvorak analysis from TAFB and SAB at 18Z
were T2.0 and T2.5, respectively. Based on these data, advisories
are initiated on Tropical Storm Kristy with an initial intensity of
35 kt.
 
The initial motion of this tropical storm is westward at 270/15 kt.
Kristy is expected to continue on this general motion during the
next few days as is steered by broad subtropical ridge centered well
west of Baja California. Late this week, Kristy will be approaching
a weakness created by a large cutoff low over the North Pacific.
This weakness should allow the tropical cyclone to turn to the
northwest by the end of the forecast period. The track guidance is
in good agreement, especially early in the forecast period, and the
initial forecast track follows the HCCA and TVCE models closely.
 
Relatively low wind shear and warm sea-surface temperatures should
allow Kristy to steadily gain strength over the next few days. The
forecast calls for the tropical cyclone to become a hurricane on
Wednesday. SHIPS guidance from both GFS and ECMWF suggest that the
wind shear values will be less than 10 kt by midweek, while the
sea-surface temperatures will be around 28-29 C. Such favorable
conditions could favor significant strengthening once the inner-core
becomes established. By Friday, Kristy will be crossing the 26 C
isotherm and the global model guidance also indicates that the wind
shear will also abruptly increase. Thus weakening is expected to
begin between forecast days 4 and 5. The NHC intensity forecast is
in good agreement with the HFIP Corrected Consensus Approach
(HCCA).
