...ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS EXPECTED...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM MST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.3N 113.9W
ABOUT 650 MI...1045 KM SSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
ABOUT 365 MI...590 KM SSW OF SOCORRO ISLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...125 MPH...205 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 265 DEGREES AT 20 MPH...31 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...954 MB...28.17 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Kristy was located 
near latitude 14.3 North, longitude 113.9 West. Kristy is moving 
toward the west near 20 mph (31 km/h), and this general motion is 
expected to continue through Thursday. A gradual turn toward the 
west-northwest and northwest is expected on Friday and into the 
weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 125 mph (205 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Kristy is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Additional steady to rapid 
strengthening is expected during the next day or so. Gradual 
weakening is forecast to begin on Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 954 mb (28.17 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kristy will affect portions of the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula late this week. These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

<title>Hurricane Kristy Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Hurricane Kristy Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
800 AM MST Wed Oct 23 2024
 
The impressive rapid intensification of Kristy has continued this 
morning. The gradually warming eye of the hurricane is surrounded by 
a ring of very deep convection, with infrared cloud tops as cold as 
-75 to -80 deg C. GOES-West derived motion winds indicate good 
upper-level outflow, particularly over the southern and western 
portions of the circulation. Subjective Dvorak classifications were 
a consensus T5.5/102-kt from TAFB and SAB at 12 UTC. Satellite 
trends suggest Kristy has kept strengthening since that time, and 
the initial intensity is set at 110 kt, following the rising 
objective estimates from UW-CIMSS.

The hurricane is moving quickly westward (265/17 kt) while being 
steered by a strong subtropical ridge to its north. This quick 
westward motion should continue for the next 24-36 h. Then, an 
upper-level trough between the Hawaiian Islands and the west coast 
of the United States is forecast to erode the western extent of the 
ridge. As a result, Kristy is expected to move toward the 
west-northwest and northwest late this week and into the weekend. A 
westward motion is shown by day 5, as it is anticipated that Kristy 
will become highly sheared and decoupled, with the vertically 
shallow vortex steered by the low-level ridge. No significant 
changes were made to the latest NHC track forecast.

Kristy is a relatively small hurricane that remains susceptible to 
rapid intensity fluctuations in a weak shear environment over warm 
SSTs. The latest GFS and ECMWF SHIPS output shows a 50 to 60 percent 
chance of a 20-kt increase during the next 12 h, and the satellite 
trends suggest continued near-term strengthening is likely. The 
updated NHC forecast reflects these signals and lies above the 
intensity guidance in the near term, showing Kristy peaking as a 
category 4 hurricane on Thursday. By Friday, the aforementioned 
trough is expected to impart increased shear on the hurricane, which 
should induce weakening through the rest of the 5-day forecast 
period. With SHIPS-diagnosed shear values of 40-50 kt by the 
weekend, Kristy is forecast to quickly weaken over the weekend and 
degenerate to a post-tropical remnant low by 120 h.
