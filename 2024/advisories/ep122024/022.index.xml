<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Kristy, located over the western portion of the eastern <br/>
Pacific basin.<br/>
<br/>
Western East Pacific:<br/>
A large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms is located <br/>
well to the southwest of the southwestern tip of the Baja California <br/>
peninsula.  Environmental conditions appear conducive for <br/>
development of this system, and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form by the early to middle part of next week while moving westward <br/>
or west-northwestward at about 15 mph over the far western portion <br/>
of the eastern Pacific basin.  This system is expected to move into <br/>
the central Pacific basin on Wednesday or Thursday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Kristy Advisory Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
800 PM PDT Sat Oct 26 2024
 
...KRISTY QUICKLY UNRAVELING...
...FORECAST TO DEGENERATE INTO A REMNANT LOW ON SUNDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 PM PDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.5N 129.5W
ABOUT 1255 MI...2020 KM W OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 330 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...996 MB...29.42 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM PDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Kristy was
located near latitude 21.5 North, longitude 129.5 West.  Kristy is
moving toward the north-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A turn 
toward the northwest and west at a slower forward speed is expected 
tonight and on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast, and Kristy is 
expected to degenerate into a remnant low on Sunday.  The remnant 
low will likely dissipate by early Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kristy are affecting portions of the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula and will likely continue to
impact the region through the weekend. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM PDT.

Tropical Storm Kristy Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
800 PM PDT Sat Oct 26 2024
 
Kristy's low-level cloud field is starting to lose some definition, 
but there has still been bursting of deep convection to the north of 
the center.  Dvorak CI numbers of 3.5 from TAFB and 3.0 from SAB, 
combined with objective satellite estimates, support a current 
intensity of 50 kt.  Due to the expected continuation of very strong 
southerly shear, as well as sea surface temperatures of 23-24 
degrees Celsius, Kristy is forecast to weaken below tropical storm 
strength and become a remnant low during the day on Sunday.  Model 
fields show the circulation opening up into a trough by 36 hours, 
and that is when dissipation is now shown.

Kristy has turned north-northwestward and slowed down further 
(330/10 kt).  However, now that the circulation is becoming 
increasingly shallow, low-level ridging to the north will cause the 
cyclone to turn back toward the northwest and west tonight and on 
Sunday before it dissipates.
