200 PM PDT Thu Oct 24 2024
 
...KRISTY BECOMES A CATEGORY 5 HURRICANE...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM PDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.2N 121.6W
ABOUT 970 MI...1565 KM SW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
ABOUT 770 MI...1240 KM WSW OF SOCORRO ISLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...160 MPH...260 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 275 DEGREES AT 16 MPH...26 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...926 MB...27.35 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM PDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kristy was located 
near latitude 14.2 North, longitude 121.6 West. Kristy is moving 
toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h) and this motion is expected to 
continue through tonight. A turn toward the northwest and then 
north-northwest, with a slower forward speed, is expected Friday 
through the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 160 mph (260 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Kristy is a category 5 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity 
are expected through tonight, with rapid weakening expected to begin 
Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles
(165 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 926 mb (27.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Kristy will affect portions of the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula late this week and over the
weekend.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM PDT.

Hurricane Kristy Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122024
500 PM PDT Thu Oct 24 2024

Satellite imagery continues to show a circular eye that has been 
warming through the afternoon, with varying degrees of clearing. 
While the inner eye has not been as clear over the past few hours, 
subjective satellite intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB have 
either increased or held steady, with a data-T value of T/7.0 and 
T/6.5, from TAFB and SAB respectively. UW-CIMSS objective intensity 
estimates have increased as well. Using an average of these 
intensity estimates and latest trends in satellite images, the 
initial intensity is set to 140 kt for this advisory. Therefore, 
Kristy has strengthened into a category 5 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.

Kristy's forward motion remains steady, estimated at 270/14 kt while 
being steered by a ridge over the northeastern Pacific. The 
hurricane will gradually round the southwestern portion of the ridge 
over the next day or so, with a turn to the northwest and then the
north-northwest occurring through this weekend as a trough to the 
west begins to influence Kristy's motion. The system will  
rapidly weaken by the end of this weekend, with the remnants then 
turning west-southwestward in the low-level steering flow. The 
latest NHC track forecast has once again shifted slightly to the 
right, closer to the consensus aids, but remains on the southwest 
side of the guidance envelope.

For about the next 24 hours, Kristy looks to remain in a favorable 
environment characterized by warm sea surface temperatures and light 
vertical wind shear. Some slight fluctuations are possible in the 
short term, especially if the system has another eyewall replacement 
cycle. The environment then rapidly becomes hostile as the hurricane 
enters an area of stronger vertical wind shear, drier air, and 
cooler sea surface temperatures. The intensity guidance remains 
insistent on rapid weakening occurring through the end of the 
forecast period. Model-simulated satellite imagery also mirrors this 
trend, suggesting that Kristy will lose convection and become 
post-tropical by 72 h, degenerate to a remnant low by 96 h, and open 
into a trough by 120 h. The NHC intensity forecast also follows 
these trends with only minor adjustments made this afternoon.
