...ERNESTO COULD RESTRENGTHEN SOME TODAY...
...DANGEROUS BEACH CONDITIONS EXPECTED ALONG THE U.S. EAST COAST
THROUGH DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...34.6N 63.0W
ABOUT 690 MI...1110 KM S OF HALIFAX NOVA SCOTIA
ABOUT 980 MI...1580 KM SW OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...70 MPH...110 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 25 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...978 MB...28.88 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Bermuda Weather Service has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warning for Bermuda.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in southeastern Newfoundland should monitor the progress
of Ernesto.  A watch may be required for a portion of this area
later today.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ernesto was 
located near latitude 34.6 North, longitude 63.0 West. Ernesto is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 9 mph (15 km/h),  and some 
increase in forward speed is forecast later today, followed by a 
turn toward the northeast and east-northeast on Monday and Tuesday. 
On the forecast track, the center of Ernesto will pass near 
southeastern Newfoundland late Monday and Monday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Some re-intensification is possible later today, and Ernesto 
could regain hurricane status.  The cyclone will likely become 
post-tropical near southeastern Newfoundland by Monday night or 
Tuesday morning.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 978 mb (28.88 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the 
Bahamas, Bermuda, the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic 
Canada.  Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are likely 
in these areas during the next couple of days.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office, and stay out of the water 
if advised by lifeguards.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Ernesto Forecast Discussion Number 26</title>
<description>Issued at 1100 PM AST Sat Aug 17 2024  <![CDATA[<pre>

Tropical Storm Ernesto Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
1100 PM AST Sat Aug 17 2024

Satellite imagery and radar data from Bermuda continue to show 
limited convection associated with Ernesto, with the strongest 
convection in a poorly-defined eyewall in the northern semicircle. 
This is likely due to a tongue of dry air wrapping around the 
system from the northwest into the central core. The various 
subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates have 
decreased a little more since the last advisory, and based on this 
the initial intensity is lowered to 60 kt.

The initial motion is 030/7 kt.  This slow motion should continue 
for the next 6-12 h as a mid-latitude shortwave ridge passes to the 
north of Ernesto.  After that, southwesterly flow on the east side 
of a mid-latitude trough moving through the eastern United States 
should cause the cyclone to accelerate to the north-northeast, 
northeast, and eventually east-northeast.  This motion should bring 
the center just southeast of Newfoundland late Monday and Monday 
night, with the system moving into the open north Atlantic 
thereafter.  The track guidance remains tightly clustered, and the 
new forecast track has only minor changes from the previous track.

Little change in strength is expected tonight while Ernesto tries 
to mix out the dry air tongue.  After that, upper-level divergence 
is forecast to increase while the cyclone is still over relatively 
warm water.  This could allow some modest re-intensification as 
show by the dynamical models, and this remains reflected in the 
intensity forecast.  After 36 h, the cyclone should weaken as it 
moves over colder water and begins extratropical transition.  
Transition should be complete by 60 h, and and the post-tropical low 
is expected to degenerate to a trough over the northeastern 
Atlantic between 72-96 h.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Ernesto is still moving slowly, and its impacts on Bermuda are
not quite over.  Strong winds, heavy rainfall, coastal flooding, and
battering waves should continue for a few more hours.  The heavy 
rains will likely result in considerable life-threatening flash 
flooding, especially in low-lying areas on the island.
 
2. Even though Ernesto is forecast to remain well offshore the U.S.
East Coast, swells generated by the hurricane are expected to affect
the area through early next week.  Beach goers should be aware that
there is a significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip
currents, and should stay out of the water if advised by lifeguards.
Surf and rip currents are also possible on the Bahamas, Bermuda, and
Atlantic Canada during the next few days.
 
3. Ernesto could bring wind, wave, and rain impacts to portions of
southeastern Newfoundland late Monday and Monday night.
