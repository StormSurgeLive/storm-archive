...ERNESTO STRENGTHENS A LITTLE MORE...
...DANGEROUS BEACH CONDITIONS CONTINUING ALONG THE U.S. EAST COAST
AND ATLANTIC CANADA THROUGH EARLY THIS WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...40.2N 60.5W
ABOUT 340 MI...550 KM SSE OF HALIFAX NOVA SCOTIA
ABOUT 580 MI...935 KM SW OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...85 MPH...140 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 30 DEGREES AT 21 MPH...33 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...972 MB...28.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in southeastern Newfoundland should monitor the progress
of Ernesto.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was
located near latitude 40.2 North, longitude 60.5 West.  Ernesto is
moving toward the north-northeast near 21 mph (33 km/h), and a turn 
toward the northeast and east-northeast with an increase in forward 
speed is expected today and Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Ernesto will pass near southeastern Newfoundland tonight 
and early Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast today, 
and a weakening trend is expected to begin tonight.  Ernesto is 
expected to lose tropical characteristics during the next day or so.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles
(350 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 972 mb (28.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the
Bahamas, Bermuda, the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic
Canada.  Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are likely
to continue in these areas during the next couple of days.  In
southeastern Newfoundland large breaking waves could bring the
possibility of coastal flooding, particularly along southwest-facing
shorelines from Burin east to Avalon regions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office, and stay out of the water
if advised by lifeguards.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Hurricane Ernesto Forecast Discussion Number 31</title>

Hurricane Ernesto Discussion Number  31
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
500 AM AST Mon Aug 19 2024

Satellite imagery shows that Ernesto's eye is irregularly-shaped, 
with fairly cold convective cloud tops over the northern portion of 
the circulation.  The southwestern part of the high cloud canopy is 
beginning to become slightly blunted, which suggests some 
southwesterly shear is beginning to affect the system.   The 
various objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS indicate that, a 
couple of hours ago, the hurricane strengthened a little more, but 
recently the overall cloud pattern appears to have become a little 
less organized.  This suggests that Ernesto has stopped 
strengthening, and the current intensity estimate is set at 75 kt 
which is in general agreement with subjective Dvorak T-numbers.

Center fixes indicate a gradual increase in forward speed overnight 
and the initial motion estimate is 030/18 kt.  Ernesto is expected 
to accelerate northeastward in the flow ahead of a large deep-layer 
trough near the U.S. east coast for the next 24 hours or so.  This 
motion should bring the center of the cyclone near southeastern 
Newfoundland tonight or early Tuesday.  Based on the NHC 
forecast, most of the stronger winds in the system's circulation 
are expected to stay offshore of Newfoundland.  Thereafter, a 
faster east-northeastward motion over the North Atlantic is forecast 
while the cyclone becomes fully embedded within the mid-latitude 
westerlies.  In 2-3 days, Ernesto is likely to open up into a 
trough while merging with a large extratropical low to the south of 
Iceland.  The official track forecast follows the latest dynamical 
model consensus and is just slightly to the north of the previous 
NHC prediction.

Ernesto will be traversing significantly cooler waters later today 
and will be impacted by increasing west-southwesterly vertical wind 
shear during the next day or two.  Therefore, a weakening trend 
should begin by tonight or earlier.  The official intensity forecast 
is quite similar to the latest Decay-SHIPS numerical guidance.  
Simulated satellite imagery from the global models suggest that the 
system will become post-tropical within the next day or so.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Even though Ernesto is forecast to remain well offshore of the
U.S. East Coast, swells generated by the hurricane will continue to
affect the area through the early part of this week.  Beach goers
should be aware that there is a significant risk of life-threatening
surf and rip currents, and should stay out of the water if advised
by lifeguards.  Surf and rip currents are also possible on the
Bahamas, Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada during the next few days.
 
2. Ernesto will likely bring some wind, wave, and rain impacts to 
portions of southeastern Newfoundland tonight into Tuesday morning.
Breaking waves could bring the possibility of coastal flooding,
particularly along southwest-facing shorelines from Bunin east to
Avalon regions. For additional impact specific information, please
see statements issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre.
