...DANGEROUS BEACH CONDITIONS ALONG THE U.S. EAST COAST AND ATLANTIC 
CANADA TO CONTINUE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...36.1N 62.5W
ABOUT 590 MI...950 KM S OF HALIFAX NOVA SCOTIA
ABOUT 880 MI...1410 KM SW OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...70 MPH...110 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 20 DEGREES AT 16 MPH...26 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...978 MB...28.88 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in southeastern Newfoundland should monitor the progress
of Ernesto. For storm information specific to your area, please 
monitor products issued by your national meteorological service. 
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ernesto was 
located near latitude 36.1 North, longitude 62.5 West. Ernesto is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h) and some 
increase in forward speed is forecast today, followed by a turn 
toward the northeast and east-northeast on Monday and Tuesday. On 
the forecast track, the center of Ernesto will pass near 
southeastern Newfoundland late Monday into Tuesday morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Some strengthening is possible today and Ernesto is forecast 
to regain hurricane status. The cyclone is forecast to become 
post-tropical after it passes by southeastern Newfoundland by 
Tuesday morning. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 978 mb (28.88 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the 
Bahamas, Bermuda, the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic 
Canada.  Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are likely 
in these areas during the next couple of days.  In southeastern 
Newfoundland large breaking waves could bring the possibility of 
coastal flooding, particularly along southwest-facing shorelines 
from Burin east to Avalon regions.  Please consult products from 
your local weather office, and stay out of the water if advised by 
lifeguards.  
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Ernesto Forecast Discussion Number 27</title>

Tropical Storm Ernesto Discussion Number  27...Corrected
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
500 AM AST Sun Aug 18 2024

Corrected text of second key message.

Ernesto's cloud pattern hasn't changed much overnight, and lacks a 
well-defined eye feature.  Deep convection has been trying to 
wrap around the eastern portion of the circulation, giving the 
system a fairly symmetric overall appearance.  The current 
intensity estimate is held at 60 kt which is in good agreement with 
the latest objective, AID, estimates from UW-CIMSS.  Subjective 
Dvorak satellite estimates are somewhat lower.  Unfortunately the 
most recent scatterometer overpasses missed most of the circulation.

The tropical cyclone continues on a rather slow north-northeastward 
heading, with an initial motion estimate of 025/8 kt.  The steering 
flow on the east side of a large mid-tropospheric trough approaching 
the U.S. east coast should cause an increase in forward speed during 
the next day or so along with a turn toward the northeast.  In 2-3 
days,  Ernesto is likely to turn toward the east-northeast with 
additional acceleration as it becomes embedded in the mid-latitude 
westerlies over the north Atlantic.  The track guidance models 
remain in good agreement, and little changes to the previous NHC 
track forecast were required.

Ernesto is still over warm waters, and should remain over SSTs of 
at least 27 deg C for the next 24 hours or so.  Also, vertical wind 
shear is forecast to remain low today with upper-level divergence 
diagnosed over the area by the SHIPS model diagnostics.  These 
environmental factors favor a short period of restrengthening 
today, and this reflected in the official forecast.  In 36-48 
hours, the cyclone will encounter much cooler waters and this 
should cause weakening.  Simulated IR satellite imagery from the 
global models show an increasingly asymmetric cloud structure by 
the time the system passes near Newfoundland, and the official 
forecast indicates post-tropical transition by 48 hours.  Ernesto 
is predicted to open up and become a large trough over the 
northeastern Atlantic by 96 hours.


Key Messages:
 
1. Even though Ernesto is forecast to remain well offshore of the 
U.S. East Coast, swells generated by the hurricane are expected to 
affect the area through early next week.  Beach goers should be 
aware that there is a significant risk of life-threatening surf and 
rip currents, and should stay out of the water if advised by 
lifeguards.  Surf and rip currents are also possible on the Bahamas, 
Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada during the next few days.
 
2. Ernesto could bring wind and wave impacts to portions of 
southeastern Newfoundland late Monday and Monday night.
