LOCATION...33.3N 64.0W
ABOUT 85 MI...135 KM NE OF BERMUDA
ABOUT 1090 MI...1750 KM SW OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests in southeastern Newfoundland should monitor the progress
of Ernesto.  A watch may be required for a portion of this area
Sunday morning.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was
located near latitude 33.3 North, longitude 64.0 West.  Ernesto is
moving toward the north-northeast near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this 
slow motion is expected to continue through tonight.  An 
acceleration toward the north-northeast is forecast to begin on 
Sunday, with a turn toward the northeast and east-northeast 
occurring on Monday and Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the
center of Ernesto will slowly move away from Bermuda through 
tonight and pass near southeastern Newfoundland late Monday and 
Monday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  No significant change in strength is forecast during the 
next 48 hours, and Ernesto should remain near or at hurricane 
strength through Monday.  The cyclone will likely become 
post-tropical near southeastern Newfoundland by Monday night or 
Tuesday morning.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles
(370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 976 mb (28.82 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are likely to continue on Bermuda
through tonight, with hurricane-force gusts possible in rainbands.
 
STORM SURGE:  Coastal flooding is still possible on Bermuda in areas
of onshore winds.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Ernesto is expected to produce an additional 1 to 2
inches (25 to 50 mm) of rainfall through tonight across Bermuda,
with storm total amounts of 7 to 9 inches (175 to 225 mm). This 
rainfall will likely result in considerable life-threatening flash 
flooding to the island, especially in low-lying areas.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the
Bahamas, Bermuda, the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic
Canada today.  Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are
likely in these areas during the next couple of days.  Please
consult products from your local weather office, and stay out of the
water if advised by lifeguards.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

<title>Hurricane Ernesto Forecast Discussion Number 24</title>

Hurricane Ernesto Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
1100 AM AST Sat Aug 17 2024
 
An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft made a couple of 
passes through Ernesto this morning and only found 700-mb flight 
level winds as high as 74 kt--significantly lower than the maximum 
winds reported by the mission yesterday evening and overnight.  The 
initial intensity is therefore set at 70 kt for this advisory, and 
even that could be a bit generous.  Although the central pressure 
has not risen much, Ernesto's wind field has continued to expand, 
and the hurricane is now exhibiting a large rain-free center region 
that is just about to move past Bermuda.

The forward motion has slowed a bit more and is now estimated to be 
north-northeastward (025 degrees) at 7 kt.  Ernesto has been left 
behind by a shortwave trough now located near Newfoundland, and 
therefore a continued slow motion toward the north-northeast is 
forecast for the next day or so until another trough to the west 
gets closer.  Ernesto should begin accelerating on Sunday as it 
heads toward Atlantic Canada, turning northeastward and passing 
very near southeastern Newfoundland late Monday and Monday night.  
The guidance has again slowed down on this cycle, and the NHC 
forecast has been adjusted accordingly.

Although deep-layer shear is forecast to diminish a bit during the 
next 24 hours while Ernesto remains over waters of 28 degrees 
Celsius, the structure of the hurricane and dry air within the 
circulation suggest that the storm may not be able to re-intensity 
much, if at all.  The NHC intensity forecast is near the top end of 
the guidance and does keep Ernesto as a hurricane for the next 48 
hours.  Weakening is expected after that time, and global model 
fields suggest Ernesto should become extratropical by 72 hours 
while or just after passing Newfoundland.  A 96-hour point is 
provided for continuity, but both the GFS and ECMWF indicate that 
the circulation could open up into a trough over the north Atlantic 
by then.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Ernesto is moving slowly, and its impacts on Bermuda are 
not over.  Strong winds, heavy rainfall, coastal flooding, and 
battering waves are likely through tonight.  The heavy rains will 
likely result in considerable life-threatening flash flooding, 
especially in low-lying areas on the island.
 
2. Even though Ernesto is forecast to remain well offshore the U.S. 
East Coast, swells generated by the hurricane are expected to affect 
the area through early next week.  Beach goers should be aware that 
there is a significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip 
currents, and should stay out of the water if advised by lifeguards. 
Surf and rip currents are also possible on the Bahamas, Bermuda, and 
Atlantic Canada during the next few days.
 
3. Ernesto could bring wind, wave, and rain impacts to portions of 
southeastern Newfoundland late Monday and Monday night.
