STRENGTHENING...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM AST...0600 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...23.3N 69.1W
ABOUT 180 MI...290 KM NE OF GRAND TURK ISLAND
ABOUT 675 MI...1085 KM SSW OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...85 MPH...140 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area. A watch is typically issued 48 hours before
the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds,
conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was
located near latitude 23.3 North, longitude 69.1 West. Ernesto is
moving toward the north-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h). A turn
toward the north is expected later today, followed by a slower
northward to northeastward motion on Friday and Saturday. On the
forecast track, the center of Ernesto is expected to pass near
Bermuda on Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next couple 
of days, and Ernesto could become a major hurricane by Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175
miles (280 km). NOAA buoy 41046, located about 40 miles north of 
Ernesto, recently reported a wind gust to 57 mph (91 km/h) and a 
minimum central pressure of 997.9 mb (29.47 inches).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible on Bermuda Saturday, with
tropical storm conditions possible by Friday afternoon.
 
RAINFALL: Ernesto is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
3 to 6 inches on Bermuda with isolated maximum amounts of 9 inches.
This rainfall may result in considerable life-threatening flash
flooding.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the
northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the
Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the
southeastern Bahamas. These swells will spread toward Bermuda and
the rest of the Bahamas later today. Swells are expected to reach
the east coast of the United States tonight and continue into
the weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Hurricane Ernesto Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
1100 PM AST Wed Aug 14 2024
 
The satellite structure of Ernesto has somewhat improved tonight. A 
series of earlier SSMI/S 91 GHz passive microwave images showed the 
formation of a mid-level eye, and there have been recent hints of an 
eye trying to emerge in proxy-visible satellite images. Data from 
the Air Force Hurricane Hunters showed the central pressure has 
fallen to 982 mb, and the aircraft measured peak 700-mb flight-level 
winds of 76 kt in the northeast quadrant. Based on these data, the 
initial intensity is set at 70 kt. The wind field remains quite 
broad and asymmetric, with the strongest aircraft winds well to the 
northeast of the center. The next aircraft reconnaissance mission 
into Ernesto is scheduled for tomorrow morning.  

Ernesto is now moving north-northwestward at 330/14 kt. The 
hurricane will continue on a north-northwestward to northward motion 
during the next day or so while moving through a break in the 
subtropical ridge over the western Atlantic. The global models agree 
the upper trough that weakened the ridge will not capture Ernesto. 
As a result, Ernesto will move slower to the north-northeast and 
north while the hurricane approaches and moves near Bermuda Friday 
night and Saturday. Later this weekend, a second trough will move 
across the eastern U.S., and Ernesto should accelerate northeastward 
early next week within the deep-layer southwesterly flow ahead of 
this feature. The NHC track forecast is essentially an update of the 
previous one, as the track guidance remains in good overall 
agreement. It is still too soon to know exactly how close Ernesto's 
center will move to Bermuda this weekend, but warnings will likely 
be required for the island on Thursday.
 
While there is still evidence of some drier air nearby Ernesto, the 
very warm ocean waters and weak to moderate shear should promote 
some strengthening during the next couple of days. This is supported 
by the bulk of the intensity guidance, and the regional hurricane 
models still favor Ernesto reaching major hurricane intensity on 
Friday. The latest NHC prediction remains on the high end of the 
guidance envelope, closest to the HFIP corrected consensus. Some 
gradual weakening is forecast thereafter as Ernesto moves into a 
drier, more sheared environment. There are some indications that 
positive interaction with the second upper trough could cause 
Ernesto's intensity to level off or even slightly increase during 
the 60-96 h time period while still over warm waters. By 120 h, the 
model fields suggest Ernesto will be on the verge of losing tropical 
characteristics while accelerating over cooler waters.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane conditions are possible on Bermuda on Saturday, with 
tropical storm conditions possible by Friday afternoon. Rainfall 
associated with Ernesto may begin to affect Bermuda late Thursday 
and result in flash flooding across Bermuda later this week and this 
weekend.
 
2. Even though Ernesto is forecast to remain well offshore the U.S.
East Coast, swells generated by the storm are expected to reach the
area late this week and into the weekend.  Beach goers should be
aware of a significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip
currents, and stay out of the water if advised by lifeguards.  Surf
and rip currents are also possible on the Virgin Islands, Puerto
Rico, the Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos, and the Bahamas
during the next few days.
