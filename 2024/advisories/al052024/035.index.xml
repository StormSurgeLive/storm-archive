----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...47.3N 50.0W
ABOUT 150 MI...245 KM ENE OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 50 DEGREES AT 36 MPH...57 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...975 MB...28.80 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was
located near latitude 47.3 North, longitude 50.0 West.  Ernesto is
moving toward the northeast near 36 mph (57 km/h).  An even faster
motion to the northeast or east-northeast is expected during the
next couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of Ernesto
will move over the open North Atlantic today and tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Continued weakening is forecast, and 
Ernesto should lose its tropical characteristics later today, 
and dissipate on Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles
(350 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 975 mb (28.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting Bermuda, the
northeast coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada. The
swells and the associated life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions should gradually subside during the next day or so.
Please consult products from your local weather office, and stay out
of the water if advised by lifeguards.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Ernesto Discussion Number  35
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
500 AM AST Tue Aug 20 2024

Increasingly strong westerly vertical wind shear is affecting the 
cyclone, displacing most of the remaining deep convection to the 
east of the low-level center.  The system's cloud pattern is 
already taking on a less tropical-looking appearance, making 
intensity estimates via the Dvorak technique somewhat problematic.  
However, a couple of ship reports of winds of 58 and 51 kt to the 
east of the center indicate that Ernesto is still near hurricane 
strength.  Thus, the advisory intensity is set at 65 kt.

The hurricane has been accelerating northeastward and the initial 
motion estimate is 050/31 kt.  Ernesto is embedded within a strong 
deep-layer flow between a large trough over the northeastern U.S. 
and a ridge over the central subtropical Atlantic.  In a day or so, 
an even faster motion toward the northeast and east-northeast is 
likely as the cyclone comes more under the influence of a large 
deep-layer cyclone over the northeastern Atlantic.  The official 
track forecast is close to the previous NHC prediction, and follows 
the multi-model consensus solution.

Continued weakening is likely as Ernesto moves over cold water and 
remains under the influence of strong shear.  Based on current 
trends and simulated satellite imagery from the global models, the 
system's deep convection should be disrupted to the point that 
Ernesto will have become a post-tropical cyclone in about 12 hours.  
In 24 hours, the guidance shows a frontal appearance indicating 
extratropical transition.  In 36 hours or so, Ernesto is predicted 
to open up into a trough over the northeastern Atlantic. 

 
Key Messages:
 
1. The effects of swells generated by Ernesto on the coasts of
Bermuda, the northeast U.S., and Atlantic Canada should diminish
during the next day or so.  Until then, beach goers should be aware
that there still could be a significant risk of life-threatening
surf and rip currents and should stay out of the water if advised by
lifeguards.
