-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...33.9N 63.3W
ABOUT 140 MI...225 KM NE OF BERMUDA
ABOUT 1030 MI...1660 KM SW OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...70 MPH...110 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests in southeastern Newfoundland should monitor the progress
of Ernesto.  A watch may be required for a portion of this area on
Sunday.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ernesto was
located near latitude 33.9 North, longitude 63.3 West. Ernesto is
moving toward the north-northeast near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue through tonight.  An 
acceleration toward the north-northeast is forecast to begin on 
Sunday, with a turn toward the northeast and east-northeast 
occurring on Monday and Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center 
of Ernesto will move away from Bermuda tonight and pass near 
southeastern Newfoundland late Monday and Monday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is expected tonight. 
Some intensification is possible Sunday and Sunday night, and 
Ernesto could regain hurricane status. The cyclone will likely 
become post-tropical near southeastern Newfoundland by Monday night 
or Tuesday morning.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 978 mb (28.88 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are likely to continue on Bermuda
for the next few hours.
 
STORM SURGE:  Coastal flooding is still possible on Bermuda in areas
of onshore winds.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.

RAINFALL: Ernesto is expected to produce an additional 1 to 2 inches 
or 25 to 50 mm of rainfall through Saturday night across Bermuda, 
with storm total amounts of 7 to 9 inches (175 to 225 mm). This 
rainfall will likely result in considerable life-threatening flash 
flooding to the island.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the
Bahamas, Bermuda, the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic
Canada today.  Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are
likely in these areas during the next couple of days.  Please
consult products from your local weather office, and stay out of the
water if advised by lifeguards.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Ernesto Forecast Discussion Number 26</title>

Tropical Storm Ernesto Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
1100 PM AST Sat Aug 17 2024

Satellite imagery and radar data from Bermuda continue to show 
limited convection associated with Ernesto, with the strongest 
convection in a poorly-defined eyewall in the northern semicircle. 
This is likely due to a tongue of dry air wrapping around the 
system from the northwest into the central core. The various 
subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates have 
decreased a little more since the last advisory, and based on this 
the initial intensity is lowered to 60 kt.

The initial motion is 030/7 kt.  This slow motion should continue 
for the next 6-12 h as a mid-latitude shortwave ridge passes to the 
north of Ernesto.  After that, southwesterly flow on the east side 
of a mid-latitude trough moving through the eastern United States 
should cause the cyclone to accelerate to the north-northeast, 
northeast, and eventually east-northeast.  This motion should bring 
the center just southeast of Newfoundland late Monday and Monday 
night, with the system moving into the open north Atlantic 
thereafter.  The track guidance remains tightly clustered, and the 
new forecast track has only minor changes from the previous track.

Little change in strength is expected tonight while Ernesto tries 
to mix out the dry air tongue.  After that, upper-level divergence 
is forecast to increase while the cyclone is still over relatively 
warm water.  This could allow some modest re-intensification as 
show by the dynamical models, and this remains reflected in the 
intensity forecast.  After 36 h, the cyclone should weaken as it 
moves over colder water and begins extratropical transition.  
Transition should be complete by 60 h, and and the post-tropical low 
is expected to degenerate to a trough over the northeastern 
Atlantic between 72-96 h.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Ernesto is still moving slowly, and its impacts on Bermuda are
not quite over.  Strong winds, heavy rainfall, coastal flooding, and
battering waves should continue for a few more hours.  The heavy 
rains will likely result in considerable life-threatening flash 
flooding, especially in low-lying areas on the island.
 
2. Even though Ernesto is forecast to remain well offshore the U.S.
East Coast, swells generated by the hurricane are expected to affect
the area through early next week.  Beach goers should be aware that
there is a significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip
currents, and should stay out of the water if advised by lifeguards.
Surf and rip currents are also possible on the Bahamas, Bermuda, and
Atlantic Canada during the next few days.
 
3. Ernesto could bring wind, wave, and rain impacts to portions of
southeastern Newfoundland late Monday and Monday night.
