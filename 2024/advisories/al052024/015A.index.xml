----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.5N 69.3W
ABOUT 605 MI...975 KM SSW OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...85 MPH...140 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was 
located near latitude 24.5 North, longitude 69.3 West. Ernesto is 
moving toward the north near 13 mph (20 km/h).  This general motion 
is expected to continue today, followed by a slower northeastward or 
northward motion on Friday and Saturday. On the forecast track, the 
center of Ernesto is expected to pass near or over Bermuda on 
Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast during the next day or two, and
Ernesto could become a major hurricane by Friday.  Ernesto is
forecast to be a large hurricane near Bermuda on Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175
miles (280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 975 mb (28.79 inches) 
based on data from a dropsonde.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected on Bermuda Saturday, with
tropical storm conditions likely beginning Friday afternoon.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding on Bermuda in areas of onshore winds.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: Ernesto is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
4 to 8 inches in Bermuda with isolated maximum amounts up to 12
inches.  This rainfall may result in considerable life-threatening
flash flooding.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the
northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the
Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the
southeastern Bahamas. These swells will spread toward Bermuda and
the rest of the Bahamas later today. Swells are expected to reach
the east coast of the United States tonight and continue into
the weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Ernesto Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
500 AM AST Thu Aug 15 2024

Ernesto has strengthened overnight.  Satellite images show that a 
more symmetric area of deep convection has formed near the center, 
with a rather large curved band wrapping in all quadrants of the 
hurricane. The initial intensity is set to 75 kt, matching the TAFB 
and SAB estimates, though recent imagery suggests that could be a 
little conservative.  An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter 
Aircraft is scheduled to be in the hurricane in a few hours.

Ernesto has turned northward and is moving at about 11 kt.  The 
models remain in good agreement that the hurricane should turn to 
the northeast during the next day or so while moving through a break 
in the subtropical ridge over the western Atlantic towards a 
mid-latitude trough.  However, the trough departs by the weekend, 
causing Ernesto to move slower to the north-northeast or north while 
the hurricane approaches Bermuda Friday night and Saturday.  Later 
this weekend, a second trough will move across the eastern U.S., and 
Ernesto should accelerate northeastward early next week within the 
deep-layer southwesterly flow ahead of this feature. The NHC track 
forecast is very close to the previous one as the track guidance 
remains in good overall agreement. 

While the shear near Ernesto remains low, a large dry slot continues 
to wrap near the core, preventing anything other than slow 
intensification so far.  Most of the guidance gradually intensifies 
the system during the next day or so as the very warm waters and 
light-to-moderate shear outweigh the effects of the dry air.  Little 
change was made to the intensity forecast, and all of the guidance 
show this system as a large hurricane near Bermuda.  There remains 
some indications that positive interactions with the second upper 
trough and warmer than normal waters should cause the system to keep 
much of its strength north of Bermuda, and the new forecast reflects 
this.  All of the guidance now show Ernesto as post-tropical by 120 
h, and so does the NHC forecast.
 
 
Key Messages:

1. Ernesto is expected to approach Bermuda late Friday and be near 
the island Saturday and Saturday night.  A prolonged period of 
strong winds and storm surge is expected on Bermuda beginning late 
Friday, and a hurricane warning has been issued for the island.  
Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to 
completion.

2. Rainfall associated with Ernesto is expected to begin to affect 
Bermuda later today and may result in flash flooding Friday through 
this weekend.
 
3. Even though Ernesto is forecast to remain well offshore the U.S.
East Coast, swells generated by the storm are expected to reach the
area late this week and into the weekend.  Beach goers should be
aware of a significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip
currents, and stay out of the water if advised by lifeguards.  Surf
and rip currents are also possible on the Virgin Islands, Puerto
Rico, the Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos, and the Bahamas
during the next few days.
