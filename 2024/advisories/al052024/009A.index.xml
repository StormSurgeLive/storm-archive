DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ernesto was 
located near latitude 18.4 North, longitude 64.7 West. Ernesto is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 18 mph (30 km/h). A turn 
toward the northwest with a gradual decrease in forward speed is 
expected overnight, followed by a turn toward the north-northwest 
and north Wednesday night and Thursday. On the forecast track, the 
center of Ernesto should pass just to the northeast and north of 
Puerto Rico tonight and on Wednesday. Ernesto should then move over 
the western Atlantic later in the week and approach Bermuda on 
Friday and Friday night.
 
Aircraft data indicate that maximum sustained winds have increased 
to near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher gusts. Strengthening is 
forecast during the next several days. Ernesto is expected to become 
a hurricane later tonight or early Wednesday to the north of the 
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) 
from the center. A National Ocean Service station in Charlotte 
Amalie, St. Thomas, recently reported a wind gust of 43 mph (69 
km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches) 
based on Hurricane Hunter aircraft data.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Ernesto is expected to produce total rain 
accumulations of 4 to 6 inches over portions of the Leeward Islands 
from St. Kitts and Nevis to St. Martin and across the U.S. and 
British Virgin Islands. Rainfall totals of 6 to 8 inches, with 
maximum amounts of 10 inches, are expected across southeastern 
Puerto Rico, with totals of 2 to 4 inches across northwestern Puerto 
Rico.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Ernesto, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occurring over the Virgin 
Islands and will spread over Puerto Rico, Vieques, and Culebra 
during the next several hours. Hurricane conditions are possible 
over the Virgin Islands, Vieques, and Culebra tonight.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level for the eastern coast of Puerto Rico
from San Juan to Guayama, including the islands of Culebra and
Vieques and in the U.S. Virgin Islands, including St. Thomas, St.
John, and St. Croix.
 
A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet
above normal tide levels in the British Virgin Islands. Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. These swells
will reach the Dominican Republic tonight, the Turks and Caicos
Islands and southeastern Bahamas on Wednesday, and Bermuda and the
rest of the Bahamas on Thursday. Swells are also expected to reach
the east coast of the United States Thursday night and continue into
the weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Ernesto Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Tropical Storm Ernesto Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
500 PM AST Tue Aug 13 2024
 
Ernesto's structure continues to gradually increase in organization. 
There has been some indication of dry air within the circulation 
and possibly some westerly shear--likely related to the system's 
continued fast motion--but the maximum winds have been increasing 
during the day nonetheless.  An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft measured peak 850-mb flight-level winds of 57 kt and 
believable SFMR winds of 45-50 kt northeast of the center, and 
dropsonde data showed that the central pressure had fallen to 1001 
mb.  Based on these data, the initial intensity is set at 50 kt.  
Some satellite estimates suggest the intensity could be slightly 
higher, but there will be both Air Force and NOAA aircraft in the 
storm later this evening to confirm these trends.
 
The recent aircraft fixes indicate that Ernesto continues to turn 
to the right and is moving west-northwestward, or 300/16 kt.  This 
turn is expected to continue for the next couple of days as Ernesto 
moves toward a break in the western Atlantic subtropical ridge.  On 
this track, Ernesto's center should pass over the Virgin Islands 
later this evening and then pass northeast and north of Puerto Rico 
overnight and on Wednesday.   A northward to north-northeastward
motion is forecast after 48 hours as Ernesto interacts with a
deep-layer trough off the U.S. East Coast, but this trough ends up
bypassing Ernesto, resulting in the storm slowing down a bit when
it is in the vicinity of Bermuda.  The track guidance continues to 
be very consistent, and again no significant changes were required 
to the official track forecast compared to the previous issuance.
 
Very warm sea surface temperatures and generally low shear favor 
continued strengthening over the next few days.  SHIPS and the HFIP 
Corrected Consensus models continue to suggest that Ernesto could 
reach hurricane strength by 12 hours, and several of the Rapid 
Intensification (RI) indices are still well above climatology.  As a 
result, the NHC intensity forecast shows Ernesto becoming a 
hurricane by tonight and then peaking at an intensity at or just 
below major hurricane strength in 60-72 hours.  Since there is some 
chance of Ernesto becoming a hurricane while it is near the Virgin 
Islands, a Hurricane Watch remains in effect for the Virgin Islands, 
Culebra, and Vieques.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue over portions
of the northern Leeward Islands this evening and spread westward to 
the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico this evening and tonight.  
Hurricane conditions are also possible on the Virgin Islands, 
Culebra, and Vieques this evening and tonight.
 
2. Heavy rainfall may result in locally considerable flash flooding 
and mudslides in areas of the Leeward Islands through this evening, 
and over the Virgin Islands into Puerto Rico by this evening 
through Wednesday.
 
3. Ernesto is likely to bring impacts to Bermuda late this week,
and interests there should monitor the progress of this system.

4. Swells generated by Ernesto are expected to affect portions of 
the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, the Turks 
and Caicos, and the Bahamas during the next few days and then reach 
the east coast of the United States and Bermuda late this week and 
into the weekend.  These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
