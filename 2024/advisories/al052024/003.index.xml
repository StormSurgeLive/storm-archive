DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the disturbance was centered near latitude
14.4 North, longitude 52.5 West. The system is moving toward the
west near 25 mph (41 km/h) and this motion is expected to continue 
with some decrease in forward speed during the next couple of days.  
On the forecast track, the disturbance is expected to move across 
portions of the Leeward Islands on Tuesday and approach the U.S. 
and British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico Tuesday evening.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and 
the disturbance is expected to become a tropical depression later 
today or tonight and become a tropical storm as it nears the 
Leeward Islands.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1009 mb (29.80 inches). A 
NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate the 
system this morning.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone Five can be found in
the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO
header WTNT45 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
RAINFALL: Potential Tropical Cyclone Five is expected to produce 
total rain accumulations of 4 to 6 inches over portions of the 
Leeward Islands. For Puerto Rico, 3 to 6 inches of rainfall, with 
maximum amounts of 10 inches, is expected.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Potential Tropical Cyclone Five, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
Elsewhere in the Caribbean, Potential Tropical Cyclone Five is 
expected to produce the following rain accumulations through Friday 
morning:
Windward Islands… 1 to 4 inches
Eastern Hispaniola… 2 to 4 inches 
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
beginning late tonight or Tuesday.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 
to 3 feet above ground level for the eastern coast of Puerto Rico 
from San Juan to Guayama, including the islands of Culebra and 
Vieques and in the U.S. Virgin Islands, including St. Thomas, St. 
John, and St. Croix.

A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet 
above normal tide levels in the British Virgin Islands.  Near the 
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large
and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the system will likely begin to affect
portions of the Leeward Islands beginning tonight. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Potential Tropical Cyclone Five Forecast Discussion Number 3</title>

Potential Tropical Cyclone Five Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
500 AM AST Mon Aug 12 2024

Satellite imagery and surface observations from NOAA buoy 41040 
indicate that the tropical wave east of the Lesser Antilles doe not 
have a well-defined circulation, and that the convection is not 
well organized.  However, these observations also suggest the 
possibility that a new center may be trying to form to the west or 
northwest of the advisory position.  Until that is confirmed by 
either daylight satellite imagery or an upcoming Hurricane Hunter 
flight, the system will remain at potential tropical cyclone 
status.  The initial intensity is a possibly conservative 25 kt.
 
The initial motion is a fast 280/22 kt.  A mid-level ridge is 
forecast to remain in place to the north of the potential tropical 
cyclone for the next 24-36 hours, which should more or less 
maintain the current heading during that period with some decrease 
in forward speed.  After that, a mid-latitude trough moving 
eastward from the eastern United States is forecast to create a 
large break in the subtropical ridge, with the system turning 
northwestward and northward into the break.  While the model 
guidance is generally in good agreement with this scenario, there 
is still uncertainty on where the predominant center will 
eventually form, and this will affect where the system may track 
with respect to the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto 
Rico.  The new forecast track has only minor adjustments from the 
previous forecast.

Based on the disturbance's currently disorganized state and 
continued easterly shear, the intensity forecast during the first 
36 h has been nudged downward.  However the system is still 
expected to become a tropical storm near or over the Leeward 
Islands.  Environmental conditions become more favorable for 
development after 24-36 hr, and the intensity forecast shows 
significant strengthening during that time.  This portion of the 
new intensity forecast is similar to the previous forecast.


Key Messages:
 
1. The disturbance is expected to become a tropical storm before or 
as it reaches the Leeward Islands, where Tropical Storm Watches are 
in effect.  Tropical storm conditions could begin on Tuesday for
portions of the area.
 
2. Heavy rainfall may result in locally considerable flash flooding 
and mudslides in areas of the Leeward Islands by later today into 
Wednesday, and over Puerto Rico late Tuesday into Thursday.
 
3. A Tropical Storm Watch has been issued for Puerto Rico and the 
nearby islands.  Additional watches and warnings will likely be 
required for portions of the northeastern Caribbean later today.
