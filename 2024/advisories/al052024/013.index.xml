WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Bermuda Weather Service has issued a Hurricane Watch for
Bermuda.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was
located near latitude 21.7 North, longitude 68.3 West.  Ernesto is
moving toward the northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h).  A turn toward 
the north-northwest and north is expected tonight and on Thursday.  
A northward to northeastward motion at a slower forward speed is 
expected Friday and Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Ernesto is expected to pass near Bermuda on Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, 
and Ernesto could become a major hurricane by Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 989 mb (29.21 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible on Bermuda Saturday, with
tropical storm conditions possible by Friday afternoon.
 
RAINFALL: Ernesto is expected to produce total rain accumulations 
of 3 to 6 inches on Bermuda with isolated maximum amounts of 9 
inches.  This rainfall may result in considerable life-threatening 
flash flooding.

Rainfall is expected to diminish this evening across Puerto Rico and 
the U.S. and British Virgin Islands.  Total rainfall amounts from 
Ernesto are expected to be in the 6 to 10 inch range, with maximum 
amounts of 12 inches across southern to eastern Puerto Rico, 3 to 6 
inches across northwestern Puerto Rico, and 4 to 6 inches across the 
U.S and British Virgin Islands.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Hurricane Ernesto, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the
northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the
Dominican Republic, and the Turks and Caicos Islands.  These swells
will reach the southeastern Bahamas tonight, and Bermuda and the
rest of the Bahamas on Thursday.  Swells are expected to reach the
east coast of the United States Thursday night and continue into the
weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Hurricane Ernesto Forecast Discussion Number 13</title>

Hurricane Ernesto Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
500 PM AST Wed Aug 14 2024
 
Visible satellite imagery shows that Ernesto's cloud field is 
gradually expanding, and there have been hints of an eye potentially 
forming in the Central Dense Overcast.  The Air Force Reserve 
mission from a few hours ago found that the central pressure had 
fallen to 989 mb, but there were no indications that the maximum 
winds were any higher than 65 kt.  The initial intensity is 
therefore held at that level, which is also supported by the latest 
satellite intensity estimates.

Ernesto is still moving northwestward but continues to turn to the 
right, and the initial motion is 325/14 kt.  A turn toward the 
north-northwest and north is expected tonight and on Thursday as 
the hurricane moves through a break in the subtropical ridge, but 
the trough causing this break is forecast to leave Ernesto behind 
later in the week.  The result is that Ernesto is likely to slow 
down while it passes very near Bermuda Friday night and Saturday.  
Thereafter, a second trough approaching from the west should cause 
Ernesto to accelerate toward the northeast, near or just south of 
Atlantic Canada.  The track models are in very good agreement on 
this scenario, but there is a bit of east-to-west spread after 48 
hours.  The new NHC track forecast has been nudged eastward after 
48 hours to be close to the multi-model consensus aids, although at 
this time it is too soon to know exactly how close Ernesto's center 
will move to Bermuda this weekend.
 
An environment of warm ocean waters (around 29 degrees Celsius) and 
low to moderate shear should allow Ernesto to strengthen gradually 
during the next few days.  Most of the intensity models indicate 
that the hurricane should peak in intensity in about 48 hours.  At 
that time, the official forecast shows a peak of 100 kt--major 
hurricane--which is near the top end of the guidance and close to 
the HAFS-B, COAMPS-TC, and HCCA models.  A weakening trend should 
begin after 48 hours due to moderate shear and a drier, more stable 
atmosphere, but the weakening is likely to be gradual.  As a result, 
the official forecast keeps Ernesto as a hurricane throughout the 
5-day forecast period.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane conditions are possible on Bermuda on Saturday, with 
tropical storm conditions possible by Friday afternoon.  Rainfall 
associated with Ernesto may begin to affect Bermuda as early as 
Thursday and result in flash flooding across Bermuda later in the 
week and this weekend.
 
2. Heavy rainfall will be diminishing across Puerto Rico into the 
Virgin Islands this evening.  Locally considerable flash flooding 
and mudslides will continue through tonight over the Virgin Islands 
and into portions of Puerto Rico.
 
3. Even though Ernesto is forecast to remain well offshore the U.S.
East Coast, swells generated by the storm are expected to reach the
area late this week and into the weekend.  Beach goers should be
aware of a significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip
currents, and stay out of the water if advised by lifeguards.  Surf
and rip currents are also possible on the Virgin Islands, Puerto
Rico, the Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos, and the Bahamas
during the next few days.
