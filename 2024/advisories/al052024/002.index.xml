Virgin Islands Tuesday evening.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast, and the system is expected
to become a tropical storm by late Monday.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1009 mb (29.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone Five can be found in
the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO
header WTNT45 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.

RAINFALL: Potential Tropical Cyclone Five is expected to produce
total rain accumulations of 4 to 6 inches over the northern Leeward
Islands. For Puerto Rico, 3 to 6 inches of rainfall, with maximum
amounts of 10 inches, is expected.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Potential Tropical Cyclone Five, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
Elsewhere in the Caribbean, Potential Tropical Cyclone Five is
expected to produce the following rain accumulations through Friday
morning:
Windward Islands... 1 to 2 inches
Southern Leeward Islands... 2 to 4 inches
Eastern Hispaniola... 2 to 4 inches
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area beginning Tuesday.

STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 
to 3 feet above ground level in the U.S. Virgin Islands, including 
St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix.

A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet 
above normal tide levels in the British Virgin Islands.  Near the 
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by the system will likely begin to affect
portions of the Leeward Islands beginning Monday night. These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.

<title>Potential Tropical Cyclone Five Forecast Discussion Number 1</title>

Potential Tropical Cyclone Five Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
500 PM AST Sun Aug 11 2024

NHC has been monitoring the a broad area of low pressure associated 
with a tropical wave over the tropical Atlantic during the past 
several days.  Satellite images and earlier ASCAT data indicate that 
the low has a broad circulation, but there is no evidence of a 
well-defined center yet.  The associated shower and thunderstorm 
activity is showing some signs of organization, but visible 
satellite imagery suggests that dry air is entraining into the 
circulation.  However, since the disturbance is forecast to become 
a tropical storm in the next day or so, and there is a risk of 
tropical-storm-force winds across portions of the Leeward Islands 
during that time, advisories are being initiated on Potential 
Tropical Cyclone Five.  The NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunters 
will be investigating this system on Monday.

The estimated motion of Potential Tropical Cyclone Five is 
285/18-kt.  The track guidance is in fairly good agreement on a fast 
west-northwestward motion through the next 36-48 h.  This motion 
should bring the system near or over the Leeward Islands on Tuesday. 
Thereafter, a deep-layer trough moving off the U.S. East Coast 
should approach this system, inducing a turn to the northwest by 
Wednesday and to the north thereafter.  This should bring the 
system in the general vicinity of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico 
Tuesday night, then emerging into the Atlantic north of Puerto Rico 
on Wednesday.  The NHC track forecast is based on a blend of the 
latest GFS and ECMWF models.  Users should keep in mind that the 
track forecasts for potential tropical cyclones are inherently more 
uncertain than normal since the system lacks a well–defined center.

Potential Tropical Cyclone Five is currently located in an 
environment of moderate easterly vertical wind shear.  Over the next 
day or two, the wind shear is forecast to decrease some while the 
disturbance moves into an increasingly unstable environment.  Given 
the current organizational state of the convection and low-level 
wind structure, the system likely needs at least one more day before 
it can organize into a tropical cyclone.  Around the time the system 
reaches the Leeward Islands, it will be moving into an increasingly 
conducive environment for strengthening.  Therefore, once the system 
is able to develop an inner core it should have an opportunity to 
strengthen at a faster rate.  The favorable environment will likely 
continue in the 3 to 5-day time frame, and this system is forecast 
to be a strengthening hurricane when it is moving northward over the 
western Atlantic.  The NHC intensity forecast is slightly below the 
intensity consensus in the short term, but falls in line with the 
consensus aids beyond a couple of days.


Key Messages:

1. The disturbance is expected to become a tropical storm before 
reaching the Leeward Islands, where Tropical Storm Watches are in 
effect.  Tropical storm conditions could begin on Tuesday for 
portions of the area.

2. Heavy rainfall may result in locally considerable flash flooding 
and mudslides in portions of the northern Leeward Islands Tuesday 
and Wednesday, and into Puerto Rico Wednesday through Thursday.

3. Additional watches or warnings will likely be required for the 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico tonight or early 
Monday, and interests in these locations should monitor the progress 
of this system.
