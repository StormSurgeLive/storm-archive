WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests in Atlantic Canada should monitor the progress of Ernesto.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was 
located near latitude 32.6 North, longitude 64.6 West. Ernesto is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected today.  A faster northeastward motion is 
then expected late this weekend into early next week.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Ernesto is expected to slowly depart 
Bermuda today and move near or east of Newfoundland Monday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast today.  Some 
re-intensification is possible late in the weekend before weakening 
begins on Monday.
 
Ernesto is a large tropical cyclone. Hurricane-force winds extend
outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from the center and tropical-storm-
force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data is 
974 mb (28.76 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected on Bermuda through the
next several hours.  Due to Ernesto's large size and slow motion,
strong winds will continue on the island through most of today into 
this evening.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding on Bermuda in areas of onshore winds.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: Ernesto is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
6 to 9 inches or 150 to 225 mm on Bermuda. This rainfall will likely
result in considerable life-threatening flash flooding, especially
in low-lying areas on the island.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the the
Bahamas, Bermuda, and the east coast of the United States. These
swells will likely reach portions of Atlantic Canada today.
Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are likely in these
areas during the next couple of days.  Please consult products from
your local weather office, and stay out of the water if advised by
lifeguards.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Hurricane Ernesto Forecast Discussion Number 23</title>

Hurricane Ernesto Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
500 AM AST Sat Aug 17 2024
 
Satellite and surface observations indicate that the center of 
Ernesto made landfall on the western side of Bermuda at about 430 AM 
AST, with the National Museum of Bermuda recently reporting light 
winds and a central pressure of 972 mb.  The system overall has 
become less organized as drier air has infiltrated much of the 
circulation's southern semicircle.  Earlier aircraft reconnaissance 
data supported 75-80 kt as an initial intensity, and with the 
degradation in the satellite imagery, 75 kt is chosen as the current 
intensity (and operational landfall intensity).  The Air Force 
Hurricane Hunters should be out again in a few hours to sample the 
cyclone.
 
While the current moderate shear is forecast to weaken today, it 
will take some time for the vortex to recover from the dry air as 
it moves across warm waters north of Bermuda.  Thus little change in
intensity is anticipated in the short term, and re-strengthening
could begin tomorrow.  This should be a fairly short-lived window,
however, since Ernesto will be crossing the north wall of the Gulf
Stream on Monday while moving into a strong wind shear environment.
Therefore, steady weakening is forecast for the work week, and
Ernesto is expected to complete extratropical transition near or
just east of Newfoundland. The NHC intensity forecast is largely
an update of the previous one, a bit lower in the short-term to
account for recent guidance.
 
Ernesto has turned more to the north-northeast overnight and slowed
down to about 8 kt.  The motion should creep in that direction today
as the hurricane is stuck in an area of lighter steering currents,
waiting for the next trough to move off the U.S. East coast.  This
slow motion and Ernesto's large size will cause a long duration of
impacts through tonight on Bermuda.  The trough should force the
cyclone to accelerate northeastward later in the weekend and early
next week, taking Ernesto near Newfoundland Monday night.  The
guidance is again slower than the previous cycle, so the NHC track
forecast is trended in that direction. Global model fields depict
that Ernesto should open into a trough, or become absorbed in a
larger polar low by 120 h over the northern Atlantic ocean, thus the
NHC forecast now shows the system dissipated at that time.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Ernesto is expected to bring periods of strong winds, storm
surge and battering waves on Bermuda through tonight.  A hurricane
warning is in effect for the island, and residents there should
listen to orders from local officials.
 
2. Heavy rainfall from Ernesto will continue to impact Bermuda
through tonight and will likely result in considerable life-
threatening flash flooding, especially in low-lying areas on the
island.
 
3. Even though Ernesto is forecast to remain well offshore the U.S.
East Coast, swells generated by the hurricane are expected to affect
the area through the weekend.  Beach goers should be aware of a
significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents, and stay
out of the water if advised by lifeguards.  Surf and rip currents
are also possible on the Bahamas, Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada
during the next few days.
 
4. Interests in Atlantic Canada should monitor the progress of
Ernesto.
