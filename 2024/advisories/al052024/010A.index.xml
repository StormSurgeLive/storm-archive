DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ernesto was
located by San Juan radar near latitude 19.0 North, longitude 66.0 
West. Ernesto is moving toward the northwest near 16 mph (25 km/h). 
A turn toward the north-northwest and north with a gradual decrease 
in forward speed is expected tonight and Thursday. On the 
forecast track, the center of Ernesto will pass to the north of 
Puerto Rico through today. Ernesto should then move over the
western Atlantic later in the week and approach Bermuda on Friday
and Friday night.
 
Surface observations indicate that the maximum sustained winds have 
increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher gusts. Strengthening 
is forecast during the next several days, and Ernesto is expected 
to become a hurricane later this morning and could become a major 
hurricane in a couple of days. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center. A WeatherFlow station (XCUL) on Culebra recently
reported a sustained wind of 68 mph (109 km/h) and a gust of 86 mph
(139 km/h).  A NOAA Saildrone located about 70 miles north- 
northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico, recently reported a sustained 
wind of 52 mph (84 km/h) with a gust to 63 mph (101 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
RAINFALL: Ernesto is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
4 to 6 inches over the U.S and British Virgin Islands. Rainfall
totals of 6 to 8 inches, with maximum amounts of 10 inches, are
expected across southeastern Puerto Rico, with totals of 2 to 4
inches across northwestern Puerto Rico.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Ernesto, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions will continue spreading across the
Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Vieques, and Culebra through the
overnight hours. Hurricane conditions are possible in portions of
the watch area during the next few hours.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level for the eastern coast of Puerto Rico
from San Juan to Guayama, including the islands of Culebra and
Vieques and in the U.S. Virgin Islands, including St. Thomas, St.
John, and St. Croix.
 
A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet
above normal tide levels in the British Virgin Islands. Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and the Dominican 
Republic. These swells will reach the Turks and Caicos Islands and 
southeastern Bahamas today, and Bermuda and the rest of the Bahamas 
on Thursday. Swells are expected to reach the east coast of the 
United States Thursday night and continue into the weekend. These 
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Tropical Storm Ernesto Forecast Discussion Number 10</title>
<description>Issued at 1100 PM AST Tue Aug 13 2024  <![CDATA[<pre>

Tropical Storm Ernesto Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
1100 PM AST Tue Aug 13 2024

Aircraft data, surface observations, and NWS radar images indicate 
Ernesto passed over the Virgin Islands around 00 UTC this evening. 
The tropical cyclone remains asymmetric, as NOAA Tail Doppler Radar 
data show the strongest winds and heaviest rainfall are generally 
confined to the northern and eastern semicircles of the storm. Data 
from the NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunters indicate the central 
pressure of Ernesto has fallen to around 998-999 mb, and an earlier 
aircraft pass through the eastern part of the storm found peak 
700-mb flight-level winds of 60 kt. Based on these data, the initial 
intensity is set at 55 kt, which matches the latest Dvorak current 
intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB.

The latest aircraft fixes and radar data show Ernesto has turned 
northwestward (305/15 kt). Overnight, Ernesto will move away from 
the Virgin Islands and pass to the northeast and north of Puerto 
Rico. Then, Ernesto is expected to move northwestward to northward 
during the next couple of days toward a break in the subtropical 
ridge. By late week, the influence of a deep-layer trough over the 
western Atlantic should cause Ernesto to turn north-northeastward, 
although the cyclone is forecast to slow down a bit after the trough 
passes to its north. There are no notable changes to the NHC track 
forecast, with Ernesto forecast to make its closest approach to 
Bermuda Friday night into Saturday. 

The radar structure of Ernesto indicates it has not yet solidified 
an inner core. However, once this occurs, the atmospheric and 
oceanic conditions appear conducive for significant strengthening 
over the next few days. Most of the hurricane regional models and 
statistical guidance show Ernesto becoming a major hurricane over 
the western Atlantic late this week, and the global models 
(particularly the GFS) show significant deepening of the low. Based 
on the latest guidance trends, the NHC intensity forecast has been 
raised slightly during the middle portion of the forecast period and 
now shows Ernesto becoming a major hurricane on Friday.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue over the 
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico through early Wednesday, with 
hurricane conditions possible on the Virgin Islands, Culebra, and 
Vieques.
 
2. Heavy rainfall may result in locally considerable flash flooding 
and mudslides over the Virgin Islands and into portions of Puerto 
Rico tonight through Wednesday.
 
3. Ernesto is likely to bring impacts to Bermuda late this week,
and interests there should monitor the progress of this system.
 
4. Swells generated by Ernesto are expected to affect portions of 
the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, the Turks 
and Caicos, and the Bahamas during the next few days, and then reach 
the east coast of the United States and Bermuda late this week and 
into the weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening 
surf and rip current conditions.
