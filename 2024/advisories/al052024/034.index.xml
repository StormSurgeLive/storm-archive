...DANGEROUS BEACH CONDITIONS CONTINUING ALONG THE NORTHEAST
U.S. COAST AND ATLANTIC CANADA...
...ERNESTO PASSING SOUTH OF SOUTHEASTERN NEWFOUNDLAND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...45.7N 53.1W
ABOUT 70 MI...110 KM S OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...80 MPH...130 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 50 DEGREES AT 35 MPH...56 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...973 MB...28.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in southeastern Newfoundland should monitor the progress
of Ernesto until the center moves into the open Atlantic.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was
located near latitude 45.7 North, longitude 53.1 West. Ernesto is
moving toward the northeast near 35 mph (56 km/h).  An even faster
motion to the northeast or east-northeast is expected during the
next couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of Ernesto
is currently near its closest approach to Newfoundland, and it 
should move into the open Atlantic on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are now near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Steady to rapid weakening is forecast, and Ernesto is
expected to become a post-tropical cyclone Tuesday or Tuesday night.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles
(350 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 973 mb (28.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting Bermuda, the
northeast coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada. The 
swells and the associated life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions should gradually subside during the next day or so.  In 
southeastern Newfoundland large breaking waves could bring the 
possibility of coastal flooding, particularly along southwest-facing 
shorelines from Burin east to Avalon regions.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office, and stay out of the water 
if advised by lifeguards.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Hurricane Ernesto Discussion Number  34
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
1100 PM AST Mon Aug 19 2024

Satellite imagery shows that the convective structure of Ernesto is 
decaying due to increasing shear and passage over colder water, 
with most of the remaining convection now in the northeastern 
quadrant.  However, Canadian radar shows the remaining convection 
still has a good tropical cyclone banding pattern.  Satellite 
intensity estimates were mostly near 75 kt at 00Z, and based on the 
loss of organization since that time the initial intensity is 
decreased to 70 kt.

Ernesto should continue steady to rapid weakening due to shear and 
cold water.  The new intensity forecast has the cyclone losing its 
remaining convection and becoming a post-tropical low by 24 h. 
However, this could be generous, and the system could become 
post-tropical at any time.  After 24 h, Ernesto is going to become 
involved with a large baroclinic low developing near Iceland, and 
as this occurs it is likely to develop or merge with a frontal zone 
to become extratropical.  The system is expected to degenerate to a 
trough on the south side of the larger low by 48 h.

The hurricane is now accelerating northeastward with the initial 
motion of 050/30 kt.  The strong flow between an approaching mid- to
upper-level trough over the eastern U.S. and a ridge over the
subtropical central Atlantic should cause the cyclone to accelerate
even more during the next 24 h, and a rapid east-northeastward 
motion should continue as the baroclinic low becomes the 
predominant steering influence. The NHC track forecast remains near 
the middle of the tightly clustered models and has no significant 
change since the previous advisory.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. The effects of swells generated by Ernesto on the coasts of 
Bermuda, the northeast U.S., and Atlantic Canada should diminish 
during the next day or so.  Until then, beach goers should be aware 
that there still could be a significant risk of life-threatening 
surf and rip currents and should stay out of the water if advised by 
lifeguards.
 
2. Ernesto will likely bring some wind, wave, and rain impacts to
portions of southeastern Newfoundland during the next several hours.
Breaking waves could bring the possibility of coastal flooding,
particularly along southwest-facing shorelines from Bunin east to
Avalon regions. For additional impact specific information, please
see statements issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre.
