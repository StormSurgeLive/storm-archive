Hurricane Ernesto Advisory Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
1100 PM AST Sun Aug 18 2024
 
...ERNESTO STRENGTHENS A LITTLE...
...DANGEROUS BEACH CONDITIONS OCCURING ALONG THE U.S. EAST COAST AND
ATLANTIC CANADA THROUGH EARLY THIS WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...38.5N 61.4W
ABOUT 435 MI...700 KM SSE OF HALIFAX NOVA SCOTIA
ABOUT 705 MI...1135 KM SW OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...80 MPH...130 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 30 DEGREES AT 20 MPH...31 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...975 MB...28.80 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in southeastern Newfoundland should monitor the progress
of Ernesto.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was
located near latitude 38.5 North, longitude 61.4 West. Ernesto is
moving toward the north-northeast near 20 mph (31 km/h), and this
motion with some increase in forward speed is expected tonight.
A turn toward the northeast and east-northeast and an additional
increase in forward speed are expected on Monday and Tuesday. On
the forecast track, the center of Ernesto will pass near
southeastern Newfoundland late Monday into Tuesday morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some additional strengthening is possible tonight.  After
that, Ernesto should weaken, and the cyclone is forecast to become
post-tropical on Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles
(350 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 975 mb (28.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the
Bahamas, Bermuda, the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic
Canada.  Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are likely
to continue in these areas during the next couple of days.  In
southeastern Newfoundland large breaking waves could bring the
possibility of coastal flooding, particularly along southwest-facing
shorelines from Burin east to Avalon regions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office, and stay out of the water
if advised by lifeguards.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Hurricane Ernesto Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
1100 PM AST Sun Aug 18 2024
 
Ernesto continues to have a good structure this evening with a
partly cloud-filled eye surrounded by bands of convection, although 
the convective cloud tops are not quite as cold as they were 6 h 
ago. Subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB are now
near 65 kt, while various objective estimates are now near 75 kt.
The initial intensity is increased to 70 kt based on a blend of
these data.
 
Some additional strengthening is possible during the next 6-12 h
before Ernesto moves north of the north wall of the Gulf Stream.
After that, the system should quickly decay as it moves over colder
water and encounters increasing southwesterly shear.  The cyclone
should become an extratropical low by 36 h as it passes south of
southeastern Newfoundland, and by 72 h it should be absorbed into a
larger non-tropical low developing south of Iceland.  The new
intensity forecast is near the upper edge of the intensity guidance
for the first 12 h, and after that lies near the intensity
consensus.
 
The initial motion is now 030/17 kt. A northeastward motion at a
faster forward speed is expected over the next 24-36 h as Ernesto
becomes caught up in the flow between a large deep-layer trough
over the eastern U.S. and a subtropical ridge centered to the
hurricane's southeast. This motion should bring the center south
of southeastern Newfoundland late Monday night or early Tuesday
morning, with most of the wind field staying offshore.  A more
east-northeastward motion is expected thereafter before the cyclone
becomes absorbed by the aforementioned larger extratropical
cyclone. The tightly clustered track guidance has shifted a little 
to the north since the last advisory, so the new track forecast is a
little north of the previous track.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Even though Ernesto is forecast to remain well offshore of the
U.S. East Coast, swells generated by the hurricane will continue to
affect the area through the early part of this week.  Beach goers
should be aware that there is a significant risk of life-threatening
surf and rip currents, and should stay out of the water if advised
by lifeguards.  Surf and rip currents are also possible on the
Bahamas, Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada during the next few days.
 
2. Ernesto could bring wind, wave, and rain impacts to portions of
southeastern Newfoundland Monday night into Tuesday morning.
Breaking waves could bring the possibility of coastal flooding,
particularly along southwest-facing shorelines from Bunin east to
Avalon regions. For additional impact specific information, please
see statements issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre.
