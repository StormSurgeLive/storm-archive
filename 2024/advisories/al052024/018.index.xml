WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was 
located near latitude 27.1 North, longitude 68.1 West. Ernesto is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 14 mph (22 km/h). This 
general motion is expected to continue through Friday, followed by a 
slower north-northeastward motion on Saturday.  A faster 
northeastward motion is expected later in the weekend.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Ernesto is expected to pass near or 
over Bermuda on Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 100 mph (155 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast during the 
next day or so, and Ernesto could be near major hurricane strength 
on Friday.  Ernesto is forecast to be a large hurricane near 
Bermuda on Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 265 miles
(425 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on data from an Air 
Force Hurricane Hurricane aircraft is 968 mb (28.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected on Bermuda Saturday, with
tropical storm conditions likely beginning Friday afternoon.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding on Bermuda in areas of onshore winds.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: Ernesto is expected to produce total rain accumulations 
of 6 to 12 inches on Bermuda with isolated maximum amounts up to 15 
inches.  This rainfall may result in considerable life-threatening 
flash flooding.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the 
Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, and are beginning to reach 
Bermuda.  Swells are expected to reach the east coast of the United 
States overnight and continue into the weekend, and could reach 
portions of Atlantic Canada by late Saturday.  These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. 
Please consult products from your local weather office, and stay out 
of the water if advised by lifeguards.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Hurricane Ernesto Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
1100 PM AST Thu Aug 15 2024
 
Ernesto has been strengthening this evening.  Data from an Air
Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the minimum pressure
has fallen to about 968 mb, and a blend of the peak flight-level
and SFMR winds support increasing the initial intensity to 85 kt.
This makes Ernesto a category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Ernesto has a ragged eye and a large wind
field, with the highest winds occurring in the northeast quadrant.
 
Ernesto is moving north-northeastward at 12 kt in the flow between
a high pressure system over the central Atlantic and a large-scale
trough off the U.S. east coast.  This general motion is expected to
continue for the next day or two, bringing the hurricane near or
over Bermuda on Saturday.  Around that time, the trough is expected
to lift out, leaving Ernesto in weaker steering currents.  As a
result, a slower and likely more erratic motion to the north or
north-northeast is forecast over the weekend.  Another trough is
expected to approach the cyclone late in the weekend, and that
should cause an accelerated motion to the northeast near or east of
Atlantic Canada early next week.  The NHC track forecast is a touch
to the east and a little slower than the previous one through its
passage near Bermuda to come into better agreement with the latest
consensus aids.
 
It seems likely that Ernesto will strengthen some more during the
next 12 to 24 hours as it is expected to remain in conducive
environmental conditions of low wind shear, upper-level diffluence,
a relatively moist airmass, and over warm waters during that time.
Thereafter, increasing vertical wind shear and gradually cooler
waters should cause a slow weakening trend.  However, baroclinic
influences could offset some of the weakening, which is why the
official forecast shows little change in strength during the 48- to
72-hour time frame.  Ernesto is forecast to complete extratropical
transition by day 5, when it will likely be embedded within the
mid-latitude westerlies.  The NHC intensity forecast lies near the
high end of the guidance, in best agreement with the HCCA model.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Ernesto is moving toward Bermuda, and it is expected to bring a 
prolonged period of strong winds and storm surge on Bermuda from 
Friday afternoon through Saturday night. A hurricane warning is in 
effect for the island, and preparations to protect life and property 
should be rushed to completion.
 
2. Rainfall associated with Ernesto is expected to begin to affect
Bermuda overnight and may result in flash flooding Friday through
this weekend.
 
3. Even though Ernesto is forecast to remain well offshore the U.S.
East Coast, swells generated by the hurricane are expected to affect
the area through the weekend.  Beach goers should be aware of a
significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents, and stay
out of the water if advised by lifeguards.  Surf and rip currents
are also possible on the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, Bermuda,
and Atlantic Canada during the next few days.
