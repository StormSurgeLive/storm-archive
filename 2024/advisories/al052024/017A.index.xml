WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was
located near latitude 26.6 North, longitude 68.4 West. Ernesto is
moving toward the north near 13 mph (20 km/h).  This general motion
is expected to continue through early Friday, followed by a slower 
northeastward or north-northeastward motion late Friday and 
Saturday. A faster northeastward motion is expected later in 
the weekend.  On the forecast track, the center of Ernesto is 
expected to pass near or over Bermuda on Saturday.  
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 90 mph (150 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast during the 
next day or so, and Ernesto could be near major hurricane strength 
on Friday.  Ernesto is forecast to be a large hurricane near Bermuda 
on Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 265
miles (425 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on data from the Air 
Force Hurricane Hunters is 970 mb (28.64 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected on Bermuda Saturday, with
tropical storm conditions likely beginning Friday afternoon.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding on Bermuda in areas of onshore winds.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: Ernesto is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
6 to 12 inches on Bermuda with isolated maximum amounts up to 15
inches.  This rainfall may result in considerable life-threatening
flash flooding.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the 
Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, and are beginning to reach 
Bermuda.  Swells are expected to reach the east coast of the United 
States overnight and continue into the weekend. These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. 
Please consult products from your local weather office, and stay out 
of the water if advised by lifeguards.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Ernesto Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
500 PM AST Thu Aug 15 2024
 
The inner core of Ernesto continues to be plagued by dry air 
intrusion.  A NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported that Ernesto 
has yet to close off an eyewall.  While the minimum central sea 
level pressure has fallen to an estimated 972 mb based on dropsonde 
data, the maximum flight-level winds are still at 86 kt, similar to 
the earlier mission.  Therefore, the initial intensity is held at 
75 kt for this advisory cycle.

Ernesto has turned northward, with an estimated motion of 360/11 kt. 
The storm is currently being steered by the flow between the 
subtropical ridge centered over the north Atlantic Ocean and a 
mid-latitude trough just off the eastern seaboard of North America.  
This hurricane is expected to gradually turn more northeastward and 
slow down over the next day or so as the trough lifts out to the 
northeast.  A subsequent trough is forecast to approach the New 
England coast on Sunday and accelerate Ernesto off to the 
northeast.  The official track forecast is virtually unchanged from 
the previous prediction and lies between the various consensus aids. 
Based on the forecast, Ernesto is expected to pass near or over 
Bermuda on Saturday and near or east of Atlantic Canada on Monday.

Warm waters and relatively low vertical wind shear should allow 
Ernesto to gradually intensify over the next 12 hours or so.  
Still, the mid-level atmospheric moisture is expected to be marginal 
and the system could continue to experience dry air intrusions.  
Global models suggest that while the vertical wind shear could 
begin to increase within a day, Ernesto may be positioned in a 
region relative to the departing trough where it could capitalize on 
enhanced outflow and continue to strength.  By the weekend, 
atmospheric conditions should become less favorable and gradually 
weaken the hurricane.  Still, Ernesto is expected to remain a 
powerful hurricane as it moves north of Bermuda.  Little changes 
have been made to the latest NHC intensity forecast, which lies 
near the top of the model guidance envelope.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Ernesto is expected to approach Bermuda late Friday and be near
the island Saturday and Saturday night.  A prolonged period of
strong winds and storm surge is expected on Bermuda beginning late
Friday, and a hurricane warning is in effect for the island.
Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to
completion.
 
2. Rainfall associated with Ernesto is expected to begin to affect
Bermuda this evening and may result in flash flooding Friday through
this weekend.
 
3. Even though Ernesto is forecast to remain well offshore the U.S.
East Coast, swells generated by the storm are expected to reach the
area during the next few days, including over the weekend.  Beach
goers should be aware of a significant risk of life-threatening surf
and rip currents, and stay out of the water if advised by
lifeguards.  Surf and rip currents are also possible on the
Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, and Bermuda
during the next few days.
