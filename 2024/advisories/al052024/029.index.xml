...DANGEROUS BEACH CONDITIONS OCCURING ALONG THE U.S. EAST COAST AND
ATLANTIC CANADA THROUGH EARLY THIS WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...37.1N 62.3W
ABOUT 520 MI...840 KM S OF HALIFAX NOVA SCOTIA
ABOUT 815 MI...1310 KM SW OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 25 DEGREES AT 17 MPH...28 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...977 MB...28.85 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in southeastern Newfoundland should monitor the progress
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was 
located near latitude 37.1 North, longitude 62.3 West. Ernesto is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 17 mph (28 km/h) and this 
motion with some increase in forward speed is forecast tonight, 
followed by a turn toward the northeast and east-northeast on Monday 
and Tuesday. On the forecast track, the center of Ernesto will pass 
near southeastern Newfoundland late Monday into Tuesday morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Some additional intensification is forecast 
over the next 12 hours followed by weakening before Ernesto becomes 
a post-tropical cyclone on Tuesday. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles
(350 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 977 mb (28.85 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the
Bahamas, Bermuda, the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic
Canada.  Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are likely
to continue in these areas during the next couple of days.  In
southeastern Newfoundland large breaking waves could bring the
possibility of coastal flooding, particularly along southwest-facing
shorelines from Burin east to Avalon regions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office, and stay out of the water
if advised by lifeguards.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

<title>Hurricane Ernesto Forecast Discussion Number 28</title>

Tropical Storm Ernesto Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
1100 AM AST Sun Aug 18 2024
 
After struggling to produce a lot of deep central convection over 
the past 24 hours, Ernesto resembles more of a typical tropical 
cyclone this morning, as convection continues to burst and wrap 
around the center. There have also been hints of a cloud-filled eye 
feature showing up on visible satellite imagery. However, subjective 
and objective intensity estimates have not yet responded to the 
modest improvement in Ernesto's structure on satellite, and the 
initial intensity will remain just under hurricane intensity at   
60 kt this advisory. 

Ernesto has about a 12-18 h window to intensify back into a 
hurricane while the shear remains low, and sea-surface temperatures 
(SSTs) are between 27-28 C before the cyclone reaches the north wall 
of the Gulf Stream. After Ernesto crosses this feature, the SSTs 
sharply decrease and shear markedly increases, both which should 
initiate extratropical transition. This process should be complete 
in about 48 h with the cyclone opening up into a trough as it is 
absorbed by another extratropical cyclone beyond 72 h. The NHC 
intensity forecast is largely an update from the previous cycle, in 
good agreement with the intensity consensus guidance. 

The tropical cyclone is beginning to accelerate north-northeastward, 
estimated at 020/14 kt. There is little change in the forecast track 
thinking, with a large mid-latitude trough moving into the U.S. East 
Coast that, in combination with a large subtropical ridge to the 
southeast, is expected to cause Ernesto to increase in forward speed 
along with a turn more northeastward over the next couple of days. 
On this track, Ernesto should make its closest approach to 
Newfoundland just to the southeast early Tuesday morning, with the 
bulk of the cyclone's wind field staying offshore of the Canadian 
Provence. After post-tropical transition, the cyclone is expected to 
turn east-northeastward until its absorbed by a larger extratropical 
cyclone. The track guidance this cycle was a bit slower and touch 
further west early on, but ultimately the latest NHC track forecast 
ends up very close to the prior one after 24 h.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Even though Ernesto is forecast to remain well offshore of the 
U.S. East Coast, swells generated by the hurricane are expected to 
affect the area through the early part of this week.  Beach goers 
should be aware that there is a significant risk of life-threatening 
surf and rip currents, and should stay out of the water if advised 
by lifeguards.  Surf and rip currents are also possible on the 
Bahamas, Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada during the next few days.
 
2. Ernesto could bring wind, wave, and rain impacts to portions of 
southeastern Newfoundland Monday night into Tuesday morning. 
Breaking waves could bring the possibility of coastal flooding, 
particularly along southwest-facing shorelines from Bunin east to 
Avalon regions. For additional impact specific information, please 
see statements issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre.
