WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests in southeastern Newfoundland should monitor the progress 
of Ernesto.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was
located near latitude 32.9 North, longitude 64.4 West.  Ernesto is
moving toward the north-northeast near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue through early Sunday.  An 
acceleration toward the north-northeast should begin on Sunday, 
with a turn toward the northeast and east-northeast occurring late 
Monday into Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Ernesto 
will slowly move away from Bermuda today and pass near southeastern 
Newfoundland late Monday and Monday night.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast during the next 48
hours.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240
miles (390 km).  An elevated weather station at the National Museum 
of Bermuda recently reported a sustained wind of 62 mph (100 km/h) 
and a gust to 82 mph (132 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 974 mb (28.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane-force gusts are possible on Bermuda for a few more 
hours.  Tropical storm conditions are likely to continue through 
this evening or tonight.
 
STORM SURGE:  Significant coastal flooding is still possible on
Bermuda in areas of onshore winds.  Near the coast, the surge will
be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: Ernesto is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
6 to 9 inches or 150 to 225 mm in Bermuda. This rainfall will likely
result in considerable life-threatening flash flooding, especially
in low-lying areas on the island.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the
Bahamas, Bermuda, and the east coast of the United States and will
reach portions of Atlantic Canada today.  Life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions are likely in these areas during the next
couple of days.  Please consult products from your local weather
office, and stay out of the water if advised by lifeguards.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Ernesto Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
1100 AM AST Sat Aug 17 2024
 
An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft made a couple of 
passes through Ernesto this morning and only found 700-mb flight 
level winds as high as 74 kt--significantly lower than the maximum 
winds reported by the mission yesterday evening and overnight.  The 
initial intensity is therefore set at 70 kt for this advisory, and 
even that could be a bit generous.  Although the central pressure 
has not risen much, Ernesto's wind field has continued to expand, 
and the hurricane is now exhibiting a large rain-free center region 
that is just about to move past Bermuda.

The forward motion has slowed a bit more and is now estimated to be 
north-northeastward (025 degrees) at 7 kt.  Ernesto has been left 
behind by a shortwave trough now located near Newfoundland, and 
therefore a continued slow motion toward the north-northeast is 
forecast for the next day or so until another trough to the west 
gets closer.  Ernesto should begin accelerating on Sunday as it 
heads toward Atlantic Canada, turning northeastward and passing 
very near southeastern Newfoundland late Monday and Monday night.  
The guidance has again slowed down on this cycle, and the NHC 
forecast has been adjusted accordingly.

Although deep-layer shear is forecast to diminish a bit during the 
next 24 hours while Ernesto remains over waters of 28 degrees 
Celsius, the structure of the hurricane and dry air within the 
circulation suggest that the storm may not be able to re-intensity 
much, if at all.  The NHC intensity forecast is near the top end of 
the guidance and does keep Ernesto as a hurricane for the next 48 
hours.  Weakening is expected after that time, and global model 
fields suggest Ernesto should become extratropical by 72 hours 
while or just after passing Newfoundland.  A 96-hour point is 
provided for continuity, but both the GFS and ECMWF indicate that 
the circulation could open up into a trough over the north Atlantic 
by then.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Ernesto is moving slowly, and its impacts on Bermuda are 
not over.  Strong winds, heavy rainfall, coastal flooding, and 
battering waves are likely through tonight.  The heavy rains will 
likely result in considerable life-threatening flash flooding, 
especially in low-lying areas on the island.
 
2. Even though Ernesto is forecast to remain well offshore the U.S. 
East Coast, swells generated by the hurricane are expected to affect 
the area through early next week.  Beach goers should be aware that 
there is a significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip 
currents, and should stay out of the water if advised by lifeguards. 
Surf and rip currents are also possible on the Bahamas, Bermuda, and 
Atlantic Canada during the next few days.
 
3. Ernesto could bring wind, wave, and rain impacts to portions of 
southeastern Newfoundland late Monday and Monday night.
