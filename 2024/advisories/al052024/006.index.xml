DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ernesto was
located near latitude 16.0 North, longitude 59.6 West. Ernesto is
moving toward the west near 25 mph (41 km/h).  A westward to
west-northwestward motion with some decrease in forward speed is
expected during the next day or so.  On the forecast track, Ernesto 
is expected to move across portions of the Leeward Islands by early 
Tuesday and near or over the U.S. and British Virgin Islands and 
Puerto Rico by Tuesday evening.  Ernesto is then forecast to turn 
northward over the western Atlantic.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is expected during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1009 mb (29.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Ernesto is expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 4 to 6 inches over portions of the Leeward and
Virgin Islands.  For Puerto Rico, 3 to 6 inches of rainfall, with
maximum amounts of 10 inches, is expected.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Ernesto, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
Elsewhere in the Caribbean, Tropical Storm Ernesto is expected to
produce the following rain accumulations through Friday morning:
Windward Islands... 1 to 4 inches
Eastern Hispaniola... 2 to 4 inches
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area 
for the Leeward Islands beginning early Tuesday. Tropical storm 
conditions are expected to begin spreading over the Virgin Islands 
and Puerto Rico by Tuesday evening.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level for the eastern coast of Puerto Rico
from San Juan to Guayama, including the islands of Culebra and
Vieques and in the U.S. Virgin Islands, including St. Thomas, St.
John, and St. Croix.
 
A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet
above normal tide levels in the British Virgin Islands. Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ernesto will likely begin to affect
portions of the Leeward Islands beginning late tonight.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Ernesto Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
1100 PM AST Mon Aug 12 2024
 
Ernesto remains a rather broad tropical cyclone, and satellite and 
radar data shows that deep convection has yet to 
consolidate/concentrate near its center. Tonight's NOAA P-3 TDR data 
in Ernesto also suggests the broad center currently lacks much 
vertical alignment.  However, there are a number of convective 
banding features around the circulation and the overall organization 
of the cloud pattern has been increasing since earlier today.  
Satellite imagery shows that the upper-level anticyclonic outflow 
pattern is well defined over the western semicircle of the 
circulation.  The intensity is held at 35 kt for this advisory based 
on observations from Air Force and NOAA reconnaissance aircraft and 
Dvorak satellite estimates.
 
Since the system is still in the formative stage, there is some 
scatter in the center position estimates, making the initial motion 
estimate somewhat uncertain.  My best motion estimate is generally 
westward at a slightly slower speed, around 275/22 kt.  During the 
next day or so, a mid-level ridge to the north of Ernesto should 
maintain a westward to west-northwestward motion at a gradually 
decreasing forward speed.  This should take the center of the 
tropical cyclone over portions of the Leeward Islands very soon, 
across the extreme northeastern Caribbean Sea on Tuesday, and near 
or over portions of Puerto Rico Tuesday evening or Tuesday night.  
After that, the flow on the eastern side  a deep-layer trough moving 
off the U.S. east coast should cause Ernesto turn northward to 
north-northeastward.  Later in the forecast period, the first trough 
that steers the system northward from the Greater Antilles leaves 
Ernesto behind, and the tropical cyclone may have to wait for a 
second trough to steer it farther into the mid-latitudes.  The 
official track forecast is near the left edge of the guidance suite 
during the first 24-36 hours and close to the simple model consensus 
from 2-5 days.  

Assuming that deep convection will increase near the center of 
Ernesto, the high-level outflow and otherwise conducive oceanic and 
atmospheric environment favors strengthening during the next few 
days.  Although the intensification is expected to be gradual during 
the early part of the period, a more rapid rate of strengthening is 
likely after the system moves north of the Greater Antilles.  The 
official intensity forecast is about the same as the previous one 
and close to the multi-model consensus.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Ernesto is expected to bring tropical storm conditions to
portions of the Leeward Islands beginning early Tuesday and to the
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by late Tuesday. Tropical Storm
Warnings are in effect for this entire area.
 
2. Heavy rainfall may result in locally considerable flash flooding
and mudslides in areas of the Leeward and Virgin Islands through
Wednesday, and over Puerto Rico late Tuesday into Thursday.
 
3. It is too soon to know what impacts Ernesto could bring to
Bermuda late this week, and interests there should monitor the
progress of this system.
