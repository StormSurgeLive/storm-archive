WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was
located near latitude 28.1 North, longitude 67.0 West. Ernesto is
moving toward the north-northeast near 13 mph (20 km/h).  This
general motion is expected to continue today followed by a
slower north-northeastward motion on Saturday.  A faster
northeastward motion is expected late in the weekend.  On the
forecast track, the center of Ernesto is expected to pass near or
over Bermuda on Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast during the next day or so, 
and Ernesto is forecast to be a large hurricane near Bermuda on 
Saturday and maintain hurricane strength through the weekend.
 
Ernesto is a large tropical cyclone. Hurricane-force winds extend 
outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 265
miles (425 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 968 mb (28.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected on Bermuda Saturday, with
tropical storm conditions likely beginning this afternoon.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding on Bermuda in areas of onshore winds.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: Ernesto is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 
6 to 12 inches in Bermuda with isolated maximum amounts up to 15 
inches.  This rainfall will likely result in considerable 
life-threatening flash flooding.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the
Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, and Bermuda.  Swells are 
expected to spread up the east coast of the United States today and 
continue into the weekend, and could reach portions of Atlantic 
Canada by late Saturday.  These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office, and stay out of the water 
if advised by lifeguards.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Hurricane Ernesto Forecast Discussion Number 19</title>

Hurricane Ernesto Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
500 AM AST Fri Aug 16 2024
 
Ernesto's strengthening trend has seemingly halted overnight.  The 
cloud pattern near the center has become less organized, and the 
system appears to be struggling with dry air again with some eyewall 
erosion in the western semicircle.  Still, the convective banding 
in the eastern side where the previous aircraft mission found the 
peak winds remains deep and well-defined, suggesting that Ernesto 
hasn't lost much strength.  The initial wind speed is kept at 85 kt 
for this advisory, a bit above the latest satellite estimates, 
pending the upcoming Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
mission this morning.
 
The environment near Ernesto could support some strengthening today. 
However, the most noticeable change in the overnight intensity 
guidance aids is that almost all of them are showing more shear 
today than previously expected.  This shear, combined with the 
environmental dry air, has led to this cycle's intensity forecast 
values being a lot lower than 6 h ago.  Given current trends, the 
NHC prediction has been decreased from the last forecast, and is 
still on the high side of the guidance.  It is worth noting that 
despite the peak wind speed reductions, the forecast size is 
generally larger than the previous forecast, so the 
life-threatening hazards from Ernesto are unchanged. After the 
hurricane passes Bermuda, there could be a brief window for some 
re-intensification in lighter shear conditions plus favorable trough 
influences before Ernesto crosses into cool waters, and little 
change was made at longer range.
 
Ernesto continues moving north-northeastward at about 11 kt, steered
by the flow between a ridge over the central Atlantic and a
large-scale trough off the U.S. east coast.  This general motion is
expected to persist for the next day or two, bringing the hurricane
near or over Bermuda on Saturday.  The trough is forecast is lift
out over the weekend, causing Ernesto to slow down and turn a bit to
the north or north-northeast.  Another trough is expected to
approach the cyclone late in the weekend, and that feature should
cause Ernesto to accelerate to the northeast near or east of
Newfoundland early next week.  The NHC track forecast continues to
the trend of the previous one, nudged a touch to the east and a
little slower through its passage near Bermuda to come into better
agreement with the latest aids.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Ernesto is expected to bring a prolonged period of strong winds
and storm surge on Bermuda starting this afternoon through Saturday
night. A hurricane warning is in effect for the island, and
preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to
completion.
 
2. Heavy rainfall associated with Ernesto is expected to impact
Bermuda through this weekend and will likely result in considerable
life-threatening flash flooding.
 
3. Even though Ernesto is forecast to remain well offshore the U.S.
East Coast, swells generated by the hurricane are expected to affect
the area through the weekend.  Beach goers should be aware of a
significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents, and stay
out of the water if advised by lifeguards.  Surf and rip currents
are also possible on the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, Bermuda,
and Atlantic Canada during the next few days.
