WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests in Atlantic Canada should monitor the progress of Ernesto.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
Surface observations indicate that Ernesto made landfall on the 
western side of Bermuda around 430 AM AST (0830 UTC). At 500 AM AST 
(0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was located near 
latitude 32.3 North, longitude 64.8 West. Ernesto is moving toward 
the north-northeast near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion is 
expected today.  A faster northeastward motion is then expected late 
this weekend into early next week.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Ernesto is expected to slowly depart Bermuda today and 
move near or east of Newfoundland Monday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 85 mph (140 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast today.
Some re-intensification is possible late in the weekend before
weakening begins on Monday.
 
Ernesto is a large tropical cyclone. Hurricane-force winds extend
outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from the center and tropical-storm-
force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 972 mb (28.71 inches).  
The National Museum on Bermuda recently reported a central pressure 
of 972 mb (28.71 mb).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected on Bermuda through the
next several hours.  Due to Ernesto's large size and slow motion,
strong winds will continue on the island through most of today.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding on Bermuda in areas of onshore winds.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: Ernesto is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
6 to 9 inches or 150 to 225 mm on Bermuda. This rainfall will likely
result in considerable life-threatening flash flooding, especially
in low-lying areas on the island.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the the 
Bahamas, Bermuda, and the east coast of the United States. These 
swells will likely reach portions of Atlantic Canada by tonight.  
Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are likely in these 
areas during the next couple of days.  Please consult products from 
your local weather office, and stay out of the water if advised by 
lifeguards.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Ernesto Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
1100 PM AST Fri Aug 16 2024
 
Ernesto is very near Bermuda.  The island has been in the northern 
rainbands since this afternoon, and the eyewall is closing in on the 
island as seen in Bermuda's Doppler radar images.  So far, 
tropical-storm-force winds with gusts to hurricane force have been 
observed on Bermuda, and the strongest winds will likely occur there 
during the next several hours.  The Air Force Hurricane Hunters have 
been investigating Ernesto this evening and found that the minimum 
pressure has been steady around 969 mb.  A blend of the latest 
flight-level and SFMR winds support an initial intensity of about 80 
kt.  Recent microwave images indicate that the vortex is tilted to 
the east-northeast with height due to about 20 kt of 
west-southwesterly vertical wind shear.
 
The already tilted vortex coupled with continued moderate to strong 
shear and possible intrusions of dry air should cause some weakening 
during the next day or so.  However, the shear is expected to lessen 
during the 24- to 60-h time period, and since Ernesto will still be 
over the Gulf Stream Current then, the weakening trend should pause. 
In fact, Ernesto is forecast to strengthen some during that time, 
following the hurricane regional models and consensus aids.  On 
Monday, the cyclone is predicted to cross the north wall of the Gulf 
Stream and track over sharply cooler waters while moving into a 
strong wind shear environment.  Therefore, steady weakening is 
forecast at that point, and Ernesto is expected to complete 
extratropical transition shortly after day 3.  The NHC intensity 
forecast is largely an update of the previous one.
 
Ernesto is still moving northeastward at 11 kt, however, the 
hurricane is expected to slow down soon as the trough off Atlantic 
Canada continues to lift out.  The expected slower motion and 
Ernesto's large size will cause a long duration of impacts through 
Saturday night on Bermuda.  After the hurricane pulls away from 
Bermuda, another trough is forecast to push off the U.S. east coast. 
This feature should cause the cyclone to accelerate northeastward 
later in the weekend and early next week, taking Ernesto near 
Newfoundland Monday night.  The NHC track forecast is a little 
slower than the previous one to come into better agreement with the 
latest models.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Ernesto is expected to bring a prolonged period of strong winds
and storm surge on Bermuda through Saturday night.  A hurricane
warning is in effect for the island.  Residents there should listen
to orders from local officials.
 
2. Heavy rainfall associated with Ernesto is expected to impact
Bermuda through Saturday and will likely result in considerable
life-threatening flash flooding, especially in low-lying areas on
the island.
 
3. Even though Ernesto is forecast to remain well offshore the U.S.
East Coast, swells generated by the hurricane are expected to affect
the area through the weekend.  Beach goers should be aware of a
significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents, and stay
out of the water if advised by lifeguards.  Surf and rip currents
are also possible on the Bahamas, Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada
during the next few days.
