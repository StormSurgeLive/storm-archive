DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ernesto was
located near latitude 16.6 North, longitude 61.9 West. Ernesto is
moving toward the west near 18 mph (30 km/h).  A west-northwestward
motion with some decrease in forward speed is expected during the
next day or so.  On the forecast track, Ernesto is expected to move
across portions of the Leeward Islands this morning and near or over
the U.S. and British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by this evening.
After passing Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, Ernesto is
forecast to turn northward over the western Atlantic.
 
Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that maximum 
sustained winds have increased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Additional strengthening is expected during the next 
few days, and Ernesto could reach hurricane strength by Thursday 
over the waters north of the Greater Antilles.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.  St. Barthelemy reported a wind gust of 56 mph (90 
km/h), and St. Martin reported a gust of 50 mph (80 km/h) during 
the past few hours.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on dropsonde 
observations is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Ernesto is expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 4 to 6 inches over portions of the Leeward and
Virgin Islands. For Puerto Rico, 3 to 6 inches of rainfall, with
maximum amounts of 10 inches, are expected.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Ernesto, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
Elsewhere in the Caribbean, Tropical Storm Ernesto is expected to
produce the following rain accumulations through Friday morning:
Windward Islands...1 to 4 inches
Eastern Hispaniola...2 to 4 inches
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of the
warning area for the Leeward Islands.  Tropical storm conditions are 
expected to begin spreading over the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico 
by this evening.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level for the eastern coast of Puerto Rico
from San Juan to Guayama, including the islands of Culebra and
Vieques and in the U.S. Virgin Islands, including St. Thomas, St.
John, and St. Croix.
 
A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet
above normal tide levels in the British Virgin Islands. Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the 
Leeward Islands and Virgin Islands and will spread westward to 
Puerto Rico later today.  These swells will then reach the 
Dominican Republic tonight, the Turks and Caicos Islands and 
southeastern Bahamas on Wednesday, and Bermuda on Thursday.

Tropical Storm Ernesto Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
500 AM AST Tue Aug 13 2024
 
Satellite imagery and French radar data from Guadeloupe indicate
that convection has become more concentrated near the center of
Ernesto during the past several hours, and there is increased
evidence of cyclonic rotation in the radar imagery.  However, this
has not yet resulted in significant intensification, with surface
obs from the Leeward Islands showing a large area of pressures near
1007-1009 mb and no evidence of any tight wind center.  Based on
this and the latest satellite intensity estimates, the initial
intensity is held at 35 kt.
 
The initial motion is a somewhat uncertain 280/17, a little slower
than before.  Ernesto should turn west-northwestward with an
additional decrease in forward speed during the next 12 h or so as
it approaches a developing break in the subtropical ridge.  This
motion should bring the center near or over the Leeward Islands
today and near or over the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico tonight
and early Wednesday.  After that, the flow between the subtropical
ridge and a mid-latitude trough moving eastward from the United
States should cause the cyclone to turn northward and northeastward.
By the end of the forecast period, this trough is expected to move
eastward away from Ernesto, with a mid-latitude shortwave ridge
passing north of the storm.  This development should cause another
decrease in forward speed during the 96-120 h period.  The new
forecast track is close to the various consensus models, and it is
also similar to the previous forecast track.
 
Ernesto is forecast to be in an environment of light to moderate
shear and over warm sea surface temperatures through the forecast
period, and this combination should allow it to strengthen.
Intensification is likely to be slow during the first 12-24 h
primarily due to the current lack of organization.  After that, a
faster rate of strengthening is expected, with Ernesto forecast to
reach hurricane strength in 36-48 h.  The intensity forecast
follows the overall trend of the intensity guidance, and it lies
between the intensity consensus and the upper edge of the guidance.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Ernesto is expected to bring tropical storm conditions to
portions of the Leeward Islands today and to the Virgin Islands and
Puerto Rico by late today or tonight. Tropical Storm Warnings are
in effect for this entire area.
 
2. Heavy rainfall may result in locally considerable flash flooding
and mudslides in areas of the Leeward Islands through today, and
over the Virgin Islands into Puerto Rico by later today through
Wednesday.
 
3. It is too soon to know what impacts Ernesto could bring to
Bermuda late this week, and interests there should monitor the
progress of this system.
