WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in southeastern Newfoundland should monitor the progress
of Ernesto.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was
located near latitude 41.8 North, longitude 58.5 West. Ernesto is
moving toward the northeast near 28 mph (44 km/h). A turn
toward the northeast and east-northeast with an increase in forward
speed is expected during the next couple of days.  On the forecast
track, the center of Ernesto will pass near southeastern
Newfoundland tonight and early Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Weakening is forecast, and Ernesto is expected
to become a post-tropical cyclone by early Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles
(350 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 968 mb (28.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting Bermuda, the
northeast coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada.
Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are likely to
continue in these areas during the next day or so.  In southeastern
Newfoundland large breaking waves could bring the possibility of
coastal flooding, particularly along southwest-facing shorelines
from Burin east to Avalon regions.  Please consult products from
your local weather office, and stay out of the water if advised by
lifeguards.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Ernesto Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
1100 AM AST Mon Aug 19 2024
 
Ernesto continues to slowly gain strength.  Satellite images
indicate that the eye of the hurricane has become a little better
defined, but the storm still has a convective asymmetry with the
strongest thunderstorms on the north side.  The latest Dvorak
estimates from TAFB and SAB were 4.5/77 kt and the objective
satellite guidance is a little higher.  Based on the data and the
improved structure, the initial wind speed is increased to 80 kt.  
A very recent ASCAT pass indicated that Ernesto remains a large 
tropical cyclone.  The strongest winds and largest radius of 
hurricane and tropical-storm-force winds are located in the 
southeastern quadrant.
 
The hurricane is gradually accelerating to the north-northeast, or
30 degrees at 19 kt.  The strong flow between an approaching mid-
to upper-level trough over the eastern U.S. and a ridge over the
subtropical central Atlantic should cause the cyclone to accelerate
even more and turn to the northeast and east-northeast during the
next couple of days.  The NHC track forecast is similar to the
previous one and near the middle of the guidance envelope.
 
Ernesto is now crossing the north wall of the Gulf Stream, and will
soon be moving over sharply cooler SSTs.  In addition, the hurricane
will be moving into an environment of stronger shear and drier air.
All of these conditions should lead to weakening very soon and
extratropical transition, which is expected to be complete by early
Tuesday.  The NHC intensity forecast is similar to the previous one,
and follows the GFS guidance during the extratropical phase.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Ernesto will continue to affect the coasts
of Bermuda, the northeast U.S., and Atlantic Canada during the next
day or so.  Beach goers should be aware that there is a significant
risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents, and should stay out
of the water if advised by lifeguards.
 
2. Ernesto will likely bring some wind, wave, and rain impacts to
portions of southeastern Newfoundland tonight into Tuesday morning.
Breaking waves could bring the possibility of coastal flooding,
particularly along southwest-facing shorelines from Bunin east to
Avalon regions. For additional impact specific information, please
see statements issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre.
