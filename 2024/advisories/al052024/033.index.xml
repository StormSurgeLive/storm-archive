SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...43.8N 56.1W
ABOUT 375 MI...605 KM E OF HALIFAX NOVA SCOTIA
ABOUT 250 MI...400 KM SW OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 35 DEGREES AT 26 MPH...43 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...968 MB...28.59 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in southeastern Newfoundland should monitor the progress
of Ernesto.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was
located near latitude 43.8 North, longitude 56.1 West. Ernesto is
moving toward the northeast near 26 mph (43 km/h).  An even faster 
motion to the northeast or east-northeast is expected during the 
next couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of Ernesto 
will pass near southeastern Newfoundland tonight and early Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Steady to rapid weakening is forecast, and Ernesto is 
expected to become a post-tropical cyclone early Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles
(350 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 968 mb (28.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting Bermuda, the
northeast coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada.
Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are likely to
continue in these areas during the next day or so.  In southeastern
Newfoundland large breaking waves could bring the possibility of
coastal flooding, particularly along southwest-facing shorelines
from Burin east to Avalon regions.  Please consult products from
your local weather office, and stay out of the water if advised by
lifeguards.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Ernesto Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
500 PM AST Mon Aug 19 2024
 
Ernesto is maintaining its intensity at high latitudes.  The
hurricane continues to have an eye feature, especially in the
mid-levels, and thunderstorms remain most organized north of the
center.  Recent microwave images indicate that the circulation has
become titled from southwest to northeast with height, an indication
of increasing southwesterly vertical wind shear.  The initial
intensity is held at 80 kt, in general agreement with the subjective
and objective Dvorak estimates.
 
Ernesto has likely peaked in strength.  Since the hurricane has now 
crossed the north wall of the Gulf Stream and moving into an 
environment of increasing shear and drier air, steady or rapid 
weakening is expected to begin soon.  The environmental factors 
should also cause extratropical transition, which will likely be 
complete Tuesday morning.  The NHC intensity forecast is the same as 
the previous one and in line with the bulk of the guidance.
 
The hurricane is gradually accelerating to the northeast, or 35 
degrees at 23 kt.  The strong flow between an approaching mid- to 
upper-level trough over the eastern U.S. and a ridge over the 
subtropical central Atlantic should cause the cyclone to accelerate 
even more and turn to the northeast and east-northeast during the 
next couple of days.  The NHC track forecast remains near the middle 
of the tightly clustered models.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Ernesto will continue to affect the coasts
of Bermuda, the northeast U.S., and Atlantic Canada during the next
day or so.  Beach goers should be aware that there is a significant
risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents, and should stay out
of the water if advised by lifeguards.
 
2. Ernesto will likely bring some wind, wave, and rain impacts to
portions of southeastern Newfoundland tonight into Tuesday morning.
Breaking waves could bring the possibility of coastal flooding,
particularly along southwest-facing shorelines from Bunin east to
Avalon regions. For additional impact specific information, please
see statements issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre.
