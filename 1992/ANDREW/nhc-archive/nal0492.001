SATELLITE ANALYSTS AT BOTH SAB AND NHC HAVE BEEN CLASSIFYING THE
TROPICAL WAVE OVER THE MID ATLANTIC FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS. 
THE DVORAK CI NUMBER HAS BEEN 2.0 FOR THE PAST 12 HOURS.  METEOSAT
IMAGES CONTINUE TO SHOW A BANDING TYPE PATTERN AND DEEP CONVECTION
HAS INCREASED CLOSE TO THE CLOUD SYSTEM CENTER...ENOUGH TO WARRANT
ISSUING DEPRESSION ADVISORIES.

NMC AVIATION MODEL INDICATES THAT THE SYSTEM SHOULD REMAIN EMBEDDED
WITHIN THE DEEP EASTERLIES...AND ALL TRACK MODELS ARE IN GENERAL
AGREEMENT.  INITIAL MOTION IS 280/18 AND THIS SAME GENERAL MOTION
SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THIS FORECAST PERIOD.

THE AVIATION MODEL ALSO INDICATES STRONG 200 MB WINDS FROM THE EAST
OVER THE SYSTEM...WHICH SHOULD ALLOW ONLY SLOW STRENGTHENING.  IF
THE SHEAR IS LIGHTER THAN FORECAST...MORE STRENGTHENING COULD OCCUR.
