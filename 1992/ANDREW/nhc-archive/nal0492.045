5 AM EDT THU AUG 27 1992
 
SURFACE SYNOPTIC DATA INDICATE THAT ANDREW IS CENTERED NEAR JACKSON
MISSISSIPPI.  THE SYSTEM STILL HAS A LOW-LEVEL CENTER THAT REMAINS
WELL-DEFINED ON SURFACE AND RADAR DATA.  IT IS MOVING TOWARD 050/8
KT.

THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL TRACK HAS BEEN EXTENDED IN THIS FORECAST. 
THE BAMD IS ABOUT 5 DEGREES TO THE RIGHT OF THIS TRACK THROUGH 36
HOURS...WHILE THE NHC90 IS 5 DEGREES TO THE LEFT.  BOTH MODELS ARE
FASTER THAN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.  THE 0000 UTC QLM IS FURTHER YET
TO THE WEST.  WHILE THE SYSTEM WILL GRADUALLY LOSE ITS TROPICAL
CYCLONE CHARACTERISITICS AND MAY BEGIN TO MERGE WITH THE APPROACHING
FRONT...IT IS LIKELY TO REMAIN AN IDENTIFIABLE AND SIGNIFICANT
DYNAMIC FEATURE FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
 
ANDREW PRODUCED 3.33 INCHES OF RAIN AT JACKSON IN THE 6 HOURS ENDING
AT 0600 UTC.  THE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE...AND
...MAY BE ENHANCED BY OROGRAPHIC AS WELL AS MID-LATITUDE DYNAMIC
EFFECTS.  ASSOCIATED FLASH FLOODING REMAINS A CONCERN.

ISOLATED TORNADOES ACCOMPANYING ANDREW ARE ALSO STILL POSSIBLE.
