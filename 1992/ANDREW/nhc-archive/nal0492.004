5 PM EDT MON AUG 17 1992
 
ALL FIXES FROM VISIBLE SATELLITE PICTURES INDICATE T3.0/3.0... OR 45
KNOTS.  HOWEVER... WE WILL ONLY INCREASE THE WINDS TO 40 KNOTS AT
THIS TIME SINCE THE SYSTEM SEEMS TO BE PULSATING WITH PERIODS OF
DEEP CONVECTION.

INITIAL MOTION OF 285/20 KNOTS STILL LOOKS GOOD.  HOWEVER... THERE
IS A MARKED DIFFERENCE IN THE MODEL TRACKS COMPARED WITH THE
PREVIOUS PACKAGE.  IN THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE... THE DYNAMIC MODELS ALL
HAD THE FORECAST TRACKS SOUTH OF CLIMATOLOGY... WHEREAS THE 1800 UTC
RUNS ALL HAD THE TRACKS NORTH OF CLIMATOLOGY.  AVN GUIDANCE SHOWS
THE UPPER LOW NORTHWEST OF THE SYSTEM MOVING WEST SOUTHWESTWARD...
AS TYPICAL... BUT OPENS IT TO A TROUGH DURING THE PERIOD.  THAT
CREATES A POSSIBLE SPLIT IN THE STEERING CURRENTS WITH THE NORTHERN
STREAM CURVING ANDREW AWAY FROM THE ANTILLES.  THE SOUTHERN STREAM
WOULD BE MORE WESTERLY WHICH WOULD IMPACT THE LEEWARDS.  WE WILL GO
WITH THE LATTER SCENARIO AND STILL SHOW A POSSIBLE THREAT TO THE
LEEWARDS UNTIL THE SITUATION BECOMES CLEARER.

THE INTENSITY SCENARIO FOLLOWS CLIMATOLOGY AND THE HRD EXPERIMENTAL
INTENSITY FORECAST SCHEME....SHIPS92.
