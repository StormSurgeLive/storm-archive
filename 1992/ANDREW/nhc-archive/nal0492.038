LATEST RECON REPORTED 944 MB...SO WE WILL NOT MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT
CHANGE TO THE INTENSITY FORECAST BEFORE LANDFALL.  RECCO REPORT
INDICATES THE INNER EYEWALL HAS WEAKENED BUT AN OUTER EYEWALL HAS 
STRENGTHENED. EYE DIAMETER IS NOW 30 NMI.

INITIAL MOTION IS 300/15...AND THIS FORECAST IS BASICALLY ALONG THE
SAME TRACK AS BEFORE BUT WITH A FASTER FORWARD MOTION.  MOST
GUIDANCE MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW A DECREASE IN FORWARD SPEED. 
CURRENT TRACK IS IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH NHC90 AND THE LATEST QLM UP
TO THE LOUISIANA COAST AT LEAST.  THE BAMS ARE A LITTLE TO THE LEFT
OF OUR TRACK.
