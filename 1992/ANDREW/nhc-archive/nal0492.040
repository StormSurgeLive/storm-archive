HURRICANE ANDREW DISCUSSION NUMBER  40
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT TUE AUG 25 1992
 
RECON INDICATES THAT THE PRESSURE ROSE FROM 932 AND 945 MB DURING
THE EVENING BUT WINDS REMAIN AROUND 120 KNOTS. THE CURRENT INTENSITY
WILL BE KEPT UNTIL LANDFALL.

INITIAL MOTION IS 310/11. THIS GENERAL TRACK IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE
DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  THEN... AS A TROUGH DIGS OVER THE WESTERN
UNITED STATES...WEAKENING ANDREW SHOULD TAKE A NORTH AND
NORTHEASTERLY TRACK WITH INCREASING FORWARD SPEED. 

BAM MODELS ACCELERATE THE HURRICANE EASTWARD AFTER 48 HOURS. BAM
DEEP PUT THE HURRICANE BACK OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO DURING THE LAST
FORECAST PERIOD.  CONSIDERING THAT UNREALISTIC TRACK...THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST CERTAINLY DOES NOT INCLUDE THAT SOLUTION.
