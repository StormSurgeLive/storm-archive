TROPICAL STORM ANDREW DISCUSSION NUMBER   3
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT MON AUG 17 1992
 
ALL FIXES FROM VISIBLE SATELLITE PICTURES INDICATE T2.5/2.5. 
THUS... WE ARE UPGRADING THE SYSTEM TO TROPICAL STORM ANDREW AT THIS
TIME.

THE SYSTEM STILL IS A LITTLE RAGGED BUT SOME DEEP CONVECTION HAS
DEVELOPED ON THE EASTERN SIDE WHICH INDICATES THAT THE SHEARING IS
RELAXING.  

THE INITIAL MOTION IS CLOSE TO 285/22 KNOTS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
IS SLIGHTLY TO THE NORTH OF THE DYNAMIC MODELS WHICH APPEAR TO
FOLLOW A MORE WESTERLY COURSE.  WITH THE UPPER LEVEL LOW NORTHWEST
OF THE CENTER MOVING NORTHWESTWARD... ANDREW SHOULD CONTINUE ON A
WEST NORTHWESTWARD COURSE FOR MOST OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST SCENARIO SHOWS ONLY GRADUAL STRENGTHENING
BECAUSE OF THE RAPID MOTION.
