VISIBLE SATELLITE PICTURES SHOW A LOW LEVEL CENTER THAT IS MOVING
FASTER THAN THE CONVECTION TO THE EAST AND THUS IT APPEARS TO BE
EXPOSED.  HOWEVER...THE DEEP CONVECTION EAST IS TRYING TO WRAP
AROUND THE CENTER AS THE SYSTEM CONTINUES TO PULSATE.  

THE INITIAL MOTION HAS BEEN 285/20 KNOTS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS. 
SINCE WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RUN THE DYNAMIC TRACK FORECAST MODELS
THIS MORNING DUE TO TECHNICAL PROBLEMS AT NHC...WE WILL PRESERVE THE
INTEGRITY OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK.  

WE WILL ALSO MAINTAIN THE PREVIOUS FORECAST INTENSITY SCENARIO.
