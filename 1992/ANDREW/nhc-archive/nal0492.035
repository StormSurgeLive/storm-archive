...CORRECTION TO INCLUDE HURRICANE WATCH...

RECON FOUND 946MB MINIMUM PRESSURE AND SURFACE WINDS OF 120 KNOTS.
SATELLITE PICTURES AND MELBOURNE WSR88D CLEARLY SHOW A WELL DEFINED
EYE. SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY MAY OCCUR DURING THE NEXT 24 TO
36 HOURS.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 280/16.  THE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE THAT FORCED
ANDREW ON A WESTWARD TRACK IS WEAKENING SO THE HURRICANE MAY TAKE A
NORTHWEST TRACK DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS AT A SLOWER FORWARD
SPEED.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH BAM MODELS WHICH ALSO TURN ANDREW
INTO A MORE NORTHWESTERLY TRACK. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS A
BLEND OF THE BAM MODELS AND THE QLM.  THIS MEANS THAT HURRICANE
WARNINGS ARE NOW ISSUED FOR THE GULF COAST FROM VERMILLION BAY
LOUISIANA TO PASCAGOULA MISSISSIPPI. 

THE HURRICANE WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM VERMILLION BAY WESTWARD
TO SABINE PASS TEXAS ...AND FROM PASCAGOULA TO MOBILE.
