TROPICAL DEPRESSION ANDREW DISCUSSION NUMBER  44
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT WED AUG 26 1992

SURFACE SYNOPTIC DATA AND RADAR SHOW THAT THE CENTER IS PASSING JUST
EAST OF NATCHEZ MISSISSIPPI.  THERE ARE NO SUSTAINED WINDS OF
TROPICAL STORM FORCE AT ANY OF THE REPORTING STATIONS...THEREFORE
ANDREW IS BEING DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION.  HOWEVER WINDS
CONTINUE TO GUST ABOVE TROPICAL STORM FORCE IN SQUALLS AND THE RADAR
PRESENTATION STILL LOOKS FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE.  THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM
WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO BE IDENTIFIABLE ON THE SURFACE MAPS FOR
THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

THE MAIN CONCERN WITH ANDREW IS NOW THE THREAT OF FLOODING DUE TO
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL FROM THIS SLOW MOVING SYSTEM.  ISOLATED
TORNADOES ARE ALSO STILL POSSIBLE WITHIN THE CONVECTIVE BANDS. 

THE TRACK FORECAST IS SOMEWHAT TO THE EAST OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE
SINCE THE INITIAL POSITION AND MOVEMENT ARE FARTHER EAST THAN IN THE
PREVIOUS TRACK.
