11 AM EDT SUN AUG 23 1992
 
AN AIR FORCE RESERVE UNIT PLANE CONTINUES TO REPORT LOWER
PRESSURE...DOWN TO 930 MB.  ANDREW IS UPGRADED TO A CAT 4 HURRICANE
ON THIS ADVISORY.  SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A VERY SMALL EYE...AND WE
WILL PROBABLY SEE SOME FLUCTUATIONS BETWEEN NOW AND LANDFALL...BUT
THE INTENSITY FORECAST STILL CALLS FOR A CAT 4 HURRICANE AT LANDFALL
ON THE FLORIDA SOUTHEAST COAST.  THE HURRICANE WILL LIKELY WEAKEN
ONE CATEGORY OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...BUT COULD AGAIN STRENGTHEN
IN THE GULF OF MEXICO.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 270/14.  NMC AVIATION MODEL SHOWS THE MID/UPPER
LEVEL LOW OVER THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WEAKENING WITH TIME...AND
A RIDGE CONTINUING TO THE NORTH OF ANDREW.  THIS TRACK IS BASICALLY
AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK...WITH THE USUAL UNCERTAINTY AT THE
LONGER TIME PERIODS.  BAM MODELS ARE TO THE RIGHT OF OUR OFFICIAL
TRACK AND NHC90 IS TO THE LEFT OF OUR OFFICIAL TRACK AT THE LONGER
TIME PERIODS.
