TROPICAL STORM ANDREW DISCUSSION NUMBER  14
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT THU AUG 20 1992
 
ANDREW CONTINUES TO BE POORLY ORGANIZED ON SATELLITE IMAGERY.  THERE
ARE NO BANDING FEATURES...ONLY INTERMITTENT BURSTS OF CONVECTION
WHICH CONTINUE TO BE SHEARED NORTHEASTWARD FROM THE ESTIMATED
CENTER.  THE CREW OF THE RECON AIRCRAFT WAS NOT ABLE TO LOCATE A
CENTER...HOWEVER A 54 KNOT WIND GUST WAS REPORTED AT THE 5000 FT
FLIGHT LEVEL IN AN AREA OF STRONG CONVECTION.  WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT
FOR VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY AND THE FIRST DAYLIGHT RECON TO
DETERMINE WHETHER A CLOSED CIRCULATION STILL EXISTS ON THE SURFACE. 
 
THE LATEST AVN RUN OF THE NMC GLOBAL SPECTRAL MODEL...AS IN PREVIOUS
RUNS...INSISTS THAT THE UPPER TROPOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT WILL BECOME
MUCH MORE CONDUCIVE FOR STRENGTHENING IN ABOUT 24 HOURS...IF ANDREW
CAN SURVIVE UNTIL THAT TIME.  IT IS ALSO WORTHWHILE TO NOTE THAT THE
INITIAL STATE OF THE AVN MODEL WINDS AT 200 MB LOOK REALISTIC IN
COMPARISON TO OBSERVED CIRRUS LEVEL MOTIONS AROUND THE STORM.  THIS
MIGHT GIVE SOME CREDIBILITY TO THE MODEL FORECAST.  AGAIN...THE MAIN
QUESTION IS WHETHER THE SYSTEM WILL WITHSTAND THE SOUTHWESTERLY
SHEARING FOR MUCH LONGER.  

THE TRACK FORECAST...WITH AN INITIAL MOTION ABOUT THE SAME AS SIX
HOURS EARLIER...IS AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.  THERE IS A
SUBSTANTIAL SPREAD BETWEEN THE MORE STATISTICALLY-BASED OBJECTIVE
AIDS...NHC90 AND CLIPER...AND THE DYNAMICAL MODELS...QLM AND BAM.
THE STATISTICAL GUIDANCE TURNS ANDREW MORE NORTHWARD.  THE AVN MODEL
PREDICTS A DEEP LAYER RIDGE TO BUILD OVER THE SOUTHWEST ATLANTIC. 
THIS WOULD FAVOR A MORE WESTWARD TRACK WITH TIME AS SHOWN BY THE
DYNAMICAL TRACK GUIDANCE.  THE OFFICAL FORECAST...AS BEFORE...IS A
COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO BUT LEANS MORE TOWARD THE DYNAMICAL
GUIDANCE.
