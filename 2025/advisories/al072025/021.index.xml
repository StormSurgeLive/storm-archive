NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
500 AM AST Mon Sep 22 2025
 
...GABRIELLE STRENGTHENS...
...FORECAST TO PASS EAST OF BERMUDA TONIGHT...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...30.0N 62.5W
ABOUT 210 MI...335 KM SE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 340 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...978 MB...28.88 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Gabrielle.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gabrielle was
located near latitude 30.0 North, longitude 62.5 West. Gabrielle is
moving toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A turn
toward the north is forecast later today, followed by a faster
northeastward or east-northeastward motion on Tuesday. On the
forecast track, the center of Gabrielle is expected to pass east of
Bermuda tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 90 mph (150 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Strengthening is forecast over the next day or 
so, and Gabrielle could become a major hurricane tonight.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 978 mb (28.88 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda
during the next few days. These swells are now reaching the east
coast of the United States from North Carolina northward, as well as
Atlantic Canada, and are expected to continue through the early
part this week. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Gabrielle Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
500 AM AST Mon Sep 22 2025
 
Satellite images show that deep convection wraps around the inner
core of Gabrielle with cold cloud tops near -80C, and GLM data
depicts some lightning ongoing near the center of the system.
Unfortunately, there have been no microwave images this morning to
get a better idea of the hurricanes structure. However, there have
been brief hints that an eye may be trying to form in infrared
imagery. There is a fairly large range of subjective and objective
satellite intensity estimates. Latest Dvorak satellite intensity
estimates from TAFB and SAB range from 77 kt to 90 kt, and estimates
from UW-CIMSS such as DPRINT, AiDT, and SATCON range from 57 to 79
kt. Using these estimates and the improved satellite presentation,
the intensity is raised to 80 kt for this advisory.
 
Gabrielle is moving north-northwestward at an estimated motion of
340/9 kt. A turn towards the north is expected today and tonight as
Gabrielle rounds the western periphery of a subtropical ridge. The
system will then be steered within stronger west-southwesterly
mid-latitude flow, and accelerate towards the northeast and
east-northeast during the next few days. The latest track guidance
is in fairly good agreement in the short term, and the NHC forecast
was nudged slightly westward in the short-term, given the initial
position, but lies near the previous. However, beyond days 2-3 there
continues to be a large spread in the track guidance suite and
mainly due to differences in the forward speed of Gabrielle. The
latest NHC forecast is a little faster than the previous forecast
and lies closer to the HCCA corrected consensus, but is not as fast
as the Google DeepMind. Given uncertainty in the track forecast at
long ranges, it is too early to predict what, if any, impacts
Gabrielle could have on the Azores.
 
The hurricane is within a favorable environment for strengthening,
over the next 24 hours or so, with warm sea surface temperatures and
light to moderate wind shear. The NHC intensity forecast lies near
the higher end of the guidance envelope near the hurricane regional
models, with Gabrielle forecast to become a major hurricane tonight.
After that time, moderate to strong westerly wind shear will begin
to impact the system, as well as slightly drier mid-level air. By
day 3, sea surface temperatures drop to around 26 C, and will
continue to cool along the forecast track. Thus a weakening trend is
forecast beyond 24h and the NHC forecast trends towards the
consensus aids through the middle and end of the forecast period.
Global models and SHIPS guidance are in slightly better agreement
that Gabrielle will begin to transition to an extratropical cyclone
towards the end of the period and the latest NHC forecast now shows
the system Extra-Tropical by day 5. It should be noted that some
models do show Gabrielle attaining extratropical characteristics
sooner than explicitly forecast.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Gusty winds and showers will be possible across Bermuda today
and tonight as Hurricane Gabrielle passes by to the east.
 
2.  Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda
during the next few days. These swells are now reaching the east
coast of the United States from North Carolina northward, as well as
Atlantic Canada, and should continue during the next couple of days.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
