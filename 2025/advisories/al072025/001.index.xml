In addition, the associated <br />shower and thunderstorm activity has become a little more <br />concentrated during the past several hours.  If these trends <br />continue, advisories could be initiated on a tropical depression <br />later today.  The system is expected to move generally northwestward <br />at 10 to 15 mph over the central tropical and subtropical Atlantic <br />during the next several days.  Additional information on this <br />system, including gale warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts <br />issued by the National Weather Service.<br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br />* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br /><br />Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br />A tropical wave located a couple of hundred miles east-southeast of <br />the Cabo Verde Islands is producing an area of disorganized showers <br />and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions are only marginally <br />conducive, and any development of this system should be slow to <br />occur while it moves westward at 15 to 20 mph across the eastern and <br />central portion of the tropical Atlantic.  Regardless of <br />development, this system will likely bring areas of heavy rain <br />across the Cabo Verde Islands later today and Thursday.<br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br />* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br /><br />&&<br /><br />High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service<br />can be found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 <br />KWBC, and online at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php<br /><br />$$<br />Forecaster Cangialosi]]>

Tropical Depression Seven Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
500 AM AST Wed Sep 17 2025

Satellite data indicate that Invest 92L over the central tropical 
Atlantic has now developed into a tropical depression.  ASCAT data 
from around 00Z showed that the circulation of the system had 
improved, and although it was not well defined at the time of the 
pass, the system was only lacking some northerly winds on its west 
side.  Since deep convection has been persisting and consolidating 
near the center, it appears to now meet the convective and 
circulation criteria needed to be considered a tropical cyclone.  
However, it should be noted that the system is quite large and there 
is still considerable north-south elongation in the low-level 
structure. The initial intensity is set at 30 kt based on a blend of 
the ASCAT data and the latest Dvorak estimate from TAFB.  The 
development of this system breaks a nearly 3-week streak of no 
tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin during the peak of the 
hurricane season.

The depression is well away from land and roughly midway between the 
Cabo Verde Islands and the Windward Islands.  The system is 
estimated to be moving westward at 11 kt, but this is of low 
confidence since the center has only recently formed.  A turn to the 
northwest, perhaps influenced by a center formation, is expected to 
occur soon as the depression moves toward a weakness in the Atlantic 
subtropical ridge caused by a mid- to upper-level low to its north.  
The models show this low weakening in a day or two, which will 
likely cause the cyclone to turn back to the west-northwest late 
this week.  However, the system should reach the western periphery 
of the ridge this weekend, resulting in a turn to the northwest or 
north.  The NHC track forecast is a little to the right of the 
consensus aids, giving more weight to the ECMWF and Google Deep Mind 
predictions, which are faster and on the right side of the guidance. 
Based on the steering pattern, and deterministic and ensemble model 
solutions, there is high confidence that this system should pass 
well east of the Windward and Leeward Islands.  Interests in Bermuda 
should monitor forecasts of the depression over the next several 
days.

Only modest strengthening is expected over the next day or two as 
the depression continues to battle moderate shear from the 
aforementioned low aloft and intrusions of dry air.  However, more 
notable strengthening seems likely by the weekend when the system 
moves into more conducive environmental conditions.  The NHC 
intensity forecast shows the system reaching hurricane strength 
toward the end of the period, but it should be noted that the spread 
in the models at that time is significant and ranges from solutions 
showing a weak low to a major hurricane.  This prediction is 
generally in line with the IVCN aid.
