Tropical Storm Gabrielle Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
500 PM AST Wed Sep 17 2025
 
The biggest change with Gabrielle today has been that the center 
has re-formed farther to the north compared with the previous 
advisory, similar to earlier model forecasts.  While satellite 
imagery continues to indicate an elongated circulation with 
multiple embedded swirls, it has become better defined than this 
morning, and we have continued to make the center position on the 
advisory a mean of those swirls. A second scatterometer pass that 
intersected the northern semicircle of the storm after the 15Z 
advisory did show a large area of 40-45 kt winds. Therefore, the 
initial intensity has been increased to 45 knots, even though the 
system does not appear appreciably more organized.
 
The first part of the track forecast has been shifted to the north 
based on the recent center re-formation.  Gabrielle is moving 
northwestward now, and a west-northwestward to northwestward track 
is anticipated for the next few days due to steering from the 
subtropical ridge.  The fundamental forecast question for both 
track and intensity is related to the wind shear Gabrielle will 
experience and the structural change.  Little intensity change is 
shown for the next couple of days while the storm remains in a 
high-shear but high SST/instability environment.  There actually 
appears to be good consensus that the shear will relax after Friday, 
but there are significant model differences on how much. This leads 
to a considerable amount of track and intensity spread as the 
forecast progresses into the weekend.  Generally the models that 
relax the shear more substantially, to around 10 knots or less, show 
more intensification and a track to the right of model consensus.  
Since the NHC intensity forecast is a bit above the model average 
(similar to the last prediction), we favor a track forecast to the 
right of the model blend, more consistent with the HCCA corrected 
consensus, Google Deep Mind ensemble, and ECMWF ensemble.   

Overall, forecast confidence remains relatively low. Based on the 
recent trends, this system should pass well east and north of the 
Windward and Leeward Islands, but interests in Bermuda should 
monitor forecasts during the next several days.
