SUNDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.9N 55.6W
ABOUT 550 MI...885 KM ENE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 915 MI...1470 KM SE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1004 MB...29.65 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Gabrielle.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gabrielle
was located near latitude 21.9 North, longitude 55.6 West. Gabrielle
is moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this
motion is expected to continue through Saturday. A gradual turn 
towards the north-northwestward is expected by Saturday night, 
followed by a northward motion by Sunday night. On the forecast 
track, the center of Gabrielle is expected to pass east of Bermuda 
Sunday night and Monday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is forecast, and Gabrielle is expected to
become a hurricane by Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Gabrielle are expected to reach Bermuda
tonight and build through the weekend.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Gabrielle Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
500 AM AST Fri Sep 19 2025
 
Gabrielle's low-level center is located near the western edge of an
area of deep convection that has now persisted since late yesterday
afternoon.  While the overall convective structure is gradually
improving, the change hasn't been enough to deviate from a current
intensity of 45 kt.  UW-CIMSS SATCON, with a value of 42 kt, is
currently the closest satellite intensity estimate.
 
The storm is maintaining a west-northwestward heading of 300 degrees 
at 10 kt, with the subtropical ridge located to its north.  A 
general pattern of troughing is expected to persist near the 
southeastern U.S. coast and far western Atlantic for the next
several days, which should cause Gabrielle to recurve around the
western periphery of the ridge over the next 4 days.  There has
been further tightening of the track guidance during this period,
including a convergence of the HCCA and Google DeepMind ensemble
mean, and no significant adjustments were required for this updated
track forecast.  The reliable track models now show Gabrielle's
center passing at least 140 n mi east of Bermuda in about 3 days.
However, interests on the island should continue to monitor
Gabrielle's progress since NHC's average track error at 3 days is
about 90 n mi, and hazards can extend well away from the center.  
There is currently a 20-25 percent chance of tropical-storm-force 
winds occurring on Bermuda.
 
The moderate westerly shear currently affecting Gabrielle is
forecast to gradually lessen below 10 kt by 36 hours.  This should
begin to mitigate the effects of surrounding dry air and allow for
gradual strengthening.  The NHC intensity forecast has been nudged
upward, particularly during the first 3 days, to trend toward the
latest IVCN and HCCA consensus aids, and Gabrielle is expected
to become a hurricane by Sunday.  The forecast peak intensity on
day 4 is unchanged.  By day 5, the onset of significantly stronger
shear and cooler waters should induce some weakening.  At the
moment, there is significant uncertainty about when Gabrielle might
become extratropical and how that would affect the cyclone's
intensity.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Gabrielle is forecast to become a hurricane by Sunday and pass
east of Bermuda Sunday night and Monday.  Interests on Bermuda
should monitor Gabrielle's forecasts since it is too soon to
specify the magnitude of potential wind and rainfall impacts.
 
2.  Swells generated by Gabrielle are expected to reach Bermuda
tonight and build through the weekend.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
