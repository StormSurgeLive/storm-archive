Hurricane Gabrielle Advisory Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
500 AM AST Wed Sep 24 2025
 
...HURRICANE WARNING ISSUED FOR THE AZORES...
...GABRIELLE CONTINUES MOVING QUICKLY EAST-NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE
NORTH ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...35.6N 51.5W
ABOUT 1360 MI...2190 KM W OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...115 MPH...185 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 75 DEGREES AT 25 MPH...41 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...959 MB...28.32 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Meteorological Service of Portugal has issued a Hurricane
Warning for the Azores.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* All of the Azores
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gabrielle was
located near latitude 35.6 North, longitude 51.5 West. Gabrielle is
moving toward the east-northeast near 25 mph (41 km/h), and this
motion with some additional acceleration is expected to continue
for the next several days.  On the forecast track, the center of
Gabrielle will approach the Azores during the day on Thursday, and
move across the island chain Thursday night into Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gabrielle is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Steady weakening is expected during the
next couple of days, but Gabrielle is still expected to be a
hurricane when it passes through the Azores.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 959 mb (28.32 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the warning area
Thursday night and Friday.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near the areas of onshore winds. The
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: From Thursday into Friday morning, Gabrielle may bring 3
to 5 inches, or 75 to 125 mm, of rainfall across the central and
western Azores. During the same time outer bands from Gabrielle may
also result in 1 to 2 inches, or 25 to 50 mm, of rain across the
eastern Azores.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda,
the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward, and Atlantic
Canada over the next few days. These swells are expected to produce
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products issued by your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Gabrielle Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
500 AM AST Wed Sep 24 2025

Gabrielle continues to slowly weaken. The eye is no longer apparent 
in conventional satellite imagery, and the outflow continues to be 
restricted on the western side due to westerly vertical shear. The 
various subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates are 
in the 90-105 kt range and have decreased a little during the past 
6 h. Based on these, the initial intensity is reduced to a possibly 
generous 100 kt.

The initial motion is now 075/22 kt. For the next three days or so, 
Gabrielle should continue east-northeastward with some increase in 
forward speed, with the cyclone moving through or near the Azores 
in about 48 h.  After three days, the cyclone is expected to slow 
its forward speed and turn southeastward as it is steered by a 
broad deep-layer trough over western Europe.  Since there are only 
minor changes in the track guidance since the last advisory, the new 
forecast track is almost identical to the previous track through 72 
h, and it is nudged a little south of the previous track after that 
time.
 
Gabrielle should continue to weaken due to increasing shear and 
decreasing sea surface temperatures along the forecast track. 
However, the ECMWF and the GFS are in good agreement that the 
cyclone should have 75-80 kt winds in the southwestern quadrant as 
it approaches and moves through the Azores. These forecast winds 
are likely due to a baroclinic sting jet as Gabrielle interacts 
with an upper-level trough and undergoes extratropical transition. 
After that transition is complete in about 60 h, the global models 
forecast the cyclone to steadily weaken over the northeastern 
Atlantic. The new intensity forecast has some changes from the 
previous advisory, with the first 24 h following the intensity 
consensus and the subsequent forecast periods following a blend of 
the ECMWF and GFS wind forecasts. 


KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Gabrielle is forecast to approach the Azores late on Thursday as
a hurricane. A Hurricane Warning has been issued for all of the
islands of the Azores, and hurricane conditions are likely Thursday 
night and Friday.
 
2.  Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda,
the east coast of the United States from North Carolina northward
and Atlantic Canada during the next couple of days.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
