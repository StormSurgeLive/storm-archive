----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...36.1N 46.8W
ABOUT 1100 MI...1775 KM W OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...110 MPH...175 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* All of the Azores
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area. A warning is typically issued 36
hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-
force winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous. Preparations to protect life and property should be
rushed to completion.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gabrielle was
located near latitude 36.1 North, longitude 46.8 West. Gabrielle is
moving toward the east near 26 mph (43 km/h). An eastward to 
east-northeastward motion is expected during the next couple of 
days, followed by a slower eastward to east-southeastward motion 
this weekend. On the forecast track, the center of Gabrielle will 
approach the Azores during the day on Thursday, and move across the 
island chain Thursday night into Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 110 mph (175 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some weakening is expected during the next couple of days, 
but Gabrielle is still forecast to be a hurricane when it passes 
through the Azores.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150
miles (240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 962 mb (28.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the Azores Thursday night
and Friday, with tropical storm conditions likely by Thursday
evening.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds in the
Azores. The surge will be accompanied by large and destructive
waves.
 
RAINFALL: From Thursday into Friday morning, Gabrielle may bring 3
to 5 inches, or 75 to 125 mm, of rainfall across the central and
western Azores. During the same time outer bands from Gabrielle may
also result in 1 to 2 inches, or 25 to 50 mm, of rain across the
eastern Azores.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda
over the next couple of days, and the U.S. East Coast from North
Carolina northward and Atlantic Canada over the next day or so.
These swells are expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products issued by your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Gabrielle Discussion Number  31
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
1100 AM AST Wed Sep 24 2025
 
Gabrielle continues to show signs of gradual weakening. The 
convective pattern of the hurricane has become less symmetric, with 
restricted outflow on the western side of the system. Cold 
convective cloud tops obscure the center of the hurricane, and no 
eye feature is apparent in conventional satellite imagery. The 
latest subjective Dvorak and objective satellite intensity estimates 
range from 85-97 kt, and the initial intensity is lowered to 95 kt. 
 
Gabrielle is moving east-northeastward (075/22 kt) while embedded 
within westerly mid-latitude flow. The hurricane is expected to 
accelerate eastward to east-northeastward during the next couple of 
days, passing near or over the Azores Thursday night into Friday. By 
the weekend, Gabrielle is forecast to slow down and turn eastward 
and then southeastward over the eastern Atlantic. There are some 
forward speed differences in the track guidance, with the GFS 
notably faster than the rest of the models through much of the 
forecast period. The updated NHC track forecast has been adjusted 
slightly faster in line with the latest multi-model consensus aids, 
but otherwise is similar to the previous forecast. The track 
uncertainty increases by day 5, with some models (GFS, Google 
DeepMind) showing the system inland over Portugal while others 
(ECMWF, UKMET) keep the low offshore.

Gabrielle will encounter increasing westerly shear and cooler waters 
during the next couple of days, so some weakening is expected. 
However, as Gabrielle begins to interact with an upper trough over 
the northern Atlantic and starts extratropical transition, the GFS 
and ECMWF depict a warm seclusion low structure with a band of 
hurricane-force winds wrapping around the western side of the 
circulation. This could result in significant wind impacts to the 
Azores, and a Hurricane Warning is in effect for those islands. The 
NHC intensity and radii forecasts lean more heavily on the global 
model wind fields through the first 48 h, as these better capture 
the anticipated structural changes of the cyclone. Once Gabrielle 
becomes fully extratropical, the system should weaken more rapidly 
within a dry mid-level environment over cooler waters.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Gabrielle is forecast to approach the Azores late on Thursday as 
a hurricane. A Hurricane Warning is in effect for all of the islands 
of the Azores, and hurricane conditions are likely Thursday night 
and Friday. Significant hurricane-force wind gusts are likely 
across portions of the Azores even after the center passes.  

2.  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce significant 
coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds in the Azores. The 
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
3.  Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda 
during the next couple of days, and the east coast of the United 
States from North Carolina northward and Atlantic Canada for the 
next day or so. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening 
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your 
local weather office.
