DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM GMT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gabrielle was
located near latitude 36.0 North, longitude 42.3 West. Gabrielle is
moving toward the east near 31 mph (50 km/h). An eastward to
east-northeastward motion is expected during the next couple of

this weekend.  On the forecast track, the center of Gabrielle will
approach the Azores today and move across the island chain tonight 
into early Friday.
 
Satellite-derived winds indicate that the maximum sustained winds 
are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher gusts.  Gabrielle is 
forecast to be at hurricane strength when it passes through the 
Azores, then gradually weaken.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles
(315 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 978 mb (28.88 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the Azores tonight into 
early Friday, with tropical storm conditions likely by this 
evening. Significant hurricane-force wind gusts are likely across 
portions of the Azores even after the center passes.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds in the
Azores. The surge will be accompanied by large and destructive
waves.
 
RAINFALL: From later today into Friday morning, Gabrielle may bring 
3 to 5 inches, or 75 to 125 mm, of rainfall across the central and
western Azores. During the same time, outer bands from Gabrielle may
also result in 1 to 2 inches, or 25 to 50 mm, of rain across the
eastern Azores.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda
over the next couple of days, and the U.S. East Coast from North
Carolina northward and Atlantic Canada over the next day or so.
Swells from Gabrielle will begin reaching the Azores later today.
These swells are expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products issued by your local
weather office.
