CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* All of the Azores
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area. Preparations to protect life and
property should be rushed to completion.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM GMT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gabrielle was
located near latitude 36.1 North, longitude 40.6 West. Gabrielle is
moving toward the east near 31 mph (50 km/h). An eastward to
east-northeastward motion is expected during the next couple of
days, followed by a slower eastward to east-southeastward motion
this weekend.  On the forecast track, the center of Gabrielle will
approach the Azores today and move across the island chain tonight 
into early Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gabrielle is forecast to be at hurricane strength when it 
passes through the Azores, then gradually weaken thereafter.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195
miles (315 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 978 mb (28.88 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the Azores tonight into
early Friday, with tropical storm conditions likely by this
evening. Significant hurricane-force wind gusts are likely across
portions of the Azores even after the center passes.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds in the
Azores. The surge will be accompanied by large and destructive
waves.
 
RAINFALL: From later today into Friday morning, Gabrielle may bring
3 to 5 inches, or 75 to 125 mm, of rainfall across the central and
western Azores. During the same time, outer bands from Gabrielle may
also result in 1 to 2 inches, or 25 to 50 mm, of rain across the
eastern Azores.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda
over the next couple of days, and the U.S. East Coast from North
Carolina northward and Atlantic Canada over the next day or so.
Swells from Gabrielle will begin reaching the Azores later today.
These swells are expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products issued by your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Gabrielle Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
300 AM GMT Thu Sep 25 2025

Gabrielle has weakened during the last several hours, with the 
low-level center on the eastern edge of the central dense overcast. 
A recent scatterometer pass indicated maximum winds of 60-65 kt, 
and after assuming some underestimation due to the instrument 
resolution, the current intensity is set to 75 kt.  This is also 
consistent with the latest TAFB/SAB Dvorak estimates.  

The hurricane is moving very quickly to the east (085/27 kt) within 
zonal mid-latitude flow.  This eastward to east-northeastward 
motion should continue for the next day or two as Gabrielle passes 
near or over the Azores late today into early Friday.  The only 
notable change to the track forecast is a southward adjustment, but 
that's mostly due to the center being more accurately located by 
the scatterometer data.   By the weekend, Gabrielle is forecast to 
slow down and turn toward the east and southeast while passing over 
the eastern Atlantic, in the general direction of Portugal. 

Gabrielle could lose a bit more strength in the short term due to 
persistent shear and cooler waters.  However, it is also forecast 
to continue to interact with an upper-level trough, which is likely 
to cause a warm seclusion low structure and the formation of a 
sting jet feature.  This should result in re-strengthening, with a 
band of hurricane-force winds wrapping around the back side of the 
system around the time it moves over the Azores.  The only 
significant change to the last intensity forecast was a short-term 
weakening, followed by a re-strengthening, consistent with the 
latest ECMWF/GFS solutions.   Gabrielle should complete its 
extratropical transition in just after 36 h, and afterwards more 
significant weakening is forecast as the post-tropical low fills 
over the far eastern Atlantic.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Gabrielle is forecast to approach the Azores late today as a 
hurricane. A Hurricane Warning is in effect for all of the islands
of the Azores, and hurricane conditions are likely tonight into 
Friday. Significant hurricane-force wind gusts are likely across 
portions of the Azores even after the center passes.
 
2.  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce significant
coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds in the Azores. The
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
3.  Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda
during the next couple of days, and the east coast of the United
States from North Carolina northward and Atlantic Canada for the
next day or so. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.

Tropical Storm Humberto Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 24 2025
 
The cloud pattern of Humberto has changed little in organization
over the past several hours.  Some rudimentary convective banding 
features are evident but the cold cloud tops are rather fragmented 
at this time.  Upper-level outflow is  being restricted over the 
western portion of the circulation, at least partially due to the 
outflow from disturbance 94L located near Puerto Rico.  The current 
intensity estimate is set at 40 kt in agreement with a recently 
received scatterometer pass.
 
The storm center is not yet very well-defined so the initial motion
is a rather uncertain 300/10 kt.  Over the next few days, Humberto 
should be steered generally west-northwestward to northwestward on 
the southwestern side of a subtropical mid-level high pressure area. 
The steering scenario for the tropical cyclone will likely become 
more complicated in 2-3 days due to the interaction with the 
developing system 94L to the west.  The official forecast track is 
quite similar to the previous one, and roughly in the middle of the 
guidance.  However, due to the likely complications in the evolution 
of the steering flow, there is lower than normal confidence in this 
track forecast.
 
Global models suggest that there will be some relaxation in westerly 
vertical wind shear over Humberto in the coming days. This, along 
with very warm ocean waters and a moist mid-level air mass, should 
lead to strengthening.  The system will probably become a hurricane 
in a couple of days, and then strengthen into a major hurricane.  
The official intensity forecast is in reasonable agreement with the 
simple and corrected model consensus, including the latest FSU 
Superensemble forecast.
