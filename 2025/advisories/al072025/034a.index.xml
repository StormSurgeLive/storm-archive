SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* All of the Azores
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected 
somewhere within the warning area, in case tonight or early Friday. 
Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to 
completion.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 PM GMT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gabrielle was 
located near latitude 36.4 North, longitude 36.5 West. Gabrielle is 
moving quickly toward the east near 32 mph (52 km/h). A fast 
eastward to east-northeastward motion is expected during the next 
day or two, followed by a slower eastward to east-southeastward 
motion this weekend. On the forecast track, the center of Gabrielle 
will approach the Azores today and move across the island chain 
tonight into early Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gabrielle is forecast to be at hurricane strength when it
passes through the Azores. After that, it is expected to weaken as 
an extratropical low through the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195
miles (315 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the Azores tonight into
early Friday, with tropical storm conditions likely by this
evening. Significant hurricane-force wind gusts are likely across
portions of the Azores even after the center passes.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce 
significant coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds in the 
Azores. The surge will be accompanied by large and destructive 
waves.
 
RAINFALL: From tonight through Friday morning, Gabrielle could
produce up to 3 to 5 inches, 75 to 125 mm, of storm total rainfall
across the central Azores. This rainfall could produce flash
flooding within the mountains. Elsewhere, Gabrielle is expected
to yield 1 to 3 inches, or 25 to 75 mm, of rain across the western 
and eastern Azores.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda, 
the northeastern coast of the U.S., and Atlantic Canada today. 
Swells from Gabrielle will begin reaching the Azores later today. 
These swells are expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions. Please consult products issued by your local 
weather office.

Hurricane Gabrielle Discussion Number  34
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
900 AM GMT Thu Sep 25 2025

The center of Gabrielle has moved over colder sea surface 
temperatures during the past few hours, and the associated 
convection is starting to weaken. However, the low-level center is 
still well embedded inside the convective cloud mass. Various 
satellite intensity estimates are now in the 60-77 kt range, and 
based on these and earlier scatterometer data the initial intensity 
is held at a possible generous 75 kt.

The initial motion remains quite fast at 080/28 kt. Mid-latitude 
westerly flow associated with a baroclinic trough to the west of 
Gabrielle is expected to steer the storm eastward to 
east-northeastward for the next day or two as it passes near or over 
the Azores late today into early Friday. After 48 h, the cyclone is 
expected to slow its forward speed and turn southeastward as it 
rounds the northeastern side of the subtropical ridge over the 
eastern Atlantic, with this motion likely to bring the system near 
or over southern Portugal before the cyclone dissipates. The track 
guidance is tightly clustered through 48 h, and the new forecast 
track is little changed from the previous forecast.

Gabrielle could weaken a little during the next 6-12 hours due to a 
combination of shear and cold sea surface temperatures. However, the 
ECMWF, GFS, and regional hurricane models are in good agreement that 
interaction with the baroclinic trough will start Gabrielle's 
extratropical transition process before the cyclone reaches the 
Azores, causing some re-intensification with a band of 
hurricane-force winds wrapping around the west side of the system 
around the time it moves over the Azores. The forecast intensity of 
80 kt in 24 h is based on a blend of the above-mentioned models. 
After passing the Azores, Gabrielle should finish this transition 
and become a decaying extratropical low over the northeastern 
Atlantic. Based on the global model, the associated winds are 
currently forecast to decrease below gale-force before the low moves 
near Portugal, and the cyclone is forecast to dissipate after 96 h.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Gabrielle is forecast to approach the Azores late today as a
hurricane. A Hurricane Warning is in effect for all of the islands
of the Azores, and hurricane conditions are likely tonight into
Friday. Significant hurricane-force wind gusts are likely across
portions of the Azores even after the center passes.
 
2.  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce significant
coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds in the Azores. The
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.

3. Heavy rainfall from Gabrielle could produce flash flooding across 
the terrain of the central Azores tonight through Friday morning.
 
4.  Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda
during the next couple of days, and the east coast of the United
States from North Carolina northward and Atlantic Canada for the
next day or so. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.

Tropical Storm Humberto Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
500 AM AST Thu Sep 25 2025
 
Humberto is still a shear tropical storm this morning.  Deep 
convection is wrapped around the eastern side of the circulation 
with the low-level center mostly exposed to the west of the coldest 
cloud tops.  Objective and subjective satellite Dvorak 
classifications have held steady this cycle, ranging from 33 to 41 
kts.  The initial intensity remains at 40 kt based on the 
scatterometer data mentioned in the previous discussion.

The estimated motion is northwestward at 9 kt.  Humberto is expected 
to be steered along the southern and southwestern side of a 
subtropical ridge centered over the western Atlantic.  The track 
forecast becomes more complicated in the next few days due to the 
proximity of the tropical storm to 94L, the developing system to the 
west.  Global models generally show Humberto moving around the 
western periphery of the subtropical high by the end of the forecast 
period, however there is quite a bit of uncertainty in the timing 
and location at which the storm will make that turn.  The GFS and 
UKMet show a much faster and farther east track while the ECMWF 
predicts a slower and more westward track.  The latest official 
track forecast is slower and a bit west of the previous prediction, 
near the center of the guidance envelope.
 
Humberto is expected to gradually strengthen during the next couple 
of days, despite the strong-to-moderate vertical wind shear.  When 
the westerly shear relaxes over the storm in 2-3 days, more 
signification intensification is expected over the warm ocean 
waters.  Most model guidance predicts Humberto will reach hurricane 
strength over the weekend and become a major hurricane by early next 
week. Few changes have been made to the NHC intensity forecast, 
which still lies near the FSU Superensemble prediction.
