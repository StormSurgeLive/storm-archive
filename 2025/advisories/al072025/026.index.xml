...INTERESTS IN THE AZORES SHOULD MONITOR ITS PROGRESS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...33.2N 59.7W
ABOUT 305 MI...485 KM ENE OF BERMUDA
ABOUT 1855 MI...2985 KM W OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...140 MPH...220 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 45 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...949 MB...28.03 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the Azores should monitor the progress of Gabrielle.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gabrielle was 
located near latitude 33.2 North, longitude 59.7 West. Gabrielle is 
moving toward the northeast near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A faster 
northeastward to east- northeastward motion is expected through 
Thursday.  On the forecast track, the center of Gabrielle will 
continue to move away from Bermuda today.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 140 mph (220 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gabrielle is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Gradual weakening is expected during the 
next couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 949 mb (28.03 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect 
Bermuda, the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward, and 
Atlantic Canada over the next few days.  These swells are expected 
to produce life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please 
consult products issued by your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Gabrielle Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
500 AM AST Tue Sep 23 2025

Gabrielle remains an impressive hurricane in satellite imagery. 
However, it appears to have reached peak intensity, as the eyewall 
convective tops have become more asymmetric during the past few 
hours and the eye has become less distinct. This is likely due to 
the onset of moderate southwesterly vertical shear as shown by the 
restricted outflow in the southwestern quadrant. The various 
subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates are in the 
115-125 kt range, so the initial intensity is held at 120 kt.

The hurricane continues moving northeastward or 045/11 kt. Gabrielle 
should continue to move around the northwestern side of the 
mid-level subtropical ridge during the next 12-24 h and then 
accelerate east-northeastward in the southern portion of the 
mid-latitude westerlies.  A slight turn to the northeast ahead of a 
higher-latitude trough is expected in 72-96 h, followed by a more 
eastward motion as Gabrielle merges with the trough.  The guidance 
envelope has only minor changes since the last advisory. So, the new 
forecast, which lies near or just north of the consensus models, is 
close to the previous forecast through 60 h and a little south of it 
after that time. The new forecast is also a little faster than the 
previous forecast.

Gradual weakening is expected during the next 24 h due to shear and 
gradually decreasing sea surface temperatures along the forecast 
track.  After that, increasing shear and even cooler water should 
cause a faster weakening. While the above-mentioned trough could 
provide enhanced divergence aloft which could help Gabrielle 
maintain some of its intensity, it is also likely to cause Gabrielle 
to start extratropical transition in about 60 h.  This transition 
will likely be complete just after the cyclone passes the Azores.  
The new intensity forecast is nudged downward from the previous 
forecast and is in good agreement with the intensity consensus.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda, 
the east coast of the United States from North Carolina northward, 
as well as Atlantic Canada, during the next couple of days.  These 
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
2.  Gabrielle is forecast to approach the Azores late on Thursday. 
Interests in the Azores should monitor the progress of Gabrielle 
though it is too soon to specify the magnitude of potential wind, 
rainfall, and wave impacts.
