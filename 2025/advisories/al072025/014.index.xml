...RECON AIRCRAFT TO INVESTIGATE GABRIELLE TODAY...
...EXPECTED TO BECOME A HURRICANE AND PASS EAST OF BERMUDA SUNDAY
NIGHT AND MONDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...25.0N 59.0W
ABOUT 540 MI...865 KM NNE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 615 MI...990 KM SE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 320 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Gabrielle.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gabrielle
was located near latitude 25.0 North, longitude 59.0 West. Gabrielle
is moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue through tonight.  A turn 
toward the north-northwest is forecast on Sunday, followed by a 
turn toward the north and northeast Monday and Monday night.  On 
the forecast track, the center of Gabrielle is expected to pass 
east of Bermuda Sunday night and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are now near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Continued gradual strengthening is forecast, and Gabrielle 
is expected to become a hurricane by Sunday. Air Force Reserve and 
NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft are scheduled to investigate 
Gabrielle later today.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Gabrielle are beginning to reach Bermuda
and will build through the weekend.  Swells generated by Gabrielle 
should reach the east coast of the United States from North 
Carolina northward, along with Atlantic Canada, later this weekend 
into early next week. These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Tropical Storm Gabrielle Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
500 AM AST Sat Sep 20 2025
 
Although Gabrielle's low-level center is obscured by high cirrus
clouds, an 0555 UTC AMSR2 microwave pass confirms that it is still
located to the west of the deep convective mass due to continued
moderate westerly shear.  The convection itself has been quite
intense, with a high density of lightning co-located with cloud-top
temperatures as cold as -85 to -90 degrees Celsius.  The latest
satellite intensity estimates, as well as ASCAT data from yesterday
evening, still support an intensity of 45 kt.  The ASCAT data also
showed that there are currently no tropical-storm-force winds on
Gabrielle's western side.
 
Mid-tropospheric high pressure over the central Atlantic is
steering Gabrielle northwestward, or 315 degrees at 11 kt.  The
storm is expected to recurve between the western periphery of the
high and a trough located over the southeastern United States over
the next several days.  Mostly because of an adjustment of
Gabrielle's initial position, the new NHC track forecast has been
adjusted a bit west of the previous prediction during the first 3
days of the forecast.  That said, all of the reliable track models
continue to keep the core of Gabrielle well east of Bermuda Sunday
night and Monday during the recurvature.  By Tuesday, global model
fields indicate that Gabrielle will become embedded in fast zonal
mid-latitude flow, and there has been a significant southward shift
in the track models on days 4 and 5.  The NHC track forecast has
also been adjusted southward at those times, close to the HCCA and
Google DeepMind ensemble but not as far south as the GFS and many
of the multi-model consensus aids.
 
Vertical shear is expected to decrease over the next day or two,
which should allow Gabrielle's circulation to become more
vertically aligned, leading to strengthening.  The intensity models 
are generally split into two camps.  The statistical-dynamical 
models (SHIPS and LGEM) and global models (GFS and ECMWF) are more 
subdued on the amount of strengthening that Gabrielle might 
experience.  The regional hurricane models, as well as the HCCA and 
Florida State Superensemble, are more aggressive, with the HAFS 
models in particular bringing Gabrielle to major hurricane strength 
in about 2 days.  While not going that high, the NHC intensity 
forecast is close to the other models in that camp and continues to 
show a possible peak of 90 kt in 60-72 hours.  With the southward 
shift in the track forecast at days 4 and 5, Gabrielle's 
extratropical transition has likely been delayed, and the official 
forecast continues to depict a tropical cyclone through the next 5 
days.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Gabrielle is forecast to become a hurricane by Sunday and pass
east of Bermuda Sunday night and Monday.  Interests on Bermuda
should continue to monitor Gabrielle's forecasts since some wind 
and rainfall impacts are still possible.
 
2.  Swells generated by Gabrielle are beginning to reach Bermuda
and will build through the weekend.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
