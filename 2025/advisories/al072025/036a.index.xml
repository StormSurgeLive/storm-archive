An area of low pressure is expected to <br />form along the wave tonight or early Friday when it moves near the <br />southeast Bahamas.  This low is expected to become a tropical <br />depression when it is in the vicinity of the central and northwest <br />Bahamas late Friday or over the weekend, and then track <br />northwestward or northward over the southwestern Atlantic.  <br /><br />Interests in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, the Turks and Caicos <br />Islands, and the Bahamas should monitor the progress of this <br />system.  Regardless of development, heavy rains and gusty winds <br />are likely across that region during the next couple of days.  <br />While there is significant uncertainty in the long-range track and <br />intensity of the system, the chances of wind, rainfall, and storm <br />surge impacts for a portion of the southeast U.S. coast are <br />increasing. Interests in that area should monitor the progress of <br />the system. <br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br />* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br /><br />$$<br />Forecaster Pasch]]>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* All of the Azores
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area, in this case through this 
morning.  Preparations to protect life and property should be
complete.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 AM GMT (0000 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Gabrielle was located near latitude 37.6 North, longitude 30.5 West.
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east-northeast near
30 mph (48 km/h).  An eastward to east-northeastward motion with a 
gradual decrease in forward speed is expected through Saturday, 
followed by a turn toward the southeast through early next week. On 
the forecast track, the center of post-tropical Gabrielle will move 
across the Azores this morning, then approach the coast of Portugal 
by early Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gabrielle is forecast to be at or near hurricane strength 
when it passes through the Azores. Then, weakening is expected over 
the weekend and into early next week.
 
Gale-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km) from the 
center.  Horta on Faial Island in the central Azores recently 
reported a wind gust to 43 mph (69 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 983 mb (29.03 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions, especially in gusts, are expected in the
Azores this morning, with tropical storm conditions expected to 
spread across the islands during the next couple of hours. 
Significant hurricane-force wind gusts are likely across portions of 
the Azores even after the center passes.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds in the
Azores. The surge will be accompanied by large and destructive
waves.
 
RAINFALL: Through this morning, Gabrielle could produce up to 3
to 5 inches, 75 to 125 mm, of storm total rainfall across the
central Azores. This rainfall could produce flash flooding within
the mountains. Elsewhere, Gabrielle is expected to yield 1 to 3
inches, 25 to 75 mm, of rain across the western and eastern Azores.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Gabrielle will affect the Azores through 
the weekend. Swells from Gabrielle will reach the coast of Portugal, 
northwestern Spain, and northern Morocco on Saturday. These swells 
are expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions. Please consult products issued by your local weather 
office.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Gabrielle Discussion Number  36
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
900 PM GMT Thu Sep 25 2025
 
Gabrielle has quickly lost tropical characteristics today in a 
highly sheared environment. Dry air infiltrating the circulation has 
left the low-level center partially exposed, and the overall cloud 
pattern has become more linear ahead of an approaching baroclinic 
system. Since Gabrielle no longer has organized deep convection and 
is beginning to interact with fronts, it is best designated as a 
post-tropical cyclone. The initial intensity is set at 60 kt based 
on earlier ASCAT data and the latest GFS and ECMWF wind fields. 
Weather radar data from Flores Island in the Azores indicate showers 
are spreading across the northwestern islands as conditions begin 
to deteriorate.

The cyclone continues moving quickly eastward (080/26 kt) within 
strong westerly mid-latitude flow. The center of Gabrielle will pass 
quickly near or over the Azores later tonight and early Friday. 
Gabrielle is forecast to gradually decelerate over the next few 
days while eventually turning southeastward as a ridge builds to 
the west over the eastern Atlantic. As a result, the post-tropical 
cyclone should pass near or over the coast of Portugal later this 
weekend. No significant changes were made to the NHC track forecast 
with this update.

The global models continue to show some increase in Gabrielle's peak 
winds tonight as the cyclone interacts with an approaching 
baroclinic system and completes extratropical transition. The NHC 
intensity forecast favors this solution and shows Gabrielle as a 
65-kt post-tropical cyclone moving through the Azores early Friday. 
Thereafter, steady weakening is forecast as the low becomes 
vertically stacked and fills over the far eastern Atlantic. The 
global models are in good agreement on this solution.  

A Hurricane Warning remains in effect for the islands of the 
Azores. The NHC will continue to issue forecasts on Gabrielle as a 
post-tropical cyclone until the threat to the Azores has ended.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Gabrielle is expected to bring hurricane conditions to the
islands of the Azores later tonight and early Friday. Significant
hurricane-force wind gusts are likely across portions of the Azores
even after the center passes.
 
2.  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce significant
coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds in the Azores. The
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
3.  Heavy rainfall from Gabrielle could produce flash flooding
across the terrain of the central Azores tonight through Friday
morning.

Tropical Storm Humberto Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
500 PM AST Thu Sep 25 2025
 
Humberto continues to gradually gain strength over the central
Atlantic.  Deep convection has been increasing over the center, and
the cloud pattern is more symmetric than it was earlier today.  This
is an indication that the wind shear around the storm is lessening.
Recent microwave images indicate that an inner core appears to be
forming, and an earlier ASCAT pass showed maximum winds of about 45
kt.  Based on the improving satellite presentation, the initial
intensity is increased to 50 kt.  This value is also near the
average of the latest satellite intensity estimates.  The 34-kt wind
radii have been adjusted based on the ASCAT data.
 
Steady to rapid strengthening is expected during the next few days
as the storm moves into a more favorable environment of light winds
aloft and high moisture.  Given that Humberto is relatively compact
and an increasingly symmetric system, these conditions should cause
it to become a hurricane on Friday and a major hurricane over the
weekend. Less favorable environmental conditions should cause some
weakening early next week.  This prediction remains in line with the
latest HCCA and IVCN consensus models.
 
The storm has jogged a little to the north today, but the overall
motion is northwestward at 5 kt. Humberto remains embedded in weak
steering currents on the south side of a narrow and weak subtropical
high over the central Atlantic.  This pattern should keep the storm
moving slowly to the west-northwest or northwest during the next day
or two.  After that time, Humberto is expected to become
increasingly steered by a much stronger high over the western
Atlantic, which should cause the storm to accelerate.  The NHC track
forecast is a little slower than the previous one, trending toward
the latest consensus and Google Deep Mind models. This forecast
keeps Humberto over the open central and western subtropical
Atlantic during the next several days.
