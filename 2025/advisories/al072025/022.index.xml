Hurricane Gabrielle Special Advisory Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
900 AM AST Mon Sep 22 2025
 
...GABRIELLE RAPIDLY INTENSIFIES INTO A MAJOR HURRICANE 
SOUTHEAST OF BERMUDA...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM AST...1300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...30.6N 62.2W
ABOUT 195 MI...310 KM SE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...120 MPH...195 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 10 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...957 MB...28.26 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Gabrielle.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM AST (1300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gabrielle was
located near latitude 30.6 North, longitude 62.2 West. Gabrielle is
moving toward the north near 10 mph (17 km/h).  This general motion 
is expected today, followed by a faster northeastward or 
east-northeastward motion on Tuesday. On the forecast track, the 
center of Gabrielle is expected to pass east of Bermuda tonight.
 
Satellite images indicate that the maximum sustained winds have 
increased to near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher gusts.  Gabrielle 
is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind 
Scale.  Gabrielle could intensify even more today, though some 
weakening should begin by Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 957 mb (28.26 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda
during the next few days. These swells are now reaching the east
coast of the United States from North Carolina northward, as well as
Atlantic Canada, and are expected to continue through the early
part this week. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Gabrielle Special Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
900 AM AST Mon Sep 22 2025

Satellite images indicate that Gabrielle has rapidly intensified 
into a major hurricane with a well-defined eye.  The current 
intensity is set to 105 kt, a blend of constrained Dvorak estimates 
of about 100 kt with higher Data-T values of 115 kt.  Further 
intensification is expected today, and the intensity forecast is 
raised for the first 24 hours, then kept the same afterwards.  
Small changes were made to the wind radii to account for the 
stronger hurricane.

No changes were required to the track forecast.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Gusty winds and showers will be possible across Bermuda today
and tonight as Hurricane Gabrielle passes by to the east.
 
2.  Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda
during the next few days. These swells are now reaching the east
coast of the United States from North Carolina northward, as well as
Atlantic Canada, and should continue during the next couple of days.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
