...GABRIELLE FORECAST TO BECOME A HURRICANE BY SUNDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...23.6N 57.2W
ABOUT 535 MI...855 KM NE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 760 MI...1220 KM SE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1004 MB...29.65 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Gabrielle.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gabrielle
was located near latitude 23.6 North, longitude 57.2 West. Gabrielle 
is moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this 
motion is expected to continue through Saturday. A gradual turn 
towards the north-northwest is expected by Sunday, followed by a 
northward motion by Sunday night. On the forecast track, the center 
of Gabrielle is expected to pass east of Bermuda Sunday night and 
Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is forecast, and Gabrielle is expected to
become a hurricane by Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Gabrielle are expected to reach Bermuda
soon and build through the weekend.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Gabrielle Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
1100 PM AST Fri Sep 19 2025
 
Gabrielle still has the appearance of a sheared tropical storm.
Before sunset, the low-level center was just west of the deep
convection and recent bursts have partially obscured it now.  A GPM
microwave pass showed a couple bands curving around the eastern
semicircle of the storm.  Satellite Dvorak estimates have remained
steady since the previous advisory and the intensity is held at 45
kt, closest to the TAFB classification of T3.0/45-kt.
 
The storm is moving northwestward at 10 kt as it is steered by a
subtropical ridge over the central Atlantic.  In about a day,
Gabrielle will turn to the north-northwest and the north while it
moves between the western periphery of the ridge and a mid-latitude
trough over the eastern United States.  The storm should turn more
towards the northeast and accelerate in the mid-latitude westerlies
by early next week.  The track guidance has a noticeably slower
forward motion this cycle and by the end of the forecast period, is
farther south.  Overall, the latest NHC track forecast is slower
than the previous prediction.  It is also farther east for the first
48 hours, largely due to the initial position being farther north
than expected.  Interest in Bermuda should continue to monitor
Gabrielle's progress since there is a roughly 20 percent chance of
tropical-storm-force winds occurring on Bermuda.
 
Gabrielle is expected to gradually strengthen as the environmental 
conditions become more conducive during the next few days.  The 
system should reach hurricane strength by Sunday and is forecast to 
peak at 90 kt at 72 h.  This forecast is closest to the corrected 
consensus aid, HCCA.  It should be noted that several of the 
hurricane regional models still predict that Gabrielle could reach 
major hurricane strength by early next week.  At the end of the 
forecast period, extratropical transition could be underway but 
with the southward adjustment to the track forecast, the official 
forecast does not explicitly call for it yet.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Gabrielle is forecast to become a hurricane by Sunday and pass
east of Bermuda Sunday night and Monday.  Interests on Bermuda
should monitor Gabrielle's forecasts since it is too soon to
specify the magnitude of potential wind and rainfall impacts.
 
2.  Swells generated by Gabrielle are expected to reach Bermuda
soon and build through the weekend.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
