SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...22.4N 56.6W
ABOUT 510 MI...820 KM NE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 850 MI...1365 KM SE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Gabrielle.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gabrielle was
located near latitude 22.4 North, longitude 56.6 West. Gabrielle is
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and a 
general northwestward motion is expected through Saturday. A 
gradual turn towards the north-northwestward is expected by 
Saturday night, followed by a northward motion by Sunday night. On 
the forecast track, the center of Gabrielle is expected to pass 
east of Bermuda Sunday night and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is forecast, and Gabrielle is expected to
become a hurricane by Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Gabrielle are expected to reach Bermuda
tonight and build through the weekend.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Tropical Storm Gabrielle Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
500 PM AST Fri Sep 19 2025

Gabrielle's cloud pattern has changed significantly since the last 
advisory. The previously noted shear pattern has changed to a curved 
convective band pattern, and the previously exposed low-level center 
has become at least partly covered by cirrus clouds spreading 
westward from the convection.  This change suggests that the storm 
is starting to encounter the forecast decrease in vertical shear.  
At this time, this change has not led to an increase in the various 
satellite intensity estimates, so the initial intensity remains 45 
kt.

The initial motion is 300/10 kt.  Gabrielle is on the southwest side 
of the subtropical ridge, and during the next 2-3 days it is 
expected to turn northward between the ridge to the east and and a 
mid-latitude trough over the eastern United States and the far 
western Atlantic.  The track guidance remains fairly tightly 
clustered during this time, although the consensus models have 
shifted a little to the left since the last advisory. This part of 
the new forecast track is nudged a little to the left, but still 
lies east of the consensus models.  After 3 days, Gabrielle is 
expected to recurve into the westerlies and accelerate 
northeastward. The guidance shows more spread during this time, with 
the GFS being to the left/north and faster than most of the 
guidance, while the ECMWF is to the right/south and slower. Despite 
the spread, the consensus models and the center of the guidance 
envelope are have changed little since the last advisory for this 
part of the forecast. Thus, the new forecast is similar to, but 
slightly slower than, the previous forecast. The reliable track 
models still show Gabrielle's center passing at least 130 n mi east 
of Bermuda in 60-72 h. However, interests on the island should 
continue to monitor Gabrielle's progress since NHC's average track 
error at 72 h is about 90 n mi, and hazards can extend well away 
from the center. There remains a 20-25 percent chance of 
tropical-storm-force winds occurring on Bermuda.
 
Gabrielle is now forecast to be in a light-to-moderate shear 
environment for the next 72 h, which should allow strengthening 
that would be tempered mainly by occasional entrainment of dry air. 
The new intensity forecast has been tweaked a bit to show a peak 
intensity of 90 kt at 72 h.  Extratropical transition should be 
underway by 120 h, and could be complete by that time if the 
cyclone takes a more northward track similar to the GFS. However, a 
more southward track similar to the ECMWF would delay transition, 
and based on the uncertainty the new intensity forecast keeps the 
system as a tropical cyclone at 120 h.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Gabrielle is forecast to become a hurricane by Sunday and pass
east of Bermuda Sunday night and Monday.  Interests on Bermuda
should monitor Gabrielle's forecasts since it is too soon to
specify the magnitude of potential wind and rainfall impacts.
 
2.  Swells generated by Gabrielle are expected to reach Bermuda
tonight and build through the weekend.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
