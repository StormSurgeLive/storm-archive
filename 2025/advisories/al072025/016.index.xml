1100 PM AST Sat Sep 20 2025
 
...GABRIELLE EXPECTED TO BECOME A HURRICANE ON SUNDAY...
...FORECAST TO PASS EAST OF BERMUDA ON MONDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...26.3N 59.2W
ABOUT 535 MI...860 KM SE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 335 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...996 MB...29.42 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Gabrielle.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gabrielle 
was located near latitude 26.3 North, longitude 59.2 West. Gabrielle 
is moving toward the north-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this 
general motion should continue through Sunday. A turn toward the 
north is forecast on Monday, followed by a faster northeastward or 
east-northeastward motion on Tuesday. On the forecast track, the 
center of Gabrielle is expected to pass east of Bermuda on Monday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and 
Gabrielle is expected to become a hurricane on Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km) 
mainly to the east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda 
through early next week. Distant swells from Gabrielle should reach 
the east coast of the United States from North Carolina northward, 
along with Atlantic Canada, on Sunday and continue through early 
next week. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf 
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local 
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Tropical Storm Gabrielle Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
1100 PM AST Sat Sep 20 2025
 
Recent GMI and SSMIS passive microwave images of Gabrielle suggest 
the tight inner core noted in earlier aircraft data has collapsed. A 
larger mid-level eye structure now wraps over halfway around the 
circulation but is open to the southwest. The low-level center of 
the storm lies near the sharp western edge of the convective cloud 
mass, which suggests Gabrielle is still contending with some shear. 
Convective band wraps around the eastern side of the storm, where 
recent ASCAT-B data confirm the strongest surface winds are 
occurring. The initial intensity is set at 55 kt based on TAFB 
Dvorak and UW-CIMSS objective satellite intensity estimates. Air 
Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters are scheduled to investigate the 
storm tomorrow morning. 
 
Gabrielle is moving north-northwestward (335/8 kt) along the 
southwestern side of a subtropical ridge over the central Atlantic. 
Over the next couple of days, Gabrielle is expected to recurve to 
the north and northeast between this ridge and a mid-latitude trough 
over the eastern United States. The track models remain in good 
near-term agreement, and the updated NHC track forecast keeps 
Gabrielle well east of Bermuda on Monday. Then, Gabrielle is 
forecast to accelerate east-northeastward through the rest of the 
week while embedded in zonal westerly flow. There are greater speed 
differences in the track models during the latter half of the 
forecast period, but the consensus has trended slower once again, 
and this is reflected in the updated NHC forecast.

Assuming Gabrielle is able to solidify its inner core soon, some 
strengthening is expected over warm waters within a low to moderate 
shear environment during the next couple of days. The latest track 
guidance is not quite as aggressive as earlier today. The NHC 
forecast is very similar to the previous one, remaining close to the 
HFIP corrected consensus (HCCA) near the higher end of the guidance 
envelope. By Tuesday, increased westerly shear is forecast to cause 
Gabrielle to weaken, especially while it moves over cooler waters 
later next week. The long-range forecast track uncertainty makes it 
difficult to assess whether Gabrielle will fully complete 
extratropical transition by the end of the period. However, it seems 
likely that the system will be losing tropical characteristics and 
in close proximity to fronts by Friday.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Gabrielle is forecast to become a hurricane on Sunday and pass 
east of Bermuda on Monday. While the chances of impacts are 
decreasing, interests on Bermuda should continue to monitor forecast 
updates since some wind and rainfall impacts are still possible.
 
2.  Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda 
through early next week. These swells are expected to reach the 
coast of the United States from North Carolina northward, along with 
the coast of Atlantic Canada, on Sunday and continue through early 
next week. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf 
and rip current conditions.
