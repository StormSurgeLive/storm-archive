An area of low pressure is expected to <br />form along the wave tonight or early Friday when it moves near the <br />southeast Bahamas.  This low is expected to become a tropical <br />depression when it is in the vicinity of the central and northwest <br />Bahamas late Friday or over the weekend, and then track <br />northwestward or northward over the southwestern Atlantic.  <br /><br />Interests in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, the Turks and Caicos <br />Islands, and the Bahamas should monitor the progress of this <br />system.  Regardless of development, heavy rains and gusty winds <br />are likely across that region during the next couple of days.  <br />While there is significant uncertainty in the long-range track and <br />intensity of the system, the chances of wind, rainfall, and storm <br />surge impacts for a portion of the southeast U.S. coast are <br />increasing. Interests in that area should monitor the progress of <br />the system. <br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br />* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br /><br />$$<br />Forecaster Pasch]]>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* All of the Azores
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area, in this case through this
morning.  Preparations to protect life and property should be
complete.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM GMT (0300 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Gabrielle was located near latitude 37.8 North, longitude 29.3 West.
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east-northeast near
29 mph (46 km/h).  An eastward to east-northeastward motion with a
gradual decrease in forward speed is expected through Saturday,
followed by a turn toward the southeast and south through early 
next week.  On the forecast track, the center of post-tropical 
Gabrielle will move across the Azores this morning, then approach 
the coast of Portugal by early Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some slight re-strengthening is possible later today, but 
gradual weakening should begin on Saturday.
 
Gale-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km) from the 
center.  A sustained wind of 71 mph (114 km/h) with a gust to 86 
mph (138 km/h) was recently reported by a station on Terceira Island 
in the central Azores at an elevation of 884 feet (269 m).  Closer 
to sea level, a wind gust to 58 mph (93 km/h) was measured at Ponta 
Furada on Faial Island.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 985 mb (29.09 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions, with gusts to hurricane force, are
occurring in the central Azores and will spread to the southeastern
Azores over the next couple of hours.  Strong, gusty winds will
continue across these islands through the morning.
 
Gusty winds are possible along portions of the coast of Portugal
late Saturday through Sunday.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds in the
Azores. The surge will be accompanied by large and destructive
waves.
 
RAINFALL: Through this morning, Gabrielle could produce 3 to 5 
inches, or 75 to 125 mm, of storm total rainfall across the central 
Azores.  This rainfall could cause flash flooding across the 
terrain.  Elsewhere, Gabrielle is expected to produce 1 to 3 inches, 
or 25 to 75 mm, of rain across the eastern Azores.  
 
SURF: Swells generated by Gabrielle will affect the Azores through
the weekend and will reach the coasts of Portugal, northwestern
Spain, and northern Morocco on Saturday. These swells are expected
to produce life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products issued by your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 600 AM GMT.
Next complete advisory at 900 AM GMT.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Gabrielle Discussion Number  37
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
300 AM GMT Fri Sep 26 2025
 
A patch of deep convection has redeveloped well to the northeast of 
Gabrielle's center, most likely along an occluded frontal boundary 
that is forming in the storm's immediate vicinity.  A 2330 UTC ASCAT 
pass showed winds as high as 45 kt in the southeastern quadrant-- 
slightly lower than the ASCAT pass from 12 hours ago--and therefore 
the current intensity is estimated to be 55 kt.  Strong winds began 
spreading across the central Azores a few hours ago, with 
hurricane-force gusts being reported at some elevated sites on those 
islands.  Strong winds are expected to spread to the southeastern 
Azores within the next couple of hours.

The current motion is east-northeastward, or 070 degrees at 25 
kt.  Gabrielle's center is forecast to move across the Azores over 
the next several hours and then continue on a more-or-less eastward 
track but at a slower speed for the next couple of days while 
approaching the coast of Portugal.  An even slower southeastward to 
southward motion is expected in 3 to 4 days while the low decays 
near southern Portugal and northern Morocco.

Gabrielle could re-intensify slightly today until extratropical 
transition is completed, with the strongest winds shifting from the 
southeastern quadrant to the northwestern quadrant.  A gradual 
decrease in winds is expected after 24 hours, and the NHC intensity 
forecast is close to a blend of the GFS and ECWMF solutions.
 
A Hurricane Warning remains in effect for the islands of the
Azores. The NHC will continue to issue forecasts on Gabrielle as a
post-tropical cyclone until the threat to the Azores has ended.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Gabrielle is expected to produce tropical storm conditions, 
with gusts to hurricane force, across the central and southeastern 
Azores this morning, with the strongest winds occurring at higher 
elevations.
 
2.  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce significant
coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds in the Azores. The
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
3.  Heavy rainfall from Gabrielle could produce flash flooding 
across the terrain of the central Azores through this morning.

Tropical Storm Humberto Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
1100 PM AST Thu Sep 25 2025
 
Humberto continues to gain strength while moving slowly over the
central Atlantic.  The system is exhibiting a growing CDO feature
with cloud tops to near -70 deg C, along with some convective bands
over the eastern portion of the circulation, where most of the
lightning flashes are currently occurring.  The advisory intensity
is increased to 55 kt, in agreement with subjective Dvorak
classifications from both TAFB and SAB and a blend of objective
satellite estimates from UW-CIMSS.
 
The storm's forward speed is quite slow with a motion estimate of
only 320/3 kt.  Steering currents are not strong at this time since 
the subtropical ridge to the north of Humberto is quite weak.  
Global model forecasts show the ridge strengthening with time and in 
a few days the cyclone should move somewhat faster toward the  
northwest and turn northward in the vicinity of 70 W longitude. By 
the end of the forecast period, after Humberto passes north of the 
ridge, the system should begin accelerating northeastward.
 
Cirrus motions indicate that the vertical wind shear over Humberto
has lessened, and the SHIPS model output does not show the shear
increasing much through 72 hours.  Sea surface temperatures are
expected to be very warm along the projected path of the cyclone,
and the system should remain embedded in a moist air mass.  The
official forecast continues to call for significant strengthening
during the next few days.  This is consistent with the latest
corrected consensus, HCCA, forecast which also shows Humberto
intensifying into a major hurricane this weekend.
