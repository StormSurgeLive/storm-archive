Tropical Storm Gabrielle Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
1100 PM AST Thu Sep 18 2025
 
Gabrielle has managed to re-develop deep convection near its 
low-level center this evening.  Thunderstorms in the northeast 
quadrant formed early in the afternoon and have continued into the 
evening, producing cloud top temperatures colder than -80 degrees C. 
 A scatterometer pass from 0012 UTC measured the eastern portion of 
the circulation with wind speeds close to 40 kt.  However, these 
data did not capture the radius of maximum wind, which is assumed to 
have stronger winds.  Therefore, the initial intensity is held at 45 
kt for this advisory. 

Global models suggest environmental conditions will be unfavorable 
for the next day or so while Gabrielle contends with 
strong-to-moderate vertical wind shear and dry air intrusions.  By 
this weekend, both of these impediments should subside and allow the 
storm to gradually strengthen.  Once again, the intensity aids have 
risen this cycle.  The NHC intensity forecast has been nudged upward 
and now lies in the middle of the guidance envelope with a peak of 
90 kt by day 4.  
 
Gabrielle is moving west-northwestward at 10 kt.  The storm should 
slowly turn toward the northwest over the next few days around the 
periphery of a subtropical ridge centered over the central Atlantic. 
Late this weekend and into early next week, the storm is expected to 
turn toward the north and northeast in the flow between the ridge 
and a frontal system approaching from the west.  There are still 
some speed differences among the numerical models, however the 
overall track guidance spread is not as significant this cycle. The 
latest official track forecast is slightly east of the previous 
prediction and lies between the consensus aids to the west and 
Google DeepMind to the east. Interests in Bermuda should continue to 
monitor Gabrielle over the next several days.
