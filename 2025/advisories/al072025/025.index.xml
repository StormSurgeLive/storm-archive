...INTERESTS IN THE AZORES SHOULD MONITOR ITS PROGRESS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...32.4N 61.0W
ABOUT 220 MI...355 KM E OF BERMUDA
ABOUT 1945 MI...3130 KM W OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...140 MPH...220 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 50 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...948 MB...28.00 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the Azores should monitor the progress of Gabrielle.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Gabrielle was
located near latitude 32.4 North, longitude 61.0 West.  Gabrielle is
moving toward the northeast near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A faster 
northeastward to east- northeastward motion is expected on Tuesday 
and Wednesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Gabrielle 
will continue to move away from Bermuda tonight and Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 140 mph (220 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gabrielle is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in strength is expected 
through early Tuesday, followed by  gradual weakening later on 
Tuesday and on Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 948 mb (28.00 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda
and the east coast of the United States from North Carolina
northward, as well as Atlantic Canada, and are expected to continue
for the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Gabrielle Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
500 PM AST Mon Sep 22 2025

Gabrielle has continued to become better organized this afternoon, 
with very cold cloud tops in the eyewall and a warm eye.  Data from 
both NOAA P-3 Hurricane Hunter aircraft confirm satellite estimates 
that Gabrielle is a category 4 hurricane, with peak 700-mb winds of 
129 kt in the eastern quadrant a few hours ago.  Additionally, 
tail-Doppler radar data showed maximum 0.5 km winds of 135-140 kt 
on the last pass, and the double eyewall structure has 
consolidated into a single eyewall again.  These data supported an 
intensity of at least 115 kt at 18Z, and with the slight 
improvement on satellite since that time, the initial wind speed is 
set to 120 kt.  

The hurricane is moving to the north-northeast at about 10 kt. 
There are no important changes to report to the track forecast, 
with the subtropical ridge providing a seemingly reliable steering 
for the next several days.  Gabrielle is forecast to turn 
northeastward overnight and then move at a more rapid pace to the 
east-northeast during the next few days due to stronger mid-latitude 
flow.  The new forecast remains on the faster side of the guidance, 
closer to the Google DeepMind and GFS model.  Extratropical 
transition is expected late on Friday while the system is in the 
vicinity of the Azores.
 
Little significant intensity change with Gabrielle is expected as 
the cyclone begins to move into a less conducive environment, 
though the overnight diurnal convective max should help the 
hurricane maintain its strength in the short term.  A combination of 
cooler waters and increasing shear should cause Gabrielle to start 
to weaken by late tomorrow.  While SSTs drop off notably by 
midweek, an upper-level trough is likely to provide extra divergence 
aloft, keeping the hurricane stronger than other environmental 
conditions might suggest.  The new NHC intensity forecast is quite 
similar to the previous one, showing a gradual weakening during the 
long-range forecast and near the model consensus.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda 
and the east coast of the United States from North Carolina 
northward, as well as Atlantic Canada, during the next couple of 
days.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and 
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local 
weather office.
 
2.  Gabrielle is forecast to approach the Azores late on Thursday.
Interests in the Azores should monitor the progress of Gabrielle
though it is too soon to specify the magnitude of potential
wind, rainfall, and wave impacts.
