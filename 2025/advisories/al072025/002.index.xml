DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of poorly defined Tropical 
Storm Gabrielle was located near latitude 17.5 North, longitude 
46.6 West. Gabrielle is moving toward the north-northwest near 22

motion at a reduced forward speed is anticipated across the 
tropical and subtropical central Atlantic during the next few days.
 
Satellite-derived winds indicate that the maximum sustained winds 
are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. Little change in 
strength is forecast during the next 48 hours but some gradual 
intensification is forecast over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center, primarily in the eastern semicircle of the storm.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).

      <title>Tropical Depression Seven Forecast Discussion Number 1</title>

Tropical Depression Seven Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
500 AM AST Wed Sep 17 2025

Satellite data indicate that Invest 92L over the central tropical 
Atlantic has now developed into a tropical depression.  ASCAT data 
from around 00Z showed that the circulation of the system had 
improved, and although it was not well defined at the time of the 
pass, the system was only lacking some northerly winds on its west 
side.  Since deep convection has been persisting and consolidating 
near the center, it appears to now meet the convective and 
circulation criteria needed to be considered a tropical cyclone.  
However, it should be noted that the system is quite large and there 
is still considerable north-south elongation in the low-level 
structure. The initial intensity is set at 30 kt based on a blend of 
the ASCAT data and the latest Dvorak estimate from TAFB.  The 
development of this system breaks a nearly 3-week streak of no 
tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin during the peak of the 
hurricane season.

The depression is well away from land and roughly midway between the 
Cabo Verde Islands and the Windward Islands.  The system is 
estimated to be moving westward at 11 kt, but this is of low 
confidence since the center has only recently formed.  A turn to the 
northwest, perhaps influenced by a center formation, is expected to 
occur soon as the depression moves toward a weakness in the Atlantic 
subtropical ridge caused by a mid- to upper-level low to its north.  
The models show this low weakening in a day or two, which will 
likely cause the cyclone to turn back to the west-northwest late 
this week.  However, the system should reach the western periphery 
of the ridge this weekend, resulting in a turn to the northwest or 
north.  The NHC track forecast is a little to the right of the 
consensus aids, giving more weight to the ECMWF and Google Deep Mind 
predictions, which are faster and on the right side of the guidance. 
Based on the steering pattern, and deterministic and ensemble model 
solutions, there is high confidence that this system should pass 
well east of the Windward and Leeward Islands.  Interests in Bermuda 
should monitor forecasts of the depression over the next several 
days.

Only modest strengthening is expected over the next day or two as 
the depression continues to battle moderate shear from the 
aforementioned low aloft and intrusions of dry air.  However, more 
notable strengthening seems likely by the weekend when the system 
moves into more conducive environmental conditions.  The NHC 
intensity forecast shows the system reaching hurricane strength 
toward the end of the period, but it should be noted that the spread 
in the models at that time is significant and ranges from solutions 
showing a weak low to a major hurricane.  This prediction is 
generally in line with the IVCN aid.
