...GABRIELLE MOVING EAST-NORTHEASTWARD AS A CATEGORY 4 
HURRICANE OVER THE NORTH ATLANTIC...
...HURRICANE WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FOR THE AZORES...
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...33.9N 58.3W
ABOUT 390 MI...630 KM ENE OF BERMUDA
ABOUT 1765 MI...2840 KM W OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...140 MPH...220 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 60 DEGREES AT 20 MPH...31 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...948 MB...28.00 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Azores Meteorological Service has issued a Hurricane Watch for
all the islands of the Azores. 
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* All of the Azores

A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Gabrielle was 
located near latitude 33.9 North, longitude 58.3 West. Gabrielle is 
moving toward the east-northeast near 20 mph (31 km/h). A faster 
east-northeastward motion is expected through Thursday. On the 
forecast track, the center of Gabrielle will continue to move away 
from Bermuda today, but begin approaching the Azores on Thursday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 140 mph (220 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Gabrielle is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Gradual weakening is expected during the next 
couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 948 mb (28.00 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area
by Thursday night.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce 
significant coastal flooding near the areas of onshore winds where 
the center makes landfall. Near the coast, the surge will be 
accompanied by large and destructive waves.

RAINFALL: From Thursday into Friday morning, Gabrielle may bring 3 
to 5 inches or 75 to 125 mm of rainfall across the central and 
western Azores. During the same time outer bands from Gabrielle may 
also result in 1 to 2 inches or 25 to 50 mm of rain across the 
eastern Azores.  
 
SURF: Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda, 
the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward, and Atlantic 
Canada over the next few days. These swells are expected to produce 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products issued by your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Gabrielle Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
500 AM AST Tue Sep 23 2025

Gabrielle remains an impressive hurricane in satellite imagery. 
However, it appears to have reached peak intensity, as the eyewall 
convective tops have become more asymmetric during the past few 
hours and the eye has become less distinct. This is likely due to 
the onset of moderate southwesterly vertical shear as shown by the 
restricted outflow in the southwestern quadrant. The various 
subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates are in the 
115-125 kt range, so the initial intensity is held at 120 kt.

The hurricane continues moving northeastward or 045/11 kt. Gabrielle 
should continue to move around the northwestern side of the 
mid-level subtropical ridge during the next 12-24 h and then 
accelerate east-northeastward in the southern portion of the 
mid-latitude westerlies.  A slight turn to the northeast ahead of a 
higher-latitude trough is expected in 72-96 h, followed by a more 
eastward motion as Gabrielle merges with the trough.  The guidance 
envelope has only minor changes since the last advisory. So, the new 
forecast, which lies near or just north of the consensus models, is 
close to the previous forecast through 60 h and a little south of it 
after that time. The new forecast is also a little faster than the 
previous forecast.

Gradual weakening is expected during the next 24 h due to shear and 
gradually decreasing sea surface temperatures along the forecast 
track.  After that, increasing shear and even cooler water should 
cause a faster weakening. While the above-mentioned trough could 
provide enhanced divergence aloft which could help Gabrielle 
maintain some of its intensity, it is also likely to cause Gabrielle 
to start extratropical transition in about 60 h.  This transition 
will likely be complete just after the cyclone passes the Azores.  
The new intensity forecast is nudged downward from the previous 
forecast and is in good agreement with the intensity consensus.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda, 
the east coast of the United States from North Carolina northward, 
as well as Atlantic Canada, during the next couple of days.  These 
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
2.  Gabrielle is forecast to approach the Azores late on Thursday. 
Interests in the Azores should monitor the progress of Gabrielle 
though it is too soon to specify the magnitude of potential wind, 
rainfall, and wave impacts.
