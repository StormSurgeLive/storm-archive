BULLETIN
Hurricane Gabrielle Advisory Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
1100 AM AST Mon Sep 22 2025
 
...GABRIELLE COULD FURTHER STRENGTHEN AS IT PASSES EAST OF BERMUDA
TODAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...30.8N 62.3W
ABOUT 180 MI...290 KM SE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...120 MPH...195 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 10 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...955 MB...28.20 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda and the Azores should monitor the progress of
Gabrielle.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gabrielle was
located near latitude 30.8 North, longitude 62.3 West. Gabrielle is
moving toward the north near 10 mph (17 km/h).  This general motion
is expected today, followed by a faster northeastward or east-
northeastward motion on Tuesday and Wednesday. On the forecast
track, the center of Gabrielle is expected to pass east of Bermuda
tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gabrielle is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Gabrielle could intensify even more today,
though some weakening should begin by Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 955 mb (28.20 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda
during the next few days. These swells are now reaching the east
coast of the United States from North Carolina northward, as well as
Atlantic Canada, and are expected to continue through the early
part this week. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Gabrielle Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
1100 AM AST Mon Sep 22 2025
 
Visible satellite imagery shows that Gabrielle is an impressive, 
well-organized hurricane.  The eye of Gabrielle has recently 
warmed, though the eyewall convection remains a bit fractured in 
the northeastern quadrant.  Bermuda radar also has the suggestion 
of the beginning of an eyewall replacement cycle, with an outer 
eyewall possibly forming.  The initial intensity is held at 105 kt, 
at the top end of the various intensity estimates, and a NOAA 
Hurricane Hunter will be in the area during the next few hours
for a closer look at the hurricane.
 
Gabrielle is moving northward at about 9 kt.  The track forecast
seems straightforward with the subtropical ridge providing the
steering for the next several days.  The hurricane should turn
northeastward tonight and then move faster to the east-northeast
during the next few days due to Gabrielle encountering stronger
mid-latitude flow.  Model guidance is generally a bit faster than
the last cycle, and the new forecast is adjusted in that direction.
Extratropical transition is expected on Friday while the system is
in the vicinity of the Azores.
 
The hurricane is moving over very warm waters within moderate shear
today, so further intensification is expected.  A combination of
cooler waters and increasing shear should cause Gabrielle to start
to weaken tomorrow.  While SSTs drop off more significantly by
midweek, an upper-level trough could provide a favorable trough
interaction, keeping the hurricane more organized than other
environmental conditions might suggest.  The new NHC intensity
forecast is similar to the previous one, showing a gradual
weakening during most of the forecast and lies close to the model
consensus.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Gusty winds and showers will be possible across Bermuda today
and tonight as Hurricane Gabrielle passes by to the east.
 
2.  Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda
during the next few days. These swells are now reaching the east
coast of the United States from North Carolina northward, as well as
Atlantic Canada, and should continue during the next couple of days.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
3.  Gabrielle is forecast to approach the Azores on Thursday.
Interests in the Azores should monitor the progress of Gabrielle
though it is too soon to specify the magnitude of potential 
wind, rainfall, and wave impacts.
