BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Gabrielle Advisory Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
1100 AM AST Sun Sep 21 2025
 
...GABRIELLE POISED TO BECOME A HURRICANE LATER TODAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...27.7N 61.0W
ABOUT 390 MI...630 KM SE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 320 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...995 MB...29.39 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Gabrielle.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gabrielle
was located near latitude 27.7 North, longitude 61.0 West. Gabrielle
is moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this
general motion should continue through tonight. A turn toward the
north is forecast on Monday, followed by a faster northeastward or
east-northeastward motion on Tuesday. On the forecast track, the
center of Gabrielle is expected to pass east of Bermuda on Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gabrielle is expected to become a hurricane later today, and
rapid intensification is possible over the next day or so. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda
during the next few days. These swells are expected to reach the
east coast of the United States from North Carolina northward, as
well as Atlantic Canada, starting today and continuing through 
early this week. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening 
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your 
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Tropical Storm Gabrielle Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
500 AM AST Sun Sep 21 2025
 
Gabrielle has become slightly better organized overnight. The large 
convective band over the eastern side of the system has persisted, 
and within the last few hours deep convection has been bursting over 
the low-level center. There have been no microwave passes since the 
previous advisory, to determine if the inner core has been able to 
close off on the southwestern side. Satellite intensity estimates 
from TAFB and SAB were both T/3.5 or 55 kts. Latest objective AiDT, 
DPRINT, and DMINT intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS range from 52 to 
58 kt. Using these estimates, the intensity is held at 55 kt for 
this advisory, although that could be conservative given recent 
convective burst. An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 
en route to investigate the storm and will provide important details 
on the intensity and structure of the system.
 
The storm is moving north-northwestward at an estimated motion of 
335/8 kt. The system continues to be steered by a subtropical ridge 
over the Central Atlantic. Over the next few days, Gabrielle will 
begin to recurve to the north and eventually northeast between the 
western periphery of the ridge and a trough moving offshore the east 
coast of the United States. Track models remain tightly clustered 
and keep Gabrielle well east of Bermuda on Monday. As Gabrielle 
becomes steered within the west-southwesterly wind flow, the system 
will accelerate across the Atlantic. By day 3 of the forecast 
period, there is some along track model spread with differences in 
the forward speed of the system. The NHC track forecast is near the 
previous in the short term, but some minor adjustments to slow down 
the previous forecast towards the consensus aids were made between 
day 3-5.
 
The environment surrounding the system is favorable for 
strengthening over the next couple of days, with light to moderate 
wind shear, warm sea surface temperatures, and slightly better 
mid-level relative humidity values. As Gabrielle looks to be 
establishing an inner core, it should begin to strengthen. The NHC 
intensity forecast follows these trends although the intensity 
guidance has continued to trend not as aggressive due to how long 
the system has taken to establish an inner core, and the peak 
intensity forecast has been lowered to 85 kt, which remains near the 
higher end of the guidance envelope. In about 48 h, westerly shear 
will begin to increase and sea surface temperatures will begin to 
cool along the forecast track, thus a weakening trend is forecast. 
The long-range forecast along track uncertainty makes it difficult 
to assess whether Gabrielle will fully complete extratropical 
transition by the end of the period. 
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Gabrielle is forecast to become a hurricane later today and pass 
east of Bermuda on Monday. While the chances of impacts are 
decreasing, interests on Bermuda should continue to monitor forecast 
updates since some wind and rainfall impacts are still possible.
 
2.  Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda 
during the next few days. These swells are expected to reach the 
east coast of the United States from North Carolina northward, as 
well as Atlantic Canada, beginning later today and continuing 
through early this week. These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
