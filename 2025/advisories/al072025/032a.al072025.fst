DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gabrielle was
located near latitude 36.1 North, longitude 43.5 West. Gabrielle is
moving toward the east near 29 mph (46 km/h). An eastward to 
east-northeastward motion is expected during the next couple of 
days, followed by a slower eastward to east-southeastward motion 
this weekend.  On the forecast track, the center of Gabrielle will 
approach the Azores during the day on Thursday and move across the 
island chain late Thursday into early Friday.  
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some weakening is forecast during the next few days, but 
Gabrielle is forecast to be at hurricane strength when it passes 
through the Azores.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160
miles (260 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 970 mb (28.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the Azores Thursday
night into early Friday, with tropical storm conditions likely by
Thursday evening. Significant hurricane-force wind gusts are likely
across portions of the Azores even after the center passes.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds in the
Azores. The surge will be accompanied by large and destructive
waves.
 
RAINFALL: From Thursday into Friday morning, Gabrielle may bring 3
to 5 inches, or 75 to 125 mm, of rainfall across the central and
western Azores. During the same time, outer bands from Gabrielle may
also result in 1 to 2 inches, or 25 to 50 mm, of rain across the
eastern Azores.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda
over the next couple of days, and the U.S. East Coast from North
Carolina northward and Atlantic Canada over the next day or so.
Swells from Gabrielle will begin reaching the Azores on Thursday.
These swells are expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products issued by your local
weather office.
