1100 AM AST Wed Sep 24 2025
 
...GABRIELLE MOVING QUICKLY EAST-NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE
SUBTROPICAL ATLANTIC...
...HURRICANE WARNING IN EFFECT FOR THE AZORES...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...36.0N 48.7W
ABOUT 1200 MI...1935 KM W OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...110 MPH...175 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 75 DEGREES AT 25 MPH...41 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...962 MB...28.41 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* All of the Azores
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area. A warning is typically issued 36
hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm- 
force winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or 
dangerous. Preparations to protect life and property should be 
rushed to completion.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gabrielle was 
located near latitude 36.0 North, longitude 48.7 West. Gabrielle is 
moving toward the east-northeast near 25 mph (41 km/h). This general 
motion with some increase in forward speed is expected to continue 
for the next couple of days, followed by a slower eastward to 
east-southeastward motion this weekend. On the forecast track, the 
center of Gabrielle will approach the Azores during the day on 
Thursday, and move across the island chain Thursday night into 
Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 110 mph (175 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Some weakening is expected during the next couple of days, 
but Gabrielle is still forecast to be a hurricane when it passes 
through the Azores.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 962 mb (28.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the Azores Thursday night
and Friday, with tropical storm conditions likely by Thursday
evening.   
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds in the 
Azores. The surge will be accompanied by large and destructive 
waves.
 
RAINFALL: From Thursday into Friday morning, Gabrielle may bring 3
to 5 inches, or 75 to 125 mm, of rainfall across the central and
western Azores. During the same time outer bands from Gabrielle may
also result in 1 to 2 inches, or 25 to 50 mm, of rain across the
eastern Azores.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda 
over the next couple of days, and the U.S. East Coast from North 
Carolina northward and Atlantic Canada over the next day or so. 
These swells are expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions. Please consult products issued by your local 
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Gabrielle Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
500 AM AST Wed Sep 24 2025

Gabrielle continues to slowly weaken. The eye is no longer apparent 
in conventional satellite imagery, and the outflow continues to be 
restricted on the western side due to westerly vertical shear. The 
various subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates are 
in the 90-105 kt range and have decreased a little during the past 
6 h. Based on these, the initial intensity is reduced to a possibly 
generous 100 kt.

The initial motion is now 075/22 kt. For the next three days or so, 
Gabrielle should continue east-northeastward with some increase in 
forward speed, with the cyclone moving through or near the Azores 
in about 48 h.  After three days, the cyclone is expected to slow 
its forward speed and turn southeastward as it is steered by a 
broad deep-layer trough over western Europe.  Since there are only 
minor changes in the track guidance since the last advisory, the new 
forecast track is almost identical to the previous track through 72 
h, and it is nudged a little south of the previous track after that 
time.
 
Gabrielle should continue to weaken due to increasing shear and 
decreasing sea surface temperatures along the forecast track. 
However, the ECMWF and the GFS are in good agreement that the 
cyclone should have 75-80 kt winds in the southwestern quadrant as 
it approaches and moves through the Azores. These forecast winds 
are likely due to a baroclinic sting jet as Gabrielle interacts 
with an upper-level trough and undergoes extratropical transition. 
After that transition is complete in about 60 h, the global models 
forecast the cyclone to steadily weaken over the northeastern 
Atlantic. The new intensity forecast has some changes from the 
previous advisory, with the first 24 h following the intensity 
consensus and the subsequent forecast periods following a blend of 
the ECMWF and GFS wind forecasts. 


KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Gabrielle is forecast to approach the Azores late on Thursday as
a hurricane. A Hurricane Warning has been issued for all of the
islands of the Azores, and hurricane conditions are likely Thursday 
night and Friday.
 
2.  Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda,
the east coast of the United States from North Carolina northward
and Atlantic Canada during the next couple of days.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
