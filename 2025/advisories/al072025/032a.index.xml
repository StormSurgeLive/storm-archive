...GABRIELLE FORECAST TO BRING HURRICANE CONDITIONS TO THE AZORES 
LATE THURSDAY OR EARLY FRIDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 PM AST...0000 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...36.1N 43.5W
ABOUT 915 MI...1475 KM W OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...100 MPH...155 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...E OR 80 DEGREES AT 29 MPH...46 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* All of the Azores
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area. A warning is typically issued 36
hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-
force winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous. Preparations to protect life and property should be
rushed to completion.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gabrielle was
located near latitude 36.1 North, longitude 43.5 West. Gabrielle is
moving toward the east near 29 mph (46 km/h). An eastward to 
east-northeastward motion is expected during the next couple of 
days, followed by a slower eastward to east-southeastward motion 
this weekend.  On the forecast track, the center of Gabrielle will 
approach the Azores during the day on Thursday and move across the 
island chain late Thursday into early Friday.  
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some weakening is forecast during the next few days, but 
Gabrielle is forecast to be at hurricane strength when it passes 
through the Azores.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160
miles (260 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 970 mb (28.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the Azores Thursday
night into early Friday, with tropical storm conditions likely by
Thursday evening. Significant hurricane-force wind gusts are likely
across portions of the Azores even after the center passes.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds in the
Azores. The surge will be accompanied by large and destructive
waves.
 
RAINFALL: From Thursday into Friday morning, Gabrielle may bring 3
to 5 inches, or 75 to 125 mm, of rainfall across the central and
western Azores. During the same time, outer bands from Gabrielle may
also result in 1 to 2 inches, or 25 to 50 mm, of rain across the
eastern Azores.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda
over the next couple of days, and the U.S. East Coast from North
Carolina northward and Atlantic Canada over the next day or so.
Swells from Gabrielle will begin reaching the Azores on Thursday.
These swells are expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products issued by your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Gabrielle Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
500 PM AST Wed Sep 24 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Gabrielle indicates the hurricane is
contending with increasing westerly shear. Recent AMSR2 89 GHz and
37 GHz passive microwave images reveal the vortex is tilted with
height, and the western side of the inner core has been eroded. The
overall cloud pattern has taken an oblong shape this afternoon. The
satellite intensity estimates have gradually decreased today, and
the initial intensity is lowered to 85 kt for this advisory. This
lies in between the latest UW-CIMSS objective estimates and 18 UTC
final-T Dvorak numbers from TAFB and SAB.
 
The hurricane is moving quickly to the east (080/24 kt) within zonal
mid-latitude flow. This eastward to east-northeastward motion should
continue for the next day or two as Gabrielle passes near or over
the Azores late Thursday into early Friday. The track models are
tightly clustered for this portion of the forecast, although the
guidance consensus is once again faster than the previous cycle. The
NHC forecast has been adjusted accordingly. By the weekend,
Gabrielle is forecast to slow down and turn toward the east and
southeast while passing over the eastern Atlantic. There was an
overall northward shift of the guidance envelope from 72-120 h, and
this is reflected in the new NHC forecast.
 
As Gabrielle moves over cooler waters within a highly-sheared 
environment, the hurricane is expected to gradually lose tropical 
characteristics while interacting with an upper-level trough. The 
GFS and ECMWF suggest the resulting warm seclusion low structure 
could lead to the formation of a sting jet feature, with a band of 
hurricane-force winds wrapping around the back side of the system 
around the time it moves over the Azores. Since the global models 
tend to handle these situations well, the NHC forecast closely 
follows the GFS and ECMWF guidance during this part of the forecast. 
A Hurricane Warning remains in effect for the Azores, and portions 
of the islands are likely to experience significant wind and storm 
surge impacts. Gabrielle should complete its extratropical 
transition in 36-48 h, and afterwards more significant weakening is 
forecast as the post-tropical low becomes vertically stacked and 
fills over the eastern Atlantic.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Gabrielle is forecast to approach the Azores late on Thursday as
a hurricane. A Hurricane Warning is in effect for all of the islands
of the Azores, and hurricane conditions are likely Thursday night
into Friday. Significant hurricane-force wind gusts are likely
across portions of the Azores even after the center passes.
 
2.  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce significant
coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds in the Azores. The
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
3.  Swells generated by Gabrielle will continue to affect Bermuda
during the next couple of days, and the east coast of the United
States from North Carolina northward and Atlantic Canada for the
next day or so. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.

Tropical Storm Humberto Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
500 PM AST Wed Sep 24 2025
 
Satellite data indicates that Invest 93L over the central tropical 
Atlantic has now developed into Tropical Storm Humberto. Visible 
satellite imagery shows that throughout the day, the low-level 
center has become well-defined, with persistent and organized deep 
convection mainly located over the eastern side of the system. 
Subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were both 
data-T/2.5 35 kt. DPRINT and DMINT Objective intensity estimates 
from UW-CIMSS range from 31 to 35 kt. Using these data, the 
initial intensity is set to 35 kt.

The system is estimated to be moving west-northwestward at 300/13 
kt, but this is of low confidence since the center has only recently 
formed.  A west-northwestward to northwestward motion is 
anticipated through the next several days along the southwestern 
periphery of a mid-latitude ridge. Towards the end of the forecast 
period, an approaching trough moving offshore the east coast of the 
United States will erode the ridge and allow the system to turn more 
northward. However, there is quite a bit of uncertainty with the 
forward speed and cross-track spread of the system. This is 
increasingly apparent beyond day 3 as there are complex steering 
components with timing differences in the global models, including 
the approaching trough and potential binary interaction with Invest 
94L. The NHC track forecast lies near the consensus aids given some 
of these uncertainties, and there is lower than normal confidence in 
the track forecast.

The storm is within a favorable environment for strengthening with 
warm sea surface temperatures near 29C and moist mid-level RH 
values. The system will be dealing with some moderate westerly wind 
shear for the next day or so that will likely cause an asymmetric 
storm structure. EC and GFS SHIPS guidance depict the shear slightly 
weakening in the day 2 to 4 time frame, and with increasing 
divergence aloft, a slightly greater rate of strengthening is shown 
at that time. The latest NHC forecast follows these trends and lies 
near the consensus intensity aids.
