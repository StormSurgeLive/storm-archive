An area of low pressure <br />is expected to form along the wave by tonight when it moves near the <br />southeast Bahamas.  This low is expected to become a tropical <br />depression when it is in the vicinity of the central and northwest <br />Bahamas over the weekend, and then track northwestward or northward <br />over the southwestern Atlantic.  <br /><br />Regardless of development, heavy rains and gusty winds are ongoing <br />in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and the Turks and Caicos Islands, <br />and are likely to spread across the Bahamas and eastern Cuba during <br />the next day or two. Interests in all of these areas should monitor <br />the progress of the system. While there remains considerable <br />uncertainty in the long-range track and intensity of the system, <br />there is a significant risk of wind, rainfall, and storm surge <br />impacts for a portion of the southeast U.S. coast early next week. <br />Interests in this area should also monitor the progress of the <br />system. <br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br />* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br /><br />$$<br />Forecaster Cangialosi]]>

300 PM GMT Fri Sep 26 2025
 
...CENTER OF GABRIELLE CONTINUES MOVING AWAY FROM THE AZORES...
...THIS IS THE FINAL NHC ADVISORY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM GMT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...40.0N 22.8W
ABOUT 245 MI...395 KM ENE OF LAJES AIR BASE IN THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 65 DEGREES AT 31 MPH...50 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...992 MB...29.30 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Gabrielle was located near latitude 40.0 North, longitude 22.8 West.
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east-northeast near
31 mph (50 km/h). A turn toward the east with a decrease in forward 
speed is expected through Saturday, followed by a turn toward the 
southeast and south through early next week. On the forecast track, 
the center of post-tropical Gabrielle will continue moving away from 
the Azores today, then approach the coast of Portugal by early 
Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast through tonight, with 
weakening expected over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Gusty winds across the central and southeastern Azores will
continue to diminish this afternoon.
 
RAINFALL: Gabrielle is expected to produce less than an inch, or 25
mm, of additional rainfall across the Azores today. Any flooding
caused by Gabrielle across the terrain of the central Azores should
subside today.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Gabrielle will affect the Azores through
the weekend and will reach the coasts of Portugal, northwestern
Spain, and northern Morocco on Saturday. These swells are expected
to produce life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products issued by your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane 
Center on this system. Future information on marine impacts can be 
found in High Seas Forecasts issued by Meteo France under WMO header 
FQNT50 LFPW and available on the web at 
https://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/raw/fq/fqnt50.lfpw..txt. Future 
information on potential land-based impacts in Portugal can be found

Post-Tropical Cyclone Gabrielle Discussion Number  38
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
900 AM GMT Fri Sep 26 2025

Gabrielle continues to produce a patch of convection to the 
northeast of the center, which is most likely along a frontal 
boundary in this area. The center is currently moving through the 
central Azores where tropical-storm conditions and wind gusts to 
hurricane-force have been reported. In addition, sustained 
hurricane-force winds have been reported in the elevated 
mountainous areas of Terceira and Sao Miguel Islands.  The initial 
intensity is held at 55 kt based mainly on continuity from the 
previous advisory.

While the center has moved a little to the left of the previous 
track during the past few hours, the overall motion remains 
east-northeastward or 070/25 kt. Gabrielle should continue 
east-northeastward for the next day or so with a decrease in 
forward speed, and this motion should bring the center away from 
the Azores today.  After that, the cyclone is expected to turn 
eastward and southeastward as it approaches the coast of Portugal. 
This should be followed by an even slower southeastward to 
southward motion while Gabrielle decays and eventually dissipates 
near southern Portugal and northern Morocco. The new forecast track 
is shifted a bit to the north of the previous track based mainly on 
the more northerly initial position.

Gabrielle is almost finished its extratropical transition, with 
satellite imagery indicating a cold front forming to the southeast 
and south of the center in addition to the frontal boundary to the 
north. The global models suggest little change in strength for the 
next 24 h, followed by a gradual weakening. The new intensity 
forecast is based mainly on a blend of the ECMWF and GFS models, 
and it now calls for the system to dissipate between 72-96 h.
 
A Hurricane Warning remains in effect for the islands of the
Azores. The NHC will continue to issue forecasts on Gabrielle as a
post-tropical cyclone until the threat to the Azores has ended. 
This should occur sometime later today.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Gabrielle is expected to produce tropical storm conditions, with 
gusts to hurricane force, across the central and southeastern Azores 
this morning, with hurricane-force winds possible at higher 
elevations.
 
2.  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce significant 
coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds in the Azores. The surge 
will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
3.  Any flooding caused by Gabrielle across the terrain of the 
central Azores should subside today.

Hurricane Humberto Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
500 AM AST Fri Sep 26 2025
 
Humberto has become better organized during the past several hours.
Conventional satellite imagery has shown a growing central dense
overcast, with hints of an eye-like feature near the center.
Microwave imagery revealed a well-defined rain band wrapping around
a vertically-aligned vortex, suggesting the developing of an
eyewall.  Satellite classifications have risen notably on this
cycle and the initial intensity is set to 65 kt, closest to the
TAFB Dvorak and SATCON estimates.
 
The hurricane is drifting slowly in weak steering currents with an 
estimated motion of 320/3 kt.  Model guidance is in relatively good 
agreement, showing Humberto gradually increasing speed while moving 
west-northward to northwestward along the southern side of a 
subtropical ridge during the next few days.  By early next week, the 
hurricane is expected to turn northward around the westward 
periphery of the high and begin accelerating northeastward.  Only 
minor adjustments have been made to the latest official track 
forecast.

Humberto is showing signs of steady-to-rapid intensification.  The 
hurricane is over warm waters and seems to be experiencing less 
vertical wind shear than the global models are currently suggesting. 
Statistical rapid intensity indicators, such as DTOPS, are showing 
elevated probabilities of a 25 to 30 kt increase in the next 24 
hours.  Given these probabilities and the recent increase in initial 
intensity, the NHC intensity forecast has been increased, 
particularly in the near-term forecast, and lies above most of the 
guidance.  By the middle of the forecast period, it is closer the 
the corrected consensus aid, HCCA, and still shows Humberto becoming 
a major hurricane this weekend.
