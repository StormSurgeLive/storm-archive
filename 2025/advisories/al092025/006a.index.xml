HURRICANE HUMBERTO DISCUSSION NUMBER  14
NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL       AL082025
1100 PM AST SAT SEP 27 2025
 
HUMBERTO REMAINS A LARGE, POWERFUL HURRICANE THIS EVENING, WITH A
SPECTACULAR SATELLITE PRESENTATION.  THE HURRICANE HAS A CLEAR, 
19C, SYMMETRIC 25 NM WIDE EYE THAT IS SURROUNDED BY A WHITE RING 
OF VERY, COLD (-73C) CLOUD TOPS.  THE MOST INTENSE DEEP CONVECTION 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE EYEWALL APPEARS TO BE JUST EAST OF THE SURFACE 
CENTER, WHERE -78C (CMG) TOPS ARE DISCERNIBLE.  IMPRESSIVE 
VENTILATION ALOFT IS PROVIDED BY DUAL OUTFLOW CHANNELS LOCATED OVER 
THE NORTH SEMICIRCLE OF THE CYCLONE.  THE LATEST SUBJECTIVE DVORAK 
DATA-T NUMBERS FROM TAFB AND SAB, AND THE VARIOUS UW-CIMSS OBJECTIVE 
ESTIMATES SUPPORT HOLDING THE INITIAL INTENSITY AT 140 KT.
 
HUMBERTO COULD UNDERGO INNER CORE STRUCTURAL CHANGES, WHICH WILL
LIKELY CAUSE INTENSITY FLUCTUATIONS DURING THE NEXT 12-24 HOURS.  
IN FACT, AN EARLIER GPM/GMI OVERPASS REVEALED A HINT OF CONCENTRIC
OUTER RING DEVELOPMENT, AND THE UW-CIMSS MPERC IS INDICATING UP TO
A 78 PERCENT C HANCE OF ANOTHER ERC EVENT.  AFTERWARD, THE 
STATISTICAL AND SKILLED CONSENSUS INTENSITY MODELS POINT TOWARD A 
GRADUAL WEAKENING TREND BEGINNING AROUND MONDAY.  THROUGH THE 
REMAINING PERIOD, FURTHER WEAKENING AT A FASTER PACE IS EXPECTED 
WHILE THE CYCLONE BECOMES EMBEDDED IN THE STRONG UPPER-LEVEL 
WESTERLY FLOW.
 
BY THE 60 HOUR PERIOD, HUMBERTO SHOULD CONTINUE MOVING AROUND
THE SOUTHWESTERN PERIPHERY OF A MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE LOCATED TO 
THE NORTHEAST OF THE CYCLONE AND EAST OF BERMUDA.  BY TUESDAY 
NIGHT, HUMBERTO IS FORECAST TO TURN NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD WHILE THE 
RIDGE MENTIONED ABOVE WEAKENS AND SHIFTS EASTWARD.  BY MID-NEXT 
WEEK, HUMBERTO SHOULD TURN QUICKLY TOWARD THE NORTHEAST TO 
EAST-NORTHEAST IN RESPONSE TO A MAJOR SHORTWAVE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH 
AMPLIFYING AND MOVING OUT OF THE CANADIAN MARITIMES AND INTO THE
NORTHWESTERN ATLANTIC WATERS.  THERE REMAINS QUITE A BIT OF
ALONG-TRACK SPREAD BEYOND DAY 4, WHICH IS TYPICALLY SEEN WHEN
TROPICAL CYCLONES MOVE WITHIN THE MID-LATITUDE UPPER-WESTERLIES AND
COMMENCE A STRUCTURAL TRANSITION TO AN EXTRA-TROPICAL CYCLONE.
THE NHC FORECAST IS NUDGED TOWARD THE TVCA SIMPLE CONSENSUS AND THE 
HCCA CORRECTED AID, AND IS CLOSE TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Nine was 
located near latitude 22.7 North, longitude 76.9 West. The 
depression is moving toward the northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h). A 
faster motion to the north-northwest is expected to begin later 
today and continue through Monday. On the forecast track, the center 
of the system is expected to move across the central and 
northwestern Bahamas today and tonight and approach the southeast 
U.S. coast early this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts. Strengthening is expected during the next few days, and the 
system is forecast to become a tropical storm later today and a 
hurricane by late Monday or Tuesday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Nine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the central Bahamas
beginning later today and in the northwestern Bahamas late this 
afternoon. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area
along the east coast of Florida on Monday.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Nine is expected to produce additional
rainfall of 4 to 8 across eastern Cuba and the Bahamas. This
rainfall will likely produce flash and urban flooding. Mudslides are
also possible in areas of higher terrain across eastern Cuba.
 
The system is also expected to bring a threat of heavy rainfall from
the east coast of Florida northward into the eastern Carolinas.
Rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches are possible, with localized
totals of 10 inches across portions of the coastal Carolinas. This
rainfall could result in flash, urban, and river flooding. Changes
in the forecast track could result in adjustments to these rainfall
totals.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with the system, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds in the northwestern Bahamas. Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by this system and Hurricane Humberto will
affect portions of the Bahamas this weekend, and spread to portions
of the southeast U.S. coast early this week. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found

Tropical Depression Nine Discussion Number   6...Corrected
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
1100 PM EDT Sat Sep 27 2025

Corrected first sentence of third paragraph
 
The depression this evening remains fairly disorganized, with 
convection mainly oriented in a north-south fashion with only a 
hint of banding on the northern side. A NOAA-P3 aircraft that 
has been flying through the system only found a peak 700 mb flight 
level wind of 34 kt about 60 n mi away from the center. Tail Doppler 
Radar (TDR) analysis from the aircraft also shows the center is 
quite broad at the 1 km level with the mid-level center tilted to 
the south with height. Based on the plane data, the initial 
intensity remains 30 kt this advisory, which is a little under the 
various satellite-based estimates, but close to a recently 
received scatterometer pass which had a peak wind of 31 kt. 

Aircraft fixes both at 700 mb and from the TDR analysis shows the 
cyclone is meandering right now, with a best guess at a motion of 
310/2 kt. Over the next couple of days, the system should turn 
north-northwestward with a somewhat faster forward motion, moving 
within the flow between an upper trough over the southeast U.S. and 
a subtropical ridge over the Atlantic. This forecast brings the 
depression over the central and northwestern Bahamas through early 
Monday, then toward the southeast U.S. coast by Tuesday. It is 
notable to point out the system has been moving slower than 
anticipated over the last 12-24 hours, and this could have 
significant implications on its ultimate track. Even in the first 
48 hours of the track, there is quite a bit of spread in the 
north-south direction in both the deterministic and ensemble model 
guidance. Faster tracks appear to interact more with the upper-level 
trough to the west, resulting in a track closer to the Carolina 
coastline, while slower tracks largely miss a direct interaction 
with this feature, and turn sharply east faster as Hurricane 
Humberto approaches from the east, eroding the mid-level ridging 
steering TD9 northward. Because it has been moving slower than 
expected, its becoming more likely its ultimate track will fall in 
the slower and sharper east camp. In response, the overall track 
guidance this cycle shifted slower and further east, and the NHC 
track forecast was shifted in that direction. The latest track 
roughly splits the difference between the ECMWF and GFS tracks, and 
lies quite close to the HCCA consensus aid, but still not as far 
south and east as the Google DeepMind ensemble mean (GDMI). 

The depression is not showing signs of intensification yet, with a 
broad diffuse structure on aircraft observations persisting. 
However, the intensity guidance is insistent that deep central 
convection will soon form near the center, helping to tighten up the 
surface wind field. While the cyclone will have some southerly shear 
to deal with, it does not appear to be prohibitively strong, only 
15-20 kt for the next 48 hours in both the GFS and ECMWF-based SHIPS 
guidance. That, combined with warm 29-30 C sea-surface temperatures 
should promote steady intensification once a central core develops, 
and the NHC intensity forecast was nudged up a little higher showing 
a 70 kt peak in 48 hours. After this period is where the intensity 
forecast gets tricky. The large spread in north-south tracks also 
has a significant impact on the amount of shear the system will face 
in the 48-96 hour time-frame. Solutions that are further south have 
less shear to contend with and are generally stronger. For now, the 
latest intensity forecast will cap the peak intensity at 70 kt 
through the end of the forecast, close to the HCCA intensity 
guidance, but this could be conservative if the track shifts further 
south and east. The system could also interact with a baroclinic 
zone towards the end of the forecast, but because the forecast track 
remains over warm waters at day 5, extratropical transition won't be 
shown quite yet. 

Even if this further offshore track pans out, the wind field is 
expected to expand quite a bit, and given the expected storm 
structure, a risk of significant heavy rainfall, storm surge, and 
wind impacts is still possible for the southeast U.S. coast even if 
the storm center remains offshore.

KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The depression is expected to strengthen and bring tropical storm
conditions to portions of the central and northwestern Bahamas
through Sunday night. Tropical storm conditions are also possible
along portions of the east coast of central Florida beginning
Monday, where a Tropical Storm Watch is in effect.
 
2. Rainfall will continue to impact eastern Cuba and the Bahamas 
through the weekend, which will likely produce flash and urban 
flooding. Mudslides are possible in the higher terrain.
 
3. There is a significant threat of heavy rainfall early next week
from portions of the east coast of Florida northward into the
Carolinas, which could cause flash, urban, and river flooding.
 
4. The depression is expected to be at or near hurricane intensity
when it is closest to the southeast U.S. coast early next week,
where there is a risk of storm surge and wind impacts. Although it
is too soon to specify the exact location and magnitude of impacts,
residents should closely monitor the latest forecast updates and
ensure that they have their hurricane plan in place.
