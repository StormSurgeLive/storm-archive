DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Imelda was located 
near latitude 32.9 North, longitude 60.9 West. Imelda is moving 
toward the east-northeast near 30 mph (48 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue through tonight. A northeastward 
motion is then forecast on Friday and Saturday. On the forecast 
track, Imelda will continue moving farther away from Bermuda this 
morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Imelda is expected to become an extratropical low 
later today, with gradual weakening forecast for the next several 
days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 255
miles (405 km). The L.F. Wade International Airport on Bermuda 
recently reported a gust of 44 mph (71 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).

WIND: Tropical storm conditions, especially in gusts, are expected 
on Bermuda for the next few hours.
 
RAINFALL: Lingering showers across Bermuda could produce up to an
inch (25 mm) of additional rainfall through today.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Imelda are affecting the Bahamas, Bermuda,
and much of the U.S. East Coast. Swells from Imelda will spread
toward the Greater Antilles and northern Leeward Islands on Friday
and continue through the weekend. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
