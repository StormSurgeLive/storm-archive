Remnants Of Humberto Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
1100 AM AST Wed Oct 01 2025

Satellite imagery indicates that the center of Humberto has become 
ill-defined while the system has merged with a frontal zone.  This 
will be the last advisory on this system.

Humberto's remnants and Imelda are producing a large area of
hazardous marine conditions over the western and central Atlantic,
where life-threatening rip currents are expected to continue
affecting beaches throughout the region through the week.

KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Dangerous marine conditions, including high surf and
life-threatening rip currents, will continue to affect beaches of
the northern Caribbean, the Bahamas, Bermuda, and much of the east
coast of the United States during the next several days.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Imelda was located 
near latitude 31.6 North, longitude 67.9 West. Imelda is moving 
toward the east-northeast near 22 mph (35 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue through Thursday night. A 
northeastward motion is forecast on Friday and Saturday. On the 
forecast track, the core of Imelda will be near Bermuda late tonight 
and move away from the island by Thursday afternoon.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Some additional strengthening is possible before Imelda 
passes close to Bermuda late tonight. Imelda is expected to become 
an extratropical low on Thursday, with gradual weakening forecast 
thereafter.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 255 miles
(405 km). The L.F. Wade International Airport on Bermuda recently
reported a sustained wind of 43 mph (69 km/h). An elevated observing

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Imelda can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions will continue to spread across the
island this evening. Hurricane conditions are expected over Bermuda
tonight and early Thursday. Significant hurricane-force wind gusts
are likely across Bermuda even after the center passes.
 
RAINFALL: Across Bermuda, 2 to 4 inches (50 to 100 mm) of rainfall
is expected from tonight into Thursday, which could lead to flash
flooding.
 
STORM SURGE: In Bermuda, a dangerous storm surge is expected to
produce coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds. The surge will
be accompanied by large and damaging waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Imelda are affecting the Bahamas, Bermuda,
and much of the U.S. East Coast. Swells from Imelda will spread
toward the Greater Antilles and northern Leeward Islands on Friday
and continue through the weekend. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.

      <title>Hurricane Imelda Forecast Discussion Number 20</title>

Hurricane Imelda Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
1100 AM EDT Wed Oct 01 2025
 
The Air Force Hurricane Hunters investigating Imelda this morning
have found that the hurricane is strengthening. They reported a
closed, circular eyewall during their two passes through the storm,
and dropsonde data indicate the central pressure has fallen to
around 966 mb. The aircraft measured peak 700-mb flight-level winds
of 97 kt in the southeastern quadrant of Imelda, which supports
raising the initial intensity to 85 kt for this advisory.
 
Imelda is moving quickly east-northeastward (065/17 kt) within the
flow ahead of a western Atlantic deep-layer trough. In the near
term, the track models agree that the core of Imelda will move near
or over Bermuda tonight into early Thursday, with conditions there
expected to deteriorate later today. Once Imelda passes Bermuda and
becomes extratropical, the forecast becomes much more uncertain
given the significant spread in the track guidance and ensembles. In
general, most global models show the extratropical low becoming
captured by the upper trough, which results in a northeastward
motion across the north Atlantic through the 5-day period. The
outlying GFS solution shows the trough missing the low, and as a
result the GFS is almost 1500 miles away from the ECMWF at day 5.
Once again, the long-range NHC forecast is weighted more heavily
toward a consensus of the ECMWF and Google Deep Mind solutions.
 
The improved inner core structure of the hurricane and the potential 
for positive trough interaction could support some additional 
strengthening before Imelda reaches Bermuda, despite increasing 
southwesterly shear expected over the hurricane. This is reflected 
in the updated NHC intensity forecast, which lies on the high end of 
the guidance envelope. Extratropical transition is now forecast in 
24 h, after which some gradual weakening is predicted. However, 
Imelda will remain a powerful extratropical cyclone for much of the 
forecast period as its wind field expands while the cyclone moves 
deeper into the mid-latitudes. As a result, large swell and 
dangerous marine and rip current conditions will continue to affect 
much of the central and western Atlantic for the next several days.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Imelda is expected to bring damaging hurricane-force winds and
large and damaging waves to Bermuda when it passes near or over the
island tonight. Preparations to protect life and property should be
rushed to completion, as tropical storm conditions are expected to
spread across the region beginning later today.
 
2. Heavy rainfall could cause flash flooding across Bermuda later
today into Thursday.
 
3. Swells and high surf from Imelda are expected to produce
dangerous marine conditions and rip currents along much of the East
Coast of the United States during the next several days.
