DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Humberto was 
located by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near 
latitude 28.0 North, longitude 67.6 West. Humberto is moving toward 
the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).A gradual turn towards the 
north-northwest then north is expected over the next day or so. The 
hurricane is then forecast to turn and accelerate east-northeastward 
by late Tuesday or early Wednesday. On the forecast track, the 
center of Humberto will pass west, and then north of Bermuda on 
Tuesday and Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Humberto is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Fluctuations in intensity are possible today. 
Gradual weakening is forecast after that, but Humberto is expected 
to remain a dangerous major hurricane into Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185
miles (295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 940 mb (27.76 inches) 
based on Air Force Reserve reconnaissance dropsonde data.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Humberto can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Humberto will continue to affect portions
of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
and Bermuda through much of this week. Swells from Humberto will
also affect the U.S. East Coast beginning today. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?ripCurrents
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning
Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL: Hurricane Humberto is expected to bring rainfall of 1 to
2 inches – 25 to 50 mm – to Bermuda Monday night through Tuesday
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Humberto Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
1100 AM AST Mon Sep 29 2025
 
Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft found Humberto has 
strengthened this morning. The aircraft depicted that the system has 
completed an eyewall replacement cycle, with the outer eyewall as 
depicted on earlier microwave imagery now dominant, and the old 
inner eyewall has collapsed. The aircraft however did depict that 
the eyewall is open on the southwest side which is likely due to the 
impacts of increasing wind shear. Maximum flight level winds in the 
northeast quadrant were 138 kt, which supported the increased 
intensity to 125 kt at the intermediate advisory. Using the latest 
hurricane hunter and scatterometer wind data, the wind radii have 
been slightly adjusted and the intensity is held at 125 kt for this 
advisory.
 
Humberto is moving northwestward at an estimated motion of 325/ 11 
kt, along the southwestern periphery of a mid-level subtropical 
ridge. A gradual turn to the north then northeast over the next day 
or so is anticipated as the system rounds the western periphery of 
the ridge, and the NHC forecast has been shifted slightly to the 
left closer to the consensus aids in the short term. The system will 
then begin to move northeast to east-northeastward as the system is 
picked up by a trough moving into the north Atlantic. The NHC 
forecast is similar to the previous through the end of the forecast 
period, with a slight nudge towards the latest consensus aids.
 
Some fluctuations in intensity are possible over the next 12 h or 
so. Thereafter, increasing wind shear and cooling sea surface 
temperatures should induce a weakening trend. The wind shear will 
also cause Humberto become quite asymmetric with most of the 
convection displaced to the eastern side of the circulation. In 
about 60 h, global models depict that the system should merge with 
the previously mentioned trough digging across the north Atlantic 
and develop frontal features. As the system becomes extratropical 
across the north Atlantic, the wind field is anticipated to grow in 
size. The latest NHC intensity forecast lies on the higher end of 
the guidance envelope given the latest increase in intensity, and 
then shows weakening throughout the period. By 96h, the system is 
expected to dissipate and merge within the larger trough.
 
Along the forecast track, Humberto is expected to move to the west 
and north of Bermuda, although there is a possibility of 
tropical-storm-force winds occuring over the island late Tuesday and 
Wednesday within outer rainbands.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical-storm-force winds could begin to affect Bermuda by late
Tuesday, and a tropical storm watch is in effect for the island.
Interests there should continue to monitor the progress of Humberto.
 
2. Dangerous marine conditions, including high surf and
life-threatening rip currents, are affecting beaches of the northern
Caribbean, Bahamas, and Bermuda. The dangerous surf conditions are
expected to begin affecting much of the east coast of the U.S.
today.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Imelda was 
located by NOAA and Air Force Reconnaissance aircraft near latitude 
26.9 North, longitude 77.1 West. Imelda is moving toward the north 
near 9 mph (15 km/h), and a general northward motion is expected to 
continue today. On Tuesday, Imelda is expected to turn sharply to 
the east-northeast. On the forecast track, the center of the system 
is expected to start moving away from the northwestern Bahamas today 
and then turn east-northeastward, moving away from the southeastern 
U.S. by the middle part of this week, but approaching the island of 
Bermuda.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h)
with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast and Imelda
is forecast to become a hurricane on Tuesday. 

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km) 
from the center. This morning, a sustained wind of 48 mph (77 km/h) 
was reported at Little Hog Cay, in North Abacos, Bahamas. A wind 
gust of 83 mph (134 km/h) was also recently reported in Treasure 
Cay, Bahamas.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated by Air Force Reconnaissance 
dropsonde data is is 988 mb (29.18 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Imelda can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occuring in portions of
the northwestern Bahamas and should continue through today.
 
RAINFALL:  Tropical Storm Imelda is expected to produce total 
rainfall of 4 to 8 inches across the northwest Bahamas through 
Tuesday. This rainfall will likely produce flash and urban 
flooding. 

Storm total rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches with local maxima of 4 
inches are expected through Tuesday across northeast Florida, 
coastal South Carolina, and coastal sections of southeast North 
Carolina. This rainfall could result in isolated flash and urban 
flooding.

As Imelda passes near Bermuda, 2 to 4 inches – 50 to 100 mm – of 
rainfall is expected from Wednesday into Thursday.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Imelda, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds in the northwestern Bahamas.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
Minor coastal flooding is possible in areas of onshore winds over
the Southeastern U.S. coastline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the surge occurs over the next several high tide cycles...
 
Volusia/Brevard County Line, Florida to the South Santee River,
South Carolina...1 to 2 ft
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Imelda and Hurricane
Humberto are affecting the Bahamas and will spread to much of the
east coast of the U.S. early this week. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ripCurrents

      <title>Tropical Storm Imelda Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Tropical Storm Imelda Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
500 AM EDT Mon Sep 29 2025

Imelda continues to slowly become better organized.  Earlier 
aircraft data indicated that the pressure has fallen to 996 mb, and 
satellite imagery shows persistent convection near and north of the 
center.  The initial intensity is set to 40 kt with numerous 35 kt 
wind vectors on the evening scatterometer pass and higher Dvorak 
estimates.  

The storm is progressing northward at about 7 kt.  This motion is 
forecast to continue today due to steering along the western side 
of the subtropical ridge.  Humberto is forecast to erode the ridge 
by Tuesday, causing an abrupt turn of Imelda to the east-northeast 
with some acceleration as the cyclone encounters faster mid- 
latitude flow.  There is increasing confidence in the storm staying 
well offshore of the southeastern United States coast.  The 
latest track guidance is similar to the previous cycle, although 
faster at the end, and remains close to Bermuda.  The medium range 
forecast beyond Bermuda is quite uncertain with a complicated flow 
pattern due to a digging north Atlantic trough and 
then-extratropical Humberto interactions.

Imelda is forecast to gradually strengthen within an environment of 
moderate south-southwesterly vertical wind shear, warm ocean waters 
and within a fairly moist mid-level air mass for the next couple of 
days.  Thereafter, an upper-level trough will help to initiate 
extratropical transition, and some of the models are showing this 
as a favorable trough interaction, causing a larger and stronger 
cyclone.  The GFS and ECMWF models are also showing a sting jet 
developing as well about the time that Imelda is near Bermuda, so 
that situation will have to be watched closely.  The official 
forecast remains at the higher end of the model guidance.  Most of 
the global models are showing a faster extratropical transition 
after Imelda moves past Bermuda, and that is indicated in the new 
NHC forecast.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Imelda is expected to continue to bring tropical storm conditions 
to portions of the northwestern Bahamas today.
 
2. Rainfall associated with Imelda will continue to impact eastern 
Cuba and the Bahamas through Tuesday, which will likely produce 
flash and urban flooding.  Mudslides are possible in the higher 
terrain.  Heavy rainfall across the coastal Carolinas could cause 
isolated flash and urban flooding through Tuesday.

3. Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Imelda as a
Hurricane Watch could be required late today.
 
4. Swells and high surf from both Humberto and Imelda are expected
to produce dangerous marine conditions and rip currents along the
east coast of Florida and the Georgia coast today.  These conditions 
are expected to spread northward along much of the east coast of the 
United States early this week.
