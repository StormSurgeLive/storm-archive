BECOME EXTRATROPICAL LATER TODAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...32.8N 61.9W
ABOUT 170 MI...275 KM ENE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...85 MPH...140 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 75 DEGREES AT 30 MPH...48 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Meteorological Service of Bermuda has changed the Hurricane
Warning for Bermuda to a Tropical Storm Warning.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case during the
next few hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Imelda was located
near latitude 32.8 North, longitude 61.9 West. Imelda is moving
toward the east-northeast near 30 mph (48 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue through tonight. A northeastward
motion is then forecast on Friday and Saturday. On the forecast
track, the core of Imelda will move farther away from Bermuda
during the next several hours.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Imelda is expected to become an extratropical low later
today, with gradual weakening forecast for the next several days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 255 miles
(405 km). The elevated station at the National Museum of Bermuda 
recently reported sustained winds of 56 mph (91 km/h) and a wind 
gust of 70 mph (113 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 975 mb (28.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Imelda can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda for the
next few hours.
 
RAINFALL: Lingering showers across Bermuda could produce up to an
inch (25 mm) of additional rainfall through today.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge flooding on Bermuda should subside today.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Imelda are affecting the Bahamas, Bermuda,
and much of the U.S. East Coast. Swells from Imelda will spread
toward the Greater Antilles and northern Leeward Islands on Friday
and continue through the weekend. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found

NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

      <title>Hurricane Imelda Forecast Discussion Number 22</title>

Hurricane Imelda Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
1100 PM AST Wed Oct 01 2025
 
Data from the Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft this evening 
found that Imelda is likely in the early to mid stages of 
extratropical transition. In addition to the aircraft crossing a 
baroclinic zone just to the north of the hurricane's core, the winds 
have become very asymmetric, with hurricane-force winds around the 
western and southeastern sides of the circulation, but much lighter 
winds to the northeast. The aircraft also found rising pressure 
between fixes, and the earlier eyewall reported from the prior 
mission has been reduced to a small fragment on the northwestern 
side. Despite the degraded presentation, the 700 mb flight-level 
winds were a little higher than the prior mission, peaking at 98 kt 
in the southeastern quadrant. While this would normally translate to 
a somewhat higher 90 kt maximum sustained wind, these flight-level 
winds occurred where Imelda has little in the way of precipitation 
according to the Bermuda radar. Thus, the initial intensity will 
remain 85 kt for this advisory, using a slightly lower surface wind 
reduction.
 
Aircraft fixes and Bermuda radar imagery indicate that Imelda 
continues to accelerate quickly to the east-northeast, with its 
estimated motion now at 075/25 kt. This motion will likely take the 
hurricane's inner eyewall fragment right over the island of Bermuda 
over the next couple of hours. The strongest winds associated with 
Imelda are likely to be felt just after the center passes by, 
thanks to the increasingly asymmetric wind-field of the hurricane. 
In fact, the global and hurricane-regional models show a distinct 
sting-jet like signature on the backside that both 18 UTC HAFS-A/B 
and the 12 UTC ECMWF show moving directly over Bermuda between now 
and the 06 UTC time frame. After passing Bermuda, the global and 
regional-hurricane models show the hurricane completing 
extratropical transition as the frontal boundary merges in with the 
cyclone's core. The NHC intensity forecast is a little lower than 
the prior advisory, but remains in good agreement with the consensus 
aids HCCA/IVCN.
 
After Imelda clears Bermuda and becomes fully extratropical, the 
models are in better agreement about the cyclone turning 
northeastward by late Thursday or Friday when it fully phases with a 
digging shortwave trough located upstream of the system. While 
significant model spread persists, the 18 UTC GFS has come into 
better agreement with the other global model guidance showing this 
phasing solution rather than being left behind the trough. The 
latest NHC track forecast this evening is roughly a blend of the 
HFIP corrected consensus aid (HCCA) and the faster Google DeepMind 
ensemble mean (GDMI).
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Imelda's core is currently near Bermuda and is expected to bring 
damaging hurricane-force winds and large and damaging waves to 
Bermuda as it moves over the island now into early Thursday. 
Significant hurricane-force gusts are likely across Bermuda even 
after the center passes.
 
2. Heavy rainfall could cause flash flooding across Bermuda tonight
into Thursday.
 
3. Swells and high surf from Imelda are expected to produce
dangerous marine conditions and rip currents along much of the East
Coast of the United States and the western Atlantic during the next
several days.
