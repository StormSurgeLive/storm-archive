WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case during the
next few hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products 
issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Imelda was located 
near latitude 32.9 North, longitude 60.9 West. Imelda is moving 
toward the east-northeast near 30 mph (48 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue through tonight. A northeastward 
motion is then forecast on Friday and Saturday. On the forecast 
track, Imelda will continue moving farther away from Bermuda this 
morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Imelda is expected to become an extratropical low 
later today, with gradual weakening forecast for the next several 
days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 255
miles (405 km). The L.F. Wade International Airport on Bermuda 
recently reported a gust of 44 mph (71 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Imelda can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions, especially in gusts, are expected 
on Bermuda for the next few hours.
 
RAINFALL: Lingering showers across Bermuda could produce up to an
inch (25 mm) of additional rainfall through today.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Imelda are affecting the Bahamas, Bermuda,
and much of the U.S. East Coast. Swells from Imelda will spread
toward the Greater Antilles and northern Leeward Islands on Friday
and continue through the weekend. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found

NEXT ADVISORY

      <title>Hurricane Imelda Forecast Discussion Number 23</title>

Hurricane Imelda Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
500 AM AST Thu Oct 02 2025
 
The center of Imelda passed just south of Bermuda a few hours ago,
with sustained hurricane force winds reported at one of the
elevated stations there. Since then, the cyclone has continued to
produce a central convective feature, and radar data from Bermuda
shows fragments of spiral bands to the north of the center.
Overall, it appears that Imelda is continuing through extratropical
transition, but the process is not finished yet. Satellite
intensity estimates have decreased, and based on these the initial
intensity is lowered to a possibly generous 75 kt.
 
The initial motion remains quickly east-northeastward or 075/26 kt.
This general motion is likely to continue for the next 12-24 h.
After that, the cyclone should phase with a digging mid-latitude
trough that is currently north of the system, with this trough
eventually becoming a deep-layer cut-off low over Imelda's
low-level center. This evolution should cause the surface center to
move generally northeastward from 24-72 h with a decrease in
forward speed. An east-northeastward motion is expected by the end
of the forecast period as the cyclone gets more embedded in the
mid-latitude flow.  The new forecast track is similar to the
previous track through 72 h, and then is slower than and south of
the previous track at 96 and 120 h.
 
Current trends and global model guidance suggest that Imelda should
complete extratropical transition later today. Phasing with the
above-mentioned mid-latitude trough should help the system maintain
its intensity for the next 3-4 days, and the intensity forecast has
been nudged upward a bit to match a blend of the global model wind
forecasts.  After 96 h, the global models forecast the system to
weaken quickly as the surface low separates from the upper-level
center, and this is also reflected in the new intensity forecast.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Imelda's core has passed Bermuda, and conditions on the island
are improving. However, tropical storm conditions are expected to
continue for a few more hours.
 
2. The threat of heavy rainfall on Bermuda has diminished.
 
3. Swells and high surf from Imelda are expected to produce
dangerous marine conditions and rip currents along much of the East
Coast of the United States and the western Atlantic during the next
several days.
