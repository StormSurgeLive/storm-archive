BULLETIN
Hurricane Humberto Advisory Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
500 AM AST Sun Sep 28 2025
 
...EXTREMELY DANGEROUS CATEGORY 4 HUMBERTO MOVING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD
OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN SUBTROPICAL ATLANTIC...
...COULD BRING HAZARDS TO BERMUDA IN A FEW DAYS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...23.9N 63.3W
ABOUT 585 MI...945 KM S OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...155 MPH...250 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...929 MB...27.44 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Humberto, as 
watches could be required later today.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Humberto was
located near latitude 23.9 North, longitude 63.3 West. Humberto is
moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). A turn 
toward the northwest is expected this morning, followed by a turn to
the north-northwest on Monday evening. Humberto is forecast to then 
turn north-northeastward and move west of Bermuda by Tuesday 
evening.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 155 mph (250 km/h) with higher
gusts. Humberto is an extremely dangerous category 4 hurricane on 
the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Humberto should remain a 
powerful major hurricane for the next few days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 929 mb (27.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Humberto will continue to affect portions
of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
and Bermuda through much of this week. Swells from Humberto will
also affect the U.S. East Coast beginning Monday. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

HURRICANE HUMBERTO DISCUSSION NUMBER  14
NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL       AL082025
1100 PM AST SAT SEP 27 2025
 
HUMBERTO REMAINS A LARGE, POWERFUL HURRICANE THIS EVENING, WITH A
SPECTACULAR SATELLITE PRESENTATION.  THE HURRICANE HAS A CLEAR, 
19C, SYMMETRIC 25 NM WIDE EYE THAT IS SURROUNDED BY A WHITE RING 
OF VERY, COLD (-73C) CLOUD TOPS.  THE MOST INTENSE DEEP CONVECTION 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE EYEWALL APPEARS TO BE JUST EAST OF THE SURFACE 
CENTER, WHERE -78C (CMG) TOPS ARE DISCERNIBLE.  IMPRESSIVE 
VENTILATION ALOFT IS PROVIDED BY DUAL OUTFLOW CHANNELS LOCATED OVER 
THE NORTH SEMICIRCLE OF THE CYCLONE.  THE LATEST SUBJECTIVE DVORAK 
DATA-T NUMBERS FROM TAFB AND SAB, AND THE VARIOUS UW-CIMSS OBJECTIVE 
ESTIMATES SUPPORT HOLDING THE INITIAL INTENSITY AT 140 KT.
 
HUMBERTO COULD UNDERGO INNER CORE STRUCTURAL CHANGES, WHICH WILL
LIKELY CAUSE INTENSITY FLUCTUATIONS DURING THE NEXT 12-24 HOURS.  
IN FACT, AN EARLIER GPM/GMI OVERPASS REVEALED A HINT OF CONCENTRIC
OUTER RING DEVELOPMENT, AND THE UW-CIMSS MPERC IS INDICATING UP TO
A 78 PERCENT C HANCE OF ANOTHER ERC EVENT.  AFTERWARD, THE 
STATISTICAL AND SKILLED CONSENSUS INTENSITY MODELS POINT TOWARD A 
GRADUAL WEAKENING TREND BEGINNING AROUND MONDAY.  THROUGH THE 
REMAINING PERIOD, FURTHER WEAKENING AT A FASTER PACE IS EXPECTED 
WHILE THE CYCLONE BECOMES EMBEDDED IN THE STRONG UPPER-LEVEL 
WESTERLY FLOW.
 
BY THE 60 HOUR PERIOD, HUMBERTO SHOULD CONTINUE MOVING AROUND
THE SOUTHWESTERN PERIPHERY OF A MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE LOCATED TO 
THE NORTHEAST OF THE CYCLONE AND EAST OF BERMUDA.  BY TUESDAY 
NIGHT, HUMBERTO IS FORECAST TO TURN NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD WHILE THE 
RIDGE MENTIONED ABOVE WEAKENS AND SHIFTS EASTWARD.  BY MID-NEXT 
WEEK, HUMBERTO SHOULD TURN QUICKLY TOWARD THE NORTHEAST TO 
EAST-NORTHEAST IN RESPONSE TO A MAJOR SHORTWAVE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH 
AMPLIFYING AND MOVING OUT OF THE CANADIAN MARITIMES AND INTO THE
NORTHWESTERN ATLANTIC WATERS.  THERE REMAINS QUITE A BIT OF
ALONG-TRACK SPREAD BEYOND DAY 4, WHICH IS TYPICALLY SEEN WHEN
TROPICAL CYCLONES MOVE WITHIN THE MID-LATITUDE UPPER-WESTERLIES AND
COMMENCE A STRUCTURAL TRANSITION TO AN EXTRA-TROPICAL CYCLONE.
THE NHC FORECAST IS NUDGED TOWARD THE TVCA SIMPLE CONSENSUS AND THE 
HCCA CORRECTED AID, AND IS CLOSE TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Nine was
located near latitude 23.0 North, longitude 77.2 West. The
depression is moving toward the north-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h)
A faster motion to the north-northwest is expected to begin later
today and continue through Monday. On the forecast track, the center
of the system is expected to move across the central and
northwestern Bahamas today and tonight and approach the southeast
U.S. coast early this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts. Strengthening is expected during the next few days, and the
system is forecast to become a tropical storm later today and a
hurricane by late Monday or Tuesday.

Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that the estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb 
(29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Nine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the central Bahamas
beginning later today and in the northwestern Bahamas late this
afternoon. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area
along the east coast of Florida on Monday.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Nine is expected to produce 
additional rainfall of 4 to 8 inches across eastern Cuba and 6 to 12 
inches across the northwest Bahamas through Tuesday. This rainfall 
will likely produce flash and urban flooding. Mudslides are also 
possible in areas of higher terrain across eastern Cuba.

Storm total rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches with local maxima of 7 
inches are expected into Wednesday morning across portions of the 
coastal Carolinas. This rainfall could result in flash, urban, and 
river flooding. Changes in the forecast track could result in 
further adjustments to these rainfall totals.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Tropical Depression Nine, please see the National 
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds in the northwestern Bahamas. Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by this system and Hurricane Humberto will
affect portions of the Bahamas this weekend, and spread to portions
of the southeast U.S. coast early this week. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ripCurrents

Tropical Depression Nine Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
500 AM EDT Sun Sep 28 2025

The depression has been slowly becoming more organized overnight.  
The minimum central pressure has fallen to 1003 mb, and satellite 
images are indicating that a tighter circulation has formed along 
with increasing deep convection.  The initial intensity is held at 
30 kt per the latest aircraft flight-level winds, but this system 
will probably become a tropical storm soon.

The initial motion is a bit faster to the north-northwest, or 345/6 
kt.  This general motion with a turn towards the north is 
anticipated during the next couple of days while the system moves 
between an upper trough over the southeastern United States and the 
subtropical ridge.  Beyond that time, models are generally faster
and more offshore of the United States with the eventual track of 
the tropical cyclone, following the trend of the past few cycles, 
due to it missing the upper trough and eventually following 
Hurricane Humberto more out to sea.  While it is too early to feel 
extremely confident, almost all of the reliable ensembles now keep 
the system offshore of the southeastern United States, though some 
impacts are still anticipated.  The latest NHC forecast is shifted 
to the south and east, but is not nearly as far to the southeast as 
the latest consensus models due to continuity constraints.  

Now that a better-defined core has formed, gradual intensification 
is anticipated for the next couple of days while the system remains 
in a warm water but moderate shear environment.  The intensity 
forecast is similar to the previous one through the first couple 
days of the forecast.  Afterwards, the intensity forecast is 
slightly raised as the system could find itself in a lower shear 
environment while still over warm waters.  By the end of the 
forecast, interaction with a frontal boundary is likely to cause 
some weakening, along with extratropical transition.  This is a low 
confidence forecast at long range given the recent large track 
changes.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The depression is expected to strengthen and bring tropical storm
conditions to portions of the central and northwestern Bahamas
through tonight. Tropical storm conditions are also possible
along portions of the east coast of central Florida beginning
Monday, where a Tropical Storm Watch is in effect.
 
2. Rainfall associated with Tropical Depression Nine will continue 
to impact eastern Cuba and the Bahamas through Tuesday, which will 
likely produce flash and urban flooding.  Mudslides are possible in 
the higher terrain.  Heavy rainfall across the coastal Carolinas 
could cause flash, urban, and river flooding into Wednesday 
morning. 
 
3. There is still a risk of heavy rainfall, wind and high surf 
impacts for the southeast U.S. coast even if the center 
remains offshore.  Residents should closely monitor the latest 
forecast updates and ensure that they have their hurricane plan in 
place.
