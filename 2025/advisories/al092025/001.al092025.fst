Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine can be found in 
the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and 
WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical
storm warning area beginning Saturday night and are possible in the
watch area on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: The disturbance is expected to produce the following 
storm total rainfall amounts through Monday morning.

Eastern Cuba: 8 to 12 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 16 
inches possible. 

Bahamas: 4 to 8 inches of rain are expected. 

Hispaniola, Jamaica, and portions of central and southern Cuba: 2 to 
4 inches of additional rainfall are expected. 

This rainfall will likely produce flash and urban flooding. 
Mudslides are also possible in areas of higher terrain across 
eastern Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica. 

An increasing threat of heavy rainfall from this system is forecast 
over the southern Mid-Atlantic through coastal Georgia which could 
cause flash, urban, and river flooding into next week.

associated with Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine, please see the 
National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast in areas of 
onshore winds in the northwestern Bahamas. Near the coast, the 
surge will be accompanied by large waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by both this system and Hurricane Humberto 
will affect portions of the Bahamas this weekend, and spread to 
portions of the southeast U.S. coast early next week.  These swells 
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
