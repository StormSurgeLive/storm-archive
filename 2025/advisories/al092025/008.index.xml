BULLETIN
Hurricane Humberto Advisory Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
1100 AM AST Sun Sep 28 2025
 
...HUMBERTO FORECAST TO REMAIN A POWERFUL MAJOR HURRICANE FOR THE
NEXT SEVERAL DAYS...
...EXPECTED TO PRODUCE DANGEROUS SURF ACROSS THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.6N 64.3W
ABOUT 450 MI...720 KM N OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 535 MI...855 KM S OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...150 MPH...240 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...934 MB...27.58 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Humberto, as
watches could be required later today.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Humberto was
located near latitude 24.6 North, longitude 64.3 West. Humberto is
moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). A gradual 
turn toward the northwest, and then north is expected over the next 
couple of days. By the middle of the week, Humberto is forecast to 
begin accelerating toward the east-northeast.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 150 mph (240 km/h) with higher
gusts. Humberto is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Fluctuations in intensity are possible during 
the next day or so. Gradual weakening is expected after that, but 
Humberto is expected to remain a dangerous major hurricane for the 
next couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km). Humberto is expected to grow quickly during the next few 
days, resulting in a much larger wind field.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 934 mb (27.58 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Humberto will continue to affect portions
of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
and Bermuda through much of this week. Swells from Humberto will
also affect the U.S. East Coast beginning Monday. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

      <title>Hurricane Humberto Forecast Discussion Number 16</title>

Hurricane Humberto Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
1100 AM AST Sun Sep 28 2025
 
Humberto has weakened slightly, likely the result of an ongoing 
eyewall replacement cycle, but it remains a powerful hurricane. The 
initial intensity of 130 kt is based primarily on a blend of Final-T 
and CI Dvorak values from TAFB. That value is on the high end of the 
various objective estimates, but the 1210 UTC UW-CIMSS DPRINT Vmax 
value was also 130 kt. For the next day or two, Humberto's intensity 
will likely be determined largely by internal dynamics like 
additional eyewall replacement cycles, and by how large of an eye it 
develops. GPM microwave data from earlier this morning showed the 
presence of a very large outer ring of deep convection around 
Humberto's center. If that larger ring ultimately replaces 
Humberto's eyewall, it could result in the hurricane having a lower 
intensity in the short term than currently forecast, but a rapidly 
larger extent of hurricane-force winds.
 
Consequently, the main concern for Humberto going forward is not how 
strong it will be, but how large. In addition to the expected 
expansion of Humberto's hurricane-force inner core, the 
tropical-storm-force wind radii are also expected to expand quickly 
in the next few days. As a result of this, even though the core of 
Humberto is forecast to move west and then north of Bermuda, 
tropical-storm-force impacts appear increasingly likely and tropical 
storm watches could be required there later today. Humberto is also 
expected to produce swells that affect most of the western Atlantic, 
with dangerous surf conditions starting along the U.S. East Coast on 
Monday.
 
Humberto's initial motion hasn't changed, and the track forecast 
reasoning is very similar to previous forecasts. Humberto should 
move around the southwest periphery of the subtropical ridge for 
the next couple of days, moving west of Bermuda on Tuesday. The 
hurricane should then accelerate east-northeastward as it becomes 
post-tropical. Humberto's winds should expand further as its 
intensity gradually decreases through the middle of the week, but it 
is forecast to remain a very powerful hurricane-force low, even 
after it becomes post-tropical.

KEY MESSAGES:

1. There is an increasing risk of tropical-storm-force winds 
affecting Bermuda by late Tuesday. Interests there should monitor 
the progress of Humberto and watches could be issued later today.

2. Dangerous marine conditions, including high surf and 
life-threatening rip currents, are affecting beaches of the northern 
Caribbean, Bahamas, and Bermuda. The dangerous surf conditions are 
expected to begin affecting the U.S. East Coast on Monday.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Nine 
was located by Air Force reconnaissance aircraft near latitude 23.5 
North, longitude 77.3 West. The depression is moving toward the 
north near 7 mph (11 km/h). A faster motion to the north-northwest 
or north is expected later today and continuing through Monday. On 
the forecast track, the center of the system is expected to move 
across the central and northwestern Bahamas later today and tonight 
and then turn east-northeastward, moving away from the southeastern 
U.S. by the middle part of this week. 
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Strengthening is expected during the next few days, and the 
system is forecast to become a tropical storm later today and a 
hurricane by late Monday or Tuesday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Nine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the central Bahamas
beginning later today and in the northwestern Bahamas late this
afternoon. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area
along the east coast of Florida on Monday.

RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Nine is expected to produce additional 
rainfall of 2 to 6 inches across eastern Cuba and 6 to 12 inches 
across the northwest Bahamas through Tuesday. This rainfall will 
likely produce flash and urban flooding. Mudslides are also possible 
in areas of higher terrain across eastern Cuba.

Storm total rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches with local maxima of 
7 inches are expected into Wednesday morning across portions of the 
coastal Carolinas. This rainfall could result in flash, urban, and 
isolated, minor river flooding. Changes in the forecast track could 
result in further adjustments to these rainfall totals.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with this system, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero

STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds in the northwestern Bahamas. Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large waves.

Minor coastal flooding is possible in areas of onshore winds over 
the Southeastern U.S. coastline. The water could reach the 
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if 
the surge occurs over the next several high tide cycles...

Volusia/Brevard County Line, Florida to the South Santee River, 
South Carolina...1 to 2 ft

SURF: Swells generated by this system and Hurricane Humberto will
affect portions of the Bahamas this weekend, and spread to 
much of the east coast of the U.S. early this week. These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. 
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found

Tropical Depression Nine Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
500 AM EDT Sun Sep 28 2025

The depression has been slowly becoming more organized overnight.  
The minimum central pressure has fallen to 1003 mb, and satellite 
images are indicating that a tighter circulation has formed along 
with increasing deep convection.  The initial intensity is held at 
30 kt per the latest aircraft flight-level winds, but this system 
will probably become a tropical storm soon.

The initial motion is a bit faster to the north-northwest, or 345/6 
kt.  This general motion with a turn towards the north is 
anticipated during the next couple of days while the system moves 
between an upper trough over the southeastern United States and the 
subtropical ridge.  Beyond that time, models are generally faster
and more offshore of the United States with the eventual track of 
the tropical cyclone, following the trend of the past few cycles, 
due to it missing the upper trough and eventually following 
Hurricane Humberto more out to sea.  While it is too early to feel 
extremely confident, almost all of the reliable ensembles now keep 
the system offshore of the southeastern United States, though some 
impacts are still anticipated.  The latest NHC forecast is shifted 
to the south and east, but is not nearly as far to the southeast as 
the latest consensus models due to continuity constraints.  

Now that a better-defined core has formed, gradual intensification 
is anticipated for the next couple of days while the system remains 
in a warm water but moderate shear environment.  The intensity 
forecast is similar to the previous one through the first couple 
days of the forecast.  Afterwards, the intensity forecast is 
slightly raised as the system could find itself in a lower shear 
environment while still over warm waters.  By the end of the 
forecast, interaction with a frontal boundary is likely to cause 
some weakening, along with extratropical transition.  This is a low 
confidence forecast at long range given the recent large track 
changes.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The depression is expected to strengthen and bring tropical storm
conditions to portions of the central and northwestern Bahamas
through tonight. Tropical storm conditions are also possible
along portions of the east coast of central Florida beginning
Monday, where a Tropical Storm Watch is in effect.
 
2. Rainfall associated with Tropical Depression Nine will continue 
to impact eastern Cuba and the Bahamas through Tuesday, which will 
likely produce flash and urban flooding.  Mudslides are possible in 
the higher terrain.  Heavy rainfall across the coastal Carolinas 
could cause flash, urban, and river flooding into Wednesday 
morning. 
 
3. There is still a risk of heavy rainfall, wind and high surf 
impacts for the southeast U.S. coast even if the center 
remains offshore.  Residents should closely monitor the latest 
forecast updates and ensure that they have their hurricane plan in 
place.
