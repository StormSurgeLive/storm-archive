north of Bermuda today and Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 80 mph (130 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Continued weakening is forecast and Humberto is
expected to become a strong extratropical system on Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km).
 
The minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches) as indicated

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Humberto can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells from Humberto are likely to cause dangerous surf and
life-threatening rip current conditions, affecting beaches of the
northern Caribbean, Bahamas, Bermuda, and much of the east coast of
the United States over the next several days. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found

Hurricane Humberto Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
1100 AM AST Tue Sep 30 2025
 
Humberto is quickly decoupling.  Strong westerly vertical wind shear
has exposed the low-level circulation, with a curved band of deep
convection still present in the northeastern quadrant.  The Air
Force Hurricane Hunters have just completed their final mission into
Humberto, finding peak flight-level winds of 77 kt and a rising
central minimum pressure.  The initial intensity has been lowered to
a possibly generous 70 kt.
 
The hurricane is moving at an estimated 340/16 kt.  Humberto is
expect to turn northward and north-northeastward later today,
followed by a turn to the east-northeast on Wednesday with an
increase in forward motion as the hurricane merges with a large mid-
to upper-level trough over the north Atlantic.  The latest
official track forecast has shifted slightly to the west, largely
due to the current north-northwest motion.
 
Humberto should gradually weaken while it transitions into a strong
extratropical cyclone.  Global models suggest this transition will
occur sooner than previously expected, and the official forecast now 
shows Humberto as an extratropical cyclone by Wednesday.  By 
Thursday, the cyclone is forecast to elongate along a frontal 
boundary extending southwestward toward Imelda and lose its closed 
circulation.  The hurricane is producing a large area of hazardous 
marine conditions over the western and central Atlantic, where 
life-threatening rip currents are expected to affect beaches along 
the eastern seaboard through the week.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Dangerous marine conditions, including high surf and
life-threatening rip currents, will continue to affect beaches of
the northern Caribbean, Bahamas, Bermuda, and much of the east coast
of the United States through the week.

A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Imelda was located
near latitude 29.2 North, longitude 75.9 West.  Imelda is moving
toward the east-northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A generally
east-northeastward motion at a faster forward speed is expected over
the next couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of the
hurricane should continue to move away from the Bahamas today, and 
will approach Bermuda Wednesday afternoon.

Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some additional strengthening is forecast during the next 48
hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185
miles (295 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft observations is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Imelda can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected over Bermuda by Wednesday
evening, with tropical storm conditions likely by Wednesday
afternoon.
 
RAINFALL:  Across Bermuda, 2 to 4 inches (50 to 100 mm) of rainfall
are expected from Wednesday into Thursday, which could lead to
flash flooding.
 
STORM SURGE:  In Bermuda, a dangerous storm surge is expected to
produce coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds.  The surge will
be accompanied by large and damaging waves.
  
SURF: Swells generated by Hurricane Imelda and Hurricane Humberto
are affecting the Bahamas and are currently spreading to much of the
U.S. east coast. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.

      <title>Hurricane Imelda Forecast Discussion Number 16</title>

Hurricane Imelda Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
1100 AM EDT Tue Sep 30 2025
 
Imelda is gradually becoming better organized, with deep convection 
increasing near the center and banding features becoming more 
evident.  An Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft measured 
flight-level winds that supported hurricane strength, although the 
central pressure has not yet fallen very much.  The current 
intensity is set, perhaps conservatively, at 70 kt.
 
Imelda is moving northeastward, or around 040/6 kt.  A mid-level 
trough near the U.S. east coast should cause the hurricane to 
accelerate east-northeastward during the next couple of days.  This 
track will bring the center of the hurricane near Bermuda in 36 
hours or so.  The official forecast is a bit south of the latest 
simple and corrected dynamical model consensus predictions, perhaps 
reflecting some binary interaction with the circulation of Humberto 
as the pair of tropical cyclones get closer together.

The hurricane is embedded in an environment of moderate 
south-southwesterly vertical wind shear, but will be moving over 
warm waters and within a moist low- to mid-level air mass.  
Moreover, upper-level divergence associated a trough to the 
northwest of Imelda is likely to produce some positive forcing for 
intensification during the next day or so.  So the system is likely 
to be rather potent while it passes near Bermuda.  Later in the 
forecast period, the global models show the system merging with a 
broad baroclinic zone over the north Atlantic.  The official 
intensity forecast is similar to the latest correct consensus model 
solution.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Imelda is expected bring damaging hurricane-force-winds to 
Bermuda when it passed near or over that island by Wednesday 
afternoon or evening.  A Hurricane Warning is now in effect for 
Bermuda.

2. Imelda is likely to cause large and damaging waves in Bermuda.

3. Heavy rainfall could cause flash flooding across Bermuda 
Wednesday into Thursday. 

4. Swells and high surf from both Humberto and Imelda are expected
to produce dangerous marine conditions and rip currents along much
of the East Coast of the United States during the next several days.
