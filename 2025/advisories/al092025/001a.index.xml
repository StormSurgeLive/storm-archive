WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Humberto was 
located near latitude 22.3 North, longitude 58.1 West. Humberto is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h). A 
west-northwestward to northwestward motion at a slightly faster 
forward speed is forecast through the weekend, followed by a turn 
toward the north-northwest on Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 115 mph (185 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Humberto is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Additional strengthening is 
forecast over the next couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles 
(165 km). NOAA buoy 41044 located to the southwest of Humberto 
recently reported a sustained wind of 36 mph (57 km/h) and a gust of 
49 mph (80 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 962 mb (28.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Humberto will begin affecting portions of
the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and
Bermuda this weekend. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Humberto Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
500 PM AST Fri Sep 26 2025

Satellite data indicate Humberto has strengthened into the third 
major hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. The eye of 
the hurricane has cleared out this afternoon and is surrounded by a 
ring of deep, cold convective cloud tops. Based on these 
developments, the latest subjective Dvorak classifications and 
objective intensity estimates have risen to 90-102 kt. The initial 
intensity of Humberto is set at 100 kt for this advisory. NOAA buoy 
41044, located about 50 n mi southwest of the center, has reported 
falling pressures and tropical-storm-force gusts this afternoon.

Humberto remains in a low shear environment over very warm 
sea-surface temperatures, and its well-defined inner core structure 
appears conducive to further intensification unless an eyewall 
replacement cycle occurs. The latest intensity guidance favors 
continued strengthening, and this is reflected in the updated NHC 
forecast. There are differences noted in the upper-air pattern of 
the global models later in the period, likely related to the 
evolution and future path of Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine. But in 
general, increasing deep-layer shear over the hurricane should 
induce at least gradual weakening by early next week. Although the 
peak winds are forecast to decrease, the wind field is expected to 
expand as Humberto gains latitude and curves around Bermuda at days 
3-5. 
 
The hurricane is moving slowly northwestward (295/4 kt). A slow 
westward to west-northwestward motion should continue through the 
next day or so, followed by a turn toward the northwest later this 
weekend with a gradual increase in forward speed as a subtropical 
ridge slides eastward over the central Atlantic. A slight southward 
adjustment was made to the near-term NHC track forecast based on 
today's trends, but otherwise this portion of the forecast is 
similar to the previous one. Later in the period, the models are 
fairly consistent on a sharp recurvature of the hurricane between 
the ridge and an upper trough digging over the northwestern 
Atlantic, though there are larger along-track speed differences 
noted. This part of the forecast generally lies between the 
multi-model consensus aids and the Google DeepMind solution.

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine can be found in
the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and
WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the central Bahamas 
beginning Saturday night and are possible in portions of the
northwestern Bahamas on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: The disturbance is expected to produce the following
storm total rainfall amounts through Monday morning.
 
Eastern Cuba: 8 to 12 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 16
inches possible.
 
Bahamas: 4 to 8 inches of rain are expected.
 
Hispaniola, Jamaica, and portions of central and southern Cuba: 2 to
4 inches of additional rainfall are expected.
 
This rainfall will likely produce flash and urban flooding.
Mudslides are also possible in areas of higher terrain across
eastern Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica.
 
An increasing threat of heavy rainfall from this system is forecast
over the southern Mid-Atlantic through coastal Georgia which could
cause flash, urban, and river flooding into next week.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine, please see the
National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds in the northwestern Bahamas. Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by both this system and Hurricane Humberto
will affect portions of the Bahamas this weekend, and spread to
portions of the southeast U.S. coast early next week.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
500 PM EDT Fri Sep 26 2025

Visible satellite images and surface observations suggest that 
Invest 94L is gradually organizing and beginning to develop a 
low-level circulation near eastern Cuba with estimated maximum winds 
of about 30 kt.  Although the system does not meet the criteria of a 
tropical cyclone currently, it is expected to become one during the 
next day or so.  In addition, the system is likely to bring tropical 
storm conditions to portions of the central and northwestern Bahamas 
this weekend and potential impacts to portions of the southeast U.S. 
early next week.  Therefore, NHC is now initiating Potential 
Tropical Cyclone advisories for this disturbance. 

The system has been moving west-northwestward at about 8 kt during 
the past 12 to 24 hours.  However, this motion is expected to change 
as the disturbance is forecast to turn northward in southerly flow 
between a large-scale trough over the eastern U.S. and a subtropical 
ridge over the central-western Atlantic.  This track should take the 
system across the central and northwestern Bahamas over the weekend. 
The models are in good agreement through that time period, but they 
diverge significantly early next week when the synoptic pattern 
becomes complicated.  If the system moves on the fast side of the 
guidance, it will likely be more influenced by the U.S. trough that 
is expected to cut off.  In that scenario, the disturbance would 
move inland over the southeast U.S. early next week.  Conversely, if 
the system moves on the slow side of the guidance, Humberto's 
circulation will cause the steering currents to collapse, resulting 
in this system stalling near the southeast coast or drifting 
eastward.  The NHC track forecast lies roughly between these 
scenarios, in best agreement with EMXI, but confidence is very 
low in the days 4 and 5 positions.

Strengthening is likely to be slow in the short term due to the 
current land interaction and some southerly shear.  However, gradual 
intensification seems like a good bet this weekend and on Monday 
while the system tracks over the Gulf Stream and within a diffluent 
upper-level wind pattern.  The NHC intensity forecast lies close to 
the hurricane regional and consensus models and shows the system 
reaching hurricane strength early next week.  It should be 
emphasized that the long-range intensity forecast depends largely on 
where the system is and the degree of land interaction at those 
periods, and therefore, is of low confidence. Given the 
higher-than-usual uncertainty in the forecast track and intensity of 
the system, NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft have been collecting data 
over the western Atlantic since yesterday, and additional upper-air 
launches are occurring.  This data collection will continue through 
the weekend to help improve the model guidance for this system.

KEY MESSAGES:

1. The disturbance is forecast to become a tropical storm this 
weekend and bring tropical storm conditions to portions of the 
central and northwestern Bahamas, where Tropical Storm Warnings and 
Watches, respectively, have been issued. Rainfall associated with 
this system will impact eastern Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the 
Bahamas through the weekend.  

2.  There is an increasing threat of heavy rainfall early next 
week from coastal Georgia through the Carolinas and into the 
southern Mid-Atlantic states, which could cause flash, urban, and 
river flooding. 

3. The system is expected to be at or near hurricane intensity 
when it approaches the southeast U.S. coast early next week, where 
there is a risk of storm surge and wind impacts. Residents in that 
area should monitor updates to the forecast and ensure they have 
their hurricane plan in place.
