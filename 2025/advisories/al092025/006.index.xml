Hurricane Humberto Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
1100 PM AST Sat Sep 27 2025
 
Humberto remains a large, powerful hurricane this evening, with a
spectacular satellite presentation.  The hurricane has a clear, 
19C, symmetric 25 nm wide eye that is surrounded by a white ring 
of very, cold (-73C) cloud tops.  The most intense deep convection 
associated with the eyewall appears to be just east of the surface 
center, where -78C (CMG) tops are discernible.  Impressive 
ventilation aloft is provided by dual outflow channels located over 
the north semicircle of the cyclone.  The latest subjective Dvorak 
data-T numbers from TAFB and SAB, and the various UW-CIMSS objective 
estimates support holding the initial intensity at 140 kt.
 
Humberto could undergo inner core structural changes, which will
likely cause intensity fluctuations during the next 12-24 hours.  
In fact, an earlier GPM/GMI overpass revealed a hint of concentric
outer ring development, and the UW-CIMSS MPERC is indicating up to
a 78 hance of another ERC event.  Afterward, the statistical and
skilled consensus intensity models point toward a gradual weakening
trend beginning around Monday.  Through the remaining period, 
further weakening at a faster pace is expected while the cyclone
becomes embedded in the strong upper-level westerly flow.
 
By the 60 hour period, Humberto should continue moving around
the southwestern periphery of a mid-tropospheric ridge located to 
the northeast of the cyclone and east of Bermuda.  By Tuesday 
night, Humberto is forecast to turn north-northeastward while the 
ridge mentioned above weakens and shifts eastward.  By mid-next 
week, Humberto should turn quickly toward the northeast to 
east-northeast in response to a major shortwave upper-level trough 
amplifying and moving out of the Canadian Maritimes and into the
northwestern Atlantic waters.  There remains quite a bit of
along-track spread beyond day 4, which is typically seen when
tropical cyclones move within the mid-latitude upper-westerlies and
commence a structural transition to an extra-tropical cyclone.
The NHC forecast is nudged toward the TVCA simple consensus and the 
HCCA corrected aid, and is close to the previous advisory.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Nine 
was located by NOAA reconnaissance aircraft near latitude 22.4 
North, longitude 76.7 West. The depression has been meandering with 
a very slow motion toward the northwest near 2 mph (4 km/h). A 
faster motion to the north-northwestward motion is expected to begin 
on Sunday and continue through Monday. On the forecast track, the 
center of the system is expected to move across the central and 
northwestern Bahamas on Sunday and Sunday night and approach the 
southeast U.S. coast early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Strengthening is expected during the next few days, and the 
system is forecast to become a tropical storm overnight or early 
Sunday and a hurricane by late Monday or Tuesday.

The estimated minimum central pressure measured by aircraft
dropsonde data is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Nine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the central Bahamas
beginning tonight or early Sunday and in the northwestern Bahamas on
Sunday. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area
along the east coast of Florida on Monday.

RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Nine is expected to produce additional 
rainfall of 4 to 8 across eastern Cuba and the Bahamas. This 
rainfall will likely produce flash and urban flooding. Mudslides are 
also possible in areas of higher terrain across eastern Cuba.

The system is also expected to bring a threat of heavy rainfall from 
the east coast of Florida northward into the eastern Carolinas. 
Rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches are possible, with localized 
totals of 10 inches across portions of the coastal Carolinas. This 
rainfall could result in flash, urban, and river flooding. Changes 
in the forecast track could result in adjustments to these rainfall 
totals.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with the system, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds in the northwestern Bahamas. Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by this system and Hurricane Humberto will
affect portions of the Bahamas this weekend, and spread to portions
of the southeast U.S. coast early next week. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ripCurrents
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 AM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 500 AM EDT.

Tropical Depression Nine Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
500 PM EDT Sat Sep 27 2025
 
The organization of the depression has not changed much since this 
morning. Some deep convection has flared up this afternoon near the 
estimated center, which appears broad in the 850-mb flight-level 
wind data from the Air Force Hurricane Hunters. The earlier 
scatterometer winds and more recent aircraft data do not suggest the 
system has intensified. The initial intensity is held at 30 kt for 
this advisory.

The center appears to be slightly south and west of previous 
estimates, with an uncertain initial motion of 315/4 kt. Over the 
next couple of days, the system should turn more north-northwestward 
within the flow between an upper trough over the southeast U.S. and 
a subtropical ridge over the Atlantic. This forecast brings the 
depression over the central and northwestern Bahamas through early 
Monday, then toward the southeast U.S. coast by Tuesday. The NHC 
track forecast is very similar to the previous one, with only a 
slight nudge westward based on the initial position adjustments 
during the day. Warm waters and strong upper-level divergence should 
promote strengthening during the next few days, but this could be 
tempered by moderate southerly shear over the system from an 
upper-level trough. The NHC intensity forecast shows steady 
strengthening through early next week, with the system becoming a 
hurricane by 60 h. This prediction lies close to the latest IVCN and 
HCCA aids. 

There is still above-average uncertainty in the details of the 
long-range forecast. In general, the models agree that the presence 
of Hurricane Humberto to the east will result in a weakening of the 
prevailing steering currents, causing the system to slow down and 
meander near the southeast U.S. coast on Tuesday. While the chances 
of a landfall appear lower than yesterday, there are still some 
hurricane regional models and ensemble solutions that show this 
possibility. Given the expected asymmetric storm structure, a risk 
of significant heavy rainfall, storm surge, and wind impacts exists 
for the southeast U.S. coast even if the storm center remains 
offshore. The increased track spread at 96-120 h is related to 
whether the system feels the effects of an amplifying upper-level 
trough behind Humberto over the western Atlantic. While many global 
models show a sharp eastward turn and acceleration away from land, 
the system fails to be captured by the trough in the 12z ECMWF and 
lingers offshore. The NHC track forecast at days 4-5 maintains a 
consensus approach and shows a slower eastward motion, but future 
track adjustments are likely as confidence increases. The system may 
be in close proximity to fronts by the end of the period, so 
extratropical transition could begin around or shortly after day 5.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The depression is expected to strengthen and bring tropical storm
conditions to portions of the central and northwestern Bahamas
through Sunday night. Tropical storm conditions are also possible
along portions of the east coast of central Florida beginning
Monday, where a Tropical Storm Watch is in effect.
 
2. Rainfall will continue to impact eastern Cuba, Hispaniola, 
Jamaica, and the Bahamas through the weekend, which will likely 
produce flash and urban flooding. Mudslides are possible in the 
higher terrain. 
 
3. There is a significant threat of heavy rainfall early next week 
from portions of the east coast of Florida northward into the 
Carolinas, which could cause flash, urban, and river flooding. 
 
4. The depression is expected to be at or near hurricane intensity 
when it is closest to the southeast U.S. coast early next week, 
where there is a risk of storm surge and wind impacts. Although it 
is too soon to specify the exact location and magnitude of impacts, 
residents should closely monitor the latest forecast updates and 
ensure that they have their hurricane plan in place.
