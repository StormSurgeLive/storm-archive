DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Humberto was
located near latitude 22.3 North, longitude 59.3 West. Humberto is
moving toward the west near 6 mph (9 km/h). By early Monday, a
turn toward the northwest at a slightly faster forward speed is
forecast followed by a turn toward the north-northwest by Monday
night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Humberto is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional strengthening is forecast through 
the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles
(165 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 938 mb (27.70 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Hurricane Humberto Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
500 AM AST Sat Sep 27 2025
 
Humberto seems to have paused its meteoric rise for the moment.  
The eye has become smaller and more distorted based on GOES 
satellite imagery.  An AMSR2 microwave pass showed some evidence 
that the concentric rings mentioned in the previous discussion have 
contracted, indicating an ongoing eyewall replacement cycle.  The 
microwave images also displayed classic hurricane structure, with 
curved banding in all quadrants and no signs of dry air intrusions.  
The satellite intensity estimates have leveled off overnight, and 
the initial intensity is held at 125 kt, closest to the UW-CIMSS ADT 
of T6.3.  
 
While internal dynamics may have interrupted Humberto's 
strengthening, the hurricane still has about a day of conducive 
environmental and oceanic conditions to intensify.  Some of the 
regional hurricane models show slight strengthening, though most of 
the model guidance suggests Humberto will hold generally steady for 
the next couple of days.  By next week, the vertical wind shear is 
expected to increase and induce a gradual weakening trend.  As 
Humberto gains latitude, a significant expansion in the surface wind 
field will likely occur while it passes west of Bermuda.  
Phase-space analyses of global model forecasts by day 5 show 
Humberto as an extratropical cyclone, or close to one.  The latest 
NHC intensity forecast is very similar to the previous prediction 
and lies on the high end of the guidance in the short-term.

The hurricane is moving westward at 5 kt.  A subtropical ridge 
centered over the western Atlantic should slowly steer Humberto to 
the west or west-northwest during the next day or so, then turn the 
cyclone to the northwest and north-northwest by early next week.  By 
day 4, an amplifying upper-level trough moving out of the Canadian 
Maritimes is expected to rapidly steer Humberto northeastward.  The 
NHC track forecast shifted slightly eastward this cycle and is a 
little quicker at days 4 and 5.  It lies between the Google DeepMind 
ensemble mean and the previous prediction.

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine can be found in
the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and
WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the central Bahamas
beginning tonight or early Sunday and in the northwestern Bahamas 
on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: The disturbance is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 
8 to 12 inches with isolated maximum totals of 16 inches possible 
in eastern Cuba, and 4 to 8 inches of rain in the Bahamas. This 
rainfall will likely produce flash and urban flooding. Mudslides 
are also possible in areas of higher terrain across eastern Cuba, 
Hispaniola, and Jamaica.
 
Moisture from the disturbance will lead to a threat of heavy 
rainfall well to the north across portions of the Southeast U.S. and 
Virginia into early next week which could cause flash, urban, and 
river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with the system, please see the National Weather Service 
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds in the northwestern Bahamas. Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by both this system and Hurricane Humberto 
will affect portions of the Bahamas this weekend, and spread to 
portions of the southeast U.S. coast early next week. These swells 
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ripCurrents

Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
500 AM EDT Sat Sep 27 2025

Satellite imagery this morning shows an increase in vorticity at 
the western edge of a convective cluster located near the Ragged 
Islands in the Bahamas. However, this has not reached the stage 
where it could be called a well-defined center of circulation.  
Based on this, the system is continued as a potential tropical 
cyclone with maximum winds near 30 kt.

The initial motion is a somewhat uncertain 315/6 kt.  Later today, 
the system should turn north-northwestward between the subtropical 
ridge over the Atlantic and a deep-layer trough over the 
southeastern United States.  The track models are in good 
agreement during this part of the system's life, and this portion 
of the new forecast track is almost the same as the previous track. 
After 72 h, the guidance continues to be quite divergent. Most of 
the deterministic and consensus models now show a turn toward the 
east caused by Hurricane Humberto passing to the east of the system 
and breaking down the ridge. However, the HMON and HAFS-A models 
still show landfall in the southeastern United States, as do several 
ECMWF and GFS ensemble members. Given the current guidance and the 
trends, the new forecast track calls for a slow turn to the 
northeast and east after 72 h, but at a much slower forward speed 
than most of the guidance. It should be noted that while this 
forecast keeps the system offshore, it would still be large enough 
and close enough to cause wind and coastal flooding impacts along
the southeastern U.S. coast, as well as heavy rainfall/flooding
concerns in inland areas.

Based on current trends in the satellite imagery and the global 
models, the disturbance will likely take another 12-18 h to become 
a tropical cyclone. After that happens, strengthening is expected 
through 72 h as the system moves through an upper-level wind 
environment of moderate shear and strong divergence. The intensity 
forecast continues to show the system reaching hurricane strength 
in 3-4 days, which is in agreement with the intensity consensus. 
Some weakening is expected by 120 h due to shear and possible 
interaction with a frontal system approaching from the northwest.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The disturbance is forecast to become a tropical storm this
weekend and bring tropical storm conditions to portions of the
central and northwestern Bahamas, where Tropical Storm Warnings are 
in effect.

2. Rainfall associated with this system is expected to impact 
eastern Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Bahamas through the 
weekend, which will likely produce flash and urban flooding.  
Mudslides are possible in the higher terrain. 
 
3.  There is an increasing threat of heavy rainfall early next
week from coastal Georgia through the Carolinas and into the
southern Mid-Atlantic states, which could cause flash, urban, and
river flooding.
 
4. The system is expected to be at or near hurricane intensity
when it approaches the southeast U.S. coast early next week, where
there is a risk of storm surge and wind impacts. Residents in that
area should monitor updates to the forecast and ensure they have
their hurricane plan in place.
