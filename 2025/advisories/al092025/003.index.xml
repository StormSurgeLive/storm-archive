Hurricane Humberto Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
1100 PM AST Fri Sep 26 2025
 
Humberto has continued to intensify rapidly this evening.  The eye
temperature has increased to 15C and the eyewall white ring (-73C) 
is nearly closed.  A 2137 UTC WSFM-1 HiRes microwave pass indicated 
that a concentric ring was developing about 65 nm from the eye. The 
initial intensity is raised to 125 kt and is close to the UW-CIMSS 
ADT of T6.4 and above the constrained subjective Dvorak intensity 
estimates from TAFB and SAB.
 
All intensity contributions, low shear, warm waters, and ample
mid-level moisture, appear conducive for Humberto to intensify 
rapidly during the next 12-24 hours.  DTOPS guidance indicates 
a high probability of RI during the next 12-24 hours, and the latest
official intensity forecast follows suit, bringing Humberto to a
peak intensity of 140 kt Saturday night.  By the 36 hour period,
however, inner-core fluctuations as a result of eyewall replacement 
cycles (ERC) are possible, and it's difficult to forecast the exact 
timing.  It's worth mentioning, however, that the UW-CIMSS M-PERC 
(Microwave-based Probability of Eyewall Replacement Cycle) 
statistical model is predicting a 61 percent of onset.  By mid-next 
week, increasing vertical shear spreading over Humberto should 
induce a gradual weakening trend.  At the same time, while it passes 
west of Bermuda, a significant expansion in the surface wind field 
will likely occur.  The NHC intensity forecast is just above the 
previous forecast through the 36 hour period, and closely follows a 
blend of the HCCA consensus and the HAFS/HWRF/HMON hurricane models.
 
Humberto has taken a trochoidal jog to the left of the track this
evening, likely due to the rapid intensification event. The initial 
motion is estimated to be slightly south of due west, or 265/6 kt.  
Humberto is expected to move slowly toward the west or 
west-northwest during the next day or so in the easterly steering 
flow provided by mid-tropospheric high pressure located to the north 
of the cyclone and just east of Bermuda.  Around the 48 hour period, 
or Sunday evening, a northwestward turn with some reduction in 
forward speed is forecast while the above-mentioned high pressure 
weakens and shifts eastward.  By day 4, Humberto should commence a 
rather abrupt turn northward and northeastward in response to a 
major shortwave upper-level trough amplifying and moving out of 
northeastern Canada and into the northwestern Atlantic.  The 
official track forecast is located just to the left of the previous 
advisory, primarily due to the initial motion left of track, and 
lies between the HCCA corrected consensus and the Google DeepMind 
ensemble model.
 
NOAA buoy 41044, located about 38 n mi southwest of the center, has 
reported falling pressure,sustained tropical-storm-force winds, 
gusts just below hurricane-force and 17 ft seas.

southeast U.S. coast early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
The system is expected to become a tropical depression by
tonight. Gradual strengthening is forecast thereafter, with the
system becoming a tropical storm by early Sunday, and a hurricane
by late Monday.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine can be found in
the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and
WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the central Bahamas
beginning tonight or early Sunday and are possible in portions of
the northwestern Bahamas on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: The disturbance is expected to produce 8 to 12 inches,
with isolated maximum totals of 16 inches possible to eastern Cuba
and 4 to 8 inches of rain to the Bahamas.  This rainfall will likely
produce flash and urban flooding. Mudslides are also possible in
areas of higher terrain across eastern Cuba, Hispaniola, and
Jamaica.
 
Moisture from the disturbance is leading to a threat of heavy
rainfall from this system well to the north across portions of the
Southeast and Virginia into early next week which could cause flash,
urban, and river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine, please see the
National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds in the northwestern Bahamas. Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by both this system and Hurricane Humberto
will affect portions of the Bahamas this weekend, and spread to 
portions of the southeast U.S. coast early next week.  These swells 
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ripCurrents

Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
500 AM EDT Sat Sep 27 2025

Satellite imagery this morning shows an increase in vorticity at 
the western edge of a convective cluster located near the Ragged 
Islands in the Bahamas. However, this has not reached the stage 
where it could be called a well-defined center of circulation.  
Based on this, the system is continued as a potential tropical 
cyclone with maximum winds near 30 kt.

The initial motion is a somewhat uncertain 315/6 kt.  Later today, 
the system should turn north-northwestward between the subtropical 
ridge over the Atlantic and a deep-layer trough over the 
southeastern United States.  The track models are in good 
agreement during this part of the system's life, and this portion 
of the new forecast track is almost the same as the previous track. 
After 72 h, the guidance continues to be quite divergent. Most of 
the deterministic and consensus models now show a turn toward the 
east caused by Hurricane Humberto passing to the east of the system 
and breaking down the ridge. However, the HMON and HAFS-A models 
still show landfall in the southeastern United States, as do several 
ECMWF and GFS ensemble members. Given the current guidance and the 
trends, the new forecast track calls for a slow turn to the 
northeast and east after 72 h, but at a much slower forward speed 
than most of the guidance. It should be noted that while this 
forecast keeps the system offshore, it would still be large enough 
and close enough to cause wind and coastal flooding impacts along
the southeastern U.S. coast, as well as heavy rainfall/flooding
concerns in inland areas.

Based on current trends in the satellite imagery and the global 
models, the disturbance will likely take another 12-18 h to become 
a tropical cyclone. After that happens, strengthening is expected 
through 72 h as the system moves through an upper-level wind 
environment of moderate shear and strong divergence. The intensity 
forecast continues to show the system reaching hurricane strength 
in 3-4 days, which is in agreement with the intensity consensus. 
Some weakening is expected by 120 h due to shear and possible 
interaction with a frontal system approaching from the northwest.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The disturbance is forecast to become a tropical storm this
weekend and bring tropical storm conditions to portions of the
central and northwestern Bahamas, where Tropical Storm Warnings are 
in effect.

2. Rainfall associated with this system is expected to impact 
eastern Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Bahamas through the 
weekend, which will likely produce flash and urban flooding.  
Mudslides are possible in the higher terrain. 
 
3.  There is an increasing threat of heavy rainfall early next
week from coastal Georgia through the Carolinas and into the
southern Mid-Atlantic states, which could cause flash, urban, and
river flooding.
 
4. The system is expected to be at or near hurricane intensity
when it approaches the southeast U.S. coast early next week, where
there is a risk of storm surge and wind impacts. Residents in that
area should monitor updates to the forecast and ensure they have
their hurricane plan in place.
