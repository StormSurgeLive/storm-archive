track, the center of Humberto will pass west of, and then north of 
Bermuda today and Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 100 mph (155 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Continued weakening is forecast, with Humberto
expected to become a strong extratropical system on Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 972 mb (28.71 inches).

Hurricane Humberto Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
500 AM AST Tue Sep 30 2025

Humberto is a highly sheared hurricane.  Strong westerly vertical 
wind shear has caused the cyclone to continue its weakening trend. 
This is well-demonstrated by a recent AMSR2 microwave image, which 
shows that the convection has been sheared off from the western half 
of Humberto's circulation.  Although the low-level center is still 
underneath the convective area in GOES-19 imagery, it's close to the 
western edge of the convection.  The cyclone has taken on an 
elongated comma shape, with deep convection extending well off to 
the southeast.  Subjective intensity estimates range from 77-90 kt, 
and objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS range from 70-85 kt. 
The advisory intensity is adjusted downward to 85 kt based primarily 
on this data, and also taking into account ASCAT and Air Force 
Hurricane Hunter data from 8-9 hours ago.

Humberto is moving toward the north-northwest, or 340 degrees at 15 
kt, in between a subtropical ridge to its east and Tropical Storm 
Imelda to its west.  Humberto has tracked farther west than the 
previous NHC track forecast.  A northward turn is expected over the 
next few hours as the ridge shifts east and weakens.  On Wednesday, 
a very large mid- to upper-level trough is expected to amplify over 
the north Atlantic, causing Humberto to turn sharply to the 
east-northeast and accelerate.  The NHC track forecast has been 
adjusted well to the left of the previous forecast at the 12 and 24 
hour points, and is a bit slower than the previous forecast at 36-48 
hours.  The new NHC forecast is very near the various consensus 
aids.  This track takes the core of Humberto well west and then 
north of Bermuda.
 
Steady weakening is expected over the next 12 h as northwesterly 
vertical wind shear and intrusions of dry air persist, followed by 
more gradual weakening over the next day or two.  By late Wednesday, 
Humberto is expected to merge with a mid-to upper-level trough, and 
that should cause the system to quickly develop frontal features and 
complete extratropical transition.  The global models agree that 
Humberto will then become extremely elongated along the front and 
will likely no longer have a closed circulation by Thursday 
afternoon, so the new NHC forecast has moved forward the time of 
dissipation.  It is important to convey that Humberto is forecast to 
be a large and powerful cyclone until it dissipates on Thursday.  
The large extratropical low in combination with Imelda will cause 
rough marine conditions over a large portion of the western and 
central Atlantic. See Key Messages below for more information.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Humberto's outer rainbands could produce gusty winds and heavy 
rainfall over Bermuda today and Wednesday. Please follow local 
updates from the Bermuda Weather Service for impacts from both 
Humberto and Imelda.
 
2. Dangerous marine conditions, including high surf and 
life-threatening rip currents, will continue to affect beaches of 
the northern Caribbean, Bahamas, Bermuda, and much of the east coast 
of the United States through the week.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Imelda was
located near latitude 28.8 North, longitude 76.8 West. Imelda is
moving toward the northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h).  This general 
motion is expected today, followed by a turn towards the east- 
northeast at a faster forward speed by tonight. On the forecast 
track, the center of the system should move away from the Bahamas 
today and quickly be approaching Bermuda late on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Imelda should become a hurricane later today, with further 
strengthening anticipated on Wednesday.  
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 981 mb (28.97 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Imelda can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area by
Wednesday night, with tropical storm conditions possible by
Wednesday afternoon.
 
RAINFALL:  Storm total rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches with local
maxima of 4 inches are expected through tonight across coastal
sections of southeast North Carolina. This rainfall could result in
isolated flash and urban flooding.
 
As Imelda passes near Bermuda, 2 to 4 inches – 50 to 100 mm – of
rainfall is expected from Wednesday into Thursday.
 
STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding is possible in areas of onshore
winds over the Southeastern U.S. coastline. The water could reach
the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas
if the surge occurs over the next several high tide cycles...
 
Volusia/Brevard County Line, Florida to the South Santee River,
South Carolina...1 to 2 ft
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Imelda and Hurricane
Humberto are affecting the Bahamas and are currently spreading to
much of the U.S. east coast. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found

      <title>Tropical Storm Imelda Forecast Discussion Number 15</title>

Tropical Storm Imelda Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
500 AM EDT Tue Sep 30 2025

Deep convection has redeveloped on the western side of Imelda 
during the past several hours, though a fair portion of the 
circulation has been overtaken by dry air aloft.  The last reports 
overnight from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that the pressure had fallen again to 983 mb, with some 
increase in flight-level winds as they exited in the western 
quadrant.  Given the improved organization on satellite since the 
plane left, I'm going to nudge the maximum winds up to 60 kt on 
this advisory, and another Hurricane Hunter should be in the area 
this morning.  

Imelda has taken the long-awaited turn away from the mainland, now 
estimated at 035/7 kt.  This general motion is expected today, 
followed by a faster motion towards the east-northeast primarily 
due to increasing mid-latitude southwesterly flow.  There remains 
some speed differences in the models, but it is notable that all of 
the guidance is near Bermuda between 36-48 h.  The new forecast is 
a touch south of the previous one, perhaps reflecting some binary 
steering influences from Humberto as the pair of tropical cyclones 
get closer together.  

The environment around Imelda is a complicated one, with lots of 
shear and dry air in the vicinity while the system remains over 
warm waters.  A recent AMSR pass also shows better low-level 
structure, so intensification is forecast today.  Imelda should 
experience a favorable trough interaction by Wednesday, forcing an 
increase in the maximum winds as Imelda undergoes a protracted 
extratropical transition with lots of upper divergence and 
convection.  Every model forecasts a strong sting jet to form on 
the south and west side of the cyclone on Wednesday during the 
later stages of the transition.  The new forecast is near a mean of 
the global and regional hurricane models, showing a potent system 
near Bermuda.  Imelda probably won't have a conventional hurricane 
structure near that island, but there is a significant risk of high 
winds due to the hybrid tropical cyclone structure expected then.  
Steady weakening is anticipated by late week after the system 
passes Bermuda.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Imelda is expected to intensify into a hurricane later today 
with the cyclone approaching Bermuda during the day Wednesday as a 
hurricane. A Hurricane Watch is in effect for the island of Bermuda 
due to the expected onset of tropical storm conditions beginning 
Wednesday afternoon.
 
2. Locally heavy rainfall across coastal sections of southeast
North Carolina could cause isolated flash and urban flooding
through tonight. As Imelda passes near Bermuda, 2 to 4 inches – 50
to 100 mm – of rainfall is expected from Wednesday into Thursday.
 
3. Swells and high surf from both Humberto and Imelda are expected
to produce dangerous marine conditions and rip currents along much
of the East Coast of the United States during the next several days.
