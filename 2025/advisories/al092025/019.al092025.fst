DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Imelda was located
near latitude 30.2 North, longitude 72.1 West. Imelda is moving
toward the east-northeast near 20 mph (31 km/h). A much faster
east-northeast to northeast motion is expected over the next couple 
of days.  On the forecast track, the core of the hurricane will be 
near Bermuda this afternoon or evening and move away from the island 
by Thursday afternoon.
 
Satellite data indicate that the maximum sustained winds have 
increased to near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher gusts.  Imelda is 
expected to be stronger, near category 2 strength, when it passes 
close to Bermuda late today.  Imelda is then expected to become an 
extratropical low in a couple of days, with gradual weakening 
thereafter.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles
(370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 974 mb (28.77 inches).

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected over Bermuda by this
evening, with tropical storm conditions likely by this afternoon.
 
RAINFALL:  Across Bermuda, 2 to 4 inches (50 to 100 mm) of rainfall
are expected from later today into Thursday, which could lead to
flash flooding.
 
STORM SURGE:  In Bermuda, a dangerous storm surge is expected to
produce coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds.  The surge will
be accompanied by large and damaging waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Hurricane Imelda and Hurricane Humberto
are affecting the Bahamas, Bermuda, and much of the U.S. east coast.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
