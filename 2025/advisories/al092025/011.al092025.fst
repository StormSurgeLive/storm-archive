DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Imelda was
located near latitude 25.5 North, longitude 77.1 West. Imelda is
moving toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h), and a generally 
northward motion is expected to continue today.  On Tuesday, Imelda 
is expected to turn sharply to the east-northeast.  On the forecast 
track, the center of the system is expected to move across the 
northwestern Bahamas today and then turn east-northeastward, moving 
away from the southeastern U.S. by the middle part of this week.

Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is forecast and Imelda could become a 
hurricane on Tuesday.  
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km), 
primarily east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Imelda can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occuring in portions of 
the northwestern Bahamas and should continue through today.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Imelda is expected to produce additional 
rainfall of 2 to 4 inches across eastern Cuba and 4 to 8 inches 
across the northwest Bahamas through Tuesday. This rainfall will 
likely produce flash and urban flooding. Mudslides are also possible 
in areas of higher terrain across eastern Cuba.

Storm total rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches with local maxima of 4 
inches are expected through Tuesday across northeast Florida, 
coastal South Carolina, and coastal sections of southeast North 
Carolina. This rainfall could result in isolated flash and urban 
flooding.

As Imelda passes near Bermuda, 2 to 4 inches -- 50 to 100 mm -- of 
rainfall is expected from Wednesday into Thursday.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Tropical Storm Imelda, please see the National 
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds in the northwestern Bahamas.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
Minor coastal flooding is possible in areas of onshore winds over
the Southeastern U.S. coastline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the surge occurs over the next several high tide cycles...
 
Volusia/Brevard County Line, Florida to the South Santee River,
South Carolina...1 to 2 ft
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Imelda and Hurricane
Humberto are affecting the Bahamas and will spread to much of the
east coast of the U.S. early this week. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
