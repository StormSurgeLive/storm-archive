BULLETIN
Hurricane Humberto Advisory Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
500 AM AST Sun Sep 28 2025
 
...EXTREMELY DANGEROUS CATEGORY 4 HUMBERTO MOVING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD
OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN SUBTROPICAL ATLANTIC...
...COULD BRING HAZARDS TO BERMUDA IN A FEW DAYS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...23.9N 63.3W
ABOUT 585 MI...945 KM S OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...155 MPH...250 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...929 MB...27.44 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Humberto, as 
watches could be required later today.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Humberto was
located near latitude 23.9 North, longitude 63.3 West. Humberto is
moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). A turn 
toward the northwest is expected this morning, followed by a turn to
the north-northwest on Monday evening. Humberto is forecast to then 
turn north-northeastward and move west of Bermuda by Tuesday 
evening.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 155 mph (250 km/h) with higher
gusts. Humberto is an extremely dangerous category 4 hurricane on 
the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Humberto should remain a 
powerful major hurricane for the next few days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 929 mb (27.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Humberto will continue to affect portions
of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
and Bermuda through much of this week. Swells from Humberto will
also affect the U.S. East Coast beginning Monday. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Humberto Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
500 AM AST Sun Sep 28 2025

Humberto continues to display a clear, circular eye about 10-15 
miles in diameter.  Although the eye temperatures are still fairly 
warm around 15C, the area of cloud tops colder then -70C has shrunk 
a bit in the southwest quadrant, and data-T numbers have 
continuously been lower than 7.0 for about 8 hours now.  The latest 
subjective CI numbers range from 127-140 kt, and the latest 
objective intensity estimates range from 125-135 kt.  Based on the 
above analyses and data, the initial intensity is nudged down to 135 
kt.

The initial motion estimate is west-northwestward, or 300 degrees 
at 11 kt.  Over the next couple of days, Humberto will round the 
southwestern periphery of a mid-tropospheric subtropical ridge 
located northeast of the cyclone.  Humberto will turn northward by 
early Tuesday in between the ridge and Tropical Depression Nine, 
which should be located to the west-southwest of Humberto.  By 
Tuesday night, Humberto is forecast to turn north-northeastward 
while the aforementioned ridge weakens and shifts eastward.  
Humberto should turn quickly toward the northeast to east-northeast 
by mid-week in response to a large, amplifying upper-level trough 
moving out of the Canadian Maritimes and into the northwestern 
Atlantic waters.  There remains quite a bit of along-track spread 
at days 4 and 5.  The new NHC forecast is slightly faster toward 
the northwest through 48 h, then lies to the northwest, or left of, 
the previous official forecast at 60-72 when it makes its closest 
approach to Bermuda.  In other words, the new forecast shows the 
center passing a bit farther from Bermuda, however, Bermuda still 
has roughly a 50 percent chance of getting tropical-storm-force 
winds, most likely on Tuesday night and Wednesday.

There have been no recent microwave passes over Humberto in the 
last 6 h, but infrared imagery suggests there could be a partial 
outer ring trying to become more dominant.  SHIPS predictors and 
the UW-CIMSS Microwave-based Probability of Eyewall Replace Cycle 
(M-PERC) guidance indicate a high likelihood of an eyewall 
replacement cycle commencing within the next 12 h.  Otherwise, 
environmental conditions are pretty favorable for the next 12 h, so 
the forecast will show Humberto maintaining its current intensity 
for 12 h despite the potential for fluctuations.  Thereafter, all 
of the intensity guidance points toward gradual weakening as there 
is potential for gradually increasing vertical wind shear during 
the 36 to 60 hour time frame.  By hour 72, Humberto should 
encounter significantly stronger upper-level westerly flow and begin 
the process of extratropical transition.  Extratropical transition 
should be complete around 96 h, after Humberto crosses the 26 
degree C sea-surface temperature isotherm, as all global models 
show a warm front extending northeastward from Humberto by that 
time.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Nine was 
located near latitude 23.2 North, longitude 77.3 West. The 
depression is moving toward the north-northwest near 7 mph       
(11 km/h). A faster motion to the north-northwest is expected to 
begin later today and continue through Monday. On the forecast 
track, the center of the system is expected to move across the 
central and northwestern Bahamas later today and tonight and 
approach the southeast U.S. coast early this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Strengthening is expected during the next few days, and the system 
is forecast to become a tropical storm later today and a hurricane 
by late Monday or Tuesday.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated by NOAA G-IV dropsonde data 
is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Nine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the central Bahamas
beginning later today and in the northwestern Bahamas late this
afternoon. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area
along the east coast of Florida on Monday.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Nine is expected to produce additional 
rainfall of 4 to 8 inches across eastern Cuba and 6 to 12 inches 
across the northwest Bahamas through Tuesday. This rainfall will 
likely produce flash and urban flooding. Mudslides are also possible 
in areas of higher terrain across eastern Cuba.
 
Storm total rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches with local maxima of 7
inches are expected into Wednesday morning across portions of the
coastal Carolinas. This rainfall could result in flash, urban, and
river flooding. Changes in the forecast track could result in
further adjustments to these rainfall totals.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Depression Nine, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds in the northwestern Bahamas. Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by this system and Hurricane Humberto will
affect portions of the Bahamas this weekend, and spread to portions
of the southeast U.S. coast early this week. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ripCurrents

Tropical Depression Nine Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
500 AM EDT Sun Sep 28 2025

The depression has been slowly becoming more organized overnight.  
The minimum central pressure has fallen to 1003 mb, and satellite 
images are indicating that a tighter circulation has formed along 
with increasing deep convection.  The initial intensity is held at 
30 kt per the latest aircraft flight-level winds, but this system 
will probably become a tropical storm soon.

The initial motion is a bit faster to the north-northwest, or 345/6 
kt.  This general motion with a turn towards the north is 
anticipated during the next couple of days while the system moves 
between an upper trough over the southeastern United States and the 
subtropical ridge.  Beyond that time, models are generally faster
and more offshore of the United States with the eventual track of 
the tropical cyclone, following the trend of the past few cycles, 
due to it missing the upper trough and eventually following 
Hurricane Humberto more out to sea.  While it is too early to feel 
extremely confident, almost all of the reliable ensembles now keep 
the system offshore of the southeastern United States, though some 
impacts are still anticipated.  The latest NHC forecast is shifted 
to the south and east, but is not nearly as far to the southeast as 
the latest consensus models due to continuity constraints.  

Now that a better-defined core has formed, gradual intensification 
is anticipated for the next couple of days while the system remains 
in a warm water but moderate shear environment.  The intensity 
forecast is similar to the previous one through the first couple 
days of the forecast.  Afterwards, the intensity forecast is 
slightly raised as the system could find itself in a lower shear 
environment while still over warm waters.  By the end of the 
forecast, interaction with a frontal boundary is likely to cause 
some weakening, along with extratropical transition.  This is a low 
confidence forecast at long range given the recent large track 
changes.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The depression is expected to strengthen and bring tropical storm
conditions to portions of the central and northwestern Bahamas
through tonight. Tropical storm conditions are also possible
along portions of the east coast of central Florida beginning
Monday, where a Tropical Storm Watch is in effect.
 
2. Rainfall associated with Tropical Depression Nine will continue 
to impact eastern Cuba and the Bahamas through Tuesday, which will 
likely produce flash and urban flooding.  Mudslides are possible in 
the higher terrain.  Heavy rainfall across the coastal Carolinas 
could cause flash, urban, and river flooding into Wednesday 
morning. 
 
3. There is still a risk of heavy rainfall, wind and high surf 
impacts for the southeast U.S. coast even if the center 
remains offshore.  Residents should closely monitor the latest 
forecast updates and ensure that they have their hurricane plan in 
place.
