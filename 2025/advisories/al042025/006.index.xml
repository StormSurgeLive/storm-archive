of days as Dexter becomes an extratropical cyclone.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)

Tropical Storm Dexter Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042025
500 AM AST Tue Aug 05 2025

Dexter appears to be weakening.  The low-level circulation has 
become totally exposed this morning- a consequence of continued 
strong vertical wind shear.  Satellite intensity estimates have 
fallen so the initial wind speed is reduced to 35 kt.  Little 
change is expected for the next day or so as Dexter battles the 
shear.  While normally the storm would just decay after the waters 
become cooler in a couple days, most models are now showing 
re-intensification due to a favorable trough interaction.  This was 
first shown by the ECMWF yesterday, and now other models are on 
board.  The short-term part of the forecast was lowered based on the 
initial wind speed, and little change was made to the longer-term 
intensities.  

The storm continues moving east-northeastward at about 10 kt.  An 
east-northeast to northeast track is likely for the next couple of 
days due to mid-latitude westerly flow.  The aforementioned trough 
interaction should cause a faster forward motion in a few days.  
The new forecast is similar to the previous one, mostly ignoring 
the slow GFS solution.  Extratropical transition is expected 
between 36-48 h, and the low is forecast to decay into a trough in 
roughly 4-5 days.
