Tropical Storm Dexter Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042025
500 PM AST Tue Aug 05 2025

This afternoon Dexter continues to exhibit a pulsing convective 
structure. After briefly becoming exposed earlier today, the 
low-level circulation has tucked underneath a renewed convective 
burst on its down-shear side. Despite its ragged appearance, an 
earlier scatterometer pass indicated that Dexter's circulation had 
tightened up some with a smaller radius of maximum wind. The peak 
wind value retrieved was 35 kt, which still supports a current 
intensity of 35 kt this advisory. This value is higher than the 18 
UTC subjective Dvorak intensity estimates, but a bit lower than the 
some of the objective intensity estimates (DMINT, SATCON).

Dexter continues to move off to the northeast, with the latest 
motion estimated at 055/11 kt. This direction of motion is expected 
to continue for the next few days with a gentle bend towards the 
east-northeast, across the North Atlantic. However, the speed of the 
forward motion continues to be uncertain, with large along-track 
spread in the guidance. The GFS continues to be on the slow end, 
while the ECMWF and Google Deep Mind ensemble mean (GDMI) are on the 
faster end of the guidance suite. The latest NHC track forecast 
continues to favor the faster track solutions, and is a blend of the 
prior forecast track, with some of the more reliable consensus aids 
(HCCA). 

Vertical wind shear over the system is now above 30 kt out of the 
west-southwest, and is forecast to increase further over the next 
24-48 hours. However, the majority of the intensity guidance 
indicates Dexter may strengthen due to baroclinic dynamics from a 
favorable trough interaction. Thus, the NHC intensity forecast shows 
some strengthening, peaking Dexter as a 50 kt extratropical cyclone 
in about 48 hours. This forecast is roughly in the middle of the 
intensity guidance envelope, though notably lower than the latest 
HAFS-A/B forecasts, which develop a potent sting-jet-like structure 
as Dexter becomes extratropical. After the extratropical low 
occludes, it should gradually weaken, eventually opening up into a 
trough by the end of the forecast period.
