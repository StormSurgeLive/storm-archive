Tropical Storm Dexter Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042025
500 AM AST Mon Aug 04 2025

Dexter remains a sheared tropical storm.  Animated Proxy-Visible 
imagery shows a partially exposed low-level center near the western 
edge of the convective canopy, a function of moderate shear. With 
little change in the convective signature or satellite estimates 
during the past few hours, the initial intensity will stay at 40 kt 
for this advisory.  

The initial motion continues east-northeastward at 10 kt, with 
Dexter steered by mid-latitude westerly flow on the northwestern 
side of the subtropical ridge.  Model guidance has come into better 
agreement on the system moving to the northeast or east-northeast 
for the next few days due to flow from that ridge, with fewer 
outlier solutions to note.  Generally the models are a bit slower 
than the last cycle, and the NHC forecast follows that trend, though 
is still on the faster side of the guidance.
 
The moderate shear currently affecting Dexter is expected to 
increase to over 20 kt by late today, with increasing environmental 
mid-level dry air.  This should limit the potential strengthening to 
the short term, and the NHC forecast is similar to the previous one, 
near the model consensus.  While strong shear expected in a couple 
of days would normally cause weakening, there is some chance of a 
favorable trough interaction causing non-tropical intensification, 
as shown by the 00Z ECMWF model.  Most of the global models, 
however, do not show the trough phasing with Dexter, though they are 
showing a stronger extratropical low.  The new forecast is just a 
little higher at 72-96h than the last forecast, and is now below the 
long-range model consensus. Dexter's extratropical disposition 
should be considered fairly uncertain at this time.
