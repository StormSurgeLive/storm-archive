Tropical Storm Dexter Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042025
1100 PM AST Wed Aug 06 2025
 
Dexter is very close to being an extratropical cyclone. Satellite
images suggest that frontal features are forming both to the east
and south of the center, and the overall cloud pattern is beginning
to take on an extratropical appearance. Strong westerly vertical
wind shear has caused the low-level center to become completely
exposed with disorganized convection limited to the northeast
quadrant. The initial intensity is held at 45 kt, which is in line
with the latest satellite intensity estimates and recent ASCAT data.

A mid- to upper-level trough currently over the Canadian Maritimes 
is expected to merge with the system early Thursday, which should 
complete Dexter's extratropical transition. This will also likely 
cause strengthening due to baroclinic forcing, and Dexter could 
become a hurricane-force extratropical low in about 24 hours. 
Gradual weakening is expected after that time as the upper-level 
trough dampens out. The NHC intensity forecast is slightly above 
the guidance in the short term, but in line with the bulk of the 
models from 48 to 96 hours.

Dexter is moving a little faster to the east now, with the latest 
initial motion estimated to be 085/14 kt. A northeastward motion is 
expected during the next day or two as Dexter interacts and merges 
with the aforementioned trough. After that time, a turn back to 
the east-northeast or east is predicted in the mid-latitude 
westerly flow. The NHC track forecast lies fairly close to the 
various consensus aids.
