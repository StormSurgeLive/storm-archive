Tropical Storm Dexter Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042025
1100 PM AST Mon Aug 04 2025

Dexter continues to be disrupted by strong westerly vertical wind 
shear, with its associated deep convection being displaced to the 
east of the low-level center.  The storm's cloud pattern is very 
ragged-looking at this time and lacks convective banding features.
Satellite-based intensity estimates using subjective and objective 
methods range from 30 kt to 47 kt.  Blending these values, the 
advisory intensity estimate remains 40 kt, though a recent 
scatterometer pass suggests this might be generous.

Although there is some uncertainty in the center location using 
infrared imagery, it appears that the forward speed has slowed 
somewhat and the current motion estimate is around 050/11 kt.  
Dexter is near the southern edge of a belt of mid-level westerlies. 
The track guidance is in general agreement on a northeastward to 
east-northeastward motion for the next several days.  However, it 
is possible that the system could become completely decoupled and 
move more slowly in the low-level flow.  The official forecast 
assumes that the cyclone will retain enough vertical coherency to 
be steered at least partially by the mid-level flow.  The NHC track 
forecast is fairly close to the latest corrected consensus, HCCA, 
guidance.

There is no sign that the strong shear in Dexter's environment will 
abate.  In fact, the SHIPS model indicates that the vertical wind 
shear will increase even more over the next few days.  Therefore, 
it is not likely that the system will be able to strengthen as a 
true tropical cyclone.  The official forecast allows for slight 
intensification due to baroclinic processes.  Simulated infrared 
imagery and the FSU phase space predictions from the global 
models suggest that Dexter will likely make the transition 
into an extratropical cyclone in 2-3 days.
