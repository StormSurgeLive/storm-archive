Thereafter, environmental <br />conditions appear favorable for gradual development of this system, <br />and a tropical depression could form by the latter portion of this <br />week or weekend as as the low initially moves slowly westward, but <br />turns more northward by this weekend.<br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br />* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br /><br />Central Tropical Atlantic:<br />A tropical wave over the far eastern tropical Atlantic is currently <br />producing disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity, primarily <br />to the southwest of the wave axis.  Environmental conditions are <br />forecast to be conducive for gradual development during the next few <br />days, and a tropical depression could form late this week or over <br />the weekend as the system moves generally west-northwestward across <br />the central tropical or subtropical Atlantic.<br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br />* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br /><br />$$<br />Forecaster Papin]]>

Tropical Storm Dexter Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042025
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
1100 AM AST Tue Aug 05 2025
 
Dexter continues to be in a weakened state this morning.  The 
low-level circulation is still partially exposed to the 
the west of the deeper convection, and cloud tops with the deeper 
convection have warmed this morning.  The initial wind speed 
remains 35 kt and little change in this intensity is expected 
today.  Most models continue to show some re-intensification due to 
a favorable trough interaction by Wednesday into Thursday.  Thus 
little to no change was made to the intensity forecast, although 
there remains some uncertainty with how quickly this modest 
re-intensification occurs.

Overall little change was made to either the track or intensity 
forecast with this package.  There is some model spread with the 
forward speed of Dexter, with the GFS remaining an outlier on the 
slower side of the model spread, and the ECMWF faster.  However, run 
to run continuity in the models has been low with these details, 
and the previous forecast remains well within this spread.  Expect 
that we will continue to see run to run variability, and thus there 
was no strong evidence that a change in the track forecast was 
needed at this time.  Thus the new forecast is similar to the 
previous one, and continues to give less weight to the slower GFS.  
Extratropical transition is expected between 36-48 h, and the low is 
forecast to decay into a trough in roughly 4-5 days.
