Tropical Storm Dexter Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042025
1100 AM AST Wed Aug 06 2025

This morning, Dexter's structure continues to be quite resilient 
against an estimated 35-40 kt of westerly vertical wind shear over 
the storm. Deep convection continues to burst, still primarily 
down-shear, but an earlier AMSR2 microwave pass showed a bit more 
banding-type structure on the 37 GHz channel. Subjective Dvorak 
estimates from TAFB and SAB are now both T3.0/45 kt, and there were 
a few GOES-19 derived motion wind vectors up to 52 kt near 850 mb on 
the west side of Dexter's low-level circulation. These data support 
raising the initial intensity to 45 kt for this advisory. 

Dexter remains on an east-northeastward heading, a bit faster than 
earlier at 060/13 kt. The tropical storm is being steered by the 
mid-latitude westerly flow on the downstream side of a southward 
digging shortwave trough moving out of Atlantic Canada. The guidance 
has finally come into good agreement on this trough capturing Dexter 
in 36 h, leading to further acceleration east-northeastward until 
the trough and Dexter fully phase. The track guidance this cycle is 
a touch faster than earlier, and the latest NHC track forecast was 
nudged a little faster compared to the prior forecast cycle. 

Dexter's recent intensification is likely not fully tropical in 
nature. In fact, Dexter is currently positioned in the right 
entrance region of a 120 kt upper-level jet streak, which is likely 
providing some enhanced upper-level divergence and aiding the deep 
convection over the cyclone. The digging shortwave trough will also 
start impinging on the cyclone, initiating extratropical transition. 
This process should be complete in about 36 h, when both the GFS and 
ECMWF models show deep convection separating from Dexter's core. 
However, this will be a dynamic extratropical transition, with all 
the various hurricane-regional models suggesting the development of 
a sting jet, or branch of rapidly descending dry air, curving 
cyclonically around the cyclone's western flank. The NHC intensity 
forecast shows Dexter peaking as a 60-kt extratropical cyclone in 
about 36 h in response to this feature, and both HAFS-A/B suggest 
this intensity could be conservative. After the extratropical 
cyclone occludes, the winds should decrease again as it loses its 
baroclinic forcing, with the low opening up to a trough by the end 
of the forecast period over the far northeastern Atlantic.
