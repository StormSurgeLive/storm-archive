Tropical Storm Dexter Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042025
500 PM AST Mon Aug 04 2025
 
There is not a lot new to report with Dexter this afternoon. The 
center remains partially exposed, with periodic bursts of deep 
convection firing off along the downshear-right side of the storm. 
This activity continues to struggle rotating upshear due to westerly 
vertical wind shear which has now increased above 20 kt. The 18 UTC 
Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB were T3.0/45 kt and T2.0/30 kt 
respectively. Objective intensity estimates also range from 35 to 45 
kt. Earlier scatterometer data received after the prior advisory 
only had a peak value of 33 kt. The initial intensity remains 40 kt 
for this advisory, a blend of all the various intensity estimates.
 
There are several mesovorticies rotating around the mean center, but 
Dexter in general remains on a northeastward heading at 050/13 kt. A 
narrow mid-level ridge oriented northeast to southwest from the 
Azores to Bermuda should enable Dexter to continue moving 
northeastward to east-northeastward, as long as it remains 
vertically coherent. The vertical depth likely plays a role in 
Dexter's future forward motion, with significant along-track spread 
persisting in the track guidance this afternoon. The NHC track 
forecast is on the faster side of the guidance envelope, close to 
the most recent 12 UTC ECMWF forecast track. However, it remains 
possible that Dexter completely decouples from its mid-level 
circulation and misses phasing with the trough digging southward 
from Atlantic Canada. Instead of accelerating northeastward, this 
latter scenario could result in the storm slowing down as it becomes 
a shallow cyclone. For now, the latest NHC track forecast is close 
to the prior one. 

As shear continue to increase over the tropical cyclone, forecasted 
to be above 30 kt in 12 h, its window for further tropical 
intensification is closing. The intensity guidance is a bit lower 
this afternoon. In response, the NHC intensity forecast now holds 
Dexter at 40 kt until it undergoes extratropical transition sometime 
between 60-72 h, where a slight amount of intensification is still 
shown. The intensity forecast is in the middle of the guidance 
envelope. As mentioned previously, Dexter's final structure remains 
quite uncertain near the end of the forecast period, and it is 
entirely possible the storm could become a remnant low instead of an 
extratropical cyclone by the latter half of this week.
