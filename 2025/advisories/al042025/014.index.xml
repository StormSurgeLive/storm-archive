Tropical Storm Dexter Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042025
500 AM AST Thu Aug 07 2025

Dexter is on the edge of being extratropical. An earlier 
scatterometer overpass showed what is likely a warm front extending 
from the east into or near the center. In addition, a cloud band in 
the southeastern semicircle appears to be a developing cold front. 
However, a strong convective burst is currently occurring a little 
east of the center, and based on this Dexter as maintained as a 
tropical storm at this time.  Satellite intensity estimates have 
changed little since the last advisory, so the initial intensity is 
held at 45 kt.

Dexter should complete extratropical transition during the next 
6-12 h as it merges with a mid- to upper-level trough approaching 
from the northwest.  Global model show strengthening due to 
baroclinic forcing as this happens, and Dexter is forecast to
become a hurricane-force extratropical low in about 24 hours.
Gradual weakening is expected after that time as the upper-level
trough dampens out. The NHC intensity forecast remains above the 
guidance in the short term, but in line with the bulk of the models 
from 48 to 96 hours. The cyclone is forecast to weaken to a trough 
by 120 h.

The initial motion is now 070/16. A northeastward motion is expected 
during the next day or two as Dexter interacts and merges with the 
aforementioned trough. After that time, a turn back to the 
east-northeast or east is likely as the cyclone is steered by the 
mid-latitude westerly flow.  The guidance nudged slightly northward 
between 24-60 h, and the new track forecast has a similar small 
nudge. It is otherwise similar to the previous forecast and close to 
the various consensus models.
