Tropical Storm Dexter Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042025
1100 PM AST Tue Aug 05 2025
 
Strong westerly vertical wind shear continues over Dexter.  Although 
vigorous deep convection continues to form within the circulation, 
this activity is persistently displaced to the east of the estimated 
low-level center.  The cloud pattern remain rather ragged-looking 
with no well-defined banding features.  The current intensity 
estimate is 35 kt, which is a blend of subjective Dvorak estimates 
from TAFB and SAB.  Objective intensity estimates are somewhat 
higher, but since the organization of the system has not improved 
since earlier today, the intensity is not increased on this 
advisory.

Dexter is estimated to be moving east-northeastward, or around 
060/10 kt.  The cyclone continues moving along the southern side of 
a belt of mid-level westerlies.  An upstream trough is expected pass 
just north of the system within the next 1-2 days, and Dexter will 
probably accelerate a little due to the influence of the trough.  
The official track forecast is very similar to the previous NHC 
prediction and close to the dynamical model consensus.

As diagnosed by the Decay-SHIPS guidance, vertical wind shear is 
predicted to increase even further during the next 48 hours.  
Typically this would lead to weakening of a tropical cyclone.  
However, Dexter is expected to intensify somewhat due to its 
interaction with the approaching upper-level trough and baroclinic 
forcing, while losing its tropical characteristics.  The NHC 
intensity forecast is about in the middle of the model guidance.  
This is also close to the latest HCCA corrected consensus solution.
