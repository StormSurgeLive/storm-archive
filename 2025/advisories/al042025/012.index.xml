Tropical Storm Dexter Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042025
500 PM AST Wed Aug 06 2025

Similar to the past couple of days, the high vertical wind shear 
over Dexter caused its low-level circulation to become exposed to 
the west of the the deep convection earlier this afternoon. A 
scatterometer pass received after the prior advisory also suggested 
that Dexter's vortex is becoming more elongated, with signs of a 
baroclinic zone starting to take shape to the northeast of the 
center. These signatures suggest that Dexter may soon undergo 
extratropical transition. The earlier scatterometer pass had a peak 
wind retrieval of 43 kt, and that value, combined with similar 
subjective and objective intensity estimates, support maintaining 45 
kt this advisory.  

Dexter continues to gradually accelerate to the east-northeast, 
with the estimated motion now at 070/14 kt. The storm remains well 
embedded in the mid-latitude westerly flow as a shortwave trough 
drops southward towards Dexter. The subsequent trough interaction is 
forecast to keep Dexter moving quickly east-northeastward with just 
a subtle bend northeastward from 24-48 h. Compared to 24 h ago, the 
track guidance is in much better agreement with less along-track 
spread, and the latest NHC track forecast is very similar to the 
prior advisory, near the simple and corrected consensus aids. 

With vertical wind shear now around 40 kt and the cyclone also 
crossing the north edge of the Gulf Stream, most of the subsequent 
strengthening shown in the intensity forecast will be due to 
baroclinic processes as Dexter undergoes extratropical transition. 
The global and regional hurricane model fields shows Dexter's 
metamorphosis, with to development of frontal features as the wind 
field becomes quite asymmetric. In fact, the maximum sustained winds 
in 24-36 h are likely related to a sting jet that curves 
cyclonically around the cyclone's western flank during this time 
frame. The hurricane-regional models, and even the most recent 12 
UTC ECMWF run show winds up to hurricane-force in the southwest 
quadrant. Thus, the latest NHC intensity forecast will now 
explicitly show a 65-kt extratropical cyclone in 36 h. After 
occlusion, the low will slowly weaken through the remainder of the 
forecast period, ultimately dissipating by early next week in the 
far northeastern Atlantic.
