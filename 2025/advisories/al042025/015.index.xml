Post-Tropical Cyclone Dexter Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042025
1100 AM AST Thu Aug 07 2025
 
Satellite imagery and surface observations indicate that Dexter has 
completed its transition to an extratropical cyclone.  Strong 
westerly wind shear is leaving an exposed, elongated center with all 
convection in the eastern semicircle.  The convection is decreasing 
in strength and areal coverage, and it is also becoming more 
asymmetric.  A warm front clearly extends east-northeastward from 
Dexter, and there also appears to be a developing cold front 
extending towards the southwest, as noted in an earlier AMSR2 
microwave pass.  Surface marine observations show temperatures in 
the upper 50s and lower 60s just a couple hundred n mi northwest of 
Dexter's center.  A recent partial ASCAT pass showed winds up to 45 
kt, but this pass did not sample the entire circulation.  The 
initial intensity of the extratropical cyclone is increased to 50 kt 
based on the ASCAT data as well as global model analyses, which 
suggest the winds have likely reached 50 kt.
 
Dexter is merging with an approaching mid- to upper-level trough.
Global models show strengthening over the next 12-24 h due to
baroclinic forcing due to the trough interaction.  Thereafter, the
cyclone will begin to steadily weaken late Friday into the weekend
as the upper-level trough dampens out. The NHC intensity forecast is
near the high end of the guidance during the first 24 hours of the
forecast, and near the middle of the guidance envelope thereafter.
The cyclone is forecast to weaken to a trough in 4 to 5 days.
 
The initial motion is 070/15. A motion between northeast and
east-northeast is expected during the next 24-36 hours as Dexter
interacts with the aforementioned trough.  After that time, a slight
bend more toward the east is expected as the cyclone is steered by
the mid-latitude flow.  The new NHC forecast is a bit slower than
the previous one, and lies in between the simple and corrected
consensus aids.

This is the final NHC advisory on Dexter. Additional information on 
this system can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the 
National Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header 
FZNT01 KWBC, and online at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
