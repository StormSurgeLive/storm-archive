      <title>Hurricane Iona Forecast Discussion Number 12</title>

Hurricane Iona Discussion Number  12
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
500 PM HST Tue Jul 29 2025
 
Iona likely reached peak intensity earlier today, with satellite 
images now showing the eye obscured by a central dense overcast.  
The cyclone has begun to weaken as it feels the influence of 
increasing westerly vertical wind shear while also moving over 
cooler sea surface temperatures below 27C, as depicted by the 
Real-time, Global, Sea Surface Temperature Analysis.  The latest 
subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates from PHFO and JTWC 
were 5.5/102 knots, while SAB was a somewhat lower 4.5/77 knots. 
Meanwhile, the latest objective intensity estimates range from 85 to 
96 knots.  Given that the system has just recently begun to weaken, 
the initial intensity will be lowered to 100 knots for this 
advisory.

Iona is moving due west, or 270 degrees, at 15 knots.  This general 
motion is expected to continue during the next couple of days as the 
cyclone moves along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge to 
the north.  A turn toward the west-northwest and a gradual decrease 
in forward speed is expected late in the week and over the weekend, 
as the system is steered into a weakness in the mid-level ridge to 
the north.  The official track forecast remains near the center of 
the tightly clustered guidance envelope and is nearly identical to 
the previous advisory. Confidence remains high that Iona will stay 
well south of the Hawaiian Islands.

The cyclone is expected to undergo rapid weakening tonight and 
Wednesday as it experiences increasing westerly vertical wind shear 
while also moving over cooler sea surface temperatures of 26.5 to 
27C. A slower rate of weakening is then forecast Wednesday night 
and Thursday.  By Friday, the shear begins to relax, sea surface 
temperatures begin to increase to 28C or above, and the mid-levels 
begin to moisten. The spread among the intensity guidance is 
considerable, and the cyclone’s intensity will likely depend on how 
intact the system remains after moving through the hostile 
environment over the next couple of days. The official forecast 
shows the intensity leveling off after 48 hours, but confidence in 
this is low. Overall, the intensity forecast lies pretty close to 
the middle of the intensity guidance envelope.

SUMMARY OF 500 PM HST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...13.1N 151.7W
ABOUT 700 MI...1125 KM SE OF HONOLULU HAWAII

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM HST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Keli was
located near latitude 13.1 North, longitude 151.7 West.  Keli is
moving toward the west near 18 mph (30 km/h) and a westward to 
west-northwestward motion at a faster forward speed is expected 
during the next day or so.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast through tonight, but 
Keli is expected to weaken into a depression on Wednesday and 
dissipate by Thursday.
.
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).

Tropical Storm Keli Discussion Number   7
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
500 PM HST Tue Jul 29 2025
 
Keli appears to be maintaining its intensity...for now.  The system 
continues to produce rather small areas of convection with limited 
banding features over the eastern semicircle.  Overall, however, 
the tropical cyclone's cloud pattern is not very well organized.  
The advisory intensity estimate is held at 35 kt in agreement with 
subjective Dvorak numbers from SAB and PHFO along with objective 
estimates from UW-CIMSS.  The storm remains quite small with only 
about a 30 n mi extent of 34-kt winds from the center.

The storm continues to gradually accelerate with an initial motion 
estimate now of about 280/16 kt.  Keli is being steered by the flow 
on the south side of a mid-level ridge and appears to also be 
starting to get caught up in the northeast quadrant of the outer 
circulation of larger Hurricane Iona.  The track guidance models 
have generally shifted a little northward with an additional 
increase in forward speed.  The official forecast has again been 
nudged poleward and faster.

Although Keli is hanging on as a tropical storm for the moment, it 
is not likely to last for more than a couple of days.  Westerly 
vertical shear from the outflow of Iona is likely to cause 
weakening, and Keli's inflow should be soon disrupted by Iona's 
low-level circulation.  The official forecast continues to call for 
weakening and dissipation in 48 hours or so.  This is also in good 
agreement with the IVCN intensity model consensus.
