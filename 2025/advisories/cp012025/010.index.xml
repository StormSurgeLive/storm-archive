Hurricane Iona Discussion Number  10
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
500 AM HST Tue Jul 29 2025

Iona is still rapidly intensifying. Satellite images indicate that
the eye of the hurricane is becoming more distinct, and it is
surrounded by a symmetric ring of cold cloud tops. A blend of the
latest intensity estimates from PHFO, JTWC, and UW-CIMSS supports
increasing the initial intensity to 110 kt, just below category 4
status. Iona has strengthened at a very rapid pace of about 50 kt
over the past 24 hours. Although Iona is very powerful, the wind
field is quite small. The hurricane- and tropical-storm-force
winds are estimated to only extend up to 20 n mi and 70 n mi
from the center, respectively.
 
The major hurricane could get a little stronger today, and the
official forecast is at the top end of the intensity guidance in
the short term.  However, as is the case in most major hurricanes,
internal dynamics like eyewall replacement cycles could occur that
cause fluctuations in the system's strength. Iona is expected to
move into less favorable conditions of drier air, stronger shear,
and slightly cooler SSTs by tonight, and that should end the
strengthening trend and induce weakening. This forecast is in best
agreement with the HCCA model.
 
Iona has been moving due westward at about 11 kt on the south side
of a narrow mid-level ridge situated across the Hawaiian Islands.
The hurricane should continue westward on the south side of the
ridge during the next few days, and then turn west-northwestward to
northwestward after that when it moves toward the southwestern
periphery of the high pressure system.  The models are a little
slower this cycle, and the new track forecast has been adjusted in
that direction. Iona is expected to cross the International Date
Line in a little more than 4 days.

Tropical Storm Keli Discussion Number   5
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
500 AM HST Tue Jul 29 2025


Keli has been holding steady since the previous advisory.  Cold 
cloud tops over the storm initially warmed, but recent fresh 
convection has been growing just west of the low-level center.  The 
subjective Dvorak satellite intensity estimates from PHFO and JTWC 
remained at T2.0 and the intensity is held at 35 kt for this cycle. 
Keli is a small tropical cyclone and tropical-storm-force winds only 
extend outward from the center about 30 n mi.  

A mid-level ridge to the north of Keli is steering the storm 
westward at about 11 kt.  Model guidance, and the NHC official track 
forecast, predict the forward motion of the storm slightly 
increasing during the next couple of days while maintaining a 
westward trajectory. 

The intensity forecast reasoning has not changed.  While sea surface 
temperatures are sufficiently warm, environmental conditions are 
expected to become gradually less conducive. Therefore, Keli is 
predicted to hold steady for the next day or so until it begins to 
weaken.  The latest official forecast now show Keli dissipating 
by 60 h, based on the latest model guidance.  However, Keli is a 
small storm and could dissipate sooner than expected.
