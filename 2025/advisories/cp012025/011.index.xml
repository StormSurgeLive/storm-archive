      <title>Hurricane Iona Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Hurricane Iona Discussion Number  11
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Tue Jul 29 2025
 
 
After rapidly intensifying over the past day or so, Iona's strength 
appears to have leveled off. The eye of the hurricane is not quite 
as distinct as it was a few hours ago and the convective pattern is 
slightly less symmetric.  The initial intensity is held at 110 kt, 
but this is near the high end of the latest satellite intensity 
estimates. Although Iona is quite powerful, its wind field remains 
compact. The hurricane- and tropical-storm-force wind radii are 
estimated to only extend up to 25 n mi and 80 n mi from the center, 
respectively.
 
The major hurricane is likely near its peak intensity. Water vapor 
images show a large area of dry and likely stable air just west of 
the system, and this stable air combined with increasing shear 
should cause Iona to steadily weaken during the next several days. 
The new forecast is a touch lower than the previous one and lies 
generally near the middle of the guidance envelope.
 
Iona has been moving due westward at about 12 kt on the south side 
of a narrow mid-level ridge situated across the Hawaiian Islands. 
The hurricane should continue westward on the south side of the 
ridge during the next few days, and then turn west-northwestward to 
northwestward after that when it moves toward the southwestern 
periphery of the high pressure system.  The models are again a 
little slower this cycle, and the new track forecast has been 
adjusted in that direction. Iona is expected to cross the 
International Date Line in about 4 days.

Tropical Storm Keli Discussion Number   6
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Tue Jul 29 2025
 
Keli is a ragged-looking tropical storm.  Thunderstorms have been 
developing in the eastern semicircle of the the circulation 
suggesting some decrease in the southeasterly shear.  Satellite 
intensity estimates from PHFO and JTWC were T2.5 and T2.0, 
respectively, and the initial intensity will be held at 35 kt.  Keli 
is a small tropical cyclone and tropical-storm-force winds only 
extend outward from the center about 30 n mi.

The storm appears to be gradually accelerating and is moving 
westward at 13 kt.  A narrow ridge to the north should continue to 
steer Keli westward through the next day or so.  The track guidance 
envelope has shifted northward and increased in forward speed this 
cycle. Thus, the official track forecast has been nudged poleward 
and is slightly faster, lying between the previous forecast and the 
various consensus aids.

Only minimal changes have been made to the intensity forecast.  
Atmospheric conditions and the storm's proximity to Hurricane 
Iona are expected to gradually weaken Keli.  Model guidance has been 
advancing the dissipation of this small storm, and the official 
forecast now shows Keli opening into a trough by 48 h.  However, 
dissipation could still occur sooner than expected.
