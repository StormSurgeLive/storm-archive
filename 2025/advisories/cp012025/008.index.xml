      <title>Hurricane Iona Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Hurricane Iona Discussion Number   8
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
500 PM HST Mon Jul 28 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Iona has improved since earlier today, 
with very cold cloud tops ranging from -70°C to -80°C surrounding a
developing eye that is becoming increasingly well-defined. 
Subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates came in at 4.0/65 
knots from PHFO, 4.0/65 knots from SAB, and 4.5/77 knots from JTWC. 
Objective estimates from ADT, AiDT, and SATCON have ranged between 
65 and 82 knots over the past several hours. Based on a blend of 
these data, the initial intensity for this advisory has been 
increased to 75 knots.

Hurricane Iona is moving due west, or 270 degrees at 11 knots. This
general motion, along with a gradual increase in forward speed, is
expected to continue over the next several days as the cyclone moves
along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge to the north.  A
turn toward the west-northwest is anticipated by late in the week as
the system is influenced by a weakness in the mid-level ridge,
created by a developing upper-level low west of the International
Date Line.  The official track forecast remains near the center of
the guidance envelope and is nearly identical to the previous
advisory.  Confidence remains high that Iona will stay well south of
the Hawaiian Islands.
 
Environmental conditions appear primed for further intensification 
during the next 24 hours.  Iona will remain over warm sea surface 
temperatures near 28C, with sufficient mid-level moisture and 
minimal vertical wind shear.  The latest ECMWF SHIPS guidance 
indicates a greater than a 40 percent probability of a 30-knot 
intensity increase within 24 hours.  Given the improving structure 
and conducive environment, the intensity forecast explicitly calls 
for rapid intensification during the next 24 hours, with Iona 
expected to become a major hurricane on Tuesday.  Steady weakening 
is forecast to begin Tuesday night or Wednesday as the system moves 
over slightly cooler waters, encounters increasing westerly vertical 
wind shear, and begins to entrain drier mid-level air.  Iona is 
expected to weaken to tropical depression status by day 5, and it is 
possible the system could become a post-tropical remnant low by that 
time.  The intensity forecast has been adjusted slightly upward from 
the previous advisory, reflecting the latest trends in the intensity 
guidance.  This aligns well with regional hurricane models through 
day 2 and then closely follows the HCCA consensus guidance 
thereafter.

Tropical Storm Keli Discussion Number   3
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
500 PM HST Mon Jul 28 2025

Satellite imagery shows that Keli is producing a small area of deep 
convection near and just west of the estimated center position.  
There is little evidence of convective banding features, although 
there are some curved cloud lines noted over the eastern portion 
of the system on visible imagery.  Overall, the cloud pattern is 
rather disorganized with the storm experiencing easterly shear. 
The current intensity estimate is held at 35 kt, which is a 
little above the subjective Dvorak classifications and close to the 
objective AIDT and DRINT estimates from UW-CIMSS.  Keli is a small 
tropical cyclone and tropical-storm-force winds only extend outward 
about 30 n mi from the center.
 
The storm is moving westward, with a motion estimate of around 
280/10 kt. Keli is expected to continue on a generally westward 
track for the next few days while it remains on the south 
side of a narrow mid-level ridge.  Most of the track models have 
shifted north and are faster than in the previous advisory, and the 
official forecast has been adjusted accordingly.

Slight additional strengthening is possible during the next day or 
so while Keli moves over relatively warm waters.  However the 
unfavorable dynamical influence of the low-level circulation and 
upper-level outflow of nearby Hurricane Iona should result in a 
weakening trend in around 36 hours.  The global models show the 
system weakening into a trough in a few days.  Therefore, Keli could 
dissipate sooner than shown in this official forecast.
