Hurricane Iona Discussion Number  14
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
500 AM HST Wed Jul 30 2025
 
Iona has continued to rapidly weaken since the last advisory. A GPM 
microwave overpass showed an exposed low-level center located well 
to the northwest of the mid-level center apparent in geostationary 
imagery, with little or no organized convection near the low-level 
center. Subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates have 
decreased significantly and currently are in the 45-75 kt range.  
Based on a blend of these estimates, the initial intensity is 
reduced to a likely generous 65 kt.

The initial motion is now 280/17 kt. This general motion is 
expected to continue during the next day or two as the cyclone 
moves along the southern periphery of a low- to mid-level 
subtropical ridge to the north.  A turn toward the west-northwest 
and a gradual decrease in forward speed are expected late in the 
week and over the weekend, as the system is steered into a weakness 
in the ridge. The official forecast is nudged just a little north 
of the previous track  and lies near the center of the track 
guidance envelope. Iona has stayed well south of the Hawaiian 
Islands, and the cyclone is forecast to move farther away from the 
islands during the next couple of days.
 
Rapid weakening is expected to continue for the next 12-24 h due to 
increasing westerly vertical shear and a track over cooler sea 
surface temperatures.  After that, the intensity forecast shows a 
period of little change in strength as sea surface temperatures 
begin to warm along the forecast track and the atmospheric 
conditions become a little more favorable.  By the end of the 
forecast period, Iona should again weaken as it encounters mid-level 
dry air and another bout of vertical shear.  The intensity forecast 
was lowered below the previous forecast mainly in response to the 
current intensity trends.

Tropical Storm Keli Discussion Number   9
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
500 AM HST Wed Jul 30 2025
 
While initially appearing a little more organized on satellite 
infrared imagery, Keli's convection has become more fragmented 
during the past few hours.  Subjective Dvorak estimates range from 
T2.0/30 kt to T3.0/45 kt and the initial intensity is still held at 
35 kt to represent a blend of these estimates.  First-light visible 
satellite data should hopefully reveal more useful information about 
the state of the low-level circulation.

Keli is moving rapidly westward at about 18 kt.  A combination of 
the ridging to the north and Iona to the southeast continue to the 
be the major steering features. The track guidance is closely 
clustered, and the NHC track forecast has been nudged to show a 
slightly faster forward motion.  Strong vertical wind shear, dry 
mid-level humdities, and marginal sea surface temperatures will all 
contribute to Keli's weakening and dissipation during the next day 
or so.  While the official intensity forecast still maintains 
dissipation at 36 h, numerical models suggest this could occur even 
sooner.
