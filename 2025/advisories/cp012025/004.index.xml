Tropical Storm Iona Discussion Number   4
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
500 PM HST Sun Jul 27 2025
 
A strong burst of deep convection with very cold cloud tops below 
-80C developed over the low-level center of the tropical cyclone 
well southeast of the Hawaiian Islands earlier this morning into the 
early afternoon. This activity has recently subsided, but the 
satellite presentation has improved since the previous advisory, 
with well-defined banding structures now evident. The latest 
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from PHFO, SAB, and JTWC all 
came in at 2.5/35 knots, while the objective intensity estimates 
ranged from 35 to 42 knots. Taking a blend of these data, the 
initial intensity for this advisory has been raised to, perhaps a 
conservative 35 knots, making Iona the first named storm of the 
season in the central Pacific.

Tropical Storm Iona is moving westward at 270/9 knots. This general 
westward motion is expected to continue during the next couple of 
days as the system moves along the southern periphery of a 
subtropical ridge to the north. By Tuesday night or Wednesday, Iona 
is expected to increase its forward speed due to a strengthening 
low-to-mid-level ridge north of the system. The track forecast 
closely follows a blend of the FSSE and HCCA consensus guidance and 
is very close to the track from the previous advisory. Confidence 
remains high that Iona will stay well to the south of the Hawaiian 
Islands.

The environment appears conducive to further intensification over 
the next day or so, as Iona remains over warm waters around 28C, 
with adequate mid-level moisture and very light vertical wind shear. 
As a result, the intensity forecast calls for steady strengthening, 
with the cyclone expected to near hurricane strength by Monday night 
or Tuesday. However, by Tuesday night, Iona will begin to move over 
slightly cooler waters, begin to feel the influence of increasing 
westerly vertical wind shear, and start to entrain drier mid-level 
air.  This is expected to result in steady weakening, with the 
cyclone likely becoming a post-tropical remnant low by Day 5 and 
potentially weakening into a trough by that time. The intensity 
forecast has been raised from the previous advisory, following the 
latest trends in the intensity guidance, and is best aligned with 
the FSSE and HCCA consensus guidance.
