Tropical Storm Iona Discussion Number  15
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Wed Jul 30 2025
 
Iona continues to rapidly weaken, as the low-level center is now 
seen in visible imagery exposed well to the west-northwest of the 
remaining poorly-organized convection.  Subjective and objective 
satellite intensity estimates again have decreased significantly 
and currently are in the 40-65 kt range. Based on a blend of these 
estimates, the initial intensity is reduced to a possibly generous 
55 kt, and Iona is downgraded to a tropical storm.
 
The initial motion is 275/19 kt. There is little change in the 
forecast philosophy from the past couple of forecasts, as a general 
westward motion is expected to continue during the next day or two 
while Iona moves along the southern periphery of a low- to mid-level
subtropical ridge to the north.  A turn toward the west-northwest
and a gradual decrease in forward speed are expected after 48 h as 
the system is steered into a weakness in the ridge.  There has been 
little change in the forecast guidance since the last advisory, and 
the new forecast track is similar to the previous track.

Rapid weakening should continue for the next 12 h or so due to
westerly vertical shear and a track over cooler sea surface 
temperatures.  After that, the intensity forecast shows a period of 
little change in strength as sea surface temperatures begin to warm 
along the forecast track and the atmospheric conditions become a 
little more favorable. After 72 h, Iona should again weaken as it 
encounters mid-level dry air and another bout of vertical shear.  
The intensity forecast was again lowered below the previous 
forecast based on the current intensity trends.  Note that the 
intensity forecast is based on the premise that Iona will re-develop 
enough convection to sustain the system as a tropical cyclone. If 
this does not happen, the cyclone could degenerate to a remnant low 
or trough before 120 h.

Tropical Storm Keli Discussion Number   9
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
500 AM HST Wed Jul 30 2025
 
While initially appearing a little more organized on satellite 
infrared imagery, Keli's convection has become more fragmented 
during the past few hours.  Subjective Dvorak estimates range from 
T2.0/30 kt to T3.0/45 kt and the initial intensity is still held at 
35 kt to represent a blend of these estimates.  First-light visible 
satellite data should hopefully reveal more useful information about 
the state of the low-level circulation.

Keli is moving rapidly westward at about 18 kt.  A combination of 
the ridging to the north and Iona to the southeast continue to the 
be the major steering features. The track guidance is closely 
clustered, and the NHC track forecast has been nudged to show a 
slightly faster forward motion.  Strong vertical wind shear, dry 
mid-level humdities, and marginal sea surface temperatures will all 
contribute to Keli's weakening and dissipation during the next day 
or so.  While the official intensity forecast still maintains 
dissipation at 36 h, numerical models suggest this could occur even 
sooner.
