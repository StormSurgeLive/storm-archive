BULLETIN
Hurricane Narda Advisory Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
200 AM MST Thu Sep 25 2025
 
...NARDA HOLDING STEADY WHILE CONTINUING WESTWARD...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM MST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.6N 114.8W
ABOUT 595 MI...960 KM SSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 280 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...980 MB...28.94 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Narda was located 
near latitude 15.6 North, longitude 114.8 West. Narda is moving 
toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h). A westward motion is expected 
to continue for the next day or so, followed by a gradual turn 
toward the west-northwest on Friday. A northwestward motion is 
forecast to begin this weekend, with a turn toward the 
north-northeast expected by early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts. Only slight weakening is forecast during the next day or 
so, followed by a brief period of re-strengthening on Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km). 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Surf: Swells generated by Narda are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico, and are expected to spread
to portions of Baja California Sur beginning later today, then reach
southern California over the weekend. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local or national meteorological office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM MST.

Hurricane Narda Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
200 AM MST Thu Sep 25 2025
 
Narda is holding steady this morning despite persistent 20 kt of 
northeasterly vertical wind shear. Recent satellite imagery shows a 
well-defined central dense overcast (CDO) with cloud tops near â€“90 
C, along with a curved band wrapping into the center from the 
southwest. The latest subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from 
TAFB and SAB are both T4.5/77 kt, while objective intensity 
estimates from UW-CIMSS range between 61 and 72 kt. Given the 
improved satellite presentation over the past few hours and these 
estimates, the initial intensity is held at 80 kt.

The initial motion is toward the west near 280/13 kt, and this 
forward speed is expected to remain steady through 48 h (Friday 
night). After that time, Narda should begin to slow down as it turns 
west-northwestward, then northwestward, and eventually northward 
through the weekend in response to a weakness developing in the 
subtropical ridge. There remains considerable spread in the guidance 
regarding the timing of this northward turn. The ECMWF shows a later 
turn near 72 h (Saturday night), while the consensus aids indicate 
an earlier turn, around 60 h (during the day Saturday). A later turn 
would keep Narda over warmer waters longer and allow it to maintain 
strength, whereas an earlier turn would move the system over cooler 
waters sooner and result in quicker weakening. The official track 
forecast is slightly to the left of the previous one after 60 h, 
reflecting a blend of the prior forecast and the consensus aids.

Only slight weakening is forecast during the next 12-24 h while the 
northeasterly shear persists. Between 24 and 48 h (tonight into 
Friday night), the shear is expected to ease to more moderate levels 
while Narda remains over warm waters with plenty of mid- to 
upper-level moisture, which should allow for a period of 
re-strengthening. This forecast lies near the middle to upper 
portion of the guidance envelope during that brief window (24â€“36 h). 
By around 60 h (Saturday), sea-surface temperatures along the track 
are forecast to fall below 26 C, and steady weakening is forecast 
thereafter. Narda is expected to fall below hurricane strength by 
the end of the weekend and become a post-tropical remnant low by day 
5 (Monday night). The latest intensity forecast is very similar to 
the previous one and remains near the middle to upper portion of the 
guidance envelope.
