BULLETIN
Hurricane Narda Advisory Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
800 AM PDT Thu Sep 25 2025
 
...NARDA COULD RESTRENGTHEN TO A CATEGORY 2 HURRICANE SOON...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM PDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.1N 116.6W
ABOUT 640 MI...1030 KM SW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 285 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...980 MB...28.94 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM PDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Narda was located
near latitude 16.1 North, longitude 116.6 West. Narda is moving
toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days.  A 
northwestward motion is forecast to commence over the weekend, 
followed by a turn toward the north-northeast early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some restrengthening is forecast and Narda could once 
again become a category 2 hurricane by Friday. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Narda are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico, and are expected to spread
to portions of Baja California Sur beginning later today, then reach
southern California over the weekend. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local or national meteorological office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM PDT.

      <title>Hurricane Narda Forecast Discussion Number 16</title>

Hurricane Narda Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
800 AM PDT Thu Sep 25 2025
 
Conventional satellite imagery and a recent AMSR2 microwave
overpass indicate that Narda's cloud pattern has changed little
during the past several hours.  The presentation consists of a 
well-developed curved band wrapping around the surface center 
from the southwest quadrant and a small -81C central dense overcast 
(CDO).  The subjective intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB are 77 
and 90 kt, respectively, and the UW-CIMSS objective technique 
estimates have been running just under 80 kt.  As a compromise, the 
initial intensity is held at 80 kt for this advisory.
 
Narda should remain over warm oceanic surface temperatures, while 
the persistent, modest northeasterly shear diminishes.  Therefore, 
some strengthening is forecast, and Narda could once again become a 
category 2 hurricane by Friday.  Afterward, Narda is expected to 
traverse progressively cooler SSTs while moving into more 
stable/drier thermodynamic environmental conditions.  Accordingly, 
weakening should occur through the end of the period.  The official 
intensity forecast is based on a blend of the IVCN and Decay-SHIPS 
statistical intensity guidance and has changed little from the 
previous forecast.
 
Narda is estimated to be moving toward the west-northwest, or
285/13 kt, and this general motion should continue through the 36
hour period.  Afterward, a cut-off mid-tropospheric low situated 
over central California is expected to dip southward toward 
northern Baja California by Friday night, forcing Narda to slow in 
forward speed and gradually turn northwestward.  By early next 
week, the cyclone should commence a north-northeastward turn in 
response to a major shortwave trough approaching the U.S. west 
coast offshore waters.  The NHC track forecast has been adjusted 
slightly to the left of the previous forecast and lies between the 
HCCA Corrected Consensus aid and the GDM FNv3 ensemble model.
