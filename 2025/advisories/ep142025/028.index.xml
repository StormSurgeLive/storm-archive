Tropical Storm Narda Advisory Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
800 AM PDT Sun Sep 28 2025
 
...NARDA CONTINUES WEAKENING OVER OPEN WATERS...
...LIKELY TO BECOME POST-TROPICAL LATER TODAY OR EARLY MONDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM PDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.7N 125.5W
ABOUT 1025 MI...1655 KM W OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 5 DEGREES AT 6 MPH...9 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM PDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Narda was 
located near latitude 19.7 North, longitude 125.5 West. Narda is 
moving toward the north near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this general motion 
is expected to continue for the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h)
with higher gusts. Continued weakening is expected, and Narda is
forecast to become a post-tropical low later today or early Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Narda are affecting portions of the coast
of west-central Mexico, the Baja California peninsula, and southern
California. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
or national meteorological office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM PDT.

Tropical Storm Narda Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
200 AM PDT Sun Sep 28 2025
 
Satellite imagery indicates that Narda’s convection has continued to 
diminish in coverage. The remaining deep convection is confined 
mainly to the southern semicircle, with cloud tops warming to near 
–65 C. A 0439 UTC METOP-B ASCAT pass showed peak surface winds of 
about 45 kt in the southeastern quadrant. Objective estimates from 
UW-CIMSS range from 47 to 57 kt. Based on a blend of these data, 
the initial intensity is set at 50 kt.

The cyclone is moving northward at about 360/4 kt, and this general 
motion is expected to continue through the remainder of the weekend. 
As Narda steadily loses convection and becomes increasingly shallow, 
it should turn back toward the northwest within the low-level flow 
before dissipating around midweek. The forecast track is very 
similar to the previous advisory and remains close to the 
multi-model consensus aids.

Narda has rapidly weakened over the past 24 hours due to cooler sea 
surface temperatures and the influence of a drier, more stable air 
mass. Additional steady weakening is forecast, and the system is 
expected to become post-tropical by Monday and dissipate by the 
middle of next week. The official intensity forecast is similar to 
the previous advisory and remains close to the consensus guidance.
