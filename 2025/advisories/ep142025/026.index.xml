WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM PDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Narda was
located near latitude 18.7 North, longitude 125.9 West. Narda is
moving toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h). A gradual 
turn toward the north is forecast by Sunday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional weakening is expected, and Narda is 
forecast to become a post-tropical low on Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.27 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Narda are affecting portions of the coast
of west-central Mexico and the Baja California peninsula. The swells
should reach southern California tonight. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local or national meteorological office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM PDT.

Tropical Storm Narda Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
800 PM PDT Sat Sep 27 2025
 
Narda has weakened this evening as it tracks over progressively 
cooler waters and into a drier environment. Subjective Dvorak 
intensity estimates from SAB and TAFB were T4.0/65 kt, with 
objective estimates from UW-CIMSS in the 54â€“64 kt range. Given the 
weakening trend shown on satellite since these estimates, the 
initial intensity is set at 60 kt, and Narda is now a tropical 
storm.
 
The initial motion is north-northwestward at about 335/4 kt. A
gradual turn toward the north is forecast tonight, with this motion
expected to persist through the remainder of the weekend as it
responds to a weakness in the subtropical ridge. Early next week,
Narda should become shallow and increasingly steered by the
low-level flow, leading to a turn back toward the northwest before
dissipation. The forecast track is very close to the previous
advisory and remains near the middle of the guidance envelope.

Continued weakening is expected as Narda moves farther north into 
progressively cooler waters and a drier, more stable environment. 
The system is forecast to become post-tropical within 36 hours and 
dissipate around day 5. The intensity forecast is very similar to 
the previous one and is close to the consensus aids.
