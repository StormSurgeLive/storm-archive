...NARDA GRADUALLY STRENGTHENING...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM CST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.7N 102.9W
ABOUT 245 MI...395 KM SSE OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 285 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM CST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Narda was
located near latitude 15.7 North, longitude 102.9 West. Narda is
moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). A turn
toward the west is expected later today, with this general motion
forecast to persist through the week.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Steady strengthening is forecast during the next
few days, and Narda is expected to become a hurricane on Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Tropical Storm Narda will lead to storm total rainfall
of 1 to 2 inches, with local amounts up to 4 inches, for coastal
sections of southern Mexico through tonight.  This brings a risk of
flash flooding, especially in areas of higher terrain.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Narda, please see the National Weather Service 
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at

      <title>Tropical Storm Narda Forecast Discussion Number 3</title>

Tropical Storm Narda Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
300 AM CST Mon Sep 22 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Narda has shown some improvement since 
the previous advisory, with a well-defined curved band developing 
north of the center.  Subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB 
were 3.0/45 kt and 2.5/35 kt, respectively, while objective 
estimates from UW-CIMSS ranged from 37 to 43 kt.  A blend of these 
data, along with the improved satellite appearance, supports raising 
the initial intensity to 40 kt for this advisory.

Narda is moving west-northwestward, or 290 degrees, at 10 kt.  A 
turn toward the west is expected later today as a mid-level ridge 
builds over northern Mexico.  This westward motion is then forecast 
to continue for the next several days as the cyclone is steered by a 
strengthening ridge to its north and northwest.  By late in the 
period, a mid-level low over southern California is expected to 
erode the eastern portion of the ridge, causing the cyclone to slow 
down and turn toward the northwest around day 5.  The official 
forecast track has been adjusted slightly south of the previous one 
to better align with the latest consensus aids, and lies between the 
consensus guidance and the prior forecast.

Narda will remain embedded within a moist air mass, over very warm 
waters, and in an environment of light to moderate 
east-northeasterly shear during the next couple of days.  These 
factors should support steady strengthening, and Narda is forecast 
to become a hurricane Tuesday.  By around 60 hours, easterly shear 
is expected to increase to 20–25 kt, which should slow the rate of 
intensification.  By late in the forecast period, although the shear 
is forecast to relax, cooler sea surface temperatures and mid-level 
humidities falling below 50 percent should result in some weakening. 
 The official intensity forecast remains near the upper end of the 
guidance envelope, close to the previous forecast, and most closely 
aligned with the SHIPS and HCCA aids.
