...NARDA WEAKENING OVER COOLER WATERS AS IT CONTINUES NORTHWARD...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM PDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.1N 125.6W
ABOUT 1045 MI...1680 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 360 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...997 MB...29.44 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM PDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Narda was
located near latitude 19.1 North, longitude 125.6 West. Narda is
moving toward the north near 5 mph (7 km/h), and this motion is
expected to persist into Monday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual weakening is expected, and Narda is forecast to become a 
post-tropical low by Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Narda are affecting portions of the coast
of west-central Mexico, the Baja California peninsula, and southern
California. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
or national meteorological office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM PDT.

Tropical Storm Narda Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
200 AM PDT Sun Sep 28 2025
 
Satellite imagery indicates that Narda’s convection has continued to 
diminish in coverage. The remaining deep convection is confined 
mainly to the southern semicircle, with cloud tops warming to near 
–65 C. A 0439 UTC METOP-B ASCAT pass showed peak surface winds of 
about 45 kt in the southeastern quadrant. Objective estimates from 
UW-CIMSS range from 47 to 57 kt. Based on a blend of these data, 
the initial intensity is set at 50 kt.

The cyclone is moving northward at about 360/4 kt, and this general 
motion is expected to continue through the remainder of the weekend. 
As Narda steadily loses convection and becomes increasingly shallow, 
it should turn back toward the northwest within the low-level flow 
before dissipating around midweek. The forecast track is very 
similar to the previous advisory and remains close to the 
multi-model consensus aids.

Narda has rapidly weakened over the past 24 hours due to cooler sea 
surface temperatures and the influence of a drier, more stable air 
mass. Additional steady weakening is forecast, and the system is 
expected to become post-tropical by Monday and dissipate by the 
middle of next week. The official intensity forecast is similar to 
the previous advisory and remains close to the consensus guidance.
