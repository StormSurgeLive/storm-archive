BULLETIN
Hurricane Narda Advisory Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
200 PM PDT Thu Sep 25 2025
 
...NARDA HEADING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD...
...SOME RESTRENGTHENING POSSIBLE THROUGH FRIDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM PDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.2N 118.0W
ABOUT 700 MI...1130 KM SW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 280 DEGREES AT 16 MPH...26 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...980 MB...28.94 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM PDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Narda was located
near latitude 16.2 North, longitude 118.0 West. Narda is moving
toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days.  A
northwestward motion is forecast to commence over the weekend,
followed by a turn toward the north-northeast to northeast early 
next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some restrengthening is forecast and Narda could once
again become a category 2 hurricane by Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Narda are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico, and are spreading to 
portions of Baja California Sur.  These swells should reach 
southern California over the weekend. Swells are likely to 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please 
consult products from your local or national meteorological office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM PDT.

Hurricane Narda Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
200 PM PDT Thu Sep 25 2025
 
A fortuitous 1329 UTC SAR RCM-1 NRCS image revealed a 15 nm 
symmetric eye beneath a small CDO and a deep convective curved 
band located over the eastern side of the cyclone.  This 
afternoon's METOP-B scatterometer pass indicated that the sustained 
tropical-storm-force winds have expanded over the eastern 
semi-circle of the cyclone.  The initial intensity is held at 80 kt 
and is based on the various subjective and objective intensity 
estimates.
 
There's still a small window of opportunity for Narda to strengthen
some during the next 12-24 hours while it remains over warm waters, 
and favorable upper-wind conditions.  Subsequently, Narda
could once again become a category 2 hurricane by Friday.
Over the weekend, Narda is expected to traverse progressively
cooler SSTs while moving into more stable/drier thermodynamic
environmental conditions.  Accordingly, weakening should occur 
after day 1 and continue through the end of the period.  The 
official intensity forecast is based on a blend of the IVCN and 
Decay-SHIPS statistical intensity guidance and specifies Narda 
becoming a post-tropical cyclone in 4 days.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be generally westward, 
or 280/14 kt.  By Friday night, a mid-latitude upper-level trough 
situated over central California is expected to dip southward toward 
northern Baja California, causing Narda to slow down and gradually 
turn toward the northwest temporarily.  By the 72-hour period, the 
cyclone should begin a north-northeast to northeast turn in 
response to an major shortwave trough approaching the U.S. west 
coast from the northeastern Pacific.  The NHC track forecast has 
been adjusted slightly to the left of the previous forecast and 
lies between the HCCA Corrected Consensus aid and the GDM FNv3 
ensemble model.
 
Narda's wind radii have been adjusted based on a 1631 UTC METOP-B
scatterometer pass.
