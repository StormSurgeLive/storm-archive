again become a category 2 hurricane by Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Narda are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico, and are spreading to 
portions of Baja California Sur.  These swells should reach 
southern California over the weekend. Swells are likely to 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please 
consult products from your local or national meteorological office.
