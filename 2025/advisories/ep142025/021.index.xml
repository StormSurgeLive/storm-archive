BULLETIN
Hurricane Narda Advisory Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
200 PM PDT Fri Sep 26 2025
 
...NARDA HOLDING STEADY WELL OUT TO SEA...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM PDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.1N 122.7W
ABOUT 920 MI...1485 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 285 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...979 MB...28.91 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM PDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Narda was located
near latitude 17.1 North, longitude 122.7 West. Narda is moving
toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h) and this motion is
expected to continue through tonight. A gradual turn to the north 
with a decrease in forward speed is expected over the weekend into 
early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Narda is expected to maintain its strength through today, 
but weakening is expected over the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Narda are affecting portions of the coast
of west-central Mexico and portions of the Baja California
peninsula. The swells should reach southern California over the
weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local or
national meteorological office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM PDT.

Hurricane Narda Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
200 PM PDT Fri Sep 26 2025
 
There has not been much change with Narda over the past several
hours.  The hurricane still has a central dense overcast pattern in
satellite images, but there is an asymmetry to the convection, with
a large area of deep convection colder than -70C over the southern
semicircle, with a somewhat smaller area of moderate convection
with -30 to -50C cloud tops over the northern semicircle.  Dry air 
appears to be infiltrating into the core via the weaker northwest 
quadrant.  The latest CI numbers from TAFB and SAB are a consensus 
T-4.5/77 kt and objective estimates from UW-CIMSS have been 
averaging in the 70-75 kt range over the past few hours.  Given the 
hurricane force ASCAT-B vectors noted in a recent 1750 UTC pass, 
the initial intensity is held at 80 kt.

Narda is moving west-northwestward, or 285 degrees at 11 kt.  
A subtropical ridge located to the northwest of Narda will cause 
the hurricane to slow down and gradually turn toward the north over 
the next 48 hours as a trough located to the north pulls it slowly 
northward.  The models are in fair agreement, and the NHC track 
forecast was shifted slightly east of the previous forecast.  This 
forecast lies well to the west of the latest HCCA corrected 
consensus and Google Deep Mind ensemble mean.

The hurricane is over 27C sea surface temperatures (SSTs) but is 
forecast to reach cooler water and cross the 26C isotherm in about 
12 hours.  Progressively cooler water and drier air should cause the 
system to fall below hurricane strength this weekend and decay to a 
post-tropical cyclone in a few days.  The latest NHC intensity 
forecast is near the middle of the guidance envelope, and is 
similar to the previous NHC prediction.
