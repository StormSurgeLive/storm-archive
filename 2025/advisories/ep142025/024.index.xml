...NARDA EXPECTED TO BEGIN WEAKENING SOON...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM PDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.0N 124.9W
ABOUT 1025 MI...1655 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...979 MB...28.91 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM PDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Narda was located
near latitude 18.0 North, longitude 124.9 West. Narda is moving
toward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A gradual turn
toward the north with a decrease in forward speed is forecast 
during the next day or so.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual weakening is expected to begin later today, and Narda
is forecast to weaken below hurricane strength tonight or early 
Sunday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Narda are affecting portions of the coast
of west-central Mexico and portions of the Baja California
peninsula. The swells should reach southern California later today 
or tonight. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf 
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local 
or national meteorological office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM PDT.

Hurricane Narda Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
800 AM PDT Sat Sep 27 2025
 
Narda is still maintaining its strength with the inner core
remaining intact and convective bands wrapping around it on the
south and east sides.  However, dry slots are increasing on the
northwest side of the circulation, an indication that weakening
could commence soon.  The initial intensity is again held at 80 kt,
near the upper end of the latest satellite intensity estimates.
 
The hurricane has just crossed the 26 C SST isotherm and will be 
tracking over progressively cooler waters during the next several 
days.  In addition, the global models show the system moving into a 
progressively drier air mass and stronger shear.  All of these 
factors support steady to rapid weakening, and Narda should fall 
below hurricane strength tonight or early Sunday and decay to a 
post-tropical low within a couple of days.  The NHC intensity 
forecast is similar to the previous one and in line with the 
majority of the guidance.
 
As expected, Narda is slowing down and gradually turning to the
right.  This trend should continue while the ridge to the north of
the cyclone breaks down due to a large-scale trough moving across
the north Pacific.  Narda is forecast turn northward in a day or
so, and continue in that general direction until it dissipates
around the middle of next week.  No significant changes were made to
the previous track forecast.
