      <title>Hurricane Narda Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Hurricane Narda Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
200 AM MST Wed Sep 24 2025
 
The low-level center of Narda has been mostly obscured by a central 
dense overcast with cloud-top temperatures of -70 to -85C, following 
a brief eye feature that developed near the time of the previous 
advisory package.  Since then, the cyclone has begun to feel the 
effects of increasing vertical wind shear.  UW-CIMSS now analyzes 22 
kt of east-northeasterly shear, and satellite imagery shows 
increasing outflow restriction in the eastern semicircle.  
Subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB were both 5.0/90 kt, 
while objective estimates from UW-CIMSS ranged from 84 to 101 kt. 
Taking a blend of these data, the initial intensity for this 
advisory has been raised to 90 kt.

Narda is estimated to be moving just south of due west, or 265 
degrees, at 11 kt.  A general westward motion is expected to 
continue during the next couple of days as the cyclone is steered by 
a strengthening subtropical ridge to its north and northwest.  A 
turn toward the northwest is expected by day 3 as a mid-level low 
over southern California erodes the eastern portion of the 
subtropical ridge.  A more northward motion with a decrease in 
forward speed is forecast by days 4 and 5 as the cyclone moves into 
the weakness in the ridge created by the mid-level low.  The 
official forecast track is very similar to the previous advisory for 
the next couple of days, then was shifted slightly to the left 
beyond 48 hours to better align with trends in the consensus 
guidance.

Narda will remain embedded within a moist air mass and over very 
warm waters during the next couple of days.  Despite these favorable 
conditions for intensification, east-northeasterly shear is forecast 
to increase to near 30 kt later today and tonight, which is expected 
to disrupt the cyclone enough to cause some weakening. Narda should 
emerge from the hostile shear environment on Thursday while still 
over warm waters and surrounded by moist mid-level air. This should 
allow for a period of re-intensification, with Narda forecast to 
peak at major hurricane strength around day 3.  Sea surface 
temperatures will decrease rather abruptly beyond day 3, with Narda 
crossing the 26C isotherm prior to day 4 while also moving into a 
progressively drier and more stable environment.  As a result, rapid 
weakening is forecast by days 4 and 5, with Narda expected to lose 
deep convection and become a post-tropical low by day 5.  The 
official intensity forecast is similar to the previous prediction 
and most closely aligned with a blend of the HCCA and FSSE intensity 
aids.
