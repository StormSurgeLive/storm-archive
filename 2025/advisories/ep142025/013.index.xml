BULLETIN
Hurricane Narda Advisory Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
200 PM MST Wed Sep 24 2025
 
...NARDA A LITTLE WEAKER BUT FORECAST TO RESTRENGTHEN ON FRIDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM MST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.1N 112.3W
ABOUT 560 MI...905 KM SSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...100 MPH...155 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 265 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...976 MB...28.82 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Narda was located
near latitude 15.1 North, longitude 112.3 West. Narda is moving
toward the west near 10 mph (17 km/h). This general motion is
expected to continue during the next day or two, followed by a
gradual turn toward the west-northwest Thursday night and Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 100 mph (155 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional weakening is forecast during the next
24 hours, followed by some restrengthening Thursday night and
Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 976 mb (28.82 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Surf: Swells generated by Narda are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico, and are expected to spread
to portions of Baja California Sur late this week through the
weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local or
national meteorological office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM MST.

      <title>Hurricane Narda Forecast Discussion Number 13</title>

Hurricane Narda Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
200 PM MST Wed Sep 24 2025
 
Narda has been feeling the impact of 20-25 kt northeasterly wind
shear today.  As a result, the convective structure has degraded
somewhat over the past 6-12 hours.  Although recent GPMI and ASCAT
fixes indicate that the center is still well underneath the central
dense overcast, the area of convection with cloud tops colder than
-70C has shrunk significantly and the convection has become slightly
more asymmetric.  The latest subjective Dvorak estimates are
a consensus T-5.0/90 kt from TAFB and SAB.  However, the objective
intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS have decreased significantly over
the past 6-12 hours, and have been mostly in the 65-80 kt range.
Taking into account both the subjective and objective intensity
estimates, the initial intensity is nudged downward slightly to 85
kt for this advisory.
 
Recent fixes indicate that Narda is moving slightly slower toward 
the west than earlier, with the current motion estimated at 265/9 
kt.  A general westward motion will continue over the next 24-36 h, 
followed by a gradual turn to the west-northwest as the cyclone is 
steered by a mid-level ridge to its north.  A mid-level low over 
central California is expected to sink southward toward northern 
Baja California by Friday night, which will erode the ridge and 
induce a sharp northward turn by Saturday, along with a decrease in 
forward speed.  The official forecast is slightly slower than the 
previous NHC advisory during the first 2 days, mainly due to the 
initial position being slightly farther east.  After that time, the 
latest forecast is very near the previous official forecast.  The 
official forecast is closest to the latest TVCE consensus through 60 
h, and then lies in between the TVCE and HCCA from days 3-5.
 
The aforementioned strong northeasterly vertical wind shear is
expected to continue through the next 12-24 h, then decrease to
moderate magnitudes by Thursday afternoon while Narda remains over
warm sea-surface temperatures and within a moist environment.  The
NHC forecast will therefore call for continued weakening through
the next 24 h, followed by some restrengthening on Friday.  On
Saturday, Narda is forecast to move into cooler waters and cross the
26C sea-surface temperature isotherm while reaching a somewhat drier
environment.  The NHC forecast shows rapid weakening over the
weekend as Narda moves over progressively cooler waters.  Overall,
the latest NHC intensity forecast is slightly lower than the
previous prediction.
 
It should be noted that there is a healthy amount of track model
spread beyond Day 3.  These track differences will determine
what water temperatures Narda encounters in 3-5 days, which
will affect the intensity forecast (how quickly Narda weakens during
that time period).
