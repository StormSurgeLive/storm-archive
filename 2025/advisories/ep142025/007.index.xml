      <title>Tropical Storm Narda Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Narda Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
900 PM CST Mon Sep 22 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Narda has continued to improve since 
the previous advisory, with deep convection featuring cloud tops 
colder than -80C bursting over the low-level center.  A recent 0034 
UTC WSFM microwave image confirms the improved organization, showing 
Narda beginning to develop an inner-core structure. Subjective 
Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB were both 3.5/55 kt, while 
objective estimates from UW-CIMSS ranged from 44 to 60 kt.  A blend 
of these data, along with the improved satellite appearance, 
supports raising the initial intensity to 55 kt for this advisory.

Narda is moving due west, or 270 degrees, at 11 kt. This motion is 
expected to continue for the next several days as the cyclone is 
steered by a strengthening subtropical ridge to its north and 
northwest.  By late in the period, a mid-level low over southern 
California is forecast to erode the eastern portion of the ridge, 
causing the cyclone to slow down and turn northwestward around day 
5.  The official forecast track has been adjusted slightly south of 
the previous prediction during the next couple of days to account 
for the westward motion that has now begun, but it remains very 
close to the prior forecast from day 3 onward.  The track forecast 
follows a blend of the HCCA, TVCE, and FSSE consensus aids, as well 
as the Google DeepMind/NOAA Eagle AI guidance.

Narda will remain embedded within a moist air mass, over very warm 
waters, and in an environment of light to moderate easterly shear 
during the next couple of days.  These factors should support steady 
strengthening. The latest GFS- and ECMWF-based SHIPS guidance 
indicates about a 50 percent probability of a 25-kt increase within 
24 hours, and the intensity forecast reflects this. Narda is 
expected to become a hurricane later tonight or early Tuesday and 
could approach major hurricane status within a couple of days.  By 
late in the forecast period, however, Narda will move into an 
environment with mid-level humidity below 50 percent and over waters 
cooler than 26C, which should result in steady to rapid weakening by 
day 5. The official intensity forecast remains near the upper end of 
the guidance envelope and is most closely aligned with the SHIPS and 
HCCA aids.
