      <title>Tropical Storm Narda Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Tropical Storm Narda Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
200 AM MST Tue Sep 23 2025
 
Narda continues to strengthen well off the coast of southwestern 
Mexico this evening, with satellite imagery showing a central dense 
overcast and very cold cloud tops, colder than -80C, over the 
low-level center.  A 0248 UTC GPM microwave pass and a 0350 UTC 
Metop-C ASCAT pass were helpful in estimating the center location, 
determining the motion, and assessing the structure of the cyclone.  
Subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB were 4.0/65 kt and 
3.5/55 kt, respectively, while objective estimates from UW-CIMSS 
ranged from 54 to 60 kt.  A blend of these data, along with the 
improved satellite presentation, supports raising the initial 
intensity to 60 kt for this advisory.

Narda is now estimated to be moving just south of due west, or 265 
degrees, at 11 kt.  A general westward motion is expected to 
continue during the next few days as the cyclone is steered by a 
strengthening subtropical ridge to its north and northwest.  A turn 
toward the northwest and a decrease in forward speed are expected by 
days 4 and 5 as a mid-level low over southern California erodes the 
eastern portion of the subtropical ridge.  The official forecast 
track has been adjusted slightly to the left of the previous 
forecast during the next couple of days to account for the 
south-of-due-west motion, and then slightly to the right of the 
prior forecast by days 4 and 5 due to an eastward shift in the 
guidance.  The track forecast follows a blend of the HCCA, TVCE, and 
FSSE consensus aids, as well as the Google DeepMind/NOAA Eagle AI 
guidance.

Narda will remain embedded within a moist air mass, over very warm 
waters, and in an environment of light to moderate easterly shear 
during the next day or so.  These factors should support steady 
strengthening.  The latest GFS- and ECMWF-based SHIPS guidance 
indicates about a 30 to 40 percent probability of a 25-kt increase 
within 24 hours, and the intensity forecast reflects this, with 
Narda expected to become a hurricane soon.  Little change in 
strength is forecast between 36 and 60 hours as easterly shear 
increases to around 20–25 kt, which may disrupt the cyclone enough 
to prevent further intensification despite otherwise favorable 
conditions.  Beyond 60 hours, shear is expected to decrease, which 
may allow Narda to approach major hurricane status before moving 
over cooler waters and into a drier mid-level environment by day 5. 
The official intensity forecast remains near the upper end of the 
guidance envelope and is most closely aligned with the HCCA aid.
