Hurricane Narda Advisory Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
200 AM PDT Sat Sep 27 2025
 
...NARDA HOLDING STEADY BUT GRADUAL WEAKENING EXPECTED TO BEGIN
LATER TODAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM PDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.6N 124.7W
ABOUT 1025 MI...1650 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...979 MB...28.91 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM PDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Narda was located 
near latitude 17.6 North, longitude 124.7 West. Narda is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). A gradual turn
toward the north with a decrease in forward speed is forecast later 
today through the rest of the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Gradual weakening is expected to begin later today, and Narda 
is forecast to weaken below hurricane strength by late Sunday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Narda are affecting portions of the coast
of west-central Mexico and portions of the Baja California
peninsula. The swells should reach southern California over the
weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local or
national meteorological office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM PDT.

Hurricane Narda Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
200 AM PDT Sat Sep 27 2025

Satellite imagery indicates that Narda’s overall cloud pattern has 
changed little during the past several hours, although some slight 
cloud-top warming has been noted more recently. A well-defined 
curved band continues to wrap into the central dense overcast (CDO), 
which contains cloud-top temperatures as cold as –75 C. Subjective 
Dvorak Current Intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB are both 4.5/77 
kt, while peak objective estimates from UW-CIMSS have been holding 
just under 80 kt. Based on these data, the initial intensity is held 
at 80 kt for this advisory.
 
Narda is moving west-northwestward at 290/10 kt, and this general 
motion is expected to persist this morning. A gradual turn toward 
the north, accompanied by a decrease in forward speed, is forecast 
later today and continue through the weekend. By early next week, as 
Narda remains over cooler waters and moves into a drier environment, 
it is expected to become increasingly influenced by low-level flow, 
which should result in a turn back toward the northwest by day 5. 
The forecast track is very similar to the previous advisory and 
remains close to the multi-model consensus aids.
 
Narda is now over SSTs below 26 C, and is forecast to continue 
moving over progressively cooler waters and into a drier and more 
stable air mass through the weekend. These conditions should induce 
a weakening trend beginning later this morning and continuing 
through the weekend. Narda is expected to fall below hurricane 
strength by late Sunday, then degenerate into a post-tropical 
remnant low early next week. The official intensity forecast is very 
similar to the previous one and lies near the higher end of the 
guidance envelope through much of the forecast period.
