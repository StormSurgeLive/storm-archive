BULLETIN
Hurricane Narda Advisory Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
200 AM PDT Fri Sep 26 2025
 
...NARDA HOLDING STEADY WITH SLIGHT STRENGTHENING POSSIBLE TODAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM PDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.4N 120.7W
ABOUT 835 MI...1340 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 275 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...980 MB...28.94 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM PDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Narda was located 
near latitude 16.4 North, longitude 120.7 West. Narda is moving 
toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this general motion is 
expected to continue into tonight. A northwestward motion is 
forecast to begin over the weekend, followed by a turn toward the 
north-northeast to northeast early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Some slight strengthening is possible, and Narda could 
briefly regain Category 2 hurricane strength by tonight. Thereafter, 
steady weakening is expected.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Narda are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico, and are spreading to
portions of Baja California Sur. These swells should reach southern
California over the weekend. Swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local or national meteorological office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM PDT.

Hurricane Narda Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
800 PM PDT Thu Sep 25 2025
 
Narda is holding steady this evening despite moderate northeasterly 
vertical wind shear of about 15-20 kt. Satellite imagery shows a 
well-defined central dense overcast (CDO) with cloud tops to near 
-90 C and a convective band wrapping into the center from the south. 
The latest subjective Dvorak Current Intensity estimates are 5.0/90 
kt from SAB and 4.5/77 kt from TAFB, while objective estimates from 
UW-CIMSS range between 65 and 75 kt. Based on a blend of these data 
and the satellite presentation, the initial intensity is held at 80 
kt for this advisory.

The initial motion is toward the west near 280/14 kt, steered by a 
subtropical ridge to its north. This forward speed is expected to 
hold steady through early Saturday. After that time, Narda should 
begin to slow down as it turns west-northwestward, then 
northwestward, and eventually north-northeastward through the 
weekend as a weakness develops in the ridge in response to an 
upper-level low over California. Beyond 48 h, the forecast track has 
been nudged slightly to the left of the previous advisory and lies 
close to the multi-model consensus aids.

Some slight strengthening is still possible during the next 12–24 h 
while the shear remains moderate and the system stays over warm sea 
surface temperatures in a moist mid- to upper-level environment. By 
36–48 h, Narda will be moving over cooler waters and into an 
increasingly drier mid-level environment with strengthening 
southwesterly shear, which should induce a weakening trend. The 
system is forecast to fall below hurricane strength by early Sunday 
and become a post-tropical remnant low by day 5. The official 
intensity forecast is close to the previous one and remains near the 
higher end of the guidance envelope.
