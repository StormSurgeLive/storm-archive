Hurricane Narda Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
200 PM MST Tue Sep 23 2025
 
After steadily strengthening over the past day or so, Narda's 
intensity appears to have leveled off for now.  Overall, the cloud 
pattern of the hurricane has not changed much during the past 
several hours and it continues to maintain a central dense overcast 
feature with outer rainbands surrounding it.  The latest satellite 
intensity estimates have generally held steady today and support 
maintaining the initial wind speed at 75 kt.  An ASCAT-C pass from a 
few hours ago confirmed that Narda is a small hurricane with its 
tropical-storm-force winds estimated to only extend up to 80 n mi 
from the center.
 
The hurricane has been losing latitude today, and the initial motion 
is now estimated to be 260/11 kt.  This south of due west motion is 
caused by a strong subtropical ridge situated to Narda's 
north-northwest, and it should keep Narda on a general westward path 
for the next few days.  After that time, the models show a weakness 
developing in the ridge associated with a cut off low moving 
southward over southern California, which should cause Narda to slow 
down and turn northwestward over the weekend.  The NHC track 
forecast is a little south of the previous one, based mostly on 
the more southward initial position and motion.
 
Narda is likely to continue to strengthen through tonight.  
However, the latest models show a notable increase in easterly 
shear over the hurricane on Wednesday and Thursday, and that could 
cause the intensity to level off.  The shear is expected to lessen 
late Thursday and Friday, allowing an opportunity for Narda 
to strengthen again before it moves over cool waters and into a 
stable air mass this weekend.  The NHC intensity forecast is a 
little lower than the previous one in the short term, but still lies 
near the high end of the guidance.  Little change was made to the 
previous long-term intensity forecast.
