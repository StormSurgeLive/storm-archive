BULLETIN
Hurricane Narda Advisory Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
800 AM PDT Fri Sep 26 2025
 
...NARDA HOLDING STEADY IN STRENGTH WELL OUT TO SEA...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM PDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.9N 121.9W
ABOUT 880 MI...1420 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 285 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...980 MB...28.94 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM PDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Narda was located
near latitude 16.9 North, longitude 121.9 West. Narda is moving
toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h) and this motion is
expected to continue for about another day. A significant slow 
down and turn to the north and northeast is forecast this weekend 
and early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts. Narda is expected to maintain its strength today, but 
weakening is expected over the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Narda are affecting portions of the coast 
of southwestern and west-central Mexico, and portions of Baja 
California Sur. These swells should reach southern California over 
the weekend. Swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and 
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local or 
national meteorological office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM PDT.

Hurricane Narda Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
200 AM PDT Fri Sep 26 2025
 
Narda has changed little in organization overnight. A 0213 UTC GMI 
microwave pass and a coincident SAR RCM-3 NRCS pass revealed a 
symmetric eye about 15 n mi wide embedded within the deep 
convection, with intermittent bursts producing cloud tops to near 
-90 C near and south of the low-level circulation center. A 0520 UTC 
METOP-B ASCAT pass depicted a wind field structure similar to that 
shown in recent passes over the past 24 h. The latest subjective 
Dvorak Current Intensity estimates from SAB and TAFB are both 4.5/77 
kt, while objective estimates from UW-CIMSS are in the 58â€“72 kt 
range. Based on these data and the satellite presentation, the 
initial intensity is held at 80 kt for this advisory.

The initial motion is toward the west at 275/13 kt, steered by a 
subtropical ridge to its north. This motion is expected to continue 
through early Saturday. After that time, Narda should begin to slow 
down as it turns west-northwestward, then northwestward, and 
eventually north-northeastward through the weekend as a weakness 
develops in the ridge in response to an upper-level low over 
California. The forecast track is very similar to the previous NHC 
advisory and lies close to the multi-model consensus aids.
 
Some slight strengthening can't be ruled out through the day today 
while the moderate shear potentially eases and the system remains 
over warm sea surface temperatures and within a moist mid- to 
upper-level environment. Over the weekend, Narda will be moving over 
cooler waters and into an increasingly drier mid-level environment, 
which should induce a weakening trend. The system is forecast to 
fall below hurricane strength by early Sunday and become a 
post-tropical remnant low by day 4. The official intensity forecast 
is close to the previous one and remains near the higher end of the 
guidance envelope.
