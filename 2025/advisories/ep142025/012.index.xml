BULLETIN
Hurricane Narda Advisory Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
800 AM MST Wed Sep 24 2025
 
...NARDA HOLDING STEADY FOR NOW...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM MST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.1N 111.7W
ABOUT 550 MI...885 KM SSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...105 MPH...165 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 265 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...972 MB...28.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Narda was located
near latitude 15.1 North, longitude 111.7 West. Narda is moving
toward the west near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this general motion is
expected to continue during the next couple of days.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some slight weakening is expected through tonight, followed
by some restrengthening Thursday night and Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 972 mb (28.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Surf: Swells generated by Narda are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico, and are expected to spread
to portions of Baja California Sur late this week through the
weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local or
national meteorological office.
 
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

      <title>Hurricane Narda Forecast Discussion Number 12</title>

Hurricane Narda Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142025
800 AM MST Wed Sep 24 2025

The recent convective structure of Narda is characterized by a CDO 
containing cold cloud tops colder than -80C, with a curved band also 
noted to the west of the CDO.  SHIPS guidance and UW-CIMSS are 
currently analyzing 20-25 kt of east-northeasterly shear.  This 
shear has prevented any strengthening over the past 6 hours.  In 
fact, the structure appears somewhat less impressive on a recent 
24/1121 UTC F18 SSMIS microwave overpass.  Given that the latest 
TAFB and SAB fixes are both T5.0/90 kt, the 90-kt intensity from the 
previous NHC advisory will be held for this advisory.

Narda's motion hasn't changed, still estimated to be westward, or 
265 degrees at 11 kt.  A general westward motion will continue over 
the next 36 h, followed by a gradual turn to the west-northwest as 
the cyclone is steered by a mid-level ridge to its north.  A 
mid-level low over central California is likely to sink southward 
toward northern Baja California by Friday night, which will act to 
erode the ridge.  This should cause Narda to turn rather sharply 
toward the north by Saturday, along with a decrease in forward 
speed.  The official forecast is similar to the previous advisory 
for the first couple of days, but lies a bit to the left, or west, 
of the previous NHC advisory at days 3-5.  The official forecast is 
closest to the TVCE and GFEX during that period, which lie in 
between the eastern HCCA solution and the western Google Deep Mind 
solution.

The aforementioned strong northeasterly vertical wind shear is 
expected to continue through tonight, then decrease to moderate 
magnitudes by Thursday while Narda remains over warm sea-surface 
temperatures and within a moist environment.  The NHC forecast will 
continue to call for some weakening through tonight, followed by 
some restrengthening by Thursday night and into Friday.  Narda is 
forecast to move into cooler waters and cross the 26C sea-surface 
temperature isotherm by Saturday while reaching a somewhat drier 
environment around the same time.  The NHC forecast shows rapid 
weakening during that time.

It should be noted that there is a healthy amount of model spread 
beyond Day 3 as to how quickly Narda gains latitude during the 
3-5 day period.  These track differences could also affect the 
intensity forecast (how quickly Narda weakens during that time 
period).
