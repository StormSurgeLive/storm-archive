Tropical Storm Gil Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072025
500 PM HST Sat Aug 02 2025
 
Gil is now over waters of about 24 degrees Celsius, and its deep
convection is gradually losing organization and areal coverage.
Based on Dvorak estimates of T3.0/4.0 from TAFB and T3.5/3.5 from
SAB, the intensity is lowered to 55 kt.  Sea surface temperatures
ahead of Gil will be getting colder by another degree or two, and
the storm will be running into a region of moderate to strong
southwesterly shear in 24-48 hours.  Gil is likely to lose
organized convection, and thus become post-tropical, in about 24
hours, with continued weakening thereafter.
 
The storm continues to move quickly west-northwestward at 295/18
kt.  The ridge north of Gil is forecast to weaken during the next
couple of days, which should cause a gradual decrease in forward
speed.  A turn toward the west is forecast in about 48 hours as the
remnant low is steered by the low-level flow.  The NHC track
forecast is slightly south of the previous forecast, leaning toward
the latest HCCA and AI guidance.  Global models are in good
agreement that the remnant low will open up into a trough by day 4
(Wednesday) northeast of the Hawaiian Islands.
