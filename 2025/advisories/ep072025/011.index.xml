Tropical Storm Gil Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072025
1100 AM HST Sat Aug 02 2025

Gil is holding steady this afternoon as it traverses cool waters. 
Geostationary satellite imagery indicates that convection remains 
confined to the northeast semicircle of the circulation, with the 
southwestern portion largely devoid of deep convection. Objective 
and subjective satellite intensity estimates, as well as a recent 
ASCAT pass, indicate that the intensity has not changed much. Based 
on this data, the initial intensity of Gil remains at 60 kt. 

The tropical storm continues to move west-northwestward at about 
295/17 under the influence of a mid-level ridge to the north, and 
this general motion is expected to continue for the next day or so. 
Thereafter, as Gil continues to weaken and is increasingly steered 
by the low-level flow, a gradual turn toward the west is expected. 
The track forecast is very close to the previous official forecast 
and represents a blend of the tightly clustered consensus aids.

Gil is forecast to weaken as it moves over increasingly cooler 
waters for the next several days. Global models indicate that deep 
convection will largely diminish after about 36 h, at which time the 
cyclone will become post-tropical. After about 48 h, environmental 
conditions are forecast to become increasingly detrimental, with 
shear increasing and mid-level moisture decreasing. The cyclone is 
expected to dissipate after 96 h. The new forecast is similar to 
both the prior forecast and the intensity consensus aids.
