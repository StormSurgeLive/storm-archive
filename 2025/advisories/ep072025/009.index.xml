Hurricane Gil Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072025
1100 PM HST Fri Aug 01 2025
 
Gil has likely reached its peak intensity. Satellite imagery shows 
convection in the northwestern quadrant has mostly eroded, likely 
due to dry air entrainment and the system now moving over marginal 
sea surface temperatures below 26 degrees C. However, the cyclone 
still displays impressive banding features wrapping around its 
southern and eastern sides. Subjective Dvorak current intensity 
estimates from TAFB and SAB remain steady at 4.0/65 kt, consistent 
with objective satellite estimates ranging from 50 to 70 kt. Based 
on these data, the initial intensity is held at 65 kt.

The initial motion is estimated at 300/17 kt, steered by a strong 
mid-level ridge to its north. This general motion is expected to 
continue into Sunday, followed by a gradual turn toward the west as 
the cyclone weakens and becomes increasingly steered by the 
low-level flow. The new NHC track forecast is very similar to the 
previous one and remains close to the consensus aids.

Gil is expected to begin weakening through the day Saturday as it 
continues moving over progressively cooler waters and encounters 
increasingly dry and stable mid-level air. These unfavorable 
conditions should lead to a gradual erosion of the cyclone’s 
convective structure. Simulated satellite imagery from global models 
suggests that Gil will lose its deep convection and become 
post-tropical by Sunday, or in about 36 hours. The system is then 
forecast to gradually spin down and dissipate by day 5, in line with 
the majority of the global model guidance.
