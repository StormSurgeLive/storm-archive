Post-Tropical Cyclone Gil Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072025
500 AM HST Sun Aug 03 2025
 
Cool waters combined with a drier and more stable environment have 
taken their toll on Gil. The system has been devoid of deep 
convection overnight, with only an exposed swirl of low- to 
mid-level clouds remaining. The initial intensity is lowered to 45 
kt, based on a blend of the latest subjective Dvorak estimates from 
TAFB and SAB and objective estimates from UW-CIMSS. Given the cool 
waters, dry and stable air, and strengthening west-southwesterly 
shear, no new organized convection is expected. Therefore, this will 
be the final advisory on the system as it has become post-tropical. 
Gil is expected to dissipate around midweek as it opens into a 
trough northeast of the Hawaiian Islands.

The initial motion is estimated at 285/16 kt. The system is being 
steered by a low- to mid-level ridge to its north, and this general 
motion is expected to continue into tonight. A gradual decrease in 
forward speed is anticipated by Monday, followed by a turn toward 
the west as the shallow remnant low becomes steered by the low-level 
flow. The updated track forecast remains close to the previous 
advisory and continues to follow the tightly clustered guidance 
envelope.
 
For additional information on the post-tropical low please see High
Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php
