Tropical Storm Gil Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072025
1100 AM HST Fri Aug 01 2025
 
Gil has slightly strengthened over the past few hours.  A 
scatterometer pass from 1710 UTC showed an area of near 50 kt 
vectors in the northeastern quadrant of the storm.  More recent 
geostationary satellite data shows fragmented convection, with a 
curved band wrapping around the southern semicircle. The imagery 
suggests Gil is experiencing a dry air intrusion wrapping around the 
storm's core.  Based on the ASCAT data (accounting for instrument 
undersampling) and a blend of the latest subjective Dvorak estimates 
the initial intensity is increased slightly to 60 kt.

The initial motion is 290/15 kt.  The track forecast reasoning 
remains unchanged.  Gil should continue a west-northwestward motion 
along the southern periphery of a mid-level ridge for the next few 
days.  As the storm weakens, a turn to the west is forecast around 
day 4.  The NHC track prediction is essentially unchanged from the 
previous cycle's forecast.
 
Gil is currently crossing a cooling gradient of the sea surface 
temperatures and nearing the 26 degree Celsius isotherm.  Therefore, 
the storm's chances for any significant strengthening are quickly 
diminishing.  Beyond 12 hours, global models predict increasing 
shear and a dry and stable airmass will steadily weaken the storm 
for the remainder of the forecast period.  The latest official 
intensity forecast lies near the various consensus aids.  Gil is 
still expected to become a post-tropical cyclone by the end of 
weekend.
