Tropical Storm Gil Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072025
500 AM HST Fri Aug 01 2025
 
Deep convection in the storm continues to pulse, though it is mostly 
concentrated in the southern and eastern quadrants.  An AMSR2 pass 
from 0927 UTC showed a large curved band wrapping around much of the 
circulation.  Subjective satellite estimates from TAFB and SAB both 
gave Gil a T3.5/55 kt. The initial intensity is held at 55 kt for 
this cycle based on these estimates.  An ASCAT pass over the storm 
is expected later today which should help update the wind radii 
estimates.

Gil is moving west-northwestward at about 14 kt along the southern 
side of a subtropical ridge to its north.  This general motion 
should continue for the next few days.  By the end of the forecast 
period, the weakened storm should turn more westward in the 
low-level flow.  Minor adjustments have been made to the latest 
track forecast which lies slightly south of the previous prediction.

Gil only has a short window of about 12 h to strengthen.  
Thereafter, the storm is expected to cross over cooler sea surface 
temperatures.  By day 2, the vertical wind shear is expected to 
increase accompanied by falling mid-level humidities. These factors 
will gradually weaken the cyclone, which is now expected to become 
post-tropical by 60 h.  The latest NHC intensity forecast still 
expects Gil to strengthen into a hurricane later today, however this 
prediction lies on the high end of the model guidance.
