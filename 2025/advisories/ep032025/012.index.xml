Post-Tropical Cyclone Barbara Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
800 PM MST Tue Jun 10 2025
 
Earlier today, the mid-level circulation of Barbara was sheared off 
to the southwest.  As a result, all that remains of the system is a 
weak low-level swirl as evidenced by an AMSR-E microwave image from 
a few hours ago.  The system lacks sufficient deep convection to 
qualify as a tropical cyclone, and this will be the last advisory 
on Barbara.  Assuming a steady spin down of the circulation, the 
current intensity is set at 25 kt.

The remnant low is drifting northward at about 010/4 kt.  This 
general motion should continue into Wednesday and until the system 
dissipates.

For additional information on the remnant low please see High Seas
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 AM MST Wed Jun 11 2025
 
Drier mid-level air and stable atmospheric conditions have taken
their toll on Cosme. The system has been devoid of deep convection
for several hours and is expected to become a remnant low later this
morning. Dvorak intensity estimates continue to decrease
accordingly. A 11/0442 UTC ASCAT pass showed winds in the 35-40 kt
range in the southern semicircle. Assuming additional weakening
after that time, the initial intensity is set at 35 kt.  After
transitioning to a remnant low later this morning, Cosme is expected
to dissipate by late Thursday or Friday.
 
The storm is now moving slowly toward the northeast. A gradual turn
to the north-northeast with some acceleration is expected later
today, followed by a turn to the north on Thursday. Only a slight
eastward adjustment was made to the previous NHC track forecast,
with no significant changes to the intensity forecast.
