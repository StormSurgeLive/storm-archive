Tropical Storm Barbara Advisory Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
200 AM MST Tue Jun 10 2025
 
...BARBARA CONTINUES TO WEAKEN OFFSHORE OF WEST-CENTRAL MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM MST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.1N 108.1W
ABOUT 180 MI...290 KM WSW OF CABO CORRIENTES MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Barbara was
located near latitude 19.1 North, longitude 108.1 West. Barbara is
moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h) and this general 
motion is expected to continue for the next day or so.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Continued weakening is forecast, and Barbara is 
expected to dissipate by Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Barbara will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as the southernmost
portions of Baja California through today. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 800 AM MST.

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
200 AM MST Tue Jun 10 2025

Barbara has lost a significant portion of its convection over the 
past 12 hours or so.  The latest current intensity estimates from 
TAFB and SAB are still in the 55-65 kt range, but the latest 
objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS are in the 45-55 kt 
range.  Based on the degraded convective appearance on geostationary 
satellite imagery and the latest intensity estimates, the initial 
intensity is set to 50 kt.

Barbara has been moving toward the northwest a little slower than 
before, or 310/7 kt.  Barbara is forecast to continue moving 
generally toward the northwest as it is steered by weak ridging to 
its north and Tropical Storm Cosme, located to its southwest.  Only 
very minor adjustments have been made to the previous NHC track 
forecast, which lies near the various consensus models.

The storm already has crossed the 26C isotherm and will continue 
moving over progressively colder water over the next day.  The cold 
water will cause Barbara to continue weakening.  The NHC intensity 
forecast shows a slightly faster rate of weakening than the previous 
official forecast, and is near the latest intensity model consensus. 
 The GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite products both show the 
cyclone losing its convection entirely by about 24 hours, with 
dissipation in 36 hours.  The NHC forecast follows the scenario 
depicted by those models.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Cosme was
located near latitude 15.3 North, longitude 114.5 West. Cosme is
moving toward the west-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h). A turn toward 
the north is expected later this morning, followed by a faster 
north-northeast motion late today through Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected during the next 
12 hours before weakening begins late today or tonight. Cosme is 
forecast to become a post-tropical remnant low on Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 993 mb (29.33 inches).

      <title>Tropical Storm Cosme Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 AM MST Tue Jun 10 2025

The convective appearance of Cosme has changed little since the 
previous advisory.  The latest subjective Dvorak estimates from 
TAFB and SAB range from 55-65 kt, and the latest objective 
intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS range from 54-59 kt.  The initial 
intensity is held at 60 kt for this advisory, based on a blend of 
the intensity estimates.

Cosme continues to move very slowly toward the northwest, with 
motion estimated at 300/4 kt. A slow motion, perhaps more toward 
the north, should continue for at least the next 12 h since the 
overall steering currents are weak, due to Barbara's current 
position in relation to Cosme.  However, as Barbara weakens, Cosme 
will accelerate north-northeastward in response to ridging located 
to the northwest of the cyclone. Very little change has been made 
to the NHC track forecast, and the latest forecast is near the 
various consensus models.

Cosme is forecast to remain in favorable enough conditions for the 
next 24 h such that the cyclone might be able to maintain its 
intensity or only weaken very slowly.  However, after that time, as 
Cosme gains latitude, it will encounter cooler water and drier air. 
Cosme is forecast to lose its convection and become post-tropical on 
Wednesday, in agreement with the GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite 
imagery products.  The post-tropical low is then forecast to 
gradually weaken and dissipate by 72 h.  The NHC intensity forecast 
is similar to the previous one, and is near the middle of the 
guidance envelope.
