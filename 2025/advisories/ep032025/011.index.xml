Post-Tropical Cyclone Barbara Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
800 PM MST Tue Jun 10 2025
 
Earlier today, the mid-level circulation of Barbara was sheared off 
to the southwest.  As a result, all that remains of the system is a 
weak low-level swirl as evidenced by an AMSR-E microwave image from 
a few hours ago.  The system lacks sufficient deep convection to 
qualify as a tropical cyclone, and this will be the last advisory 
on Barbara.  Assuming a steady spin down of the circulation, the 
current intensity is set at 25 kt.

The remnant low is drifting northward at about 010/4 kt.  This 
general motion should continue into Wednesday and until the system 
dissipates.

For additional information on the remnant low please see High Seas
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php

on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast, and Cosme is
expected to degenerate into a remnant low on Wednesday.  The
remnant low is forecast to dissipate by late Thursday or Friday.

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
800 PM MST Tue Jun 10 2025

Cosme is quickly on the path to becoming a remnant low.  Satellite 
images show that the low- and mid-level centers have separated, 
with the low-level circulation well northeast of the mid-level one 
now.  Dvorak intensity estimates continue to fall, and the initial 
intensity is set to 40 kt.  Further weakening is anticipated due to 
persistent shear, cool waters and dry air entrainment.  Cosme 
should transition into a remnant low on Wednesday morning and 
totally dissipate in a couple of days.  

The storm has taken its long-awaited turn, now moving slowly to the 
north-northeast. Cosme, or what's left of it, should move a 
little faster to the north late Wednesday and then dissipate into a 
trough of low pressure due to unfavorable environmental conditions. 
No significant changes were made to the track or intensity 
forecasts.
