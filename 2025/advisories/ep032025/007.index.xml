Hurricane Barbara Advisory Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
200 PM MST Mon Jun 09 2025
 
...BARBARA HOLDING STEADY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM MST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.2N 106.8W
ABOUT 175 MI...280 KM WSW OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...991 MB...29.27 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Barbara was
located near latitude 18.2 North, longitude 106.8 West. Barbara is
moving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h) and this motion is
expected to continue for the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher 
gusts. A weakening trend should begin tonight, and the system is 
forecast to become a remnant low by Wednesday. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.27 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Barbara will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND: Gusty winds are likely along coastal areas of southwestern
Mexico tonight.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 800 PM MST.

Hurricane Barbara Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
200 PM MST Mon Jun 09 2025
 
Since the last advisory Barbara has become a little less organized. 
Latest GOES satellite imagery depicts the system starting to ingest 
some drier air which has caused fragmented banding. However, a 
central dense overcast has remained over the tiny inner core. The 
satellite intensity estimates have decreased slightly from the 
previous advisory ranging from 50 to 65 kt. Using these estimates, 
the intensity is held at 65 kt, although this may be generous.

A mid-level ridge located over Mexico should continue to steer the 
system northwestward over the next couple of days. As Barbara begins 
to weaken into a shallow vortex and slow down, it will be steered by 
the low-level wind flow. The latest NHC track forecast is similar to 
the previous one, and close to the simple and corrected consensus.
 
Barbara likely has peaked as a short-lived hurricane. The 
environmental conditions will becoming increasingly hostile along 
the forecast track with the storm crossing into cooler SSTs and into 
a drier, more stable air mass. This will cause the system to 
steadily weaken, lose convective organization, and become post 
tropical by 36 h. The latest NHC forecast shows the system opening 
into a trough by 60 h and dissipating.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM MST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Cosme was
located near latitude 15.2 North, longitude 114.2 West. Cosme is
moving toward the northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A turn toward the 
north is expected by early Tuesday, followed by a faster 
north-northeast motion late Tuesday through Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Cosme could still become a hurricane overnight before 
weakening begins later on Tuesday.  Cosme is forecast to become a 
post-tropical remnant low in a couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM MST.

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
800 PM MST Mon Jun 09 2025

Cosme remains at the threshold of hurricane strength.  Convection 
continues to be potent south and east of the center, though it is 
weak on the northwestern side.  Unfortunately there haven't been any 
recent microwave passes to assess the inner-core structure.  Since 
the latest blend of objective and subjective satellite intensity 
estimates remains near 60 kt, that value will be kept as the 
initial wind speed.  

Cosme is moving along a thermal ridge in the SSTs, and it still 
could become a hurricane overnight before reaching less favorable 
conditions tomorrow morning.  Steady or rapid weakening is probable 
by late Tuesday due to a combination of decreasing SSTs and 
intrusions of dry/stable air.  The tropical cyclone should lose all 
convection early on Wednesday and become a remnant low between 36 
and 48 h.  No significant changes were made on this advisory to the 
intensity forecast.
 
The storm has slowed down, only moving northwestward at 3 kt, and 
this general motion should continue through tonight. After that 
time, a turn to the north-northeast is expected as Cosme moves 
toward a weakness left behind by Hurricane Barbara to its northeast. 
 The NHC track forecast is basically an update of the previous one, 
near or a smidge left of the consensus aids.
