Gradual weakening is forecast tonight and Saturday, and Karen should 
degenerate into a trough of low pressure late Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).

Subtropical Storm Karen Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112025
300 PM GMT Fri Oct 10 2025

There has been little change to Karen's structure or intensity 
since the previous advisory. A curved band of convection is located 
around the northwestern portion of the cyclone and an 1110 UTC ASCAT 
pass detected peak winds of 38 kt.  Therefore, the intensity will 
remain 40 kt for this advisory, which is also in line with the 
latest TAFB classification of ST2.5. 

The storm is moving northeastward at a slightly faster forward speed 
of 11 kt. Karen's should turn north-northeast and continue to 
accelerate ahead of a deep layer trough during the next 12 to 24 
hours. The NHC track forecast is near the middle of the tightly 
clustered guidance and is essentially an update of the previous 
official forecast. Karen is forecast to move over even cooler waters 
during the next 12-24 hours and simulated satellite imagery from the 
global models indicated that the convection is likely to wane later 
today and tonight.  Therefore, some weakening is indicated and the 
system should become post-tropical in 12 hours, if not sooner.  
Shortly thereafter, Karen is forecast to open up into a trough and 
become absorbed by an approaching frontal system.

the north is expected by this evening, with that motion continuing 
through Sunday.  A turn toward the northeast and east-northeast is 
forecast Sunday night and Monday.
 
Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter and satellite-derived wind data 
indicate that maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is expected during 
the next few days. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
to the east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Jerry can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header
WTNT45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Through today, 4 to 6 inches of rain are expected across
the island of Barbuda. Elsewhere across the Leeward and Virgin
Islands, 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected. This rainfall brings a
risk of flash flooding, especially in urban areas and in steep
terrain. For portions of Puerto Rico, moisture associated with Jerry
may result in up to 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated 6 inches 
possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Jerry, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Jerry are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Windward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, and are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
These swells are expected to spread toward the rest of the Greater
Antilles today and tonight. Please consult products from your local
weather office for more information.

Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, can be found at:

Tropical Storm Jerry Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102025
1100 AM AST Fri Oct 10 2025
 
Jerry is not a healthy tropical storm this morning.  The low-level 
circulation, as seen in satellite imagery and Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter data, is elongated in a southeast-northwest 
direction with most of the associated deep convection displaced 
well to the south-southeast.  The current intensity is held at 45 
kt, based on a maximum 850-mb flight-level wind of 54 kt measured 
by the reconnaissance aircraft and recent ASCAT data.  All of the 
tropical-storm-force winds appears to be within the eastern 
semicircle.
 
With the center not all that well defined, the current motion 
estimate of northwestward (325 degrees) at 14 kt is a bit 
uncertain.  Jerry is expected to turn northward later today as it 
moves around the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, with 
that trajectory continuing through early Sunday.  Then, a sharp 
northeastward and eastward turn is expected by Sunday night and 
Monday as Jerry becomes embedded in mid-latitude westerly flow.  
The NHC track forecast closely follows the HCCA consensus aid 
during that period and is not too different from the previous 
prediction.  On days 4 and 5, the official forecast has been nudged 
southward a bit based on the latest model trends.

Jerry continues to move in a direction directly into the shear 
vector, and this orientation is unlikely to change at least for the 
next 48 hours.  After 48 hours, the storm's motion and shear vector 
become more aligned, but then the storm will be moving over more 
marginal sea surface temperatures and into a more stable 
atmosphere.  As a result, the intensity guidance has continued to 
trend downward.  The NHC forecast now only shows the possibility of 
some slight strengthening, but overall the intensity is nearly 
flatlined through day 5.

Thickness fields from the European, UKMET, and Canadian models 
suggest that Jerry could start to become entangled in a frontal 
boundary by Monday, and the Google DeepMind model loses a large 
number of its ensemble members by Tuesday.  Therefore, the NHC 
forecast now shows Jerry becoming extratropical by Wednesday, if not 
sooner.  Only the GFS keeps Jerry as a tropical cyclone through day 
5.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall will impact portions of the Leeward Islands, 
British Virgin Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico through 
today, which could result in flash flooding, particularly in urban 
areas and in steep terrain.
 
2. Swells generated by Jerry are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Windward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, and are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
These swells are expected to spread toward the rest of the Greater
Antilles today and tonight.
