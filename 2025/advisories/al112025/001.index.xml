Subtropical Storm Karen Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112025
300 AM GMT Fri Oct 10 2025

Over the last 12-18 hours, NHC has been monitoring a small area of 
low pressure (AL96) embedded in a much larger upper-level trough, 
located about 400 n mi to the northwest of the northernmost Azores 
Islands. The system was originally a frontal low that quickly became 
occluded early on 8 October. Since that time, the low has been 
gradually shedding its remaining frontal features as shallow to 
moderate convection formed near the center. Earlier today, there was 
a Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) pass that indicated the 
system no longer was attached to frontal boundaries and had a 
contracted radius of maximum wind of 20 n mi. Since that time, the 
convective cloud tops have cooled to -50 to -55 C around the center, 
with a distinct warm spot seen near the center. A recent WSFM 
microwave pass also indicated a nearly closed cyan ring on the 
37-GHz channel. 00 UTC subjective satellite classifications on the 
system were a ST1.5/25-30 kt from TAFB, and a T3.0/45 kt from SAB. A 
blend of all of these various data points indicate that the system 
has made the transition to Subtropical Storm Karen. The initial 
intensity is set at 40 kt, in agreement with a recently received 
scatterometer pass which had a peak wind of 38 kt. This also matches 
the special 02 UTC fix of ST 2.5/35-40 kt received from TAFB.

The subtropical storm is moving slowly northeastward, estimated at 
050/8 kt. Karen is already well established in the mid-latitude 
westerlies for being at such a high latitude, and is likely to be 
caught up by another mid-latitude trough that is digging in from the 
west. The track guidance in in pretty good agreement on a 
northeastward motion with a gradual acceleration over the next 24-36 
hours, and the NHC track forecast is roughly in the middle of the 
guidance envelope, close to the simple and corrected consensus 
aids. 

While Karen has made the transition to a subtropical storm, it still 
remains fully embedded in a large upper-level low, so large in fact 
that it has helped the shear over the system remain fairly low and 
has enabled the convection to coalesce near the center. Very cold 
upper-level temperatures also appear to be contributing to the 
convective vigor, allowing cloud tops of -50 C to persist near the 
center. However, even colder sea-surface temperatures lie ahead of 
Karen's path, and it seems like the system only has about a day or 
so before it is quickly overtaken by the next mid-latitude trough. 
The global models show the small cyclone opening up into a trough by 
48 h, and it is also possible the system could become post-tropical 
before then if it loses its current organized convection. This 
intensity forecast is in general agreement with the mean of the 
intensity guidance.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jerry was 
located by Air Force reconnaissance aircraft near latitude 18.2 
North, longitude 61.6 West. Jerry is moving toward the northwest 
near 17 mph (28 km/h) and this motion is expected to continue with a 
gradual slowdown on Friday followed by a turn northward Friday night 
into Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of Jerry will pass 
just east of the northern Leeward Islands tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Little change in strength is expected through tomorrow, but slow 
strengthening is possible over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated by aircraft dropsonde data is 
1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Jerry can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header
WTNT45 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area and 
are possible in the watch area tonight and Friday morning.
 
RAINFALL: Through Friday, 4 to 6 inches of rain are expected across
the island of Barbuda. Elsewhere across the Leeward and Virgin
Islands, 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected. This rainfall brings a
risk of flash flooding, especially in urban areas and in steep
terrain. For portions of Puerto Rico, moisture associated with Jerry
combined with local orographic effects may result in up to 2 to 4
inches of rain, with isolated 6 inches possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Jerry, please see the National Weather Service storm
total rainfall graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Jerry are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Windward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. These swells
are expected to spread toward the rest of the Greater Antilles over
the next couple of days, are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States, including
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, can be found at:

Tropical Storm Jerry Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102025
1100 PM AST Thu Oct 09 2025

Jerry remains a disheveled tropical storm this evening. Most of the 
deep convection is displaced to the southeast of the low-level 
circulation, which continues to run out ahead due to continued 
northwesterly vertical wind shear. Air Force reconnaissance 
observations indicate a highly asymmetric wind field, with the peak 
850 mb flight level winds of 56 kt in the northeastern quadrant, and 
very little wind on the western side of the circulation. The flight 
level winds support lowering the initial intensity to 50 kt this 
advisory. The surface pressure has been rising as well, with the 
latest dropsonde data supporting a minimum value of 1005 mb.
 
Jerry appears to finally be moving northwestward now, estimated at 
315/15 kt. The track reasoning remains about the same as this 
afternoon, as Jerry's track should gradually bend more poleward as 
it moves along the western side of a subtropical ridge. On the 
forecast track, Jerry is making its closest approach to the Leeward 
Islands currently, and its asymmetric wind field means that the 
majority of the stronger winds will stay east of the island chain. 
Early next week, a faster eastward or east-northeastward motion is 
forecast in the mid-latitude westerlies. Jerry is expected to pass 
east of Bermuda in a few days, and given its expected eastward 
asymmetry, significant impacts still remain unlikely there. The NHC 
track forecast is quite similar to the prior one, and is a rough 
blend between the slower and further west HCCA guidance and the 
faster and further east Google DeepMind Mean (GDMI). 

The tropical storm is struggling mightily against the unfavorable 
northwesterly vertical winds shear, and its current poor structure 
also does not bode well for future short-term intensification. After 
the storm passes the northern Leeward Islands, the vertical wind 
shear does decrease to 10-15 knots, but given the current structure, 
it may take some time for the system to recover. Nonetheless, 
gradual intensification is shown beginning in 36 hours, though the 
intensity forecast is lower than the previous advisory. Shear 
increases towards the end of the forecast and sea-surface 
temperatures decrease as Jerry recurves into the mid-latitude 
westerlies, and some weakening is shown again in 120 h. This remains 
a low confidence intensity forecast, and on the high side of the 
overall guidance envelope. 

The most significant hazard expected from Jerry over the next few 
days is heavy rainfall, even after Jerry passes to the north due to 
its current structure with most of the significant weather to the 
south and east of the tropical cyclone. 
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area and
are possible in the watch area this evening through Friday morning.
 
2. Heavy rainfall will impact portions of the Leeward Islands,
British Virgin Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico through
Friday, which could result in flash flooding, particularly in urban
areas and in steep terrain.
