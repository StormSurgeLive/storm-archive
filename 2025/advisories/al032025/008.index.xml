Tropical Depression Chantal Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032025
1100 AM EDT Sun Jul 06 2025
 
The center of Chantal has been moving inland over northeastern South 
Carolina this morning and is currently near the North and South 
Carolina border.  Surface observations indicate that the winds have 
decreased, and the system is now being classified as a 30-kt 
tropical depression.  The cyclone should continue to weaken today as 
it moves farther inland.  The global models show the circulation 
opening up into a trough of low pressure on Monday, with the remnant 
moisture moving northeastward along the eastern seaboard of the U.S. 
through early Tuesday.
 
Chantal is moving northward or 360/8 kt.  A turn toward the
northeast is anticipated later today or this evening as the cyclone
moves around the western side of a mid-level ridge located off the
U.S. East Coast. The latest track prediction is similar to the
previous advisory and is near the middle of the guidance envelope.

The primary threat from Chantal will be heavy rainfall that is 
likely across portions of eastern and central North Carolina into 
Monday.

This is the last advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center
on Chantal. Future advisories on this system will be issued by
the Weather Prediction Center beginning at 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC). 
Those advisories can be found on the web at www.hurricanes.gov.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.Flash flood concerns continue today across portions of central 
North Carolina into Monday. Isolated to scattered flash flooding 
could occur within more urbanized areas.
 
2. Life-threatening surf and rip currents conditions are expected
to continue at beaches along the U.S. east coast from northeastern
Florida to the Mid-Atlantic states during the next day or so. Beach
goers should heed the advice of lifeguards and local officials.
