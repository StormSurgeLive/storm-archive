HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Chantal can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO
header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area
beginning soon and continuing through Sunday morning. Tropical
storm conditions are possible in the watch area this evening and
overnight.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Chantal is expected to produce heavy
rainfall across portions of North Carolina through Monday. Storm
total rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with local amounts up to 6 inches,
is expected. This would result in an elevated risk for flash
flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Chantal, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
South Santee, SC to Surf City, NC...1-2 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?peakSurge
 
TORNADOES: Isolated tornadoes are possible tonight and Sunday across
parts of eastern South Carolina and eastern North Carolina.
 
SURF: Chantal is expected to bring life-threatening surf and rip
currents to portions of the coast from northeastern Florida to
the Mid-Atlantic states during the next day or so.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/refresh/graphics_at3+shtml/?ripCurrents

Tropical Storm Chantal Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032025
1100 PM EDT Sat Jul 05 2025
 
Strong convection continues to persist in the northeastern quadrant 
of Chantal, with the center located on the southwestern edge of the 
burst.  This convection has been causing a gradual increase in 
organization of the storm, with an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance 
aircraft recently reporting 850-mb flight-level winds of 57 kt, 
which equate to about 45 kt at the surface.  This data is also close 
to derived velocity radar data from Wilmington, showing peak 8000 ft 
winds of about 55 kt, and TAFB's latest satellite classification of 
45 kt. The current intensity is set to 45 kt in agreement with these 
values.
 
The current motion estimate is 350/7, and Chantal could turn to 
the north-northwest before landfall due to a narrow mid-level ridge. 
A turn to the northeast is expected later on Sunday as Chantal 
becomes more embedded within the low- to mid-level flow around the 
west side of the ridge.  There is little time left for any 
intensification, and Chantal should make landfall within the next 6 
hours at about the present intensity (45-50 kt).  Steady weakening 
will occur after landfall with the loss of the warm water heat 
source, and Chantal is expected to dissipate over eastern North 
Carolina by early Monday.  The track forecast was nudged to the 
east, with little change to the intensity forecast.
 
Chantal is expected to remain asymmetric with its strongest winds
and rainfall to the right of the landfall location.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area
beginning soon and continuing through Sunday morning.
 
2. Heavy rainfall across portions of North Carolina will cause flash
flooding concerns through Monday, especially in urban areas.
 
3. Chantal is expected to bring life-threatening surf and rip
currents along the coast from northeastern Florida to the
Mid-Atlantic states during the next day or so. Beach goers
should heed the advice of lifeguards and local officials.
