DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Three
was located near latitude 30.6 North, longitude 78.9 West. The
depression has been nearly stationary tonight.  A slow motion 
towards the north-northwest is expected to begin on Saturday,
followed by a motion toward the north Saturday night and northeast 
Sunday night. On the forecast track, the center of the depression 
is expected to move near or over the coast of South Carolina Sunday 
morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Gradual strengthening is expected, and the system is 
forecast to become a tropical storm on Saturday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1012 mb (29.89 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Three can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO
header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area
beginning late Saturday or early Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Three is expected to produce heavy 
rainfall across portions of the coastal plain of the Carolinas 
Saturday through Monday. Storm total rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with 
local amounts to 6 inches, is expected. This would result in an 
elevated risk for flash flooding. 

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Tropical Depression Three, please see the National 
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge of 1 to 2 ft above ground level could
occur along the coast in the tropical storm watch area in areas of
onshore flow.
 
SURF: The depression is expected to bring rough surf and rip
currents to much of the southeastern United States coastline north 
of northeastern Florida during the next couple of days.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 AM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 500 AM EDT.

Tropical Depression Three Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032025
1100 PM EDT Fri Jul 04 2025

The depression is less organized on satellite imagery this evening, 
with a seemingly elongated low-level center near or just west of the 
deep convection. This structure is due to persistent southwesterly 
shear, with a mid-level circulation apparent east of the low-level 
center.  The current intensity will remain 30 kt, consistent with 
data from the last Air Force reconnaissance mission and satellite 
trends.  
 
The system has been moving erratically recently, but a longer term 
motion is basically stationary.  A slow north-northwestward motion 
is anticipated to begin on Saturday as the depression is steered on 
the northeast side of a developing mid- to upper-level low over the 
northeastern Gulf.  After that time, the system should be steered 
to the north and northeast with a gradual increase in forward speed 
along the western periphery of the subtropical ridge. This motion 
should bring the center near or over the coast of South Carolina 
Sunday morning.  The new NHC track forecast was nudged to the east, 
consistent with the latest guidance.

The global models generally indicate that the current shear should 
lessen on Saturday, which could allow for some strengthening in 
combination with the warm waters of the Gulf Stream.  There is 
plenty of dry air aloft, however, which will probably limit 
significant development, as well as the current disheveled 
structure.  The bulk of the guidance indicates modest strengthening 
as the system approaches the coast, and the new forecast follows 
suit, near the latest model consensus.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area
beginning Saturday and continuing through Sunday morning.
 
2. Heavy rainfall across the coastal Carolinas will cause some flash 
flooding concerns from Tropical Depression Three between Saturday 
through Monday. Isolated to scattered flash flooding could occur 
within more urbanized areas along the coastal plain of the 
Carolinas.
 
3. The system is expected to bring rough surf and rip currents to
much of southeastern United States north of northeastern 
Florida during the next couple of days.
