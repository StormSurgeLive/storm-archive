WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Tropical Storm Watch has been upgraded to a Tropical Storm 
Warning from the South Santee River, SC to Cape Fear, NC.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* South Santee River, SC to Cape Fear, NC
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Edisto Beach to South Santee River, SC
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within 
the next 12 to 24 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within the next 12 
hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the southeast coast of the United States
should monitor the progress of Chantal.  
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Chantal was 
located near latitude 30.9 North, longitude 79.0 West. The storm is 
moving slowly toward the north near 2 mph (4 km/h). A slow motion 
toward the north-northwest is expected to begin later today, 
followed by a turn to the northeast by Sunday night. On the forecast 
track, the center of Chantal is expected to move across the coast of 
South Carolina Sunday morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Some additional strengthening is expected before 
Chantal reaches the coast.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (115 km) 
primarily to the east of the center. 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1009 mb (29.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Chantal can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO
header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area 
beginning this evening and continuing into Sunday morning. Tropical 
storm conditions are possible in the watch area beginning later 
today.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Chantal is expected to produce heavy
rainfall across portions of the coastal plain of the Carolinas
today through Monday. Storm total rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with
local amounts to 6 inches, is expected. Resulting in an elevated 
risk for flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Chantal, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause 
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters 
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the 
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if 
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

South Santee River, SC to Cape Fear, NC...1-3 ft
Edisto Beach, SC to South Santee River, SC...1-2 ft
 
SURF: The tropical storm is expected to bring life-threatening 
surf and rip currents along the coast from northeastern Florida to 
the Mid-Atlantic states during the next couple of days.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found

      <title>Tropical Depression Three Forecast Discussion Number 3</title>

Tropical Depression Three Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032025
500 AM EDT Sat Jul 05 2025
 
The depression has been showing signs of organization overnight, 
with a significant burst of deep convection currently seen on 
GOES-19 infrared imagery on the eastern semicircle of the tropical 
cyclone. However, the center of the tropical depression appears to 
still be displaced westward from this burst, estimated to be on the 
edge of the larger cirrus plume. An earlier scatterometer pass 
received just after the prior advisory indicated the peak winds were 
up to 32 kt, so the depression may be close to tropical storm 
strength. For now though, the initial intensity is being held at 30 
kt blending the lower subjective and higher objective Dvorak 
intensity estimates. An Air Force Reserve Reconnaissance mission is 
scheduled to sample the system later this morning and should provide 
more in-situ information about the cyclone later today.
 
The depression continues to meander this morning, with my best guess 
at an estimated motion to be at 030/2-kt. The track forecast in the 
short-term is somewhat tricky, since the lopsided nature of the 
convection with the system suggests that there could be some center 
reformations/relocations to the north and/or east later today. 
Thereafter, the main steering features are a mid-to-upper level low 
over the northeastern Gulf, and a narrow mid-level ridge to the 
northeast of the depression. Their combined influence should result 
in a general north-northwestward track over the next 24-36 h.  The 
track guidance this cycle has come in further east this run, 
somewhat in response to the adjusted initial position. The NHC track 
forecast has been shifted eastward in response to this shift in the 
guidance, favoring the deterministic ECMWF (EMXI) over the GFS 
(AVNI), but it is not as far west as some of the track aids, 
including the Google Deep Mind ensemble mean (GDMI) and European 
deterministic AIFS (EAII). 

The vertical wind shear over the system is probably the most 
unfavorable it will be as the system remains over the warm Gulf 
Stream waters. In fact, both the GFS and ECMWF-based SHIPS guidance 
shows the current southwesterly shear decreasing from 20 kt 
currently to more like 10-15 kt over the next 24 h. However, there 
is some dry mid-level air lurking to east that might temper more 
robust intensification. All things considered, assuming the 
depression becomes better aligned vertically, at least some modest 
intensification should occur, and the latest NHC intensity forecast 
still shows a peak intensity of 40 kt before the system moves inland 
over South Carolina on Sunday Morning. While this forecast is on the 
upper end of the interpolated intensity guidance, the raw output 
from both the 00z HAFS-A and HAFS-B have a peak intensity a little 
above that value in 24 h. After landfall, the cyclone should weaken 
and is forecast to become post-tropical in about 48 h. It is a 
little unclear if the circulation will open up into a trough by 
early next week or if some remnant circulation will move back 
offshore beyond that time period. For now, the NHC forecast will 
stick to the former solution showing dissipation by 60 h. 
 
Given the eastward shift in the guidance this cycle, the Tropical 
Storm Watch has been extended eastward to Cape Fear, North Carolina 
this advisory. 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area
beginning this evening and continuing through Sunday morning.
 
2. Heavy rainfall across the coastal Carolinas will cause some flash 
flooding concerns from Tropical Depression Three from today through 
Monday. Isolated to scattered flash flooding could occur within more 
urbanized areas along the coastal plain of the Carolinas.
 
3. The system is expected to bring rough surf and rip currents to
much of southeastern United States north of northeastern
Florida during the next couple of days.
