Showers and <br />thunderstorms are also persisting near and to the east of the <br />center. A short-lived subtropical or tropical depression could <br />form later today or on Saturday while the system drifts generally <br />north-northwestward. This low is expected to move inland over the <br />southeastern U.S. by early Sunday. An Air Force Reserve Hurricane <br />Hunter aircraft is currently en route, and the data they collect <br />should provide more details on the system's structure. Regardless of <br />development, heavy rainfall is possible across portions of <br />west-central and southwestern Florida through early Saturday, and <br />across coastal sections of the Carolinas beginning later on <br />Saturday. <br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent. <br />* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br /><br />$$<br />Forecaster Cangialosi/Beven]]>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Three
was located near latitude 30.8 North, longitude 79.0 West. The
depression is moving toward the north near 2 mph (4 km/h). A slow
motion toward the north-northwest is expected through Saturday,
followed by a motion toward the north Saturday night and Sunday.
On the forecast track, the center of the depression is expected to
move near or over the coast of South Carolina Sunday morning.
 
Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter data indicate
that maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual strengthening is expected, and the system is forecast
to become a tropical storm on Saturday.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Reserve
Hurricane Hunter aircraft data is 1012 mb (29.89 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Three can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO
header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area
beginning late Saturday or early Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Three is expected to produce heavy
rainfall across portions of the coastal plain of the Carolinas
Saturday through Monday. Storm total rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with
local amounts to 6 inches, is expected. This would result in an
elevated risk for flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Depression Three, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge of 1 to 2 ft above ground level could
occur along the coast in the tropical storm watch area in areas of
onshore flow.
 
SURF: The depression is expected to bring rough surf and rip
currents to much of the Carolina coastline during the next couple of
days.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM EDT.

Tropical Depression Three Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032025
500 PM EDT Fri Jul 04 2025
 
The wind circulation associated with the low pressure area east of
the coast of north Florida has become stronger, with aircraft and
scatterometer data indicating a well-defined circulation with
maximum winds near 30 kt and a radius of maximum wind of about
80-90 n mi. The system has also developed persistent convection east
and southeast of the center. Based on these developments,
advisories are being started on Tropical Depression Three. The
cyclone is currently being affected by 20-25 kt of southwesterly
shear caused by a mid- to upper-level trough not far to the west.
 
The initial motion is uncertain due to some reformation of the
center, with the best estimate of 360/2 kt.  During the next 24 h,
the cyclone should move slowly north-northwestward on the northeast
side of a developing mid- to upper-level low over the northeastern
Gulf.  After that time, the system should be steered northward with
a gradual increase in forward speed.  This motion should bring the
center near or over the coast of South Carolina Sunday morning.  A
generally northward motion should then continue until the system
dissipates over land.  While the guidance generally agrees with this
scenario, there is considerable spread in both the forecast
direction and speed, with the HWRF being a notable right outlier.
The forecast track is in best agreement with the GFS and the HCCA
corrected consensus model.
 
The current shear is expected to diminish on Saturday as the
upper-level trough moves westward away from the cyclone and the
upper-level winds become southerly. However, the upper-level winds
are forecast to become convergent, which may limit the amount of
convection the system produces.  Most of the guidance shows some
development as the system approaches the coast, so the intensity
forecast calls for modest strengthening to a tropical storm before
the cyclone makes landfall. This forecast is a little below the
intensity consensus.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area
beginning Saturday and continuing through Sunday morning.
 
2. Heavy rainfall across the coastal Carolinas will cause some flash
flooding from Saturday through Monday. Isolated to scattered flash
flooding could occur within more urbanized areas along the coastal
plain of the Carolinas.
 
3. The system is expected to bring rough surf and rip currents to
much of the Carolina coastline during the next couple of days.
