WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Tropical Storm Watch from Edisto Beach to South Santee River,
South Carolina has been discontinued.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* South Santee River, SC to Surf City, NC
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case for the
next 6-12 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the southeast coast of the United States
should monitor the progress of Chantal.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Chantal was 
located near latitude 33.6 North, longitude 79.1 West. Chantal is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A turn 
northward and then northeastward is anticipated over the next 24 
hours. On the forecast track, the center of Chantal is expected to 
move further inland into South Carolina and then North Carolina 
through the day today.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with
higher gusts. Rapid weakening is anticipated now that Chantal has
made landfall, with the system opening up into a trough in 36-48
hours.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) 
from the center. In the past couple of hours, a sustained wind of 45 
mph (72 km/h) was reported at Apache Pier, South Carolina.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on nearby surface
observations is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Chantal can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO
header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occurring in the warning area 
and should persist through this morning.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Chantal is expected to produce heavy
rainfall across portions of northeastern South Carolina today and
across portions of North Carolina through Monday. Storm total
rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with local amounts up to 6 inches, is
expected. This would result in an elevated risk for flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Chantal, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
South Santee, SC to Surf City, NC...1-2 ft
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?peakSurge
 
TORNADOES: Isolated tornadoes will be possible today across portions
of eastern North Carolina and extreme northeast South Carolina.
 
SURF: Chantal is expected to bring life-threatening surf and rip
currents to portions of the coast from northeastern Florida to
the Mid-Atlantic states during the next day or so.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/refresh/graphics_at3+shtml/?ripCurrents
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.

      <title>Tropical Storm Chantal Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Tropical Storm Chantal Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032025
500 AM EDT Sun Jul 06 2025
 
Before the Air Force Reconnaissance plane departed Chantal this 
morning, their final leg observed 700 mb flight level winds of 59 kt 
and a dropsonde estimated pressure down to 1002 mb. Near the same 
location as those peak flight-level winds, NWS Doppler Radar 
velocities from Wilmington showed persistent 65-70 kt inbound values 
at 3-5 thousand feet. These data points were the basis for 
increasing Chantal's winds to 50 kt at the 06 UTC intermediate 
advisory. Since that time, the structure of the tropical storm on 
radar has degraded and the exact center has been difficult to pin 
down, but appears to have made landfall near Litchfield Beach, South 
Carolina at approximately 08 UTC. The initial intensity has been 
lowered to 45 kt for this advisory given the degradation in 
appearance now just after landfall and the decreasing Doppler radial 
velocities. 
 
Chantal is estimated to now be moving north-northwestward, at 345/7 
kt. A turn northward and then northeastward is anticipated by the 
end of today as the cyclone rounds the westward side of a mid-level 
ridge located off the U.S. East Coast. The latest NHC track forecast 
is shifted just a bit eastward, mostly based on the initial 
position, but falls in line closely to the prior forecast track in 
24-36 h. Weakening has already started as Chantal moves inland. 
Weakening should continue as the full circulation moves inland, with 
Chantal likely weakening back to a tropical depression later today. 
The majority of the global and hurricane-regional models then show 
the circulation opening up into a trough after 36 h, though its 
likely Chantal's remnant moisture will continue onward into the 
Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States after this time period.
 
Chantal is expected to remain asymmetric with its strongest winds
and rainfall to the right of the landfall location.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue in the warning 
area through this morning. 
 
2. Heavy rainfall across portions of northeastern South Carolina 
will cause some flash flooding concerns from Tropical Storm Chantal 
today and across portions of North Carolina through Monday. Isolated 
to scattered flash flooding could occur within more urbanized areas.
 
3. Chantal is expected to bring life-threatening surf and rip
currents along the coast from northeastern Florida to the
Mid-Atlantic states during the next day or so. Beach goers
should heed the advice of lifeguards and local officials.
