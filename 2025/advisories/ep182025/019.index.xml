Post-Tropical Cyclone Sonia Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP182025
200 AM PDT Wed Oct 29 2025
 
Sonia has succumbed to hostile environmental conditions, with 
satellite imagery showing no deep convection near the low-level 
center for about 15 hours.  Therefore, Sonia is being a declared 
post-tropical cyclone.  The latest subjective satellite intensity 
estimates from TAFB and SAB reflect this, deeming the system too 
weak to classify.  A 0541 UTC Metop-B ASCAT pass revealed a large 
area of 25-kt winds, with a peak wind vector of 26 kt.  Taking into 
account the likelihood of some undersampling, the initial intensity 
for the post-tropical remnant low of Sonia is set at 30 kt.

Sonia will continue moving westward during the next day or so, 
steered by the low-level flow, while remaining embedded within a 
hostile environment.  Regeneration of organized deep convection is 
not expected, and the remnant low of Sonia is forecast to dissipate 
by Thursday, if not sooner.
 
For additional information on the post-tropical remnant low please 
see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, 
under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the 
web at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php
