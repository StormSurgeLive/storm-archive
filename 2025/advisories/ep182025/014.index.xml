Tropical Storm Sonia Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP182025
800 PM PDT Mon Oct 27 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Sonia has changed little since the 
previous advisory, with a small area of deep convection persisting 
over the low-level center.  The latest subjective Dvorak current 
intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB are 2.5/35 kt and 2.0/30 kt, 
respectively, while objective estimates from UW-CIMSS have ranged 
from 31 to 41 kt.  A blend of these data, along with an earlier 
ASCAT Metop-C pass that sampled a broad area of 30-33 kt winds when 
convection was absent, supports maintaining the initial intensity at 
35 kt for this advisory.

Sonia is moving west-northwestward, or 295 degrees at 6 kt.  A turn 
toward the west is expected later tonight or Tuesday as the 
circulation becomes shallower and the system is steered along by the 
low-level flow.  The official forecast track has been nudged 
slightly north of the previous one due to the more west-northwest 
motion observed since the last advisory, and it lies close to the 
Google DeepMind ensemble mean.

Sonia’s days appear to be numbered, as the cyclone remains affected 
by strong southerly shear—currently analyzed near 25 kt by UW-CIMSS. 
The shear is expected to increase slightly over the next day or so 
while Sonia moves over gradually cooling waters and into a drier 
mid-level environment.  These factors should result in a steady 
weakening trend, with the system likely to become a post-tropical 
remnant low on Wednesday and dissipate on Thursday.  The intensity 
forecast has been adjusted slightly higher than the previous 
advisory, based on recent satellite trends and the latest consensus 
guidance.
