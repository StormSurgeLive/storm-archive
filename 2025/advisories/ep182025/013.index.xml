Tropical Storm Sonia Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP182025
200 PM PDT Mon Oct 27 2025
 
Sonia is producing only intermittent convection over the low-level 
center. Previous convection that was displaced well north of the 
center has dissipated. Latest satellite intensity estimates have 
decreased and range from 30 to 35 kt from SAB, TAFB and UW-CIMSS. 
Using these estimates and the current satellite presentation, the 
initial intensity is lowered to 35 kt for this advisory.
 
The storm is moving westward at an estimated motion of 275/6 kt. 
This general motion should continue as the system weakens and is 
steered by the low-level wind flow. The latest NHC track forecast is 
near the previous, only nudged slightly to the right towards the 
HCCA and Google DeepMind solutions.
 
Moderate wind shear, and a drier more stable airmass have taken
their toll on Sonia today.  The GFS model simulated IR satellite
shows that the system will not produce anymore convection, while the
ECMWF shows a burst occuring later this evening or tonight.  The
latest NHC forecast shows the system becoming a post-tropical
remnant low in 24 h, although that could occur sooner if organized
deep convection does not return over the low-level center tonight.
The system is forecast to dissipate and open into a trough in about
two to three days.
