Tropical Storm Fernand Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062025
1100 AM AST Wed Aug 27 2025
 
Fernand's center is exposed to the west of a remaining band of deep 
convection, with the circulation itself a bit elongated.  Satellite 
intensity estimates still encompass a rather large range--from 30 
kt to about 45 kt.  The initial intensity is held at 40 kt, pending 
an ASCAT pass which we may not receive until after this advisory is 
released.

Since last evening, convection appears to have had a stronger 
influence on Fernand's motion compared to the prevailing steering 
flow.  The 12-hour average motion has been eastward, or 085 degrees 
at 10 kt.  Assuming the convective influences lessen, the track 
models insist that Fernand should resume an acceleration toward the 
east-northeast very soon, with that motion continuing for the next 
day or two.  Fernand is currently over sea surface temperatures of 
about 25 degrees Celsius, but it is expected to move over the north 
wall of the Gulf Stream later today, with SSTs falling to 23-24 
degrees Celsius by this evening.  These cooler waters should cause 
Fernand's deep convection to gradually decay through the remainder 
of the day, and the cyclone could become post-tropical as early as 
tonight.  Winds are likely to remain at gale force, largely due to 
the system's increasing forward speed.  Dissipation--when the 
circulation opens up into a trough--is likely in 36-48 hours.
