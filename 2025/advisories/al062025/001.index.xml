This system is expected to <br />become a tropical storm this afternoon or evening, with further <br />intensification likely through Sunday while the low moves northward <br />at 10 to 15 mph over the southwestern Atlantic.  Interests in <br />Bermuda should monitor the progress of this system, though the <br />threat to that island appears to be less than yesterday.

SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...27.2N 61.4W
ABOUT 405 MI...655 KM SSE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 10 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1010 MB...29.83 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fernand was
located near latitude 27.2 North, longitude 61.4 West. Fernand is
moving toward the north near 15 mph (24 km/h).  A north- 
northeastward motion at a gradually increasing forward speed is 
anticipated during the next couple of days, followed by a turn to 
the northeast. On the forecast track, Fernand should move well east 
of Bermuda and across the open waters of the subtropical North 
Atlantic.
 
Satellite data indicate that the maximum sustained winds are near 
40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. Some strengthening is forecast 
during the next 48 hours, and Fernand could be near hurricane 
strength on Monday.  Weakening is expected to begin on Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft recently reported a 
minimum central pressure of 1010 mb (29.83 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Tropical Storm Fernand Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062025
500 PM AST Sat Aug 23 2025

The trough of low pressure (AL90) located a few hundred miles 
south-southeast of Bermuda has become better organized today.  An 
Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft found a well-defined 
center during the past couple of hours, with a central pressure of 
about 1010 mb.  The initial intensity is set to 35 kt, based on 
earlier scatterometer data which had a few believable 
tropical-storm-force wind vectors, and a Dvorak classification of 
35 kt from TAFB.

The initial motion is north or 010/13 kt.  A north-northeastward 
motion is anticipated during the next couple of days with a slow 
increase in forward speed due to Fernand moving around the western 
periphery of the subtropical ridge.  The storm will likely 
accelerate to the northeast thereafter as the system gets caught up 
in faster mid-latitude flow, well to the southeast of Newfoundland. 
The global models are in good agreement on this scenario, and the 
NHC forecast is on the eastern side of the guidance, closest to the 
HFIP Corrected- Consensus Model (HCCA).

Fernand has about 48 hours over warm waters within generally light 
shear to intensify.  There is a fair bit of mid-level dry air, 
however, which could hinder any rapid strengthening, so the 
intensity forecast will just show a more gradual increase in winds.  
All of the models peak the system as an upper-end tropical storm or 
category 1 hurricane, and the NHC forecast is just shy of a 
hurricane as a peak.  After Monday, Fernand should weaken due 
to the influences of cooler waters and increasing shear, and the 
storm will likely become post-tropical in 3-4 days.
