moving toward the north-northeast near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this
motion is expected to continue for the next day or two, followed
by a turn to the northeast. On the forecast track, Fernand should
move across the open waters of the subtropical central Atlantic well
east and northeast of Bermuda.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Some strengthening is anticipated through 
tomorrow, with weakening likely to begin on Tuesday.  
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)

Tropical Storm Fernand Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062025
500 PM AST Sun Aug 24 2025
 
Fernand continues to become better organized on satellite imagery 
with a more circular central dense overcast and a curved banding 
feature in the southern semicircle.  Satellite intensity estimates 
are slightly higher, so the initial intensity is raised to 40 kt.  
Further intensification is anticipated during the next day or so 
while Fernand remains in a warm water and light shear environment, 
tempered by plentiful environmental dry air.  Around Tuesday, shear 
should increase, along with a decrease in SSTs.  This should cause 
weakening, and the storm will likely become post- tropical on 
Wednesday.  No significant change to the previous forecast was made, 
and the latest NHC prediction is close to a blend of the previous 
one and the intensity model consensus.
 
The initial motion is 025/11 kt.  The storm is likely to move to the 
north-northeast then northeast at a faster forward speed during the 
next day or two as the steering flow gradually shifts from the 
subtropical ridge to the mid-latitude southwesterlies.  There is 
more spread in the model guidance than the last cycle, seemingly due 
to the forecast depth of the storm.  Generally the models are a 
little slower, perhaps because Fernand isn't expected to be as 
strong (and presumably won't feel faster upper-level flow as much). 
The new NHC forecast follows the trend of the guidance, a bit slower 
than the past advisory, and just south of the HFIP Corrected 
Consensus model.
