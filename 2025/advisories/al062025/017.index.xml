Tropical Storm Fernand Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062025
500 PM AST Wed Aug 27 2025
 
Fernand's interaction with a nearby upper-level trough has caused 
the cloud pattern to look more like an extratropical cyclone, with 
a broad cirrus shield northeast of the center and some leftover 
shallow-topped convection in a band within the eastern semicircle.  
Still, the system remains non frontal and is holding onto tropical 
cyclone status.  Maximum winds are estimated to be 45 kt based on 
ASCAT-C data from around 10 am this morning.

The initial motion is now faster toward the northeast, or 070 
degrees at 13 kt.  Additional acceleration toward the northeast or 
east-northeast is expected during the next day or so with Fernand 
now well embedded in mid-latitude westerly flow.  The storm is now 
passing across the north wall of the Gulf Stream, and sea surface 
temperatures beneath the circulation should be down to about 23 
degrees Celsius in 12 hours.  GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite 
images suggest that convection should continue to wane over these 
colder waters, and Fernand is expected to become post-tropical by 
early Thursday.  Despite the transition, Fernand is forecast to 
maintain gale-force winds, even after it opens up into a trough and 
dissipates by Thursday night.
