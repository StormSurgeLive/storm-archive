moving toward the north-northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h)and this
motion is expected to continue for the next day or so, followed by a
turn to the northeast. On the forecast track, Fernand should move
across the open waters of the subtropical central Atlantic well east
and northeast of Bermuda.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is possible today. Weakening is expected to 
begin tonight, and Fernand is expected to become post-tropical on 
Wednesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).

Tropical Storm Fernand Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062025
500 AM AST Mon Aug 25 2025

Fernand continues to produce a concentrated area of convection 
near and to the south of the center, although recent AMSR2 and GMI 
microwave overpasses show some separation between the center and 
the convection. There are also ragged outer convective bands in 
the northeastern semicircle.  The various satellite intensity 
estimates are in the 40-50 kt range, and they have not changed much 
during the past 6 h. Based on this, the initial intensity remains 
45 kt.

The initial motion remains north-northeast or 025/10 kt. Fernand is 
being steered around the western periphery of the subtropical 
ridge and is moving into the southern portion of the mid-latitude 
westerlies. A general north-northeastward to northeastward motion 
is expected with some increase in forward speed during the 
remainder of the cyclone's life. The latest track guidance has 
shifted a little to the left or northwest, and the new forecast 
track thus lies a little to the left of the previous forecast. 
Overall, the new forecast is in best agreement with the HCCA 
corrected consensus.

Fernand is almost out of time to strengthen. It is approaching an 
area of increasing shear, and after 12 h sea surface temperatures 
decrease along the forecast track. The new intensity forecast will 
show a little more strengthening today, followed by a weakening 
trend as Fernand moves into the less favorable environment. The 
cyclone is forecast to become post-tropical by 48 h over cold water, 
and it is now forecast to degenerate to a trough by 60 h in 
agreement with the global model guidance.
