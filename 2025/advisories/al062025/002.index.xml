This system could <br />become a tropical depression during the next day or two while it <br />moves quickly westward at about 20 to 25 mph, passing through the <br />Windward and Leeward Islands late on Sunday. Regardless of <br />development, locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds are possible <br />across portions of the Windward and Leeward Islands on Sunday and <br />Monday. The system is expected to reach the central Caribbean on <br />Tuesday, where conditions are expected to become less favorable for <br />additional development. An Air Force reconnaissance aircraft is <br />scheduled to investigate the system tomorrow, if necessary.  <br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br />* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br /><br />&&<br /><br />Public Advisories on Tropical Storm Fernand are issued under WMO <br />header WTNT31 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCPAT1. <br />Forecast/Advisories on Tropical Storm Fernand are issued under WMO <br />header WTNT25 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCMAT1.<br /><br />$$<br />Forecaster Cangialosi/Kelly]]>

Tropical Storm Fernand Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062025
500 PM AST Sat Aug 23 2025

The trough of low pressure (AL90) located a few hundred miles 
south-southeast of Bermuda has become better organized today.  An 
Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft found a well-defined 
center during the past couple of hours, with a central pressure of 
about 1010 mb.  The initial intensity is set to 35 kt, based on 
earlier scatterometer data which had a few believable 
tropical-storm-force wind vectors, and a Dvorak classification of 
35 kt from TAFB.

The initial motion is north or 010/13 kt.  A north-northeastward 
motion is anticipated during the next couple of days with a slow 
increase in forward speed due to Fernand moving around the western 
periphery of the subtropical ridge.  The storm will likely 
accelerate to the northeast thereafter as the system gets caught up 
in faster mid-latitude flow, well to the southeast of Newfoundland. 
The global models are in good agreement on this scenario, and the 
NHC forecast is on the eastern side of the guidance, closest to the 
HFIP Corrected- Consensus Model (HCCA).

Fernand has about 48 hours over warm waters within generally light 
shear to intensify.  There is a fair bit of mid-level dry air, 
however, which could hinder any rapid strengthening, so the 
intensity forecast will just show a more gradual increase in winds.  
All of the models peak the system as an upper-end tropical storm or 
category 1 hurricane, and the NHC forecast is just shy of a 
hurricane as a peak.  After Monday, Fernand should weaken due 
to the influences of cooler waters and increasing shear, and the 
storm will likely become post-tropical in 3-4 days.
