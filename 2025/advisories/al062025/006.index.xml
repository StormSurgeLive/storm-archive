Tropical Storm Fernand Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062025
1100 PM AST Sun Aug 24 2025
 
Fernand continues to produce bursts of convection near the low-level 
center, with cold cloud tops notes in satellite images. Microwave 
imagery shows an improving structure with curved banding and a small 
inner core trying to become established. Subjective and objective 
satellite intensity estimates range between 40 to 50 kt. Using a 
blend of these estimates, the initial intensity is raised to 45 kt.
 
The initial motion remains north-northeast at an estimated motion of 
025/11 kt. The system is being steered around the western periphery 
of a subtropical ridge. This north-northeast to northeast motion is 
anticipated throughout the forecast period as the system is steered 
around the ridge and into the mid-latitude southwesterlies, with an 
increase is forward speed. The latest NHC forecast is similar to the 
previous, and lies between the HCCA corrected consensus and Google 
DeepMind aids.
 
Fernand is forecast to gradually strengthen during the 12-24h, as 
the system remains over warm water and light wind shear. However, 
there is some drier mid-level air depicted via satellite and latest 
SHIPS guidance, which may hinder convective organization at times. 
By late Monday or Tuesday, vertical wind shear begins to increase 
and sea surface temperatures decrease significantly along the 
forecast track. This will cause the system to weaken, and become 
post-tropical on Wednesday. The NHC intensity forecast is similar to 
the previous one, and remains near the consensus aids.
