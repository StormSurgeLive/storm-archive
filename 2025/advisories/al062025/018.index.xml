Tropical Storm Fernand Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062025
1100 PM AST Wed Aug 27 2025

The system is producing minimal shower activity at this time, with 
only some shallow- to mid-level topped convection and some isolated 
deeper cells in a band over the eastern semicircle.  In fact, the 
cyclone lacks enough convection to be classified by the Dvorak 
technique.  Unless significant shower and thunderstorm activity 
redevelops in the circulation, which seems unlikely due to cooler 
ocean waters, Fernand will become a post-tropical cyclone on 
Thursday.  In spite of its unimpressive cloud appearance, recent 
ASCAT-C scatterometer measurements showed peak surface winds of 
around 45 kt over the southern part of Fernand's circulation.  Some 
slight spin-down is likely during the next 24 hours, but the system 
is expected to maintain gale-force winds even after it opens up into 
a trough by Thursday night or early Friday.

Fernand is accelerating east-northeastward with the motion now 
around 060/16 kt.  The cyclone should continue to move faster in 
about the same direction, within the mid-latitude 
west-southwesterly flow ahead of a short-wave trough, until 
post-tropical transition. The official forecast is very close to 
the dynamical track model consensus, TVCN.
