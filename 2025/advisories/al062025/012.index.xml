Tropical Storm Fernand Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062025
500 AM AST Tue Aug 26 2025
 
Fernand continues to be a sheared cyclone this morning. Satellite 
images show the low-level center exposed to the north of an area of 
dissipating convection with warming cloud tops.  Subjective and 
objective satellite intensity estimates are between 30 to 44 kt. 
Given the satellite trends, the intensity is lowered to 40 kt for 
this advisory.
 
The storm is moving northeastward  or 040/12 kt. A slightly faster 
northeastward motion is expected later today within the flow between 
a subtropical high to its east and an approaching trough to the 
west. The NHC track forecast was shifted slightly to the right, and 
lies between the Google Deep Mind and HCCA corrected consensus.
 
Fernand is expected to continue weakening, as satellite water vapor 
imagery depicts the system is moving into a drier environment and 
SHIPS mid-level RH values remain below 50 percent. The storm is also 
moving over cooler sea surface temperatures, and into higher wind 
shear along the forecast track. The NHC intensity forecast is 
similar to the previous, which shows gradual weakening as the system 
spins down, and Fernand will likely become post-tropical cyclone 
tonight or early Wednesday. The cyclone is expected to open into a 
trough by 48 h and dissipate.
