900 AM GMT Thu Aug 28 2025
 
...FERNAND BECOMES A POST-TROPICAL CYCLONE...
...THIS IS THE FINAL NHC ADVISORY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM GMT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...41.2N 42.9W
ABOUT 635 MI...1020 KM ESE OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 60 DEGREES AT 23 MPH...37 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1009 MB...29.80 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM GMT (0900 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Fernand was located near latitude 41.2 North, longitude 42.9 West.
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east-northeast near
23 mph (37 km/h) and this motion with some additional increase in 
forward speed is forecast until the system opens up into a trough. 
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) 
with higher gusts. The post-tropical cyclone is expected to open up 
into a trough in 24-36 hours.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1009 mb (29.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane 
Center on this system. Additional information on this system can be 
found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service,

Post-Tropical Cyclone Fernand Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062025
900 AM GMT Thu Aug 28 2025
 
It has now been more than 12 hours since Fernand has produced what 
could be considered organized deep convection near its center, and 
now that the cyclone has moved north of the Gulf Stream, this 
activity is very unlikely to come back. Therefore, Fernand is now 
considered a post-tropical cyclone, and this will be the final NHC 
advisory on the system. The maximum sustained winds have been 
lowered to 40 kt, assuming there has been some spin-down of the 
winds relative to the earlier scatterometer data, given the lack of 
deep convection. The system is continuing to accelerate 
east-northeastward, now at 060/20 kt, and this motion should 
continue until the post-tropical cyclone opens up into a trough in 
about 24-36 hours. This system will ultimately become absorbed by a 
larger mid-latitude cyclone forecast to develop in the far North 
Atlantic.
 
Additional information on this system, including gale warnings, can 
be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather 
Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and 
online at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
