DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fernand was
located near latitude 27.2 North, longitude 61.4 West. Fernand is
moving toward the north near 15 mph (24 km/h).  A north- 
northeastward motion at a gradually increasing forward speed is 
anticipated during the next couple of days, followed by a turn to 
the northeast. On the forecast track, Fernand should move well east 
of Bermuda and across the open waters of the subtropical North 
Atlantic.
 
Satellite data indicate that the maximum sustained winds are near 
40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. Some strengthening is forecast 
during the next 48 hours, and Fernand could be near hurricane 
strength on Monday.  Weakening is expected to begin on Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft recently reported a 
minimum central pressure of 1010 mb (29.83 inches).
