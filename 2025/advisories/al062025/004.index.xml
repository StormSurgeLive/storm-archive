However, the wave does not appear to have a surface<br />circulation.  This system could still become a tropical depression <br />during the next day or two while it moves quickly westward at about <br />20 to 25 mph, passing through the Windward and Leeward Islands <br />later today and early Monday.  Regardless of development, locally <br />heavy rainfall and gusty winds are likely across portions of the <br />Windward and Leeward Islands today and Monday. The system is <br />expected to reach the central Caribbean Sea on Tuesday, where <br />conditions are forecast to become less favorable for additional <br />development.  An Air Force reconnaissance aircraft is scheduled to <br />investigate the system this afternoon, if necessary.  <br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br />* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br /><br />&&<br /><br />Public Advisories on Tropical Storm Fernand are issued under WMO <br />header WTNT31 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCPAT1. <br />Forecast/Advisories on Tropical Storm Fernand are issued under WMO <br />header WTNT21 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCMAT1.<br /><br />$$<br />Forecaster Blake]]>

Tropical Storm Fernand Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062025
1100 AM AST Sun Aug 24 2025
 
Fernand has become a bit better organized during the past few
hours.  Convection has reformed with a banding pattern around the
center, with some expanding outflow.  Satellite intensity estimates 
are about the same as before, so the initial intensity will remain 
35 kt, though some of the objective estimates have recently 
increased.  

The storm has been moving through an environment that is somewhat 
drier with more shear than anticipated.  Consequently, Fernand 
has changed little overnight.  The environment still should support 
some gradual strengthening, which is the general idea of the model 
guidance.  The new NHC forecast is about the same as the last one, 
with a similar peak occuring on Monday, perhaps a bit sooner than 
earlier thinking.  Decreasing SSTs and increasing shear should 
cause weakening later on Tuesday, with extratropical transition 
anticipated early Wednesday and a quick dissipation on Thursday.  
 
The initial motion is 020/13 kt.  Fernand is forecast to move 
on this general course for the next couple of days around the 
northwestern edge of the subtropical ridge.  The storm will likely 
be embedded in the mid-latitude flow by late Tuesday, causing a 
faster track to the northeast.  While the model guidance remains in 
good agreement, guidance has been shifting eastward to time, which 
the Google Deep Mind (GDMI) model first sniffed out yesterday.  The 
new NHC forecast is on the eastern side of the guidance envelope 
and is east of the previous official forecast.
