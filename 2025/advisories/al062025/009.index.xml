...FERNAND FORECAST TO START WEAKENING TONIGHT...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...35.3N 57.2W
ABOUT 485 MI...775 KM ENE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 30 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fernand was
located near latitude 35.3 North, longitude 57.2 West. Fernand is
moving toward the north-northeast near 14 mph (22 km/h), and a 
general track in that direction or to the north-northeast is 
anticipated for the next couple of days.  On the forecast track, 
Fernand should move across the open waters of the subtropical 
central Atlantic well northeast of Bermuda.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Weakening is likely to begin tonight, and Fernand could 
become a post-tropical cyclone on Wednesday before dissipating on 
Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Tropical Storm Fernand Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062025
500 PM AST Mon Aug 25 2025

The center of Fernand has become exposed this afternoon with 
bursting convection continuing well south of the center.  The 
initial intensity will remain 50 kt on this package per continuity 
from earlier scatterometer winds, but if convection doesn't 
redevelop soon near the center, this is probably a generous 
estimate.  Weakening should begin soon regardless with increasing 
shear and cooler waters in the path of the storm.  Fernand is 
forecast to become post-tropical early on Wednesday due to a lack of 
convection, but it wouldn't be surprising if that transition 
happened sooner.  The new NHC intensity forecast is basically an 
update of the previous one, near the model consensus.

The initial motion is north-northeast or 030/12 kt. A general 
north-northeastward to northeastward motion is expected with some 
increase in speed during the rest of Fernand's life due to steering 
from the subtropical ridge and a mid-latitude trough.  Models are 
trending toward a slower and rightward solution, suggesting a weaker 
storm will not feel the approaching mid-latitude trough as much.  
The new official forecast is shifted south of the previous one, 
closer to the Google Deep Mind model, which has had a very good 
performance so far for this cyclone.
