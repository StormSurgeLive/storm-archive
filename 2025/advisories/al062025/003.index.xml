This system could <br />become a tropical depression during the next day or two while it <br />moves quickly westward at about 20 to 25 mph, passing through the <br />Windward and Leeward Islands late today or tonight. Regardless of <br />development, locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds are possible <br />across portions of the Windward and Leeward Islands today and <br />Monday. The system is expected to reach the central Caribbean on <br />Tuesday, where conditions are expected to become less favorable for <br />additional development. An Air Force reconnaissance aircraft is <br />scheduled to investigate the system later today, if necessary.  <br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br />* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br /><br />&&<br /><br />Public Advisories on Tropical Storm Fernand are issued under WMO <br />header WTNT31 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCPAT1. <br />Forecast/Advisories on Tropical Storm Fernand are issued under WMO <br />header WTNT21 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCMAT1.<br /><br />$$<br />Forecaster Beven]]>

Tropical Storm Fernand Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062025
500 AM AST Sun Aug 24 2025

Convection associated with Fernand remains poorly organized this 
morning, with a cluster near and just west of the center and a very 
ragged outer band in the northern semicircle. The various 
subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates remain in 
the 35-40 kt range, and the initial intensity is held at 35 kt.

The initial motion is 015/13 kt. As mentioned previously, Fernand 
is being steered around the western edge of the subtropical ridge, 
which will cause the storm to move north-northeastward during the 
next day or two. The system will then turn more northeastward and 
accelerate within the mid-latitude westerly flow between the ridge 
and an approaching trough. While the model guidance remains in good 
agreement with this scenario, the guidance envelop has shifted a 
little to the east since the previous advisory, Thus, the new 
forecast track is a little east of the previous track.

Fernand should remain over warm sea surface temperatures and in 
a light shear environment for the next 36 h or so. However, 
mid-level dry air near the cyclone may slow the development. The 
intensity guidance has again trended downward, and the new forecast 
peak intensity of 50 kt is near the upper edge of the guidance.  
After 36 h, cooler water, increasing shear, and increased dry-air 
entrainment should cause weakening, and Fernand is now forecast to 
become post-tropical by 72 hr. The global models are in good 
agreement that the system should degenerate to a trough by 96 h, 
and the official forecast shows dissipation by that time.
