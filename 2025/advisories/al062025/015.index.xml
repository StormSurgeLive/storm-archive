Tropical Storm Fernand Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062025
1100 PM AST Tue Aug 26 2025
 
The deep convection near Fernand's center has persisted through the 
evening. Overnight scatterometer data showed reliable wind vectors 
up to 39 kt and the initial intensity is raised to 40 kt based on 
these data. 
 
Fernand is moving at an estimated 50/10 kt.  The storm is expected 
to accelerate east-northeastward during the next couple of days as 
it moves in the mid-latitude westerlies.  Minor updates have been 
made to the latest NHC track forecast track which lies near the 
corrected consensus model, HCCA.  Simulated satellite imagery from 
global models suggest that Fernand will lose its deep convection in 
the next day or so.  Model guidance holds Fernand generally steady 
in intensity while it transitions into a post-tropical cyclone.  
The official intensity forecast continues to show Fernand becoming 
post-tropical by 36 hours and opening into a trough by late this 
week.
