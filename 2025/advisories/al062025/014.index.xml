Tropical Storm Fernand Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062025
500 PM AST Tue Aug 26 2025
 
As mentioned this morning, there was a possibility of deep 
convection redeveloping near Fernand's center, and that indeed has 
happened.  Fernand has therefore maintained tropical cyclone status, 
and based on earlier ASCAT data which showed wind of 30-35 kt, the 
initial wind speed is held at 35 kt.  

The initial motion is northeastward, or 045/10 kt.  An acceleration 
toward the east-northeast is expected during the next couple of days 
as Fernand becomes more fully embedded in the mid-latitude westerly 
flow.  In the short term, Fernand will be moving over a relative 
warm eddy of the Gulf Stream, while also remaining in an environment 
of low shear.  Based on the latest GFS and ECMWF fields, as well as 
the HCCA guidance, some slight strengthening appears possible during 
the next day or so.  This is reflected in the NHC intensity 
forecast.  Post-tropical transition is predicted by 36 hours, if not 
sooner, when the cyclone should finally struggle to maintain 
convection over colder waters.  The post-tropical cyclone may be 
able to maintain its integrity through 48 hours, so an additional 
forecast point was added to the official forecast at that time.  The 
GFS and ECWMF are in very good agreement that the low should open up 
into a trough by 60 hours (Thursday night).
