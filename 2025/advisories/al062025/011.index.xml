SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...37.0N 55.2W
ABOUT 635 MI...1020 KM ENE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 40 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fernand was
located near latitude 37.0 North, longitude 55.2 West. Fernand is
moving toward the northeast near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A slightly
faster northeast motion is anticipated over the next couple of
days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Continued weakening is likely, and Fernand is 
likely to become a post-tropical cyclone later tonight or early 
Wednesday before dissipating on Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).

Tropical Storm Fernand Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062025
1100 PM AST Mon Aug 25 2025
 
Fernand has lost organization over the past several hours. The 
center is completely exposed, and convection is confined to a small 
area south of the center due to northerly vertical wind shear. The 
initial intensity is lowered a little to 45 kt, which lies near the 
high end of the latest satellite estimates. This intensity value is 
in good agreement with a recent partial ASCAT pass that showed 35 to 
40 kt winds on the eastern side of the system. Continued weakening 
is expected due to sharply cooler waters, dry air, and moderate to 
strong shear. Fernand will likely become post-tropical in about 24 
hours, if not sooner, and is expected to open into a trough in a 
couple of days.
 
The storm is moving northeastward at 11 kt. A slightly faster
northeastward motion in the flow between a subtropical high to its
east and a large trough to the west is expected until Fernand
dissipates. The NHC track forecast is similar to the previous one,
and lies near the Google Deep Mind and HCCA models, which have been
performing well for this system.
