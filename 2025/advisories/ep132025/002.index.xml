BULLETIN
Tropical Depression Thirteen-E Advisory Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP132025
900 PM CST Thu Sep 11 2025
 
...TROPICAL DEPRESSION THIRTEEN-E HEADING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD OFF THE
COAST OF SOUTHERN MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM CST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.0N 99.6W
ABOUT 65 MI...105 KM SSE OF ACAPULCO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1007 MB...29.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests along the coast of southwestern Mexico should monitor the
progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM CST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression
Thirteen-E was located near latitude 16.0 North, longitude 99.6
West. The depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph
(19 km/h), and this general motion is expected to continue during 
the next couple of days. On the forecast track, the center of the 
depression will move parallel to, but offshore of, the southwestern 
coast of mainland Mexico.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours. Slow 
strengthening is expected during the next couple of days, and 
Thirteen-E is forecast to become a Tropical Storm later tonight.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Tropical Depression Thirteen-E will lead to rainfall
totals of 2 to 4 inches, with local amounts of 6 inches, across
southern and southwestern Mexico through Sunday. This brings a risk
of flash flooding, especially in areas of higher terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Thirteen-E, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep3.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Gusty winds are possible over portions of the southern coast
of Mexico from Punta Maldonado through Manzanillo during the next
day or so.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM CST.

Tropical Depression Thirteen-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP132025
300 PM CST Thu Sep 11 2025
 
High resolution GOES visible satellite imagery throughout today 
indicates that the disturbance south of Mexico has become better 
organized.  The system has a partially exposed low-level circulation 
located near an area of bursting deep convection with cloud top 
temperatures of less than -80 degrees C.  Subjective Dvorak 
classifications from TAFB and SAB are T2.5 and T2.0, respectively.  
Therefore, advisories have been initiated on Tropical Depression 
Thirteen-E with an initial intensity of 30 kt.  

The depression is moving at an uncertain 300/5 kt.  A mid-level 
ridge to centered over northern Mexico and Texas should steer the 
cyclone west-northwestward with an acceleration in forward speed 
during the next few days.  Over the weekend, the system should turn 
more northwestward as it rounds the periphery of the ridge and 
continue that motion through the end of the forecast period.  There 
is little cross-track variance in the guidance envelope, however, a 
bit more of an along-track spread.  The official track forecast lies 
between the various consensus aids and the Google DeepMind guidance.

The new cyclone has a rather small circulation.  In the next couple 
of days, global models suggest vertical wind shear and the proximity 
to land should limit the system's ability to strengthen.  By the 
weekend, environment conditions should become more conducive for 
steady strengthening.  The depression is forecast to reach 
tropical storm strength in a day or so and become a hurricane by 
day 3.  Late in the forecast period, cooler sea surface temperatures 
and dry mid-level humidities should induce a weakening trend.  The 
initial NHC intensity forecast lies on the higher end of the 
intensity guidance envelope.

Predicted tropical-storm-force winds are expected to remain 
offshore of the coast of Mexico.  However, heavy rains and 
potentially gusty winds are possible along portions of the 
southern coast of Mexico during the next day or so.
