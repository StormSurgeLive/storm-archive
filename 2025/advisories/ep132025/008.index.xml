Earlier satellite wind data also <br />indicated the circulation had become better defined.  If the ongoing <br />deep convection persists, Mario is likely to become a tropical <br />cyclone again, and advisories may be re-initiated as soon as later <br />this morning as the system moves slowly westward at around 10 mph.<br />*Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br />*Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br /><br />Off the Coast of Southwestern Mexico:<br />An area of low pressure could develop well offshore of the coast of <br />southern or southwestern Mexico early this week.
