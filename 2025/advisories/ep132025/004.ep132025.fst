DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM CST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Mario was
located near latitude 17.2 North, longitude 101.9 West.  Mario is
moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h), and this 
motion is expected to continue through this evening.  A slower 
motion toward the west-northwest is forecast tonight through the 
weekend.  On the forecast track, the center of Mario should move 
roughly parallel to the coast of Mexico through tonight, and then 
begin to move farther away from the coast on Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast during 
the next couple of days.
 
Mario is a tiny tropical storm, and tropical-storm-force winds 
extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) to the north of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Mario will lead to rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches, with
local amounts of 6 inches, across southern Mexico through Sunday.
This brings a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas of higher
terrain.
