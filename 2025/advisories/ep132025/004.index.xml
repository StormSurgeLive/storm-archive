Tropical Storm Mario Advisory Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP132025
900 AM CST Fri Sep 12 2025
 
...MINI MARIO FORMS JUST OFF THE COAST OF MEXICO...
...TROPICAL STORM WATCH ISSUED FOR A PORTION OF THE STATE OF
MICHOACAN...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM CST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.2N 101.9W
ABOUT 40 MI...65 KM SSW OF ZIHUATANEJO MEXICO
ABOUT 60 MI...95 KM SSE OF LAZARO CARDENAS MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1006 MB...29.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has issued a Tropical Storm Watch from
Lazaro Cardenas to Punta San Telmo.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Lazaro Cardenas to Punta San Telmo
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within 12 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the coast of southwestern Mexico should
monitor the progress of Mario.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM CST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Mario was
located near latitude 17.2 North, longitude 101.9 West.  Mario is
moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h), and this 
motion is expected to continue through this evening.  A slower 
motion toward the west-northwest is forecast tonight through the 
weekend.  On the forecast track, the center of Mario should move 
roughly parallel to the coast of Mexico through tonight, and then 
begin to move farther away from the coast on Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast during 
the next couple of days.
 
Mario is a tiny tropical storm, and tropical-storm-force winds 
extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) to the north of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Mario will lead to rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches, with
local amounts of 6 inches, across southern Mexico through Sunday.
This brings a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas of higher
terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Mario, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep3.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the
coast of Michoacan today.  Gusty winds are possible elsewhere along
coastal portions of the states of Guerrero, Michoacan, and Colima
through tonight.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1200 PM CST.
Next complete advisory at 300 PM CST.

Tropical Storm Mario Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP132025
900 AM CST Fri Sep 12 2025
 
37-GHz AMSR2 data from 0823 UTC did an excellent job showing the 
well-defined center of the small tropical cyclone about 20 n mi off 
the coast of Guerrero, Mexico.  As noted in the previous forecast, 
an ASCAT pass from overnight showed maximum winds just over 30 kt.  
The convective organization has been increasing since that time, 
and the depression has powered up to Tropical Storm Mario with 
maximum winds estimated at 35 kt.  This is supported by a T2.5/35 
kt from TAFB and 35-40 kt objective estimates from ADT, AiDT, and 
SATCON.

Model guidance is having a challenging time simulating Mario's 
future due to the storm's small size and proximity to Mexico's 
coastal topography.  Some models, including the ECWMF and many of 
the Google DeepMind ensemble members, show the system moving inland 
and dissipating today.  Assuming Mario stays offshore, it is likely 
to contend with moderate shear out of the north or northeast for the 
next 36 hours while moving over very warm water temperatures around 
30 degrees Celsius.  Shear is expected to be low beyond 36 hours, 
and some strengthening is therefore shown in the NHC intensity 
forecast.  Some of the hurricane models continue to show Mario 
reaching hurricane strength, but given the large degree of 
uncertainty, the NHC forecast leans much closer to the IVCN 
consensus at this time.  Mario is expected to reach colder waters by 
day 5, and transition to a post-tropical cyclone is shown at that 
time.

Mario has been moving faster toward the west-northwest (295/12 kt), 
moving roughly parallel to the coast of Mexico.  A mid-level ridge 
extending across northern Mexico westward over the Pacific waters 
is expected to keep Mario on a west-northwestward trajectory, but 
at a slower speed, for at least the next 4 days.  The models that 
maintain Mario's identity agree on this scenario, and no 
significant changes were made to the NHC track forecast.
 
Given Mario's very close proximity to the coast of Mexico, the 
government of Mexico has issued a Tropical Storm Watch for a small 
segment of the coast from Lazaro Cardenas to Punta San Telmo.
 
 
Key Messages:
1. Heavy rainfall associated with Tropical Storm Mario will impact 
southern Mexico through Sunday, which could result in flash 
flooding, particularly in areas of higher terrain.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the 
coast of Michoacan today while Mario moves roughly parallel to the 
southwestern coast of Mexico.  Gusty winds are possible elsewhere 
along the coasts of western Guerrero, Michoacan, and Colima through 
tonight.  Interests in these areas should continue to monitor the 
progress of Mario.
