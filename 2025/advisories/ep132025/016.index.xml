SUMMARY OF 800 AM PDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...22.7N 117.2W
ABOUT 465 MI...750 KM W OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1004 MB...29.65 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM PDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Mario was
located near latitude 22.7 North, longitude 117.2 West. Mario is
moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue with a decrease in forward 
speed over the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Mario will continue to weaken and is expected 
to become a post-tropical remnant low within the next day.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).

Tropical Storm Mario Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP132025
200 AM PDT Tue Sep 16 2025
 
After going a few hours with limited convection, Mario has had a 
recent convective burst near its estimated center. Its structure 
overall seems to be gradually degrading, with little in the way of 
banding features, and it appears the tropical cyclone is slowly 
succumbing to the increasingly negative thermodynamic conditions. 
Both subjective and objective intensity estimates have been 
decreasing, and the initial intensity will follow suit, lowering to 
45 kt this advisory.
 
Without much recent microwave or scatterometer data to go on, the
estimated motion remains a somewhat uncertain 310/10 kt. Mario
should continue to move along the western periphery of a mid-level
ridge centered over northern Mexico for the next day or so, but will
slow down as it loses its vertical structure. By the end of the
forecast the shallow low-level circulation will likely drift very
slowly. The latest track forecast is slightly west of the previous
one after 24 hours, electing to remain close to a blend of the
latest HCCA and GDMI guidance aids.
 
Mario is now crossing the 26 degree C sea-surface temperature
isotherm and cooler waters lie ahead, in addition to a stable dry
atmosphere and increasing southwesterly shear. Thus, weakening
should continue, and Mario is likely to lose all of its organized
convection in about 24 hours as its mid-level circulation decouples
and continues propagating off to the north. The small remnant low
left behind should open up into a trough in 60-72 h. This forecast
is in good agreement with the intensity guidance aid envelope.
 
While Mario is forecast to dissipate as a tropical cyclone well to 
the south of California, its remnant mid-level moisture will likely 
spread further north, affecting portions of southern California and 
Baja California later this week.
