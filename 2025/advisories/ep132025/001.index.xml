...TROPICAL DEPRESSION FORMS OFF THE COAST OF SOUTHERN MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM CST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.5N 98.8W
ABOUT 120 MI...195 KM SE OF ACAPULCO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 6 MPH...9 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1009 MB...29.80 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests along the coast of southwestern Mexico should monitor the
progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression
Thirteen-E was located near latitude 15.5 North, longitude 98.8
West. The depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 6 mph
(9 km/h) and this general motion with a gradual increase in 
forward speed is expected to continue for the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some slow strengthening is forecast during the next couple of 
days, and the system is expected to become a tropical storm in a 
day or so.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1009 mb (29.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Tropical Depression Thirteen-E will lead to rainfall 
totals of 2 to 4 inches, with local amounts of 6 inches, across 
southwest Mexico through Sunday. This brings a risk of flash 
flooding, especially in areas of higher terrain.

WIND:  Gusty winds are possible over portions of the southern coast 
of Mexico from Punta Maldonado through Manzanillo during the next 
day or so.

 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM CST.

Tropical Depression Thirteen-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP132025
300 PM CST Thu Sep 11 2025
 
High resolution GOES visible satellite imagery throughout today 
indicates that the disturbance south of Mexico has become better 
organized.  The system has a partially exposed low-level circulation 
located near an area of bursting deep convection with cloud top 
temperatures of less than -80 degrees C.  Subjective Dvorak 
classifications from TAFB and SAB are T2.5 and T2.0, respectively.  
Therefore, advisories have been initiated on Tropical Depression 
Thirteen-E with an initial intensity of 30 kt.  

The depression is moving at an uncertain 300/5 kt.  A mid-level 
ridge to centered over northern Mexico and Texas should steer the 
cyclone west-northwestward with an acceleration in forward speed 
during the next few days.  Over the weekend, the system should turn 
more northwestward as it rounds the periphery of the ridge and 
continue that motion through the end of the forecast period.  There 
is little cross-track variance in the guidance envelope, however, a 
bit more of an along-track spread.  The official track forecast lies 
between the various consensus aids and the Google DeepMind guidance.

The new cyclone has a rather small circulation.  In the next couple 
of days, global models suggest vertical wind shear and the proximity 
to land should limit the system's ability to strengthen.  By the 
weekend, environment conditions should become more conducive for 
steady strengthening.  The depression is forecast to reach 
tropical storm strength in a day or so and become a hurricane by 
day 3.  Late in the forecast period, cooler sea surface temperatures 
and dry mid-level humidities should induce a weakening trend.  The 
initial NHC intensity forecast lies on the higher end of the 
intensity guidance envelope.

Predicted tropical-storm-force winds are expected to remain 
offshore of the coast of Mexico.  However, heavy rains and 
potentially gusty winds are possible along portions of the 
southern coast of Mexico during the next day or so.
