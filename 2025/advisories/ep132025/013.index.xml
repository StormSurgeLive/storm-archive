DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Mario was
located near latitude 20.8 North, longitude 114.4 West. Mario is
moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this general
motion with some decrease in forward speed is forecast during the
next few days.
 
Satellite imagery indicates that the maximum sustained winds have
increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher gusts.  Little
change in strength is forecast today, with weakening likely to
begin on Tuesday.  Mario is anticipated to become a post-tropical
cyclone on Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 993 mb (29.33 inches).

Tropical Storm Mario Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP132025
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
200 PM MST Mon Sep 15 2025

The satellite presentation has improved with Mario during the day, 
with a more circular central dense overcast and consistent 
convection.  A recent 1838Z GPM microwave pass also shows the 
development of some inner-core features.  Subjective and objective 
Dvorak estimates range from 45-65 kt, a bit higher than earlier, so 
the initial intensity is set to 55 kt for this advisory. 
 
Mario is now moving northwestward (305/11 kt), steered between a 
mid-level ridge over northern Mexico and a mid-level low to its 
northwest.  The most notable thing about the track forecast is what 
happens when Mario becomes a remnant low in a couple of days.  
Model guidance has been leaning more to the northeast during the 
past few cycles as they seem to have caught onto a more vertically 
intact Mario.  While the new official forecast has been shifted to 
the north, it remains on the western side of the model consensus, 
closest to the ECMWF and Google Deep Mind solutions. 

The intensity forecast is a little tricky for Mario with it soon 
crossing into cooler waters with higher shear.  While the forecast 
shows weakening, it could hang on a bit stronger in the short-term 
if it is able to take advantage of its primitive inner-core.  Mario 
should begin to weaken in earnest on Tuesday when it gets over cold 
waters with much higher shear, causing it to lose convection in 
about 36 h and totally dissipate by 72h.  The new intensity forecast 
is similar to the previous one, between the model consensus and the 
HFIP Corrected Consensus model HCCA.
