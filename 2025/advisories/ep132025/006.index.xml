...MARIO WEAKENS TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION AS IT STARTS MOVING
AWAY FROM SOUTHWESTERN MEXICO...
...TROPICAL STORM WATCH DISCONTINUED FOR THE COAST OF MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM CST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.1N 104.6W
ABOUT 65 MI...105 KM SSW OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
ABOUT 175 MI...280 KM SSE OF CABO CORRIENTES MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1007 MB...29.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical Storm Watch
for the coast of Mexico.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests along the coast of southwestern Mexico should continue to
monitor the progress of Mario.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM CST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Mario
was located near latitude 18.1 North, longitude 104.6 West. The
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 15 mph       
(24 km/h), and this motion is expected to continue for the next 
several hours.  A slower motion toward the west-northwest is 
forecast later tonight through the weekend.  On the forecast track, 
the center of Mario should gradually move away from the coast of 
Mexico tonight and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are now near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Little change in strength is expected through Saturday 
night, and Mario is forecast to dissipate on Sunday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Tropical Depression Mario will lead to additional 
rainfall of 1 to 3 inches for Jalisco, with storm total amounts up 
to 6 inches locally through Saturday morning. This brings a risk of 
flash flooding, especially in areas of higher terrain.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Mario, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep3.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Gusty winds are possible along coastal portions of the
states of Guerrero, Michoacan, and Colima through tonight.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM CST.

Tropical Depression Mario Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP132025
900 PM CST Fri Sep 12 2025

The low-level center of Mario was apparent this afternoon near the 
convective mass just off of the coast of southwestern Mexico. Since 
that time, satellite imagery shows that a large low-pressure area is 
developing to the south of Mario, with vorticity centers noted near 
17N 106W and 15N 103W. This is causing the small circulation of 
Mario to lose its identity as it seems to be becoming a part of the 
larger circulation.  In addition, the convection near the center has 
decreased during the past several hours, and there has been a 
corresponding decrease in satellite intensity estimates. Based on 
these developments, Mario is downgraded to a tropical depression 
with an initial intensity of 30 kt.

The dynamical models show several possible scenarios for the 
evolution of Mario during the next few days. The ECMWF and Canadian 
models show the system dissipating as it becomes absorbed into the 
larger low during the next day or two. The UKMET does not absorb 
Mario into the low, but shows it degenerating into a trough and 
moving northwestward and then westward around the north side of the 
low. The GFS, in contrast, uses the Mario circulation to become the 
center of the larger low, although it keeps the winds below 35 kt 
through the forecast period. The regional hurricane models show the 
possibility of a tropical storm re-forming near or west of Socorro 
Island in a few days, although it is unclear whether this 
development is related to the current Mario circulation.  Given 
these scenarios, the current trends, and the previous forecast, the 
new intensity forecast calls for Mario to continue as a depression 
for 36 h before dissipating inside the larger low. However, an 
alternative scenario is that the circulation could degenerate to a 
trough at any time.

The initial motion is 290/13. If Mario manages to maintain its 
identity, it should turn more westward during the next 36 h as it 
moves around the north side of the larger low.
 
 
Key Messages:
1. Heavy rainfall associated with Mario will impact Jalisco and 
nearby areas into Saturday morning, which could result in flash 
flooding, particularly in areas of higher terrain.
 
2. While all coastal watches have been discontinued for Mexico, 
gusty winds are possible elsewhere along the coasts of western 
Guerrero, Michoacan, and Colima through tonight.  Interests in 
these areas should continue to monitor the progress of Mario.
