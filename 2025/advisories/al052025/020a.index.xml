--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* St. Martin and St. Barthelemy
* Sint Maarten
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within the next
12 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands,
and Puerto Rico, as well as in the Turks and Caicos and the
southeastern Bahamas should monitor the progress of Erin.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erin was located
near latitude 19.6 North, longitude 62.0 West. While the eye 
has wobbled westward during the past few hours, Erin is moving 
generally toward the west-northwest near 20 mph (31 km/h). This 
motion is expected to continue through the weekend with a gradual 
decrease in forward speed. A turn toward the north is expected to 
occur early next week. On the forecast track, the center of Erin is 
expected to move just north of the northern Leeward Islands, the 
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico over the weekend. 
 
Reports from NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds have increased to near     
145 mph (230 km/h) with higher gusts.  Erin is a category 4 
hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Continued 
rapid strengthening is expected today, followed by fluctuations in 
intensity through the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125
miles (205 km) mainly to the north of the center.
 
The latest minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force 
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft data is 935 mb (27.61 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: The outer bands of Erin are expected to produce areas of
heavy rainfall through Sunday across the northern Leeward Islands,
the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Rainfall totals of 2 to 4
inches, with isolated totals of 6 inches, are expected. Locally
considerable flash and urban flooding, along with landslides or
mudslides, are possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Erin, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area later today.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will affect portions of the northern
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and
the Turks and Caicos Islands through the weekend.  These swells will
spread to the Bahamas, Bermuda, and the east coast of the United
States early next week.  These rough ocean conditions will likely
cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult
products from your local weather forecast office for more
information.

Hurricane Erin Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
500 AM AST Sat Aug 16 2025
 
Erin is rapidly strengthening and is now a category 3 major 
hurricane. Satellite images indicate that Erin has a small eye and a 
compact and symmetric inner core. The hurricane has also been 
maintaining a large area of deep convection to the southwest of the 
core, and those outer rainbands are affecting the northern Leeward 
Islands. The Air Force Hurricane Hunters departed Erin a few hours 
ago, but on their last couple of passes through the center, the 
minimum pressure was steadily falling. Since the structure of the 
system has notably improved over the past few hours, the initial 
intensity is increased to 105 kt, and that could be conservative. 
Both the NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunters will be investigating 
Erin again later this morning, and that wealth of data will be very 
helpful in evaluating the cyclone's intensity and structure.
 
The system continues to move fairly quickly to the west-northwest at
about 17 kt on the south side of a subtropical ridge. This overall
motion should continue through the weekend, taking the core of Erin
to the north of the eastern Caribbean Islands through Sunday. After
that time, the western side of the ridge is expected to weaken, due
to a series of shortwave troughs, and that should cause Erin to slow
down and make a gradual turn to the north. The models agree on this
general theme, but there are some differences on where, when, and
how sharply Erin makes the northward turn. The NHC track forecast is
a touch to the left of the previous one to be in better agreement
with the latest consensus aids. Confidence continues to increase
that the core of Erin will pass to the east of the Bahamas and the
United States.
 
Erin is expected to continue to rapidly strengthen over the next 12
hours while it remains in favorable conditions of warm water, low
wind shear, and in an environment of high moisture. Erin will likely
become a Category 4 hurricane later today and strengthening could
continue through tonight. By early next week, however, an increase
in shear should end the strengthening trend and induce gradual
weakening. The NHC intensity forecast lies above the guidance for
the first 24 to 36 hours, and then falls near the middle of the
guidance envelope after that.
 
Although Erin is a somewhat compact hurricane now, the models are in
strong agreement that the system will grow in size over the next
several days. In fact, by the middle of next week, Erin is forecast
to at least double or triple in size, which will result in rough
ocean conditions over the western Atlantic.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall at times through Sunday across the northern
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico may lead to
locally considerable flash and urban flooding, along with landslides
or mudslides.
 
2. Gusts to tropical storm force in Erin's outer rainbands
are possible in portions of the the northern Leeward Islands
later today and over portions of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico
tonight and Sunday.
 
3. Erin is expected to produce dangerous surf and rip currents
along the beaches of the Bahamas, much of the east coast of the
U.S., and Atlantic Canada next week.
 
4.  Interests in Bermuda should continue to monitor the progress of
Erin since there is a risk of strong winds, heavy rainfall,
and high surf by the middle part of next week.
