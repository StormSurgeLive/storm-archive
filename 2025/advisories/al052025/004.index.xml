Tropical Storm Erin Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
500 AM AST Tue Aug 12 2025

The storm has not become significantly better organized on 
geostationary satellite imagery over the past few hours.  Deep 
convection has diminished in intensity, as evidenced by a warming of 
the cloud tops.  An AMSR microwave image from a few hours ago showed 
a well-defined banding feature over the southern semicircle of the 
system.  Subjective Dvorak intensity estimates range from 35 to 45 
kt and objective estimates from UW-CIMSS are generally near 40 kt.  
Thus the advisory intensity is held at 40 kt. 

Erin continues its rapid westward motion, at around 265/19 kt.  
A strong 500 mb ridge is situated to the north of the cyclone, 
resulting in a strong easterly steering current.  The tropical 
cyclone should continue on a general westward heading for the next 
few days with a gradual decrease in forward speed as the ridge 
weakens slightly.  Later in the forecast period, the ridge is 
expected to weaken a little more, and a more west-northwestward 
track is likely.   The official forecast track is a little left, or 
south, of the previous one in 3-5 days, and very close to the 
latest dynamical model consensus.  This also very similar to the 
mean of the GFS and ECMWF solutions.  The spread of the track 
models suggest near-average confidence in the NHC forecast.

During the forecast period, Erin will be traversing warmer 
ocean waters and the SHIPS model diagnoses low vertical wind shear 
over the system for the next several days.  However, the model does 
not indicate an increase in the environmental low- to 
mid-tropospheric humidity during the next 72 hours or so.  
Nonetheless, given the low shear and increasing SSTs, strengthening 
is expected.  The official intensity forecast is at the high end of 
the model guidance and shows Erin becoming a major hurricane in 
around 5 days.  There is significant uncertainty in intensity 
predictions at this time range.


KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. It is still too early to determine what impacts, if any, Erin may
bring to the northern Leeward Islands, Bermuda, or the east coast of
the United States. As we approach the climatological peak of the
hurricane season, this is an opportune time to ensure your
preparedness plans are in place.
