Tropical Storm Erin Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
200 PM CVT Mon Aug 11 2025

The system we have been monitoring that moved across the Cabo Verde 
Islands over the past 6-12 h (Invest 97L) has maintained a small, 
but persistent area of deep convection. This activity prompted an 
earlier TAFB subjective Dvorak fix of T2.5/35 kt suggesting the 
convection is now sufficently organized to be classified as a 
tropical cyclone. We also received scatterometer data at 1107 UTC 
with a peak wind retrieval of 39 kt embedded in this convection, 
with an ambiguity analysis suggesting the circulation is also 
well defined, albeit still somewhat elongated on the eastern edge. 
The combination of all this data suggests that a tropical storm has 
formed, and NHC is initiating advisories on Tropical Storm Erin with 
a current intensity of 40 kt.

Erin is moving quickly off to the west, with the motion estimated at 
275/17 kt. Over the next few days, this motion should continue with 
possibly some slight south-of-due-west motion. Erin's motion is 
primarily influenced by an east-to-west oriented mid-level ridge 
draped across the subtropical Atlantic basin. By the end of the 
forecast period, this ridge may start to become more oriented to the 
northeast of Erin, inducing a more poleward motion by 120 h. The 
initial NHC track forecast elects to stick fairly close to the HFIP 
corrected consensus approach (HCCA), which is a touch on the south 
side of the overall track guidance envelope. It should be noted that 
spread in the track guidance, especially the ensembles, begins to 
increase markedly at the end of the forecast period.

The intensity forecast in the short-term is a little tricky. The 
earlier scatterometer data indicate the system has a small 
circulation which could be prone to rapid intensity changes, either 
up or down. While vertical wind shear over the system is forecast to 
be low, between 5-10 kt over the next 72 hours, sea-surface 
temperatures are more marginal, around 26-27C, with a decent amount 
of dry mid-level air along the path of the tropical storm. The first 
NHC intensity forecast will thus only forecast slow intensification 
in the short-term, assuming the marginal SSTs and lack of mid-level 
moisture will keep the small vortex in check. After 48 h, however, 
the SSTs start to gradually increase and should allow the local 
environment of Erin to moisten up. Thus, the rate of intensification 
will likely increase in the second half of the forecast period. The 
NHC intensity forecast is a little on the high side of the guidance 
in the short-term, partially due to the initial intensity, but is in 
line with the HCCA intensity aid. By 120 h, the hurricane-regional 
models (e.g., HWRF/HAFS), and statistical-dynamical aids 
(EC-SHIPS/LGEM) show Erin becoming a major hurricane, and that will 
be explicitly forecast at the end of the period.
