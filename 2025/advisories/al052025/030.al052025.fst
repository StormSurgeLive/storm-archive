DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erin was located
near latitude 24.0 North, longitude 71.3 West. Erin is moving toward
the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A turn to the north is 
expected on Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the core of Erin is 
expected to pass to the east of the southeastern and central 
Bahamas today and tonight, and move between Bermuda and the east 
coast of the United States by the middle of the week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 140 mph (220 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Erin is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Erin is likely to remain a dangerous major 
hurricane through the middle of this week.

Erin is an unusually large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend 
outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 937 mb (27.67 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Outer bands of Erin will produce localized areas of heavy 
rainfall across portions of Hispaniola this evening and through 
Tuesday for the Turks and Caicos, the southeast Bahamas, and the 
easternmost central Bahamas.  Additional rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, 
with locally higher amounts to 6 inches, are forecast.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Erin, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected through this evening 
across the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeast Bahamas. 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in portions of the central 
Bahamas tonight through Tuesday.  Tropical storm conditions are 
possible over portions of the North Carolina Outer Banks beginning 
late Wednesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will affect the Bahamas, Bermuda,
the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada during the
next several days. These rough ocean conditions will likely cause
life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult products
from your local weather forecast office for more information.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
STORM SURGE:  Minor coastal flooding is possible in areas of
onshore winds in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeast
Bahamas.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large
waves.

The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause 
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters 
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the 
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if 
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Cape Lookout to Duck, North Carolina 2 to 4 ft 

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the 
surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge 
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For 
information specific to your area, please see products issued by 
your local National Weather Service forecast office.

inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak 
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
