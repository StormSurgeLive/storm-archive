Tropical Storm Erin Advisory Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
1100 AM AST Wed Aug 13 2025
 
...ERIN CONTINUES GENERALLY WESTWARD...
...EXPECTED TO BECOME A HURRICANE IN A COUPLE OF DAYS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.3N 43.4W
ABOUT 1305 MI...2100 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 265 DEGREES AT 17 MPH...28 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1004 MB...29.65 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of Erin.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Erin was
located near latitude 16.3 North, longitude 43.4 West. Erin is
moving toward the west near 17 mph (28 km/h). This general motion
is expected to continue into Thursday, with a west-northwestward 
motion beginning Thursday night and continuing into the weekend.
On the forecast track, the center of Erin is likely to move near or
just north of the northern Leeward Islands over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is forecast to begin later today or tonight, 
and Erin is expected to become a hurricane by Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will begin affecting portions of the
northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by this
weekend.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather forecast office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found

Tropical Storm Erin Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
1100 AM AST Wed Aug 13 2025

Erin continues to have a ragged overall appearance, with one burst 
of convection just southwest of the center and skeletal convective 
bands elsewhere in the northwestern semicircle. Various subjective 
and objective satellite intensity estimates are in the 30-45 kt 
range, and these have changed little over the past several hours. 
A just-received scatterometer overpass shows winds near 40 kt just 
north of the center, and based on these data the initial intensity 
is held at 40 kt.

Erin continues to struggle to intensify, likely due to its track 
over persistent sea surface temperatures of 26-27C and entrainment 
of dry and stable air.  The forecast track keeps the system over 
these marginal SSTs for another 24 h or so, followed by a motion 
over increasing SSTs that reach 29-30C by the end of the forecast 
period. The cyclone is currently in a favorable low- to 
moderate-shear environment, and this is likely to continue for the 
next 72 h.  This evolution should allow Erin to significantly 
intensify, with the cyclone forecast to become a hurricane by 48 h 
and a major hurricane by 96 hr.  After 72-96 h, Erin may encounter 
increased northerly shear as it tracks to the northeast of a 
large upper-level anticyclone forecast to form near Hispaniola and 
the southeastern Bahamas. Although the strength of shear the cyclone 
will encounter is uncertain, the intensity guidance suggests a lower 
rate of intensification at that time. The new intensity forecast is 
little changed from the previous forecast and is in best agreement 
with the intensity consensus.

The initial motion is now 265/15 kt. While a strong low- to 
mid-level ridge currently is situated to the north of Erin, in a day 
or two a slight weakness is forecast to develop in this ridge near 
65W longitude.  This should cause the tropical cyclone to turn 
west-northwestward after 24 h, with some decrease in forward speed 
after 72 h.  After 96 h, a developing break in the ridge near the 
southeastern coast of the United States should lead to a 
northwestward motion. The track guidance is in fairly good 
agreement, and the official forecast on the southern side of the 
guidance envelope between the HCCA corrected consensus and the other 
consensus models. The new track is similar to the previous track 
through 72 h and a little west of the previous track thereafter. 
Users are reminded that NHC track forecasts have an average error of 
150 to 215 miles at days 4 and 5, and future adjustments to the 
forecast are still possible.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erin could move close enough to the northern Leeward Islands, the
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico over the weekend to produce some
impacts on those islands.  However, the magnitude of those impacts
is still not known, and interests there should continue to monitor
the progress of this storm.
 
2. There is even greater uncertainty in what impacts might occur in
portions of the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, the east coast of
the United States, and Bermuda next week.  As we approach the
climatological peak of the hurricane season, this is an opportune
time to ensure your preparedness plans are in place.
