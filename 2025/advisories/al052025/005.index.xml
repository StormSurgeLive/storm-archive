Tropical Storm Erin Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
1100 AM AST Tue Aug 12 2025
 
Erin still has a well-defined low-level circulation, but the
convective pattern has degraded since overnight, with only a band
of moderate convection located within the southern part of the
circulation.  A 1226 UTC ASCAT-C pass showed a maximum wind barb of
36 kt north of the center, and the intensity is held at a possibly 
generous 40 kt.  Most likely, this is a result of Erin's fast 
motion, which has been south of due west (265 deg) at about 20 kt.
 
The guidance suite indicates that Erin may continue to lose some 
latitude during the next 24 to 36 hours due to strong low- to 
mid-level ridging over the eastern and central Atlantic, but overall 
the general motion should be westward through early Thursday.  After 
that time, indications are that the ridge may weaken over the 
western and central Atlantic, causing Erin to turn 
west-northwestward, but there are model discrepancies on when
that might happen and where the break in the ridge actually forms.
The trend has been for a weaker Erin in the short term and possibly
a stronger ridge, and a number of track models, including HAFS-A and
-B, HWRF, the European, HCCA, and the Google Deep Mind, have shifted
south and west for much of the 5-day forecast.  The NHC forecast has
shifted in that direction accordingly, and it should be noted that a
significant number of deterministic models and ensemble members
still lie even farther south.
 
The environment of marginal water temperatures (26-27 deg Celsius) 
and low atmospheric instability and moisture appear to remain 
nearly constant for the next 24 hours or so.  Therefore, little to 
no intensification is expected through early Wednesday.  The 
environment and water temperatures become much more suitable for 
strengthening by 48 hours, and since the cyclone already has a 
well-defined structure, it could become a hurricane by late 
Thursday.  Continued strengthening is forecast after that time, and 
the NHC forecast continues to show Erin becoming a major hurricane 
by day 5 (early Sunday).  There is quite a lot of spread in the 
intensity models, and the NHC prediction is in the upper regime of 
the envelope, close to the SHIPS model, Florida State 
Superensemble, and ICON intensity consensus.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Although it is still too early to know exactly what impacts Erin 
might bring to the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, 
and Puerto Rico, the risk has increased for Erin to move closer to 
these islands over the weekend.  Interests there should monitor the 
progress of this storm.

2. There is even greater uncertainty in what impacts, if any, might 
occur in portions of the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, the east 
coast of the United States, and Bermuda next week.  As we approach 
the climatological peak of the hurricane season, this is an 
opportune time to ensure your preparedness plans are in place.
