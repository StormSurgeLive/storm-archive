DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Erin was 
located near latitude 17.1 North, longitude 52.7 West. Erin is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h). This motion 
expected to continue into the weekend. On the forecast track, the 
center of Erin is likely to move near or just north of the northern 
Leeward Islands over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Additional strengthening is expected during the next few 
days and Erin is expected to become a hurricane tonight and could 
become a major hurricane by this weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Erin is expected to produce areas of heavy
rainfall beginning late Friday and continuing through the weekend
across the northernmost Leeward Islands, the U.S. and British Virgin
Islands, as well as southern and eastern Puerto Rico.  Rainfall
totals of 2 to 4 inches, with isolated totals of 6 inches, are
expected.  This rainfall may lead to isolated flash and urban
flooding, along with landslides or mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Erin, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area by early Saturday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will begin affecting portions of the 
northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by this 
weekend, and will likely spread to the eastern United States coast 
by next week.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening 
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your 
local weather forecast office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Tropical Storm Erin Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
500 PM AST Thu Aug 14 2025
 
Erin has changed little in organization during the past several
hours.  Conventional satellite imagery shows that the storm
continues to produce strong convection near the center.  However, a
recently received AMSR2 overpass shows that the convection is
confined mainly to the southwestern quadrant and lacks well-defined
banding.  Satellite intensity estimates are now in the 45-55 kt
range, and the initial intensity remains 50 kt for this advisory.
A NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft is en route investigate the 
system this evening, providing information on the storm's strength 
and structure. 
 
There is little change to either the intensity philosophy or 
forecast since the last advisory. Erin will be in an environment of 
light-to-moderate easterly vertical shear and moving over increasing 
sea surface temperatures during the next 48 h. These conditions 
should allow a faster rate of intensification during this time, and 
Erin is still forecast to become a hurricane by 24 h. The 
environment becomes less conducive after 48 h, with the global 
models forecasting northwesterly shear over the cyclone as a large 
upper-level anticyclone develops to the west. Despite this forecast 
shear, the global and regional hurricane models forecast 
intensification to continue, although at a slower rate than during 
the first 48 h. Based on these forecasts, the new intensity forecast 
shows steady intensification through 48 h, followed by a slower rate 
of development during the remainder of the forecast period.  The new 
forecast is an update of the previous forecast. It should be noted 
that there is some guidance that suggests a possibility Erin could 
intensify further than shown in the official forecast.
 
The initial motion is now 280/15 kt. The storm continues to be 
steered by a subtropical ridge to the north, and this ridge should 
steer the cyclone generally west-northwestward during the next three 
days. After that time, the western portion of the ridge is forecast 
to weaken or break due to the influence of the mid-latitude 
westerlies over the northeastern United States.  This evolution 
should lead to Erin turning toward the northwest or north-northwest 
during the remainder of the forecast period, although there remains 
significant spread in the guidance on just how sharp this turn will 
be.  The new forecast track is a little south of the previous track 
through 72 h, and then it is nudged a little to the west of the 
previous track at 96 and 120 h. Due to the spread in the track 
guidance later in the forecast period,  there is still a greater 
than normal uncertainty about what impacts Erin may bring to 
portions of the Bahamas, the east coast of the United States, and 
Bermuda in the long range.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:

1. Heavy rainfall across the northernmost Leeward Islands, the U.S.
and British Virgin Islands, as well as southern and eastern Puerto
Rico, may lead to isolated flash and urban flooding, along with
landslides or mudslides this weekend into early next week.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible for portions of the 
northern Leeward Islands, where Tropical Storm Watches are in 
effect, beginning on Saturday as the core of Erin passes north of 
those islands.  Tropical storm conditions could also occur in 
portions of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico later in the weekend, 
and additional watches may be required tonight or on Friday.  
 
3. While there is still uncertainty in what impacts might occur in 
portions of the Bahamas, the east coast of the United States, and 
Bermuda next week, the risk of dangerous surf and rip currents 
across the western Atlantic basin next week is increasing.
