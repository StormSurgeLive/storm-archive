DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erin was located
near latitude 33.5 North, longitude 72.7 West.  Erin is now moving 
toward the north-northeast near 17 mph (28 km/h).  A faster motion 
toward the northeast and east-northeast is expected later today and 
on Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of Erin will move over 
the western Atlantic between the U.S. east coast and Bermuda today 
through early Friday, and then pass south of Atlantic Canada Friday 
and Saturday.
 
Reports from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft indicate 
that maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is expected over the next several days, 
and Erin is likely to become post-tropical by Saturday.
 
Erin is a large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend outward up 
to 105 miles (165 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds 
extend outward up to 300 miles (480 km).  A sustained wind of 40 
mph (65 km/h) and a gust to 46 mph (74 km/h) were recently reported 
at the U.S. Coast Guard Station Hatteras.
 
The minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data is 945 mb 
(27.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of the
North Carolina Outer Banks and will spread northward along the 
Virginia coastline later this morning.  Elsewhere along the 
mid-Atlantic and southern New England coast, wind gusts to tropical 
storm force are likely today through early Friday.  Tropical storm 
conditions are possible on Bermuda later today through early 
Friday.  Gale conditions are possible along portions of the coast of 
Nova Scotia beginning early Friday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will affect the Bahamas, Bermuda,
the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada during the
next several days. These rough ocean conditions are expected to
cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult
products from your local weather forecast office for more
information.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Cape Lookout to Duck, North Carolina...2 to 4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: The outer bands of Erin may bring up to 1 inch of rainfall
to the Outer Banks of North Carolina today.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Erin, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Erin Discussion Number  39
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
1100 PM EDT Wed Aug 20 2025
 
Satellite imagery and reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft indicate little change in Erin during the past 
several hours. The aircraft reported a central pressure near 942 
mb, and the wind data showed two concentric wind maxima - a weaker 
one about 15 n mi from the center and a stronger one 60-70 n mi 
from the center. The maximum 700-mb flight-level winds in the outer 
wind band are near 105 kt. Based on the lack of change since 
earlier, the initial intensity remains 95 kt, which is near the 
average of the various subjective and objective satellite intensity 
estimates.

The initial motion is now 010/14 kt. The steering scenario and 
track forecast reasoning are again unchanged from the previous 
advisory. Erin should move around the western and northwestern 
periphery of the subtropical ridge during the next 12-24 h, passing 
between Bermuda and the U.S. east coast.  After that, the system 
should accelerate northeastward and east-northeastward while
embedded within the mid-latitude westerlies over the north 
Atlantic. The track guidance has changed little, and the new track 
forecast is an update of the previous forecast.

A little strengthening could occur during the next 12 h or so, 
although the concentric wind maxima structure argues against 
significant strengthening. After 12 h, Erin should encounter 
increasing westerly shear and move over colder sea surface 
temperatures, which should result in steady weakening. The system 
is also expected to merge with a frontal system to become an 
extratropical low, and while this is currently forecast to occur 
by 72 h it could happen earlier.  Erin should continue to weaken 
after extratropical transition as it moves east-northeastward 
across the north Atlantic.
 
Erin is an unusually large hurricane.  For hurricanes north of 30N
latitude, its tropical-storm-force wind radii are in the 75th
percentile of the Atlantic basin record.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erin is expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip 
currents along the beaches of the Bahamas, much of the east coast of 
the U.S., Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada during the next several days. 
Beachgoers in those areas should follow advice from lifeguards, 
local authorities, and beach warning flags.
 
2. Storm surge flooding and tropical storm conditions are expected 
in the North Carolina Outer Banks through Thursday.  The storm surge 
will be accompanied by large waves, leading to significant beach 
erosion and overwash, making some roads impassible.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected on Thursday along the 
Virginia coast. Wind gusts to tropical storm force are likely along 
portions of the remainder of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and southern New 
England coasts Thursday through early Friday.
 
4. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda on Thursday and 
Friday.  Gusts to gale force are possible along the coast of Nova 
Scotia on Friday and Newfoundland on Saturday.
