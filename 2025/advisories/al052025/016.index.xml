However, shower activity has increased some over the <br />past few hours and the system could become a short-lived tropical <br />depression before it moves inland over northeastern Mexico or <br />southern Texas this afternoon or evening.  Regardless of <br />development, locally heavy rainfall is possible along portions of <br />northeastern Mexico and southern Texas over the next couple of <br />days, and interests there should monitor the progress of this <br />system.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Erin was
located near latitude 17.8 North, longitude 54.4 West. Erin is
moving toward the west-northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h). This motion
is expected to continue into the weekend. On the forecast track, the
center of Erin is likely to move near or just north of the northern
Leeward Islands over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts. Steady strengthening is expected during the next few days and
Erin is forecast to become a hurricane later today and could become
a major hurricane by this weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data is 997 mb 
(29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Erin is expected to produce areas of heavy
rainfall beginning late Friday and continuing through the weekend
across the northernmost Leeward Islands, the U.S. and British Virgin
Islands, as well as southern and eastern Puerto Rico.  Rainfall
totals of 2 to 4 inches, with isolated totals of 6 inches, are
expected. This rainfall may lead to isolated flash and urban
flooding, along with landslides or mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Erin, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area by early Saturday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will begin affecting portions of the
northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by this
weekend, and will likely spread to the western Atlantic next
week.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather forecast office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found

Tropical Storm Erin Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
500 AM AST Fri Aug 15 2025
 
Erin has struggled to become better organized tonight, as the system 
is still trying to establish an inner core. Convection has 
diminished over the low-level center in recent hours due to some dry 
air entrainment. The Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters have been 
investigating the system this morning and found maximum flight-level 
winds of 52 kt. Recent infrared satellite imagery depicts a deep 
convective band becoming established in the southern semi-circle 
although flight-level aircraft data found little wind within that 
band. Objective satellite intensity estimates range from 55 to 67 
kt. Given the latest recon data and satellite estimates, the 
intensity is held at a potentially generous 60 kt. A NOAA P-3 
hurricane hunter aircraft is en route to investigate the system, and 
hopefully Tail Doppler Radar data will be able to better assess the 
structure of the system.
 
Erin is moving west-northwestward at an estimated motion of 285/15 
kt. A subtropical ridge to the north will continue to steer the 
system west-northwestward into the weekend. A weakness in the ridge 
is forecast to develop early next week, and this will result in the 
system gradually turning northwestward then northward by the end of 
the forecast period. The guidance is in fairly good agreement 
through about 60-72 hours. After 72 hours, there are some 
differences in the forward speed and cross-track spread with the 
turn toward the north. The regional hurricane models lie along the 
western edge of the guidance envelope with the GFS and Google 
DeepMind models remaining on the eastern edge of the guidance. The 
latest NHC forecast is similar to the previous one in the short 
term, and was nudged slightly west beyond day 3 closer to some of 
the simple consensus aids. There is still uncertainty about what 
impacts Erin may bring to portions of the Bahamas, the east coast of 
the United States, and Bermuda in the long range.
 
The storm is in a favorable environment for strengthening, and it 
will likely intensify once the inner core becomes more organized. 
Sea surface temperatures have warmed to about 28C and should 
continue to warm to near 30C along the forecast track, with a slight 
decrease in shear expected over the next day or so. Although SHIPS 
guidance depicts a slight increase in shear later this weekend, the 
upper-level wind pattern becomes a little more favorable with 
increasing mid-level RH values. The NHC forecast is similar to the 
previous with a steady rate of strengthening and lies near the 
consensus aids, with Erin forecast to become a hurricane later 
today, and a major hurricane late this weekend. Some of the 
hurricane regional models and the Florida State Superensemble depict 
a higher peak intensity than the current NHC forecast. Regardless of 
the details, Erin will be a large and powerful hurricane over the 
southwestern Atlantic Ocean this weekend.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall across the northernmost Leeward Islands, the U.S.
and British Virgin Islands, as well as southern and eastern Puerto
Rico, may lead to isolated flash and urban flooding, along with
landslides or mudslides this weekend into early next week.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible for portions of the
northern Leeward Islands, where Tropical Storm Watches are in
effect, beginning on Saturday as the core of Erin passes north of
those islands.  Tropical storm conditions could also occur in
portions of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico later in the weekend,
and additional watches may be required later today.
 
3. While there is still uncertainty in what impacts might occur in
portions of the Bahamas, the east coast of the United States, and
Bermuda next week, the risk of dangerous surf and rip currents
across the western Atlantic basin next week continues to increase.
