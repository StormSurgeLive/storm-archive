BULLETIN
Hurricane Erin Intermediate Advisory Number 18A
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
800 PM AST Fri Aug 15 2025
 
...ERIN INTENSIFYING AS IT NEARS ITS CLOSEST APPROACH TO THE NORTH 
OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 PM AST...0000 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.4N 58.5W
ABOUT 310 MI...500 KM ENE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...85 MPH...140 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 17 MPH...28 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...982 MB...29.00 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Meteorological Service of Antigua/Barbuda has discontinued 
the Tropical Storm Watch for the island of Barbuda.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Anguilla
* St. Martin and St. Barthelemy
* Saba and St. Eustatius
* Sint Maarten
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case over the next 24 
hours. 
 
Interests elsewhere in the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands,
and Puerto Rico, as well as in the Turks and Caicos and the
southeastern Bahamas should monitor the progress of Erin.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erin was located
near latitude 19.4 North, longitude 58.5 West. Erin is moving toward
the west-northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h). This motion is expected
to continue through the weekend with a gradual decrease in forward 
speed. On the forecast track, the center of Erin is likely to move 
just north of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and 
Puerto Rico over the weekend.
 
NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft data indicates that maximum 
sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Steady to rapid strengthening is expected over the next few 
days, and Erin is forecast to become a major hurricane during the 
weekend. Both NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
are investigating Erin this evening.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles 
(185 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
dropsonde data is 982 mb (29.00 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: The outer bands of Erin are expected to produce areas of
heavy rainfall tonight into Sunday across the northern Leeward
Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Rainfall totals of 2
to 4 inches, with isolated totals of 6 inches, are expected. This
rainfall may lead to isolated and locally considerable flash and
urban flooding, along with landslides or mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Erin, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area by early Saturday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will begin affecting portions of the
northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by this
weekend, and will likely spread to the western Atlantic early next 
week. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and 
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local 
weather forecast office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found

NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Erin Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
500 PM AST Fri Aug 15 2025

Erin continues to slowly become better organized, with convective 
banding increasing near the center and a couple of attempts to form 
an eye.  Earlier Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter data did not 
show any increase in winds after the previous advisory, although 
the central pressure fell to near 993 mb.  Satellite intensity 
estimates are in the 60-75 kt range and are gradually increasing. 
The initial intensity is held at 65 kt pending the arrival of the 
next NOAA and Air Force aircraft this evening.
 
The initial motion is 290 to 295 degrees at 15 kt. The subtropical 
ridge to the north will continue to steer Erin west-northwestward 
through the weekend, although the motion during the next 36 h or so 
may be closer to 285 degrees.  After that time, encroaching 
mid-latitude westerly flow is forecast to cause a weakness to 
develop in the ridge, and this will cause Erin to gradually turn 
northward with a decrease in forward speed. The guidance remains in 
fairly good agreement through about 72 hours. After that time, 
there are still differences in both the forward speed and 
cross-track spread with regards the turn toward the north. The 
regional hurricane models again lie along the western edge of the 
guidance envelope, while the GFS remains on the eastern edge.  
Overall, though, there again has been little change in the guidance 
envelope and the new forecast track has only minor adjustments from 
the previous track.  

Erin is forecast to be in an environment of light to occasionally 
moderate northwesterly vertical shear and over sea surface 
temperatures that warm to 29-30C along the forecast track. However, 
there is also a large area of mid-level dry and African dust to the 
north of the hurricane, and the satellite appearance suggests Erin 
is ingesting tongues of dry air.  Although the environment may not 
be ideal, the regional hurricane models are in excellent agreement 
that Erin will reach a peak intensity at or above 120 kt during the 
next 2-4 days.  Based on this, the new intensity forecast now calls 
for a peak intensity of 125 kt in 72 h, and it is possible Erin 
could get stronger than this. As the hurricane gets stronger, there 
is a high chance that eyewall replacement cycles will cause 
fluctuations in intensity that are not included in the current 
forecast. It is also expected that Erin will become very large and 
powerful hurricane by the end of the forecast period in the 
southwestern Atlantic, and the current forecast wind radii at 96-120 
h may not be large enough.


KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall tonight through Sunday across the northern Leeward
Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico may lead to isolated
and locally considerable flash and urban flooding, along with
landslides or mudslides.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible for portions of the
northern Leeward Islands, where Tropical Storm Watches are in
effect, beginning on Saturday as the core of Erin passes north of
those islands.  Gusts to tropical storm force are possible in
rainbands over portions of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico later
in the weekend.
 
3. While the threat of direct impacts in the Bahamas and along the
east coast of the United States appears to be gradually decreasing,
there will still be a significant risk of dangerous surf and rip
currents along western Atlantic beaches next week.
 
4.  Interests in Bermuda should continue to monitor the progress of
Erin since there is still a risk of strong winds, heavy rainfall,
and high surf by the middle part of next week.
