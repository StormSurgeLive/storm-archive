BULLETIN
Post-Tropical Cyclone Erin Advisory Number  46
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
500 PM AST Fri Aug 22 2025
 
...ERIN BECOMES POST-TROPICAL, THIS IS THE LAST ADVISORY...
...SWIMMING AT MANY U.S. EAST COAST BEACHES IS LIKELY TO REMAIN
DANGEROUS THROUGH THE WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...40.0N 59.7W
ABOUT 605 MI...970 KM NNE OF BERMUDA
ABOUT 375 MI...605 KM SSE OF HALIFAX NOVA SCOTIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 65 DEGREES AT 33 MPH...54 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...957 MB...28.26 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Erin
was located near latitude 40.0 North, longitude 59.7 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east-northeast near 33
mph (54 km/h).  This general motion with an increase in forward 
speed is expected later today, followed by a turn back to the 
northeast on Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Erin 
will pass south of Atlantic Canada today and tonight, and then race 
across the north Atlantic waters.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Erin is likely to remain a large and powerful 
hurricane-force low pressure system through the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 435
miles (705 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 957 mb (28.26 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Gale-force wind gusts are possible along portions of the
coast of Nova Scotia today and the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland
on Saturday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will affect the Bahamas, Bermuda,
the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada during the
next few days. These rough ocean conditions are expected to
cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult
products from your local weather forecast office for more
information.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
STORM SURGE:  Some coastal flooding is expected at times of high 
tide along portions of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and New England coasts
through tonight, making some roads impassable.  See updates from
your local National Weather Service office for details.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Erin Discussion Number  46
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
500 PM AST Fri Aug 22 2025

Erin has now become a powerful extratropical low.  While there is 
still deep convection near the center, scatterometer data clearly 
shows that Erin has become frontal.  Thus, extratropical transition 
has been completed, and this is the last NHC advisory.  The initial 
intensity remains 80 kt based on the multiple earlier scatterometer 
winds near 70 kt, with very large gale- and storm-force wind-radii 
noted.  

While the general track and intensity forecast is about the same as 
before, one specific marine hazard to highlight is the consistent 
development of a strong sting jet in the southern semicircle of Erin 
by Sunday, as well as a very large hurricane-force wind field.  
Model guidance now suggest that a maximum of 80-90 kt is possible, 
and the NHC intensity forecast is raised to 85 kt then.  No other 
noteworthy changes were made to the previous forecast.

Additional information on this system can be found in High Seas
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erin will continue to produce life-threatening surf and rip
currents along the beaches of the Bahamas, much of the east coast of
the U.S., Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada during the next few days.
Beachgoers in those areas should follow advice from lifeguards,
local authorities, and beach warning flags.
 
2. Some coastal flooding is expected at times of high tide along 
portions of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and New England coasts through 
tonight, making some roads impassable.  Large waves along the coast 
could also cause significant beach erosion and overwash.
 
3. Gale-force wind gusts are possible along the coast of Nova Scotia
today and the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland on Saturday.
