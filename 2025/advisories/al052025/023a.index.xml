Hurricane Erin Intermediate Advisory Number 23A
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
200 AM AST Sun Aug 17 2025
 
...ERIN'S OUTER RAINBANDS PRODUCING GUSTY WINDS AND HEAVY RAINS 
ACROSS THE VIRGIN ISLANDS AND PUERTO RICO... 
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM AST...0600 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.4N 66.1W
ABOUT 140 MI...220 KM N OF SAN JUAN PUERTO RICO
ABOUT 330 MI...535 KM ESE OF GRAND TURK ISLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...125 MPH...205 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...940 MB...27.76 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Turks and Caicos Islands
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case in the next 24 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the
southeast and central Bahamas should monitor the progress of 
Erin.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erin was located 
near latitude 20.4 North, longitude 66.1 West. Erin is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). This motion with a 
decrease in forward speed is expected today, followed by a turn 
to the north on Monday and Tuesday. On the forecast track, the 
core of Erin is expected to pass to the east of the Turks and 
Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas tonight and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Erin is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Fluctuations in intensity are expected over 
the next day or two due to inner-core structural changes.
 
Erin is becoming a larger system. Hurricane-force winds extend 
outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km).
 
The minimum central pressure based on data from the Air Force 
Hurricane Hunters is 940 mb (27.76 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: The outer bands of Erin will continue to produce areas of
heavy rainfall today across the northern Leeward Islands,
the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Rainfall totals of 2 to 4
inches, with isolated totals of 8 inches, are expected. Locally
considerable flash and urban flooding, along with landslides or
mudslides, are possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Erin, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
in the Turks and Caicos Islands beginning tonight. Squalls with
wind gusts to tropical storm force could occur over portions
of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico today and across the 
southeast and central Bahamas tonight through Tuesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will continue to affect portions of 
the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, 
Hispaniola, and the Turks and Caicos Islands during the next couple 
of days. These swells will spread to the Bahamas, Bermuda, the 
east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada during the 
early and middle portions of the week.  These rough ocean conditions 
will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please 
consult products from your local weather forecast office for more 
information.

Hurricane Erin Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
1100 PM AST Sat Aug 16 2025
 
After rapidly intensifying for the first part of the day, Erin now
appears to be in the middle stages of an eyewall replacement cycle
(ERC). Both the NOAA and Air Force Reserve reconnaissance have
indicated concentric eyewalls on their missions this evening, and in
response, the inner eyewall is starting to become more degraded with
decreasing winds. With that said, there is not an especially well
defined secondary wind maximum quite yet, primarily only observed in
the NOAA-P3 Tail Doppler Radar data in the northeastern quadrant.
The peak flight level winds reported by the NOAA and Air Force
aircraft were both 130 kt at 700 mb. The initial intensity is
therefore reduced to 120 kt for this advisory, and this could be
generous.
 
The inner eyewall of Erin has been wobbling around, likely due to
some trochoidal motion as it interacts with the building secondary
wind maximum, but the longer-term motion is around 290/12 kt. Erin
has moved left of the NHC forecast track over the past day, and I
suspect some of this left-of expected motion could be due to the
small inner-core size of the hurricane, which was poorly resolved by
all of the hurricane-regional forecast models. However, as the
overall wind field of Erin grows in size, a more consistent
west-northwestward motion is expected to resume tonight and persist
over the next 12-24 hours. After that time, a series of shortwave
troughs will move offshore of Atlantic Canada, helping to reinforce
a longwave trough over the north-central portion of the Atlantic.
This should create a growing weakness to the north of Erin,
ultimately allowing the large hurricane to turn northward and then
northeastward by the end of the forecast period. The track guidance
this cycle made another westward adjustment, and the NHC track
forecast was nudged in that direction. The current track remains to
the east of both the HCCA and ECMWF track aids, so it would not be
surprising to see some additional leftward adjustments in subsequent
forecast cycles.
 
The future intensity is probably the most challenging aspect of
Erin's forecast. Erin's maximum sustained winds have been decreasing
as a secondary eyewall gradually becomes better defined. A little
more weakening could occur in the short term as these structural
changes occur. However, none of the hurricane-regional models
appears to have a good handle on Erin's current structure (they all
have a much broader core). Given that the vertical wind shear is
currently low, and the hurricane is well embedded in a moist
environment, this ERC is expected to complete without much issue,
though it will likely take a bit of time for the hurricane's maximum
sustained winds to recover as its wind field broadens. Thus, the NHC
intensity forecast shows some reintensification in the 24 h period
after this ERC completes. Afterwards, it wouldn't be surprising to
see another cycle begin, and at 36-48 h northwesterly shear is still
anticipated to increase some. Their combination should begin a
weakening trend with Erin as it continues to grow in size. The NHC
intensity forecast is a little lower than the previous advisory,
primarily due to the weaker initial intensity, but is still roughly
in line with the intensity consensus aids.
 
A recent scatterometer pass indicates that Erin's outer-core is
growing in size, and the models remain in strong agreement that the
system will grow further the next several days. In fact, by the
middle of next week, Erin is forecast to at least double or triple
in size, which will result in rough ocean conditions over the
western Atlantic.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall at times through Sunday across the northern
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico may lead to
locally considerable flash and urban flooding, along with landslides
or mudslides.
 
2. Tropical-storm conditions are possible in the Turks and Caicos
Islands during the next 48 h, where a Tropical Storm Watch is in
effect. Gusts to tropical storm force in Erin's outer rainbands are
likely in portions of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico through
Sunday. Tropical-storm force wind gusts are possible in the
Southeast Bahamas beginning late Sunday.
 
3. Erin is expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip
currents along the beaches of the Bahamas, much of the east coast of
the U.S., and Atlantic Canada next week.
 
4.  Interests in Bermuda should continue to monitor the progress of
Erin since there is a risk of strong winds, heavy rainfall, and high
surf by the middle part of next week.
