WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning has been issued from north of the North
Carolina/Virginia border to Chincoteague, Virginia.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Storm Surge Warning is in effect for...
* Cape Lookout to Duck, North Carolina
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina to Chincoteague, Virginia,
including Pamlico and Albemarle sounds.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within the
next 24 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
A Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening
inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline,
during the next 36 hours in the indicated locations. For a depiction
of areas at risk, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov.  This is a
life-threatening situation.  Persons located within these areas
should take all necessary actions to protect life and property from
rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions.
Promptly follow evacuation and other instructions from local
officials.

Interests in Atlantic Canada should monitor the progress of
Erin.

For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area
outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by
your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Erin was located
near latitude 30.1 North, longitude 73.7 West. Erin is moving toward
the north near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A turn toward the north-northeast 
is expected later today and tonight, followed by a faster motion 
toward the northeast and east-northeast by Thursday and Friday.  On 
the forecast track, the center of Erin will move over the western 
Atlantic between the U.S. east coast and Bermuda today through early 
Friday, and then pass south of Atlantic Canada Friday and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 110 mph (175 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is likely during 
the next day or so, and Erin could become a major hurricane again 
by tonight.  Weakening is likely to begin by Friday, but Erin is 
forecast to remain a hurricane into the weekend.
 
Erin is a large hurricane. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up 
to 90 miles (150 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds 
extend outward up to 265 miles (425 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Hurricane 
Hunter observations is 941 mb (27.79 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
North Carolina Outer Banks and the Virginia coastline beginning 
late today.  Elsewhere along the mid-Atlantic and southern New 
England coast, wind gusts to tropical storm force are likely 
Thursday through early Friday.  Tropical storm conditions are 
possible on Bermuda Thursday and Friday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will affect the Bahamas, Bermuda, 
the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada during the 
next several days. These rough ocean conditions are expected to 
cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult 
products from your local weather forecast office for more 
information.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Cape Lookout to Duck, North Carolina...2 to 4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: The outer bands of Erin may bring 1 to 2 inches of 
rainfall to the Outer Banks of North Carolina this afternoon into 
Thursday.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Erin, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf

Hurricane Erin Discussion Number  36
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
500 AM EDT Wed Aug 20 2025
 
The last center fix of an earlier Air Force Reserve Hurricane
Hunter mission found that Erin's central pressure had dropped by a
few millibars to 954 mb.  Although satellite intensity estimates 
have increased slightly over the past 6 hours, there is no firm 
evidence to indicate that the pressure drop has translated into 
stronger maximum winds, which are being held at 85 kt.  A 
recent AMSR2 microwave pass revealed that the hurricane has 
an small inner eyewall extending about 15 n mi from the center with 
a pronounced outer ring of convection extending 70-90 n mi from the 
center.  Another reconnaissance mission is scheduled to investigate 
Erin in a few hours and should be able to help ascertain if the 
winds have increased.

Erin is moving north-northwestward, or 345/11 kt, but it is likely 
to turn northward very soon.  The track guidance is in very good 
agreement during Erin's expected recurvature over the western 
Atlantic between the east coast of the U.S. and Bermuda, and no 
significant changes were made to the first 24-36 hours of the 
forecast.  After 36 hours, there has been a notable increase in 
forward speed among the models when Erin becomes embedded in the 
mid-latitude westerlies, and the NHC forecast has been adjusted 
accordingly.  These changes are most evident at days 4 and 5, with 
the new day 5 position about 600 n mi northeast of the previous day 
5 forecast point.
 
Warm waters, relatively light shear, and upper-level divergence 
could support some intensification over the next 36 hours or so.  
However, it is unclear if Erin's broad structure will support much 
increase of the maximum winds, despite the global models showing the 
central pressure falling further into the 940s mb.  The NHC 
intensity forecast is closest to the HCCA consensus aid, showing 
some slight strengthening through Thursday.  A substantial increase 
in shear is likely to induce weakening by 48 hours, and Erin is 
expected to become post-tropical by day 4.  
 
It should be noted that the 34- and 50-kt wind speed probabilities
in the text and graphical products are likely underestimating the 
risk of those winds occurring.  This is because the forecast wind 
field of Erin is considerably larger than average compared to the 
wind field used to derive the wind speed probability product.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erin is expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip
currents along the beaches of the Bahamas, much of the east coast of
the U.S., Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada during the next several days.
Beachgoers in those areas should follow advice from lifeguards,
local authorities, and beach warning flags.
 
2. Storm surge flooding and tropical storm conditions are expected
in the North Carolina Outer Banks beginning later today or tonight. 
The storm surge will be accompanied by large waves, leading to 
significant beach erosion and overwash, making some roads 
impassible.  Tropical storm conditions are possible on Thursday 
along the southeastern coast of Virginia.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda on Thursday and
Friday.
 
4. Interests elsewhere along the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and southern New 
England coasts, and Atlantic Canada, should also monitor the  
progress of Erin as strong winds are possible Thursday through 
Saturday.
