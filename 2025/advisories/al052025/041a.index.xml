WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Bermuda Weather Service has issued a Tropical Storm Warning for 
Bermuda.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Storm Surge Warning is in effect for...
* Cape Lookout to Duck, North Carolina
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina to Chincoteague, Virginia,
including Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds
* Bermuda

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.

A Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening
inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline, in
the indicated locations. For a depiction of areas at risk, please
see the National Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov.  This is a life-threatening situation.
Persons located within these areas should take all necessary actions
to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for
other dangerous conditions.  Promptly follow evacuation and other
instructions from local officials.
 
Interests in Atlantic Canada should monitor the progress of Erin and
refer to local watches and warnings issued by Environment Canada.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area
outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by
your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erin was located
near latitude 35.6 North, longitude 70.5 West. Erin is moving toward
the northeast near 18 mph (30 km/h).  A faster northeastward to
east-northeastward motion is expected during the next couple of
days.  On the forecast track, the center of Erin will move over the
western Atlantic between the U.S. east coast and Bermuda through
early Friday, and then pass south of Atlantic Canada Friday and
Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of
days.  Erin is expected to become post-tropical on Saturday.
 
Erin is a very large hurricane. Hurricane-force winds extend 
outward up to 105 miles (165 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 320
miles (520 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 952 mb (28.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue to affect portions of 
the North Carolina Outer Banks and the Virginia coastline for the 
next few hours.  Elsewhere along the mid-Atlantic and southern New 
England coast, wind gusts to tropical storm force are likely through 
early Friday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda 
late this afternoon through early Friday.  Gusts to gale force are 
possible along portions of the coast of Nova Scotia on Friday and 
the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland on Saturday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will affect the Bahamas, Bermuda,
the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada during the
next several days. These rough ocean conditions are expected to
cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult
products from your local weather forecast office for more
information.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Cape Lookout to Duck, North Carolina...2 to 4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?peakSurge.

Hurricane Erin Discussion Number  41
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
1100 AM EDT Thu Aug 21 2025
 
Erin remains a sprawling hurricane, with its tropical-storm-force
winds extending nearly 500 n mi across. In fact, comparing Erin with
systems around the same intensity and in similar locations over the
past couple of decades indicates that it is around the 90th
percentile in size. The Air Force Hurricane Hunters indicate that
the peak winds have come down a bit, and based on their data, the
initial intensity is set at 85 kt. Although the core of Erin is
pulling away from the United States, coastal flooding and
tropical-storm-force winds continue along portions of the North
Carolina and Virginia coasts. The center of Erin passed just east of
NOAA buoy 41001 earlier this morning, and it reported a minimum
pressure of 962 mb and a maximum significant wave height of 45 ft.
The associated swells are covering nearly the entire western
Atlantic from the Bahamas to Atlantic Canada.
 
Erin is moving north-northeastward at 16 kt. A turn to the northeast
or east-northeast with a significant increase in forward speed
within the mid-latitude westerlies is expected to begin tonight,
taking Erin out to sea over the north Atlantic during the next
several days. The models are in good agreement, and only minor
changes were made to the previous NHC forecast.
 
Increasing southwesterly vertical wind shear, drier mid-level air,
and cooler SSTs should cause Erin to gradually lose strength over
the next several days. Extratropical transition is now expected to
be complete by early Saturday, when the system is forecast to
develop fronts after it crosses the north wall of the Gulf Stream.
The NHC intensity forecast follows HCCA and IVCN in the short term,
but leans toward the global model guidance during the predicted
extratropical phase.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erin will continue to produce life-threatening surf and rip
currents along the beaches of the Bahamas, much of the east coast of
the U.S., Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada during the next several days.
Beachgoers in those areas should follow advice from lifeguards,
local authorities, and beach warning flags.
 
2. Storm surge flooding and tropical storm conditions will continue
on the North Carolina Outer Banks today.  The storm surge will be
accompanied by large waves, leading to significant beach erosion and
overwash, making some roads impassible.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected today along the Virginia
coast.  Wind gusts to tropical storm force are likely along
portions of the remainder of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and southern New
England coasts today through early Friday.
 
4. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda this afternoon
through early Friday.  Gusts to gale force are possible along the
coast of Nova Scotia on Friday and the Avalon Peninsula of
Newfoundland on Saturday.
