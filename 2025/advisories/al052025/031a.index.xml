CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Turks and Caicos Islands
* Southeast Bahamas
 
A Storm Surge Watch is in effect for...
* Cape Lookout to Duck, North Carolina
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Central Bahamas
* Beaufort Inlet to Duck, North Carolina including Pamlico Sound
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.
 
Interests in the northwestern Bahamas, Bermuda, and other parts
of the southeastern coast of the United States should monitor the
progress of Erin.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erin was located
near latitude 24.5 North, longitude 71.8 West.  Erin is moving 
toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A turn to the north is 
forecast later today or tonight.  On the forecast track, the core of 
Erin is expected to move away from the southeastern Bahamas and the 
Turks and Caicos Islands this morning and move east of the remainder 
of the Bahamas later today.  The hurricane is then expected to move 
between Bermuda and the east coast of the United States by the 
middle of the week.
 
Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that maximum sustained winds have decreased to an estimated 120 mph 
(195 km/h) with higher gusts.  Erin is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Fluctuations in strength are 
expected during the next couple of days.  However, Erin is likely to 
remain a dangerous major hurricane through the middle of this week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230
miles (370 km).  A wind gust to 53 mph (85 km/h) was recently 
reported at Providenciales in the Turks and Caicos Islands.
 
The minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data is 953 mb 
(28.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Erin will produce localized areas of heavy rainfall across
portions of the southeastern Bahamas into Wednesday.  Additional
rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with storm total amounts to 8 inches, is
possible, which could lead to flash flooding and urban flood
concerns.  Portions of Hispaniola, the central Bahamas, and the
Turks and Caicos should receive an additional 1 to 2 inches of rain
as well.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Erin, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected for a few more hours
across the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeast Bahamas.
Tropical storm conditions are possible in portions of the central
Bahamas today.  Tropical storm conditions are possible over portions 
of the North Carolina Outer Banks beginning late Wednesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will affect the Bahamas, Bermuda,
the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada during the
next several days. These rough ocean conditions are expected to
cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult
products from your local weather forecast office for more
information.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
STORM SURGE:  Minor coastal flooding is possible in areas of onshore
winds in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeast Bahamas.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Cape Lookout to Duck, North Carolina...2 to 4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
Storm Surge Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?peakSurge.

Hurricane Erin Discussion Number  31
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
1100 PM EDT Mon Aug 18 2025

Erin has weakened some since the last advisory. Multiple microwave 
overpasses show that the convection has eroded on the northwestern 
side and that the mid-level center is displaced to the southeast 
of the low-level center by northwesterly shear. Reports from NOAA 
and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft show that the 
central pressure has risen to near 949 mb, and that flight-level 
winds at 8000 and 10000 ft are in the 105-115 kt range.  The 
initial intensity is reduced to 110 kt for this advisory, and this 
could be a bit generous.  It should be noted that the wind field 
has become very spread out, with flight-level winds of hurricane 
force noted by the two aircraft more than 100 n mi from the center.

Erin has slowed its forward speed with the initial motion now 320/7 
kt. The overall track reasoning remains unchanged, with Erin 
expected to turn northward during the next day or two into a break 
in the subtropical ridge, followed by recurvature into the 
westerlies with some acceleration thereafter.  However, there is 
some spread in the track guidance in both direction and speed.  The 
UKMET and ECMWF are slower and on the left side of the guidance 
envelope, while the GFS and Canadian are on the right side of the 
guidance and faster. The new forecast track is similar in direction 
to the previous track, but it is going to be slower than the 
previous track in deference to the ECMWF/UKMET and the consensus 
models.

The dynamical model guidance suggests that the current shear should 
diminish in 18-24 h, and as that happens the upper-level winds 
become divergent over the hurricane. However, due to the current 
poor organization, it is unclear whether Erin will be able to take 
advantage of the more favorable environment. The intensity forecast 
first calls for some additional weakening due to the ongoing 
shear. After that, it calls for modest re-intensification as the 
upper-level winds become more favorable.  Once Erin has recurved 
into the westerlies, there should be substantial weakening due to 
another round of shear and the onset of extratropical transition.
 
Erin's expanding wind field will result in rough ocean conditions 
over much of the western Atlantic. It should be noted that the 34- 
and 50-kt wind speed probabilities beyond 36 hours in the text and 
graphical products are likely underestimating the risk of those 
winds occurring.  This is because the forecast wind field of Erin 
is considerably larger than average compared to the wind field used 
to derive the wind speed probability product.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall is expected into Wednesday for portions of the 
southeastern Bahamas. Flash and urban flooding are possible. 
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Turks and Caicos
Islands and in the southeast Bahamas for a few more hours.  Tropical
storm conditions are possible in portions of the central Bahamas
tonight through Tuesday.
 
3. Erin is expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip
currents along the beaches of the Bahamas, much of the east coast of
the U.S., Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada during the next several days.
Beachgoers in those areas should follow advice from lifeguards,
local authorities, and beach warning flags.
 
4. Tropical storm conditions and coastal flooding are possible in
the North Carolina Outer Banks beginning late Wednesday where
Tropical Storm and Storm Surge Watches are in effect.  Interests in
Bermuda should also monitor the progress of Erin as strong winds are
possible beginning on Thursday.
