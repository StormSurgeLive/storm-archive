CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* St. Martin and St. Barthelemy
* Sint Maarten
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within the next
12 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands,
and Puerto Rico, as well as in the Turks and Caicos and the
southeastern Bahamas should monitor the progress of Erin.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erin was located
near latitude 19.8 North, longitude 63.3 West. Erin is moving toward
the west near 16 mph (26 km/h), and this motion is expected to
continue this afternoon. A turn toward the west-northwest is
expected tonight with a decrease in forward speed, and a turn
toward the north is expected to occur early next week. On the
forecast track, the center of Erin is expected to move just north
of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto
Rico through Sunday.
 
Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 160 mph (260 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Erin is a category 5 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Some strengthening is possible 
this afternoon.  Fluctuations in intensity are expected for the 
rest of the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140
miles (220 km) mainly to the north of the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from the Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft data is 915 mb (27.02 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: The outer bands of Erin are expected to continue producing
areas of heavy rainfall through Sunday across the northern Leeward
Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Rainfall totals of 2
to 4 inches, with isolated totals of 6 inches, are expected. Locally
considerable flash and urban flooding, along with landslides or
mudslides, are possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Erin, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area today. Squalls with wind gusts to tropical-storm force may 
occur elsewhere over portions of the northern Leeward and Virgin 
Islands.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will affect portions of the northern
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and
the Turks and Caicos Islands through the weekend.  These swells will
spread to the Bahamas, Bermuda, and the east coast of the United
States early next week.  These rough ocean conditions will likely
cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult
products from your local weather forecast office for more
information.

Hurricane Erin Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
1100 AM AST Sat Aug 16 2025
 
Erin has continued to rapidly strengthen during the past 6 h and is
now a category 4 hurricane.  Reports from Air Force Reserve
Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the central pressure has
fallen to 925 mb inside a 6 nm wide eye, and flight-level winds in
the northern eyewall support surface winds in the 130-135 kt range.
The initial intensity is increased to 135 kt, a 70-kt increase since
24 h ago.  The aircraft, along with land-based radar data from Sint
Maarten, report that an outer eyewall is starting to form. However,
this has yet become apparent in the aircraft wind data.
 
The hurricane has been moving a bit to the left of the previous
forecast track with the initial motion of 280/15. The track guidance
suggests that Erin will turn back to the west-northwest with a
decrease in forward speed during the next 6-12 h on the south side
of a subtropical ridge. This motion should then  continue through
the weekend, taking the core of Erin to the north of the eastern
Caribbean Islands through Sunday.  After 36 h, the western side of
the ridge is expected to weaken, due to a series of shortwave
troughs moving through the mid-latitude westerlies, and that should
cause Erin to slow further and make a gradual turn to the north. The
track guidance models are in general agreement with this scenario,
but there remain some differences on where, when, and how sharply
Erin makes the northward turn. The new track forecast is shifted to
the south during the first 12-24 h based on the initial position and
motion, and it lies near the southern edge of the guidance envelope.
From 24-72 h there track has been shifted westward due to an overall
shift in the guidance, and the track is similar to the previous
track at 96 and 120 h.
 
The development of the outer eyewall suggests that rapid
intensification should end during the next several hours.  However,
Erin is expected to reach category 5 status before this occurs, and
the new intensity forecast now calls for a peak intensity of 145 kt.
 After 12 h, the environment becomes a little less favorable, with
increasing northwesterly shear and possible dry air entrainment.
This should lead to gradual weakening of the cyclone through 72 h,
although superimposed on this trend will be fluctuations due to
eyewall replacement cycles.  After 72-96 h, the cyclone is expected
to move into the westerlies where the shear is stronger, and a
faster weakening trend is expected at that time. The new intensity
forecast is at the upper edge of the intensity guidance at 12 h and
near the intensity consensus after that.
 
Although Erin is a somewhat compact hurricane now, the models are in
strong agreement that the system will grow in size over the next
several days. In fact, by the middle of next week, Erin is forecast
to at least double or triple in size, which will result in rough
ocean conditions over the western Atlantic.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall at times through Sunday across the northern
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico may lead to
locally considerable flash and urban flooding, along with landslides
or mudslides.
 
2. Gusts to tropical storm force in Erin's outer rainbands are
likely in portions of the northern Leeward Islands through tonight
and over portions of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico later today
through Sunday. Tropical-storm force wind gusts are possible in the
Turks and Caicos Islands and Southeast Bahamas
 
3. Erin is expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip
currents along the beaches of the Bahamas, much of the east coast of
the U.S., and Atlantic Canada next week.
 
4.  Interests in Bermuda should continue to monitor the progress of
Erin since there is a risk of strong winds, heavy rainfall, and high
surf by the middle part of next week.
