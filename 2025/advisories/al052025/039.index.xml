rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions.
Promptly follow evacuation and other instructions from local
officials.
 
Interests in Atlantic Canada should monitor the progress of
Erin and refer to local watches and warnings issued by Environment 
Canada.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area
outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by
your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erin was located
near latitude 32.8 North, longitude 73.1 West. Erin is moving toward
the north near 16 mph (26 km/h).  A turn toward the north-northeast
is expected tonight, followed by a faster motion toward the
northeast and east-northeast on Thursday and Friday.  On the
forecast track, the center of Erin will move over the western
Atlantic between the U.S. east coast and Bermuda tonight and early
Friday, and then pass south of Atlantic Canada Friday and Saturday.
 
Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 110 mph (175 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Some slight strengthening is possible tonight 
and Thursday morning, and Erin could become a major hurricane again 
during that time. Weakening is likely to begin Thursday night or 
Friday, but Erin is forecast to remain a hurricane into the weekend.
 
Erin is a large hurricane. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up 
to 105 miles (165 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force 
winds extend outward up to 265 miles (425 km). During the past few
hours, NOAA buoy 41025, located just southeast of Cape Hatteras, 
has reported sustained winds of 38 mph (61 km/h) and a wind gust 
of 45 mph (72 km/h).  A private weather station in Frisco, North 
Carolina, recently reported sustained winds of 44 mph (71 km/h) and 
a wind gust of 52 mph (84 km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from the Hurricane Hunter is 
942 mb (27.82 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
North Carolina Outer Banks and the Virginia coastline beginning
in the next few hours.  Elsewhere along the mid-Atlantic and
southern New England coast, wind gusts to tropical storm force are
likely Thursday through early Friday.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible on Bermuda Thursday and Friday. Gale conditions are 
possible along portions of the coast of Nova Scotia beginning 
Thursday night.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will affect the Bahamas, Bermuda,
the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada during the
next several days. These rough ocean conditions are expected to
cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult
products from your local weather forecast office for more
information.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Cape Lookout to Duck, North Carolina...2 to 4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?peakSurge.
 
RAINFALL: The outer bands of Erin may bring up to 1 inch of rainfall
to the Outer Banks of North Carolina tonight into Thursday.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Erin, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf

Hurricane Erin Discussion Number  38...Corrected
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
500 PM EDT Wed Aug 20 2025

Corrected usually to unusually in fourth paragraph

Erin continues to look impressive on satellite imagery, with a 
fairly symmetric cloud pattern and numerous convective banding 
features.  Upper-level outflow remains well-defined over most parts 
of the circulation.  An AMSR microwave image from just before 18Z 
showed a concentric eyewall structure with an outer ring of 
convection at a radius of 70-80 n mi from the center and an inner 
eyewall at a radius of about 20 n mi.  The current intensity 
estimate is held at 95 kt based on a blend of subjective Dvorak 
classifications from TAB and SAB and objective intensity estimates 
from UW-CIMSS.

The hurricane is moving northward with a forward speed of 
around 12 kt.  The steering scenario and track forecast 
reasoning have not changed from the previous advisory.  Erin 
should move around the western and northwestern periphery of 
a mid-level subtropical anticyclone over the next day or so, 
moving between Bermuda and the U.S. east coast.  After that, the 
system should accelerate northeastward and east-northeastward while 
embedded within the  mid-latitude westerlies over the north 
Atlantic.  The official forecast is close to the previous NHC 
prediction and is in good agreement with the NOAA corrected 
consensus, HCCA, guidance.

Although Erin is over warm waters with ample mid- to low-level 
moisture, The concentric convective ring structure of the system 
will likely  prevent significant strengthening and the official 
intensity forecast now only shows a slight-short term increase in 
intensity, similar to the DSHIPS and LGEM guidance. Beginning in 
about 36 hours, the SHIPS model diagnoses a large increase in 
vertical wind shear so a weakening trend is anticipated from that 
time onward.  The predicted structure of the cyclone in the global 
models indicates that extratropical transition should be underway 
in 3-4 days, while Erin passes over much cooler waters. 

Erin is an unusually large hurricane.  For hurricanes north of 30N 
latitude, its tropical-storm-force wind radii are in the 75th 
percentile of the Atlantic basin record.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erin is expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip
currents along the beaches of the Bahamas, much of the east coast of
the U.S., Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada during the next several days.
Beachgoers in those areas should follow advice from lifeguards,
local authorities, and beach warning flags.
 
2. Storm surge flooding and tropical storm conditions are expected
in the North Carolina Outer Banks beginning later today and lasting 
through Thursday.  The storm surge will be accompanied by large 
waves, leading to significant beach erosion and overwash, making 
some roads impassible.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected on Thursday along the
Virginia coast. Wind gusts to tropical storm force are likely along
portions of the remainder of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and southern New
England coasts Thursday through early Friday.
 
4. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda on Thursday and
Friday.
