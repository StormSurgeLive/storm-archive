NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
800 PM AST Sat Aug 16 2025
 
...NOAA AND AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT SUGGEST THAT ERIN IS 
UNDERGOING AN EYEWALL REPLACEMENT CYCLE...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 PM AST...0000 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.0N 64.6W
ABOUT 160 MI...255 KM NW OF ANGUILLA
ABOUT 150 MI...235 KM NE OF SAN JUAN PUERTO RICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...150 MPH...240 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 275 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...934 MB...27.58 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None. 
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* St. Martin and St. Barthelemy
* Sint Maarten
* Turks and Caicos Islands
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within the next 12 
hours in the Leeward Islands and in the next 48 hours in the Turks 
and Caicos Islands.
 
Interests elsewhere in the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands,
and Puerto Rico, as well as in the southeastern Bahamas should
monitor the progress of Erin.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products 
issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Erin was located near 
latitude 20.0 North, longitude 64.6 West. Erin is moving toward the 
west near 15 mph (24 km/h). A turn towards the west-northwest is 
expected later tonight with a decrease in forward speed, and a turn 
towards the north is expected to occur early next week. On the 
forecast track, the center of Erin is expected to move just north of 
the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico through Sunday, and pass to the 
east of the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas 
Sunday night and Monday. 
 
Recent data from both the NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane 
Hunters indicate that maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 
150 mph (240 km/h) with higher gusts.  Erin is a category 4 
hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Some 
fluctuations in intensity are expected over the next couple of days 
due to inner-core structural changes. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185
miles (295 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure estimated by hurricane hunter 
dropsonde data is 934 mb (27.58 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: The outer bands of Erin will continue to produce areas of
heavy rainfall through Sunday across the northern Leeward Islands,
the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Rainfall totals of 2 to 4
inches, with isolated totals of 6 inches, are expected. Locally
considerable flash and urban flooding, along with landslides or
mudslides, are possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Erin, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area in the Leeward Islands through tonight, and in the watch area 
in the Turks and Caicos Islands beginning on Sunday. Squalls with 
wind gusts to tropical-storm force may occur elsewhere over portions 
of the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico
through Sunday. Squalls with wind gusts to tropical-storm force may
also occur over the southeastern Bahamas beginning on Sunday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will affect portions of the northern 
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and 
the Turks and Caicos Islands through the weekend.  These swells will 
spread to the Bahamas, Bermuda, and the east coast of the United 
States by early next week.  These rough ocean conditions will likely 
cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult 
products from your local weather forecast office for more 
information.

Hurricane Erin Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
500 PM AST Sat Aug 16 2025
 
Erin's rapid intensification may have bottomed out near 16Z based on 
the last couple of passes of data from an Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter. At that time, the maximum winds were near 140 kt 
and the central pressure was near 915 mb. Both Air Force and NOAA 
aircraft reported concentric eyewalls forming, and during the last 
couple of hours the small eye seen in conventional satellite imagery 
is becoming cloud-filled. This suggests an eyewall replacement cycle 
may be starting. The initial intensity is held at 140 kt pending the 
upcoming arrival of a NOAA Hurricane Hunter.
 
The eye has started to gain latitude during the past few hours and
the initial motion is now 280/13 kt - a little slower than before.
The track guidance still suggests that Erin will turn back to the
west-northwest with a decrease in forward speed during the next
6-12 h on the south side of a subtropical ridge. This motion should
then continue through 24-36 h. After 36 h, the western side of
the ridge is still expected to weaken, due to a series of shortwave
troughs moving through the mid-latitude westerlies, and that should
cause Erin to slow further and make a gradual turn to the north.
However, there remains a significant spread in the guidance in just
when this turn will occur, and the spread has increased due to the
12Z ECMWF forecast shifting to the west. Overall, the guidance
envelope has shifted to the left during the entire forecast track,
and the new forecast track is also shifted to the west. The new
track is still to the east of the consensus models during the
northward motion, and additional track adjustments may be necessary
in later forecasts.
 
Fluctuations in intensity are expected during the next 24 hours due 
to possible eyewall replacement cycles. However, Erin should remain 
a strong hurricane during this time.  Between 24-72 h, increasing 
northwesterly shear should cause a gradual weakening, although there 
are likely to be fluctuations superimposed on this.  After 72 h, the 
storm should start to encounter the mid-latitude westerlies where 
the shear will increase further. The new intensity forecast will 
show an increased weakening rate, but will keep Erin as a major 
hurricane as it will still be over warm sea surface temperatures 
during that time.
 
Although Erin is a somewhat compact hurricane now, the models are in
strong agreement that the system will grow in size over the next
several days. In fact, by the middle of next week, Erin is forecast
to at least double or triple in size, which will result in rough
ocean conditions over the western Atlantic.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall at times through Sunday across the northern
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico may lead to
locally considerable flash and urban flooding, along with landslides
or mudslides.
 
2. Tropical-storm conditions are possible in the Turks and Caicos 
Islands during the next 48 h, where a Tropical Storm Watch is now in 
effect. Gusts to tropical storm force in Erin's outer rainbands are 
likely in portions of the northern Leeward Islands through tonight 
and over portions of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico through 
Sunday. Tropical-storm force wind gusts are possible in the 
Southeast Bahamas beginning on Sunday.
 
3. Erin is expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip
currents along the beaches of the Bahamas, much of the east coast of
the U.S., and Atlantic Canada next week.
 
4.  Interests in Bermuda should continue to monitor the progress of
Erin since there is a risk of strong winds, heavy rainfall, and high
surf by the middle part of next week.
