DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erin was located
near latitude 24.0 North, longitude 71.3 West. Erin is moving toward
the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A turn to the north is 
expected on Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the core of Erin is 
expected to pass to the east of the southeastern and central 
Bahamas today and tonight, and move between Bermuda and the east 
coast of the United States by the middle of the week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 140 mph (220 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Erin is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Erin is likely to remain a dangerous major 
hurricane through the middle of this week.

Erin is an unusually large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend 
outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 937 mb (27.67 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Outer bands of Erin will produce localized areas of heavy 
rainfall across portions of Hispaniola this evening and through 
Tuesday for the Turks and Caicos, the southeast Bahamas, and the 
easternmost central Bahamas.  Additional rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, 
with locally higher amounts to 6 inches, are forecast.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Erin, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected through this evening 
across the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeast Bahamas. 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in portions of the central 
Bahamas tonight through Tuesday.  Tropical storm conditions are 
possible over portions of the North Carolina Outer Banks beginning 
late Wednesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will affect the Bahamas, Bermuda,
the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada during the
next several days. These rough ocean conditions will likely cause
life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult products
from your local weather forecast office for more information.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
STORM SURGE:  Minor coastal flooding is possible in areas of
onshore winds in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeast
Bahamas.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large
waves.

The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause 
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters 
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the 
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if 
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Cape Lookout to Duck, North Carolina 2 to 4 ft 

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the 
surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge 
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For 
information specific to your area, please see products issued by 
your local National Weather Service forecast office.

For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge 
inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak 
Storm Surge Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?peakSurge.

Hurricane Erin Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
500 PM EDT Mon Aug 18 2025
 
Erin's cloud pattern has become somewhat less organized than 
earlier today, likely as a result of some dry air intrusion over 
the northwestern portion of the circulation and increased northerly 
shear.  An AMSR microwave image from the GCOM satellite showed the 
dry air intrusion which is consistent with the presence of arc 
clouds emanating northwestward from the system.  The northerly 
shear has also begun to restrict the outflow to the north of Erin.  
The intensity is held at 120 kt for now, pending observations from 
another Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft in a few hours.  This 
intensity estimate is also consistent with a blend of objective 
values from UW-CIMSS.

After a west-northwestward wobble earlier today, the hurricane has 
resumed its northwest course with a motion estimate of 310/9 kt.  
The track forecast reasoning remains basically unchanged.  Over 
the next 72 hours or so, Erin should turn northward and move 
through a weakness in the subtropical ridge, and on the western 
side of a mid-level anticyclone.  Later in the forecast period, an 
approaching mid-level trough should cause Erin to accelerate
northeastward over the northern Atlantic.

The model guidance and low-level water vapor imagery suggests that 
the dry air incursion into Erin is probably temporary.  However, 
given the degraded cloud pattern and the less conducive shear over 
the system, not much additional strengthening is likely.  In any 
event since the system will remain over warm waters for at least 
the next 72 hours, Erin will likely retain major hurricane status 
through the middle of the week.  The official intensity forecast is 
at the high end of the model guidance.
  
Erin's continued expanding wind field will result in rough ocean 
conditions over much of the western Atlantic. It should be noted 
that the 34- and 50-kt wind speed probabilities beyond 36 hours in 
the text and graphical products are likely underestimating the risk 
of those winds occurring.  This is because the forecast wind field 
of Erin is considerably larger than average compared to the wind 
field used to derive the wind speed probability product.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Bands of heavy rainfall are expected over portions of Hispaniola 
this evening, and through Tuesday for the Turks and Caicos, the 
southeast Bahamas, and the easternmost central Bahamas.  Flash and 
urban flooding are possible.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Turks and Caicos 
Islands and in the southeast Bahamas through this evening.  Tropical 
storm conditions are possible in portions of the central Bahamas 
tonight through Tuesday.
 
3. Erin is expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip 
currents along the beaches of the Bahamas, much of the east coast of 
the U.S., Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada during the next several days. 
Beachgoers in those areas should follow advice from lifeguards, 
local authorities, and beach warning flags. 
 
4. Tropical storm conditions and coastal flooding are possible in 
the North Carolina Outer Banks beginning late Wednesday where 
Tropical Storm and Storm Surge Watches are in effect.  Interests in 
Bermuda should also monitor the progress of Erin as strong winds are 
possible beginning on Thursday.
