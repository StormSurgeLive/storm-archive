SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...38.6N 65.3W
ABOUT 435 MI...700 KM N OF BERMUDA
ABOUT 425 MI...680 KM SSW OF HALIFAX NOVA SCOTIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 55 DEGREES AT 22 MPH...35 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...956 MB...28.23 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Bermuda Weather Service has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warning for Bermuda.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Atlantic Canada should monitor the progress of Erin and
refer to local forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erin was located
near latitude 38.6 North, longitude 65.3 West.  Erin is moving
toward the northeast near 22 mph (35 km/h).  A turn toward the
east-northeast with an increase in forward speed is expected later
today, followed by a turn back to the northeast on Sunday.  On the
forecast track, the center of Erin will pass south of Atlantic
Canada today and tonight, and then race across the north Atlantic
waters.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Erin is likely to become post-tropical by tonight but remain
a powerful hurricane-force low pressure system through the weekend.
 
Erin remains a very large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend
outward up to 125 miles (205 km) from the center and
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 370 miles (595 km). 
A wind gust to 56 mph (90 km/h) was recently reported at the L. F. 
Wade International Airport on Bermuda.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 956 mb (28.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Wind gusts to tropical storm force are possible in extreme
southeastern Massachusetts during the next couple of hours.  Gusts
to gale force are possible along portions of the coast of Nova
Scotia today and the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland on Saturday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will affect the Bahamas, Bermuda,
the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada during the
next several days. These rough ocean conditions are expected to
cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult
products from your local weather forecast office for more
information.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
STORM SURGE:  Coastal flooding is expected at times of high tide 
along portions of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and New England coasts 
through tonight, making some roads impassable.   See updates from 
your local National Weather Service office for details.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Erin Discussion Number  44
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
500 AM AST Fri Aug 22 2025
 
Erin has begun extratropical transition.  The center is now exposed
to the southwest of the remaining central deep convection due to
30-35 kt of southwesterly shear.  In addition, the hurricane has
developed an expansive cirrus shield to the north, and stratus and
stratocumulus clouds off the Mid-Atlantic U.S. coast suggest that
cold air advection is occuring in the hurricane's wake.  Based on
the degradation of the satellite presentation since the previous
full advisory, the initial intensity is lowered to 80 kt.  The wind
field continues to grow, and tropical-storm-force winds now extend
as far as 320 n mi from the center.
 
The hurricane has been moving northeastward, or 055/19 kt.  Erin
will accelerate toward the east-northeast, embedded within the
mid-latitude westerlies, reaching a peak speed of about 35 kt in 48
hours.  A significant reduction in forward speed is then expected
on days 3 through 5 as the cyclone becomes cut off from the
westerlies, stalling or meandering just south of Iceland by the
middle of next week.  The NHC track forecast is close to a blend of
the GFS, ECMWF, and HCCA models, and no significant changes were
made from the previous forecast.
 
Global model thermal fields, model-simulated satellite imagery, and
phase-space diagrams indicate that Erin should become post-tropical
by 24 hours.  The NHC intensity forecast generally follows a blend
of the GFS and ECMWF surface wind fields, showing only some
weakening during the next 36-48 hours.  Global models are in good
agreement that the post-tropical cyclone will phase with an
upper-level trough in 48-60 hours, inducing baroclinic
reintensification and possibly the development of a sting jet on
the back side of the low.  The NHC official forecast shows that
strengthening at 60 hours.  Steady weakening, and even more
broadening of the wind field, should occur on days 3 through 5 as
the low becomes vertically stacked south of Iceland.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erin will continue to produce life-threatening surf and rip
currents along the beaches of the Bahamas, much of the east coast of
the U.S., Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada during the next several days.
Beachgoers in those areas should follow advice from lifeguards,
local authorities, and beach warning flags.
 
2. Coastal flooding is expected at times of high tide along portions
of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and New England coasts through tonight,
making some roads impassable.  Large waves along the coast could
also cause significant beach erosion and overwash.
 
3. Gusts to gale force are possible along the coast of Nova Scotia
today and the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland on Saturday.
