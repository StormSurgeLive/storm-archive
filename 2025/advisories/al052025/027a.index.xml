EASTERN SEABOARD THIS WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM AST...0600 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...22.6N 69.9W
ABOUT 110 MI...175 KM NE OF GRAND TURK ISLAND
ABOUT 935 MI...1500 KM SSE OF CAPE HATTERAS NORTH CAROLINA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...130 MPH...215 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Turks and Caicos Islands
* Southeast Bahamas
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests elsewhere in the central Bahamas, the North Carolina
Outer Banks, and Bermuda should monitor the progress of Erin.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Erin was located 
near latitude 22.6 North, longitude 69.9 West. Erin is moving toward 
the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). A gradual turn to the north is 
expected later today and on Tuesday. On the forecast track, the 
core of Erin is expected to pass to the east of the southeastern 
Bahamas today and move between Bermuda and the east coast of the 
United States by the middle of the week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Erin is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Some additional strengthening is expected 
today. Even though some weakening is forecast beginning tonight, 
Erin will remain a large and dangerous major hurricane through the 
middle of this week.
 
Erin is increasing in size. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up 
to 60 miles (95 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds 
extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km).
 
The minimum central pressure based on Air Force reconnaissance 
dropsonde data is 945 mb (27.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Scattered showers and thunderstorms will continue to
produce localized areas of heavy rainfall across Puerto Rico.
Additional rainfall of 1 to 2 inches are expected across Puerto Rico
today. Additional rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with locally
higher amounts to 6 inches, are forecast over the Turks and Caicos
and the eastern Bahamas including San Salvador Island through
Tuesday. Locally considerable flash and urban flooding, along with
landslides or mudslides, are possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Erin, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected today across the Turks 
and Caicos Islands and the southeast Bahamas.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will affect the Bahamas, Bermuda, 
the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada during the 
next several days. These rough ocean conditions will likely cause
life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult products
from your local weather forecast office for more information.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
STORM SURGE:  Minor coastal flooding is possible in areas of
onshore winds in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeast
Bahamas.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large
waves.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Hurricane Erin Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
1100 PM AST Sun Aug 17 2025
 
Erin appears to have successfully completed its eyewall replacement 
cycle (ERC) that began yesterday. A F-16 SSMIS pass at 2314 UTC 
showed just a single eyewall with Erin that also appears to be 
contracting. Thus, Erin appears to be re-intensifying but now with a 
larger 20 n mi radius of maximum winds. Satellite intensity 
estimates, both subjective and objective, are starting to increase 
again. Notably, we received a T6.0/115 kt subjective Dvorak 
intensity value at 00 UTC. The DMINT value associated with that 
earlier SSMIS pass was 113 kt, and given the improvement of Erin's 
structure on GOES-19 satellite imagery since that time period, the 
initial intensity is being increased to 115 kt this advisory, making 
Erin a Category 4 hurricane again. An Air Force Reserve 
reconnaissance mission will soon be in the core of Erin to 
provide updated in-situ observations of the hurricane. 
 
It looks like Erin is beginning to turn northwestward, with the 
initial motion now estimated to be 305/10 kt. The mid-level ridge 
that has been steering Erin over the last few days is beginning to 
split, with one ridge remaining parked over the Ohio Valley in the 
United States, but another ridge becoming positioned more eastward 
of Erin. This pattern will allow a weakness to form north of Erin, 
enabling the large hurricane to turn northward and then 
northeastward roughly between the Outer Banks of North Carolina and 
Bermuda. The track guidance this cycle have not made very many 
adjustments, and thus the latest NHC forecast track looks quite 
similar to the prior advisory, just a little slower over the next 
48 hours. This track lies roughly in between the Google Deep Mind 
ensemble mean (GDMI) and HFIP corrected consensus approach (HCCA).
 
Now that Erin has completed its ERC, there is a short-term window 
where additional intensification could occur while the hurricane 
remains over warm waters near 29C and light to moderate 
northwesterly shear. There are a couple of complications that make 
the intensity forecast tricky beyond this time period. First, 
vertical wind shear is expected to increase over Erin soon. If Erin 
also then undergoes another ERC, sometime in the 24-48 h time 
period, this could hasten a weakening trend, like HAFS-A/B models 
have been suggesting. Second, as Erin grows in size, its footprint 
of cool upwelling will also grow, and could potentially encroach on 
its inner core. Several AOML/CIMAS gliders have been near the 
inner core of Erin over the past 24 hours, and their in-situ 
observations indicate that Erin has already cooled the waters in its 
vicinity up to 1C over the past day. This rate of ocean cooling near 
Erin is likely to continue increasing as the storm grows in size and 
slows over the next 48-60 h. Thus, the intensity forecast shows 
gradual weakening beginning after a short round of intensification, 
which is a little lower than the previous NHC intensity forecast 
beyond the short-term, but still not far off from the HCCA 
consensus aid.
 
Erin's wind radii have been growing in size, and are expected to
continue expanding over the next few days. The expanding wind field
will result in rough ocean conditions over much of the western
Atlantic.  It should be noted that the 34- and 50-kt wind speed
probabilities beyond 36 hours in the text and graphical products are
likely underestimating the risk of those winds occurring.  This is
because the forecast wind field of Erin is considerably larger than
average compared to the wind field used to derive the wind speed
probability product.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Bands of heavy rainfall will linger across portions of Puerto 
Rico and the Virgin Islands through tonight, but are expected to 
diminish by Monday. Locally considerable flash and urban flooding, 
along with landslides or mudslides, are possible. 
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Turks and Caicos
Islands and in the southeast Bahamas tonight and Monday.
 
3. Erin is expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip
currents along the beaches of the Bahamas, much of the east coast of
the U.S., Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada during the next several days.
 
4. Interests along the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Bermuda
should monitor the progress of Erin as there is a risk of strong
winds associated with the outer rainbands during the middle part of
the week.
