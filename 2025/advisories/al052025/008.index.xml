BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Erin Advisory Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
500 AM AST Wed Aug 13 2025
 
...ERIN CONTINUES WESTWARD...
...EXPECTED TO BECOME A HURRICANE IN A COUPLE OF DAYS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.5N 41.9W
ABOUT 1400 MI...2255 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 260 DEGREES AT 20 MPH...31 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1004 MB...29.65 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of Erin.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Erin was
located near latitude 16.5 North, longitude 41.9 West. Erin is
moving toward the west near 20 mph (31 km/h). This general motion
is expected into Thursday, with a west-northwestward motion 
beginning Thursday night and continuing into the weekend.
On the forecast track, the center of Erin is likely to move near or
just north of the northern Leeward Islands over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is forecast to begin today, and Erin will 
likely become a hurricane by late Thursday or early Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will begin affecting portions of the 
northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by this 
weekend.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and 
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local 
weather forecast office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found

NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Tropical Storm Erin Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
500 AM AST Wed Aug 13 2025

Deep convection is redeveloping intermittently over the western 
portion of Erin's circulation.  However the system continues to 
have a rather ragged-looking appearance, with limited convective 
banding features.  There appears to be some easterly shear over the 
storm at this time.  Subjective Dvorak classifications are a little 
below tropical storm strength and objective intensity estimates 
from UW-CIMSS are generally in the 35-40 kt range.  Based on these 
estimates, the advisory intensity remains at 40 kt.

Erin has not been able to strengthen significantly for the past 
couple of days, likely due to marginal SSTs, and a relatively dry 
mid- to lower-tropospheric air mass.  However, it is expected that 
the system's environment will gradually become more conducive for 
intensification over the next 48 hours.  In particular, Erin will 
be traversing progressively warmer ocean waters with likely a 
little less environmental subsidence.  The official intensity 
forecast is similar to the previous ones and continues to call for 
Erin to become a hurricane later this week.  This is also supported 
by the corrected model consensus, HCCA, and Google DeepMind model
guidance.

Although the center is not easy to locate, it is estimated that the 
cyclone is continuing on its generally westward track, at about 
260/17 kt.  A strong low- to mid-level ridge is situated to the 
north of Erin, and in a few days a slight weakness develops in the 
ridge near 65W longitude.  This should cause the tropical cyclone to 
begin to move west-northwestward at a slightly slower forward speed 
in a couple of days.  The track guidance is in fairly good 
agreement, and the official forecast is close to the HCCA solution 
and is on the southern side of the model track forecast suite.  This 
is also very similar to the previous NHC prediction.  Users are 
reminded that NHC track forecasts have an average error of 120-180 n 
mi (150-215 statute miles) at days 4 and 5, and future adjustments 
to the forecast are still possible.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erin could move close enough to the northern Leeward Islands, the 
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico over the weekend to produce some 
impacts on those islands.  However, the magnitude of those impacts 
is still not known, and interests there should continue to monitor 
the progress of this storm.
 
2. There is even greater uncertainty in what impacts might occur in
portions of the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, the east coast of
the United States, and Bermuda next week.  As we approach the
climatological peak of the hurricane season, this is an opportune
time to ensure your preparedness plans are in place.
