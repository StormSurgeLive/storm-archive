...ERIN STILL A VERY LARGE HURRICANE...
...SWIMMING AT MANY U.S. EAST COAST BEACHES IS LIKELY TO REMAIN
DANGEROUS FOR A COUPLE MORE DAYS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...38.8N 63.1W
ABOUT 460 MI...740 KM NNE OF BERMUDA
ABOUT 400 MI...645 KM S OF HALIFAX NOVA SCOTIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 65 DEGREES AT 28 MPH...44 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...956 MB...28.23 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.

 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erin was located
near latitude 38.8 North, longitude 63.1 West. Erin is moving toward 
the east-northeast near 28 mph (44 km/h).  This general motion with 
an increase in forward speed is expected later today, followed by a 
turn back to the northeast on Sunday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Erin will pass south of Atlantic Canada today and tonight, 
and then race across the north Atlantic waters.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Erin is likely to become post-tropical by tonight but remain 
a powerful hurricane-force low pressure system through the weekend.
 
Erin is growing in size.  Hurricane-force winds extend outward up 
to 140 miles (220 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force 
winds extend outward up to 435 miles (705 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 956 mb (28.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Gale-force wind gusts are possible along portions of the 
coast of Nova Scotia today and the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland 
on Saturday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will affect the Bahamas, Bermuda,
the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada during the
next several days. These rough ocean conditions are expected to
cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult
products from your local weather forecast office for more
information.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
STORM SURGE:  Coastal flooding is expected at times of high tide
along portions of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and New England coasts
through tonight, making some roads impassable.   See updates from
your local National Weather Service office for details.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Erin Discussion Number  45
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
1100 AM AST Fri Aug 22 2025
 
Erin is now well into its extratropical transition.  While there is 
some convection that has recently reformed near the center, all of 
its other convection has shifted on the left side, with noticeable 
frontal features in the northeastern quadrant.  Additionally, the 
stratus and stratocumulus clouds off the Mid-Atlantic U.S. coast 
continue to suggest that cold air advection is occuring in the 
hurricane's wake.  The initial intensity is kept at 80 kt pending 
receipt of the full late-morning scatterometer data, though the 
partial pass suggested Erin had grown even larger.
 
The hurricane is moving faster to the east-northeast, now estimated 
at 24 kt.  Model guidance is rapidly accelerating Erin in that 
direction over the weekend, reaching a peak speed of up to 40 kt 
Sunday.  The powerful extratropical low should slow down and could 
undergo a loop over the far North Atlantic early next week as it 
becomes a large occluded low.  The new forecast is a bit faster and 
south of the previous one, based on the latest corrected consensus 
guidance from HCCA and Google Deep Mind.
 
Current trends and model fields indicate that Erin should complete 
extratropical transition by tonight, with perhaps a slight weakening 
of the winds on Saturday.  However, Erin is forecast to become an 
even larger and stronger system late Saturday into Sunday due to 
phasing with a mid-latitude trough, inducing baroclinic 
reintensification and even the development of a sting jet on the 
back side.  While they disagree on the exact timing, the global 
models are all showing a 75-90 kt sting jet on Sunday.  The new NHC 
forecast is raised during the extratropical phase for Sunday, and 
still could be too low if the latest ECMWF solution is correct.  A 
steady weakening is likely to occur early next week as Erin occludes 
and loses its upper support south of Iceland.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erin will continue to produce life-threatening surf and rip 
currents along the beaches of the Bahamas, much of the east coast of 
the U.S., Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada during the next several days. 
Beachgoers in those areas should follow advice from lifeguards, 
local authorities, and beach warning flags.
 
2. Coastal flooding is expected at times of high tide along portions
of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and New England coasts through tonight,
making some roads impassable.  Large waves along the coast could
also cause significant beach erosion and overwash.
 
3. Gale-force wind gusts are possible along the coast of Nova Scotia
today and the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland on Saturday.
