None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Turks and Caicos Islands
* Southeast Bahamas
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within 24
hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the central Bahamas, the North Carolina
Outer Banks, and Bermuda should monitor the progress of Erin.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erin was located 
near latitude 22.1 North, longitude 68.8 West. Erin is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). This general motion is 
expected tonight, followed by a gradual turn to the northwest and 
north on Monday and Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the core of 
Erin is expected to pass to the east and northeast of the Turks and 
Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas tonight into Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Erin is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some increase in size and strength is 
forecast during the next 48 hours. Erin is forecast to remain a 
large and dangerous major hurricane through the middle of this week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 50 miles (85 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 946 mb (27.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: The outer bands of Erin continue to produce areas of heavy
rainfall across Puerto Rico.  Additional rainfall of 2 to 4 inches
are expected across Puerto Rico through Monday. Additional rainfall
of 2 to 4 inches, with locally higher amounts to 6 inches, are
forecast over the Turks and Caicos and the eastern Bahamas including
San Salvador Island through Tuesday. Locally considerable flash and
urban flooding, along with landslides or mudslides, are possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Erin, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Turks and
Caicos Islands beginning tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected in the southeast Bahamas late tonight into Monday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will continue to affect portions of
the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and the Turks and
Caicos Islands during the next couple of days.  These swells will
spread to the Bahamas, Bermuda, the east coast of the United
States, and Atlantic Canada during the early and middle portions of
the week. These rough ocean conditions will likely cause
life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult products
from your local weather forecast office for more information.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
STORM SURGE:  Minor coastal flooding is possible in areas of
onshore winds in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeast
Bahamas.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large
waves.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Erin Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
500 PM AST Sun Aug 17 2025
 
Erin continues to have a well-organized cloud pattern with numerous 
convective banding features and strong upper-level outflow.  
Satellite data indicate numerous lightning flashes in these cloud 
bands.  The intensity estimate is held at 110 kt for this advisory, 
which is somewhat below the Dvorak values, but close to the estimate 
based on the most recent aerial reconnaissance mission.  Another Air 
Force Hurricane Hunter plane is scheduled to investigate Erin in a 
few hours to provide an update on the strength of the hurricane.
 
The system has been moving just a little to the right of the track 
seen earlier today, and the initial motion estimate is 295/11 kt.  
There are no significant changes to the track forecast reasoning 
from the previous advisory.  Erin is expected to gradually turn 
northward in a couple of days while moving through a weakness in the 
subtropical ridge, i.e. between two subtropical high cells.  The 
track guidance is basically unchanged from earlier today, so the new 
official forecast is essentially an update of the previous one.  
This remains close to the dynamical model consensus TVCN and is is 
also similar to the latest FSU Superensemble guidance.

Erin exhibited an eyewall replacement earlier today, with the eye 
diameter increasing from 5-10 n mi to around 40 n mi.  If the 
replacement cycle completes, there should be a contraction of the 
eyewall by tonight.  This would likely result in another 
intensification episode.  The official forecast is consistent with 
this expectation and is near the high side of the model guidance.  
Notwithstanding, Erin should remain in conducive environmental 
conditions and remain a dangerous major hurricane through the middle 
of this week.

Erin has been growing in size, and that trend is likely to continue 
over the next few days. The expanding wind field will result in 
rough ocean conditions over much of the western Atlantic.  It should 
be noted that the 34- and 50-kt wind speed probabilities beyond 36 
hours in the text and graphical products are likely underestimating 
the risk of those winds occurring.  This is because the forecast 
wind field of Erin is considerably larger than average compared to 
the wind field used to derive the wind speed probability product.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Bands of heavy rainfall will continue across portions of Puerto 
Rico and the Virgin Islands through tonight, but are expected to 
diminish by Monday. Locally considerable flash and urban flooding, 
along with landslides or mudslides, are possible. 
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Turks and Caicos
Islands and in the southeast Bahamas tonight and Monday. 
 
3. Erin is expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip
currents along the beaches of the Bahamas, much of the east coast of
the U.S., Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada during the next several days.
 
4. Interests along the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Bermuda
should monitor the progress of Erin as there is a risk of strong 
winds associated with the outer rainbands during the middle part of 
the week.
