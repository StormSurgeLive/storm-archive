WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Government of the Bahamas has issued a Tropical Storm Watch for
the Turks and Caicos Islands.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* St. Martin and St. Barthelemy
* Sint Maarten
* Turks and Caicos Islands
 
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within the next
12 hours in the Leeward Islands and in the next 48 hours in the
Turks and Caicos Islands.
 
Interests elsewhere in the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands,
and Puerto Rico, as well as in the southeastern Bahamas should
monitor the progress of Erin.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erin was located
near latitude 20.0 North, longitude 64.0 West. Erin is moving toward
the west near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this motion is expected to
continue this evening. A turn toward the west-northwest is expected
tonight with a decrease in forward speed, and a turn toward the
north is expected to occur early next week. On the forecast track,
the center of Erin is expected to move just north of the northern
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico through Sunday 
and pass to the east of the Turks and Caicos Islands and the 
southeastern Bahamas Sunday night and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 160 mph (260 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Erin is a category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Fluctuations in intensity are expected 
tonight through Sunday night. A slow weakening is expected to begin 
on Monday. A NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft is en route to 
investigate Erin this evening.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles
(260 km) mainly to the north of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 915 mb (27.02 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: The outer bands of Erin will continue to produce areas of
heavy rainfall through Sunday across the northern Leeward Islands,
the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Rainfall totals of 2 to 4
inches, with isolated totals of 6 inches, are expected. Locally
considerable flash and urban flooding, along with landslides or
mudslides, are possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Erin, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area in the Leeward Islands tonight, and in the watch area in the 
Turks and Caicos Islands beginning on Sunday. Squalls with wind 
gusts to tropical-storm force may occur elsewhere over portions of 
the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico 
through Sunday. Squalls with wind gusts to tropical-storm force may 
also occur over the southeastern Bahamas beginning on Sunday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will affect portions of the northern
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and
the Turks and Caicos Islands through the weekend.  These swells will
spread to the Bahamas, Bermuda, and the east coast of the United
States by early next week.  These rough ocean conditions will likely
cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult
products from your local weather forecast office for more
information.

Hurricane Erin Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
500 PM AST Sat Aug 16 2025
 
Erin's rapid intensification may have bottomed out near 16Z based on 
the last couple of passes of data from an Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter. At that time, the maximum winds were near 140 kt 
and the central pressure was near 915 mb. Both Air Force and NOAA 
aircraft reported concentric eyewalls forming, and during the last 
couple of hours the small eye seen in conventional satellite imagery 
is becoming cloud-filled. This suggests an eyewall replacement cycle 
may be starting. The initial intensity is held at 140 kt pending the 
upcoming arrival of a NOAA Hurricane Hunter.
 
The eye has started to gain latitude during the past few hours and
the initial motion is now 280/13 kt - a little slower than before.
The track guidance still suggests that Erin will turn back to the
west-northwest with a decrease in forward speed during the next
6-12 h on the south side of a subtropical ridge. This motion should
then continue through 24-36 h. After 36 h, the western side of
the ridge is still expected to weaken, due to a series of shortwave
troughs moving through the mid-latitude westerlies, and that should
cause Erin to slow further and make a gradual turn to the north.
However, there remains a significant spread in the guidance in just
when this turn will occur, and the spread has increased due to the
12Z ECMWF forecast shifting to the west. Overall, the guidance
envelope has shifted to the left during the entire forecast track,
and the new forecast track is also shifted to the west. The new
track is still to the east of the consensus models during the
northward motion, and additional track adjustments may be necessary
in later forecasts.
 
Fluctuations in intensity are expected during the next 24 hours due 
to possible eyewall replacement cycles. However, Erin should remain 
a strong hurricane during this time.  Between 24-72 h, increasing 
northwesterly shear should cause a gradual weakening, although there 
are likely to be fluctuations superimposed on this.  After 72 h, the 
storm should start to encounter the mid-latitude westerlies where 
the shear will increase further. The new intensity forecast will 
show an increased weakening rate, but will keep Erin as a major 
hurricane as it will still be over warm sea surface temperatures 
during that time.
 
Although Erin is a somewhat compact hurricane now, the models are in
strong agreement that the system will grow in size over the next
several days. In fact, by the middle of next week, Erin is forecast
to at least double or triple in size, which will result in rough
ocean conditions over the western Atlantic.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall at times through Sunday across the northern
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico may lead to
locally considerable flash and urban flooding, along with landslides
or mudslides.
 
2. Tropical-storm conditions are possible in the Turks and Caicos 
Islands during the next 48 h, where a Tropical Storm Watch is now in 
effect. Gusts to tropical storm force in Erin's outer rainbands are 
likely in portions of the northern Leeward Islands through tonight 
and over portions of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico through 
Sunday. Tropical-storm force wind gusts are possible in the 
Southeast Bahamas beginning on Sunday.
 
3. Erin is expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip
currents along the beaches of the Bahamas, much of the east coast of
the U.S., and Atlantic Canada next week.
 
4.  Interests in Bermuda should continue to monitor the progress of
Erin since there is a risk of strong winds, heavy rainfall, and high
surf by the middle part of next week.
