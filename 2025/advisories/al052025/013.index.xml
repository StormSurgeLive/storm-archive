...FORECAST TO BECOME A HURRICANE BY TOMORROW...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.4N 49.7W
ABOUT 890 MI...1435 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 275 DEGREES AT 17 MPH...28 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of Erin.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Erin was
located near latitude 16.4 North, longitude 49.7 West. Erin is
moving toward the west near 17 mph (28 km/h). A turn toward the
west-northwest is expected tonight, with this motion expected to
continue into the weekend. On the forecast track, the center of
Erin is likely to move near or just north of the northern Leeward
Islands over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h)
with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast during the
next day or so, and Erin is expected to become a hurricane on
Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will begin affecting portions of the
northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by this
weekend.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather forecast office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found

Tropical Storm Erin Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
1100 AM AST Thu Aug 14 2025
 
Satellite imagery shows that Erin has become a little better
organized this morning, with the formation of a ragged central
dense overcast with some outer banding in the northwestern
semicircle.  Satellite intensity estimates have increased a little
during the past 6 h and are now in the 40-55 kt range.  Based on
these data, the initial intensity is increased to 50 kt.
 
Erin will be in an environment of light-to-moderate easterly 
vertical shear and moving over increasing sea surface temperatures 
during the next 48 h. This should allow a faster rate of 
intensification during this time, and Erin is now forecast to become 
a hurricane by 24 h. The environment becomes less conducive after 48 
h, with the global models forecast northwesterly shear over the 
cyclone as a large upper-level anticyclone develops to the west. 
Despite this forecast shear, the global and regional hurricane 
models forecast intensification to continue, although at a slower 
rate than during the first 48 h. Based on these forecasts, the new 
intensity forecast shows steady intensification through 48 h, 
followed by a slower rate of development during the remainder of the 
forecast period.  The new forecast is near the intensity consensus, 
and there is guidance that suggests the possibility Erin could be 
stronger than currently forecast.
 
The initial motion is now 275/15. The storm continues to be steered 
by a subtropical ridge to the north, and this ridge should steer the 
cyclone generally west-northwestward during the next three days. 
After that time, the western portion of the ridge is forecast to 
weaken or break due to the influence of the mid-latitude westerlies 
over the northeastern United States.  This evolution should lead to 
Erin turning toward the northwest or north-northwest during the 
remainder of the forecast period, although there is significant 
spread in the guidance on just how sharp this turn will be. The new 
forecast track is south of the consensus models through 48 h and 
then lies near the consensus models thereafter. Due to the spread in 
the track guidance by 120 h and beyond, there is still a greater 
than normal uncertainty about what impacts Erin may bring to 
portions of the Bahamas, the east coast of the United States, and 
Bermuda in the long range.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Locally heavy rainfall, high surf and rip currents, and
tropical-storm force winds could occur in portions of the northern
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico this weekend as
the core of Erin passes north of those islands.  Interests in these
areas should continue to monitor the progress of Erin.
 
2. While there is still uncertainty in what impacts might occur in
portions of the Bahamas, the east coast of the United States, and
Bermuda next week, the risk of dangerous surf and rip currents
across the western Atlantic basin next week is increasing.  As we
approach the climatological peak of the hurricane season, this is an
opportune time to ensure your preparedness plans are in place.
