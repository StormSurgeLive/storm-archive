DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Erin
was located near latitude 40.0 North, longitude 59.7 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east-northeast near 33
mph (54 km/h).  This general motion with an increase in forward 
speed is expected later today, followed by a turn back to the 
northeast on Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Erin 
will pass south of Atlantic Canada today and tonight, and then race 
across the north Atlantic waters.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Erin is likely to remain a large and powerful 
hurricane-force low pressure system through the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 435
miles (705 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 957 mb (28.26 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Gale-force wind gusts are possible along portions of the
coast of Nova Scotia today and the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland
on Saturday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will affect the Bahamas, Bermuda,
the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada during the
next few days. These rough ocean conditions are expected to
cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult
