The Storm Surge Warning from Cape Lookout to Duck, North Carolina,
has been discontinued.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests in Atlantic Canada should monitor the progress of Erin and
refer to local watches and warnings issued by Environment Canada.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erin was located
near latitude 37.3 North, longitude 67.0 West. Erin is moving toward
the east-northeast near 22 mph (35 km/h). A faster northeastward to
east-northeastward motion is expected during the next couple of
days.  On the forecast track, the center of Erin will move over the
western Atlantic between New England and Bermuda through early
Friday, and then pass south of Atlantic Canada Friday and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of
days, and Erin is expected to become post-tropical on Saturday.
 
Erin remains a very large system. Hurricane-force winds extend
outward up to 105 miles (165 km) from the center and tropical-storm 
force winds extend outward up to 320 miles (520 km). During the 
past few hours, wind gusts to tropical-storm force have been 
reported on Bermuda and on Nantucket Island, Massachusetts.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 952 mb (28.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda through
early Friday. Wind gusts to tropical storm force are likely through
early Friday along the mid-Atlantic and southern New England coast.
Gusts to gale force are possible along portions of the coast of Nova
Scotia on Friday and the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland on
Saturday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will affect the Bahamas, Bermuda,
the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada during the
next several days. These rough ocean conditions are expected to
cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult
products from your local weather forecast office for more
information.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
STORM SURGE:  Water levels remain elevated along the U.S.
Mid-Atlantic and southern New England coasts, but will gradually
recede through Friday. See updates from your local National Weather
Service office for details.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?peakSurge.

Hurricane Erin Discussion Number  43
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
1100 PM AST Thu Aug 21 2025
 
Erin has changed little in organization during the past several
hours. An area of convection seen near the center in conventional
satellite imagery is associated with a fragment of an inner eyewall
seen in microwave imagery, and outer convective bands continue in
association with the outer wind maximum seen in scatterometer data.
Satellite intensity estimates are in the 75-85 kt range and have
not changed much since the last advisory, and based on this the
initial intensity remains 85 kt.  Erin continues to have a very
large area of tropical-storm force winds, and comparing Erin with
other systems around the same intensity and in similar locations
over the past couple of decades indicates that it is around the
90th percentile in size. The cyclone also continues to produce a
very large area of high seas covering nearly the entire western
Atlantic from the Bahamas to Atlantic Canada.
 
The hurricane is now moving east-northeastward or 065/19 kt. A
faster motion toward the east-northeast is expected within the 
mid-latitude westerlies over the next 2-3 days, taking Erin out to 
sea over the north Atlantic. Some decrease in forward speed is 
expected by 120 h.  The track models are tightly clustered, and the 
new forecast track has only minor adjustments from the previous 
track.
 
Erin is moving into an area of increasing shear and toward cooler
sea surface temperatures, and the cyclone is expected to merge with
a front and become extratropical in about 36 h.  However, global
models forecast that the cyclone will only gradually weaken as it
moves across the north Atlantic. The new intensity forecast is
similar to the previous forecast and is based mainly on a blend of
the GFS and ECMWF surface winds forecasts.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erin will continue to produce life-threatening surf and rip
currents along the beaches of the Bahamas, much of the east coast of
the U.S., Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada during the next several days.
Beachgoers in those areas should follow advice from lifeguards,
local authorities, and beach warning flags.
 
2. Storm surge flooding should subside on the North Carolina Outer
Banks tonight.  While this happens, the storm surge will continue to 
be accompanied by large waves, leading to significant beach erosion 
and overwash, making some roads impassible.
 
3. Wind gusts to tropical storm force are likely along portions of
the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and southern New England coasts through early
Friday.
 
4. Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda through early
Friday.  Gusts to gale force are possible along the coast of Nova
Scotia on Friday and the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland on
Saturday.
