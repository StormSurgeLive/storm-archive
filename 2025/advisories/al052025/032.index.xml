A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.
 
Interests in the northwestern Bahamas, Bermuda, and the U.S
Mid-Atlantic and southern New England coast should monitor the
progress of Erin.  Additional tropical storm watches and warnings
may be required later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erin was located
near latitude 24.8 North, longitude 72.0 West.  Erin is moving 
toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A turn toward the 
north-northwest with an increase in forward speed is expected 
today, followed by a northward motion on Wednesday and then a 
northeastward motion on Thursday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Erin will pass to the east of the Bahamas today and 
tonight, and then move over the western Atlantic between the U.S. 
east coast and Bermuda on Wednesday and Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Erin is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Fluctuations in strength are possible over 
the next few days.
 
Erin is a large hurricane and will continue to grow in size.  
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 955 mb (28.20 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Outer bands of Erin will produce localized areas of heavy
rainfall across portions of the Turks and Caicos today and through
tonight for the Bahamas. Additional rainfall of 1 to 3 inches, with
storm total amounts to 8 inches, are possible, which could lead to
flash and urban flooding. Heavy rainfall is possible on the Outer
Banks of North Carolina Wednesday night into Thursday with potential
for 1 to 2 inches and a local maximum of 4 inches.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Erin, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected for a few more hours
across the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeast Bahamas.
Tropical storm conditions are possible in portions of the central
Bahamas today.  Tropical storm conditions are possible over portions
of the North Carolina Outer Banks beginning late Wednesday or
Wednesday night.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will affect the Bahamas, Bermuda,
the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada during the
next several days. These rough ocean conditions are expected to
cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult
products from your local weather forecast office for more
information.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
STORM SURGE:  Minor coastal flooding is possible in areas of onshore
winds in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeast Bahamas.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Cape Lookout to Duck, North Carolina...2 to 4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation, 
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic, 
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?peakSurge.

Hurricane Erin Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
500 AM EDT Tue Aug 19 2025
 
Moderate to strong northwesterly shear has caused Erin's structure 
to become more asymmetric, with dry air infiltrating into the 
northwestern part of the circulation, and a long trailing convective 
band still draped to the south over the Turks and Caicos Islands.  
An earlier Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter mission made a final 
pass through the center of Erin around 1230 am and measured 
flight-level winds of 97 kt, with a central pressure up to 953 mb.  
Combining this information with the latest satellite estimates, 
Erin's intensity is set at 100 kt, which could be a bit generous.

Erin has been moving slowly northwestward since yesterday, with an 
initial motion estimated to be 325/6 kt.  There is not much change 
to the track forecast reasoning, with the hurricane still expected 
to recurve over the western Atlantic between the U.S. east coast and 
Bermuda over the next 3-4 days.  The main highlight of the new 
forecast is that much of the track guidance, including the consensus 
aids, have shifted slightly west of the previous NHC prediction 
during the first 2-3 days.  The new NHC forecast is very close to 
the TVCA and HCCA consensus aids during the first 48 hours, and then 
closer to the TVCA aid beyond 48 hours.  It should be noted that 
there is still some space for additional adjustments to the track 
forecast, particularly beyond 48 hours with the HCCA aid lying along 
the northwestern edge of the guidance envelope.
 
There are mixed signals on Erin's future intensity.  On one hand, 
more favorable environmental shear and upper-level divergence in 
24-36 hours should support some re-intensification.  On the other 
hand, Erin's slow motion and large size could lead to some upwelling 
of cooler water, and the hurricane's broad structure could limit 
significant strengthening.  The official forecast only shows 
fluctuations in intensity for the next 3 days, although it's 
becoming more likely that Erin could just weaken very gradually 
during that time.  Erin is forecast to maintain hurricane strength 
for the next 5 days, but it is likely to begin interacting with a 
frontal boundary by Friday and become extratropical by late 
Saturday.
 
The more important part of the forecast is that model guidance has 
continued to show Erin growing in size, and the wind radii have been 
made larger in the new NHC forecast.  This new forecast now brings 
tropical-storm-force winds very close to the Mid-Atlantic and 
southern New England coast later this week.  Erin's expanding wind 
field will result in rough ocean conditions over much of the western 
Atlantic. It should be noted that the 34- and 50-kt wind speed 
probabilities beyond 36 hours in the text and graphical products are 
likely underestimating the risk of those winds occurring.  This is 
because the forecast wind field of Erin is considerably larger than 
average compared to the wind field used to derive the wind speed 
probability product.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erin is expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip 
currents along the beaches of the Bahamas, much of the east coast of 
the U.S., Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada during the next several days. 
Beachgoers in those areas should follow advice from lifeguards, 
local authorities, and beach warning flags.

2. Tropical storm conditions and coastal flooding are possible in 
the North Carolina Outer Banks beginning late Wednesday or Wednesday 
night where Tropical Storm and Storm Surge Watches are in effect.  
Interests in along the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and southern New England 
coasts and on Bermuda should also monitor the progress of Erin as 
strong winds are possible Thursday and Friday.
  
3. Heavy rainfall from the outer bands of Erin will continue today 
for the Turks and Caicos and through tonight for the Bahamas. Flash 
and urban flooding are possible. 
 
4. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Turks and Caicos 
Islands and in the southeast Bahamas for a few more hours.  Tropical 
storm conditions are possible in portions of the central Bahamas 
today.
