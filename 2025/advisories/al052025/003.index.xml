Tropical Storm Erin Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
1100 PM AST Mon Aug 11 2025
 
After struggling earlier during the diurnal convective minimum, a 
large convective burst has formed and persisted over the center of 
Erin for the past several hours, and a recent GPM microwave pass 
from 11/2237 UTC confirmed that the low-level center is underneath 
this burst.  The latest subjective intensity estimates range from 
35-45 kt, and the objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS have 
crept up slightly to the 40-45 kt range.  The initial intensity is 
held at 40 kt, which might be a tad conservative.

Erin continues moving quickly westward, with the latest motion 
estimated at 275/18 kt.  This general motion with a gradual decrease 
in forward speed is expected over the next 2 to 3 days as the 
tropical storm is steered by a mid-level subtropical ridge to its 
north.  Towards the end of the forecast period, the ridge should 
erode some, which would allow Erin to turn toward the west-northwest 
and gain some latitude.  However, there are some differences in the 
global models as to how significant the weakness in the ridge will 
be, and this will affect how far north the cyclone gets by day 5.  
Some of the recent model solutions are a bit farther to the left (or 
southwest) at the end of the forecast period.  The NHC forecast is 
nudged only very slightly to the left at days 4-5, and now lies 
slightly to the north of the latest consensus aids.  Based on the 
model spread, the confidence in the track forecast appears to be 
about average.

Erin is expected to remain in low vertical wind shear conditions for 
the next 3-4 days.  The thermodynamic environment is less favorable 
in the short-term, with sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) around 
26-27C, and stable stratocumulus clouds noted just to the west and 
northwest of Erin.  Only slow strengthening is forecast during the 
next 1 to 2 days until Erin reaches warmer water.  A faster rate of 
intensification is anticipated after that time.  The latest NHC 
forecast is very similar to the previous one, and lies slightly 
below the intensity consensus for the first 36 h.  Thereafter, the 
NHC intensity forecast is near the middle of the intensity guidance 
envelope.  It is possible that vertical wind shear could increase in 
4 to 5 days, but that will depend on where the upper-level ridge is 
situated in relation to Erin, which is uncertain at this time.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. It is still too early to determine what impacts, if any, Erin may
bring to the northern Leeward Islands, Bermuda, or the east coast of
the United States. As we approach the climatological peak of the
hurricane season, it is an opportune time to ensure your
preparedness plans are in place.
