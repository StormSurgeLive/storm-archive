WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of the Bahamas has issued a Tropical Storm Watch for
the central Bahamas.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Turks and Caicos Islands
* Southeast Bahamas
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Central Bahamas
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within 12 to 24 hours.
 
Interests in the northwestern Bahamas, the North Carolina Outer 
Banks, and Bermuda should monitor the progress of Erin.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Erin was located
near latitude 22.8 North, longitude 70.2 West. Erin is moving toward
the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). A gradual turn to the north is
expected later today and on Tuesday. On the forecast track, the
core of Erin is expected to pass to the east of the southeastern
Bahamas today and move between Bermuda and the east coast of the
United States by the middle of the week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts. Erin is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Some additional strengthening is expected
today. Even though some weakening is forecast beginning tonight,
Erin will remain a large and dangerous major hurricane through the
middle of this week.
 
Erin is a large system. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up
to 80 miles (130 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds
extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 945 mb (27.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Outer bands of Erin will produce localized areas of heavy
rainfall across portions of Hispaniola through today and through
Tuesday for the Turks and Caicos and portions of the southeast
and central Bahamas. Additional rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with
locally higher amounts to 6 inches, are forecast.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Erin, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected today across the Turks
and Caicos Islands and the southeast Bahamas. Tropical storm
conditions are possible in portions of the central Bahamas late
today through Tuesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will affect the Bahamas, Bermuda,
the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada during the
next several days. These rough ocean conditions will likely cause
life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult products
from your local weather forecast office for more information.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
STORM SURGE:  Minor coastal flooding is possible in areas of
onshore winds in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeast
Bahamas.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large
waves.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.

Hurricane Erin Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
500 AM EDT Mon Aug 18 2025
 
Erin is growing in size, as predicted. Data from the Air Force
Hurricane Hunters and ASCAT passes from a few hours ago showed that
the hurricane- and tropical-storm-force winds now extend up to 70 n
mi and 200 n mi from the eye, respectively. The eye of the hurricane
has also grown and is now about 30 n mi in diameter, and there is
some evidence of mesovorticies within it. There is also some
indication that Erin again has concentric eyewalls as the Hurricane
Hunters reported a double wind maximum in their last pass. The
initial intensity remains 115 kt based on a combination of the
earlier aircraft data and current satellite estimates. Erin's outer
rainbands are affecting the southeast Bahamas and the Turks and
Caicos Islands, and those locations will likely continue to
experience tropical storm conditions for several more hours.
 
The hurricane has wobbled to the left over the past 6 hours, but a
longer-term motion is still west-northwestward at 11 kt. Erin is
still forecast to gradually turn northward later today and Tuesday
as it moves into a weakness within the subtropical ridge. This
motion should take the core of the hurricane roughly midway between
Bermuda and the east coast of the U.S. on Wednesday and Thursday.
After that time, an approaching trough should cause Erin to
accelerate northeastward over the northern Atlantic. The NHC track
forecast has been nudged to the left of the previous one to be
closer to the various consensus models.
 
Deep convection has been increasing in intensity and symmetry, and
it seems likely that Erin will strengthen today. The intensification
is likely to end by tonight due to some increase in shear and a
broadening of the inner core wind field. Slow weakening seems likely
beginning Tuesday, but it should be emphasized that Erin is expected
to remain a powerful hurricane through the week. The NHC intensity
forecast is above the models in the short term, but falls near the
middle of the guidance after that.
 
Based on an evaluation of storm sizes of major hurricanes over the
past couple of decades in the subtropics, Erin is around the 80th
percentile. Erin's wind field is expected to keep growing over the
next few days. The expanding wind field will result in rough ocean
conditions over much of the western Atlantic. It should be noted
that the 34- and 50-kt wind speed probabilities beyond 36 hours in
the text and graphical products are likely underestimating the risk
of those winds occurring.  This is because the forecast wind field
of Erin is considerably larger than average compared to the wind
field used to derive the wind speed probability product.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Bands of heavy rainfall are expected today over portions
of Hispaniola and through Tuesday for the Turks and Caicos and
portions of the southeast and central Bahamas. Flash and urban
flooding are possible.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Turks and Caicos 
Islands and in the southeast Bahamas today.  Tropical storm 
conditions are possible in portions of the central Bahamas late 
today through Tuesday.
 
3. Erin is expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip
currents along the beaches of the Bahamas, much of the east coast of
the U.S., Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada during the next several days.
 
4. Interests along the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Bermuda
should monitor the progress of Erin as there is a risk of strong
winds associated with the outer rainbands during the middle part of
the week.
