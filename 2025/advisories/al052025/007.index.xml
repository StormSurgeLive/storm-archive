...ERIN LIKELY TO BECOME A HURRICANE OVER THE CENTRAL TROPICAL
ATLANTIC IN A COUPLE OF DAYS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.7N 40.1W
ABOUT 1520 MI...2440 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 260 DEGREES AT 20 MPH...31 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1004 MB...29.65 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of Erin.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Erin was
located near latitude 16.7 North, longitude 40.1 West.  Erin is
moving toward the west near 20 mph (31 km/h).  This general motion 
is expected tonight through Thursday, with a west-northwestward

On the forecast track, the center of Erin is likely to move near or 
just north of the northern Leeward Islands over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected during the next day or 
so, and gradual strengthening is forecast to begin by late 
Wednesday.  Erin will likely become a hurricane by late Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.

Tropical Storm Erin Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
500 PM AST Tue Aug 12 2025
 
Not much has changed with Erin's structure since this morning.  A 
little bit of convection has formed over the low-level center, but 
overall the shower and thunderstorm activity remains limited.  Due 
to the cyclone's fast motion, it is assumed that the maximum winds 
have not decreased, so the initial intensity is held at 40 kt.

A quick south-of-due-west motion is expected to continue for the 
next 24 hours, with strong low- to mid-level ridging located to the 
north over the central and eastern Atlantic.  Global models 
indicate that ridge is likely to weaken in a few days, which should 
cause Erin to begin moving west-northwestward in about 60 hours, 
with that motion continuing through day 5 (Sunday).  In contrast to 
this morning, there were no major shifts in the latest track model 
simulations.  The new NHC forecast has been placed along the 
southern part of the guidance envelope, lying closest to the HFIP 
Corrected Consensus (HCCA) and Google Deep Mind (GDM) models.  This 
results in the new NHC track forecast having no appreciable 
difference from the morning forecast, with no additional shifting 
toward the northern Leeward Islands.  Keep in mind that NHC track 
forecasts have an average error of 120-180 n mi (150-215 statute 
miles) at days 4 and 5, and future adjustments in the forecast are 
still possible.

It may still take Erin a little bit of time to produce more 
significant deep convection while it continues to move over 
marginally warm sea surface temperatures and through an atmosphere 
of only modest instability and moisture.  Sea surface temperatures 
and instability begin to increase after about 24 hours, which 
should allow Erin to produce more organized convection.  Given that 
the cyclone already has a well-defined low-level structure, this 
could result in significant intensification toward the latter part 
of the forecast period, especially since the global models show an 
upper-level anticyclone building over the storm.  The NHC intensity 
forecast is near the lower end of the guidance during the first few 
days of the forecast, but then falls in line closer to the 
consensus aids in 3-5 days.  In this scenario, Erin would still 
become a major hurricane in about 4 or 5 days.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erin could move close enough to the northern Leeward Islands, 
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico over the weekend to produce some 
impacts on those islands.  However, the magnitude of those impacts 
is still not known, and interests there should continue to monitor 
the progress of this storm.
 
2. There is even greater uncertainty in what impacts might occur in 
portions of the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, the east coast of 
the United States, and Bermuda next week.  As we approach the 
climatological peak of the hurricane season, this is an opportune 
time to ensure your preparedness plans are in place.
