...ERIN STRENGTHENS AS IT MOVES WESTWARD...
...EXPECTED TO BECOME A HURRICANE IN A DAY OR TWO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.3N 45.0W
ABOUT 1200 MI...1930 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 270 DEGREES AT 17 MPH...28 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of Erin.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Erin was
located near latitude 16.3 North, longitude 45.0 West. Erin is
moving toward the west near 17 mph (28 km/h). This general motion
is expected to continue into Thursday, with a west-northwestward
motion beginning Thursday night and continuing into the weekend.
On the forecast track, the center of Erin is likely to move near or
just north of the northern Leeward Islands over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Gradual strengthening is forecast during the 
next couple of days, and Erin is expected to become a hurricane by 
Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC. 

SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will begin affecting portions of the
northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by this
weekend.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather forecast office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Tropical Storm Erin Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
500 PM AST Wed Aug 13 2025

Convection has become more concentrated near the center of Erin 
during the past few hours, although the storm still has a somewhat 
ragged overall appearance. Satellite intensity estimates have 
increased a little since the last advisory and are now in the 35-50 
kt range. Based on these trends, the initial intensity is increased 
to 45 kt.

Erin remains in an area of marginal sea surface temperatures and 
moisture and this should continue for another 12 h or so. After 
that, the forecast track takes the system over warmer SSTs that 
increase to 29-30C by the end of the forecast period. In addition, 
the cyclone is currently in a favorable low- to moderate-shear 
environment, and this is likely to continue for the next 72 h or so. 
This evolution should allow Erin to significantly intensify, with 
the cyclone forecast to become a hurricane by 36 h and a major 
hurricane by 96 hr.  After 72-96 h, Erin may encounter increased 
northwesterly shear as it tracks to the northeast of a large 
upper-level anticyclone forecast to form near Hispaniola and the 
southeastern Bahamas. Although it is unclear how much shear Erin 
will encounter, the intensity guidance suggests at least a lower
rate of intensification at that time. The new intensity forecast is
adjusted upward somewhat from the previous forecast through 72 h 
based on current trends and the intensity consensus.
 
The initial motion is now 270/15 kt. A low- to mid-level ridge 
north of Erin should steer the cyclone westward for the next 12 h 
or so, followed by a generally west-northwestward motion through  
96 h. After that time, a developing break in the ridge near the
southeastern coast of the United States should lead to a
northwestward motion. The track guidance is still in fairly good
agreement, and the official forecast remains on the southern side 
of the guidance envelope between the HCCA corrected consensus and 
the other consensus models. However, the guidance envelope has 
shifted a little westward since the last advisory, and the new 
forecast track is also a little west of the previous track. Users 
are reminded that NHC track forecasts have an average error of
150 to 215 miles at days 4 and 5, and future adjustments to the
forecast are still possible.

It should be noted that the directional spread becomes very large 
in both the deterministic and ensemble track guidance at long range. 
Therefore, there is a greater than normal uncertainty about what 
impacts Erin may bring to portions of the Bahamas, the east coast 
of the United States, and Bermuda.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Locally heavy rainfall, high surf and rip currents, and 
tropical-storm force winds could occur in portions of the northern 
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico this weekend as 
the core of Erin passes north of those islands.  Interests in these 
areas should continue to monitor the progress of Erin.
 
2. While there is still uncertainty in what impacts might occur in 
portions of the Bahamas, the east coast of the United States, and 
Bermuda next week, the risk of dangerous surf and rip currents 
across the western Atlantic basin next week is increasing.  As we 
approach the climatological peak of the hurricane season, this is an 
opportune time to ensure your preparedness plans are in place.
