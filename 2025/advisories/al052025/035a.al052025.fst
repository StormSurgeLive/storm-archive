DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erin was located
near latitude 28.3 North, longitude 73.2 West.  Erin is moving 
toward the north-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A turn toward 
the north is expected today, followed by a northeastward motion on 
Thursday.  On the forecast track, the center of Erin will move over 
the western Atlantic between the U.S. east coast and Bermuda today 
through early Friday, and then pass south of Atlantic Canada Friday 
and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Slow strengthening is expected through Thursday night.
 
Erin is a large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend outward up 
to 80 miles (130 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds 
extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km).
 
Dropsonde data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter flight 
indicate that the minimum central pressure has fallen to 954 mb 
(28.17 inches).

Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Erin, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf

North Carolina Outer Banks beginning late today or tonight.  
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area north of 
Duck, North Carolina to Cape Charles Light beginning Thursday.  
Tropical storm conditions are possible in Bermuda beginning 
Thursday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will affect the Bahamas, Bermuda,
the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada during the
next several days. These rough ocean conditions are expected to
cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult
products from your local weather forecast office for more
information.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Cape Lookout to Duck, North Carolina...2 to 4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
