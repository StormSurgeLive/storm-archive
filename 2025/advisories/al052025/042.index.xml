WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Tropical Storm Warning south of Duck, North Carolina, has been
discontinued.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Storm Surge Warning is in effect for...
* Cape Lookout to Duck, North Carolina
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Duck, North Carolina to Chincoteague, Virginia
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
A Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening
inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline, in
the indicated locations. For a depiction of areas at risk, please
see the National Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov.  This is a life-threatening situation.
Persons located within these areas should take all necessary actions
to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for
other dangerous conditions.  Promptly follow evacuation and other
instructions from local officials.
 
Interests in Atlantic Canada should monitor the progress of Erin and
refer to local watches and warnings issued by Environment Canada.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area
outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by
your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erin was located
near latitude 36.4 North, longitude 69.1 West. Erin is moving toward
the northeast near 20 mph (31 km/h). A faster northeastward to
east-northeastward motion is expected during the next couple of
days.  On the forecast track, the center of Erin will move over the
western Atlantic between the U.S. east coast and Bermuda through
early Friday, and then pass south of Atlantic Canada Friday and
Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of
days.  Erin is expected to become post-tropical on Saturday.
 
Erin is a very large system. Hurricane-force winds extend outward 
up to 105 miles (165 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force 
winds extend outward up to 320 miles (520 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 952 mb (28.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue to affect portions of
the North Carolina and Virginia coastline for the next few hours.
Elsewhere along the mid-Atlantic and southern New England coast,
wind gusts to tropical storm force are likely through early Friday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda late this
afternoon through early Friday.  Gusts to gale force are possible
along portions of the coast of Nova Scotia on Friday and the Avalon
Peninsula of Newfoundland on Saturday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will affect the Bahamas, Bermuda,
the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada during the
next several days. These rough ocean conditions are expected to
cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult
products from your local weather forecast office for more
information.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Cape Lookout to Duck, North Carolina...2 to 4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?peakSurge.

Hurricane Erin Discussion Number  42
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
500 PM AST Thu Aug 21 2025
 
Erin is gradually pulling away from the U.S., but coastal flooding 
and tropical storm conditions continue across portions of the North 
Carolina and Virginia coastline. A pair of ASCAT passes from a few 
hours ago confirmed Erin's large size with its associated 
tropical-storm-force winds extending nearly 500 n mi across. In 
fact, comparing Erin with other systems around the same intensity 
and in similar locations over the past couple of decades indicates 
that it is around the 90th percentile in size. Overall, the 
structure of the system has changed little since the aircraft 
departed earlier today, and based on that data and the satellite 
intensity estimates, the initial intensity is held at 85 kt. Erin is 
producing very rough seas, and the associated swells are covering 
nearly the entire western Atlantic from the Bahamas to Atlantic 
Canada.
 
Erin has turned northeastward, and it is currently moving at 050/17 
kt. A faster motion to the northeast or east-northeast is expected 
within the mid-latitude westerlies over the next few days, taking 
Erin out to sea over the north Atlantic. The models are in good 
agreement, and only minor changes were made to the previous NHC 
forecast.

The environmental conditions are expected to become increasingly 
hostile around Erin, as southwesterly vertical wind shear is likely 
to steadily increase while humidity values and sea surface 
temperatures decrease.  This should result in weakening, but Erin 
will likely only slowly lose strength due to its large size.  Erin 
is expected to cross the north wall of the Gulf Stream in a couple 
of days, and that should help lead to its extratropical transition.  
The NHC intensity forecast is similar to the previous one, and 
follows HCCA and IVCN in the short term, but leans toward the global 
model guidance during the predicted extratropical phase.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erin will continue to produce life-threatening surf and rip
currents along the beaches of the Bahamas, much of the east coast of
the U.S., Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada during the next several days.
Beachgoers in those areas should follow advice from lifeguards,
local authorities, and beach warning flags.
 
2. Storm surge flooding will continue on the North Carolina Outer 
Banks through tonight.  The storm surge will be accompanied by large 
waves, leading to significant beach erosion and overwash, making 
some roads impassible.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected for a few more hours 
along portions of the northeast North Carolina and Virginia coast.  
Wind gusts to tropical storm force are likely along portions of the 
remainder of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and southern New England coasts 
today through early Friday.
 
4. Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda this
evening through early Friday.  Gusts to gale force are possible
along the coast of Nova Scotia on Friday and the Avalon Peninsula of
Newfoundland on Saturday.
