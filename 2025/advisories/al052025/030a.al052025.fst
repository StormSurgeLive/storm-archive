DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erin was located
near latitude 24.1 North, longitude 71.5 West. Erin is moving toward
the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A turn to the north is 
forecast on Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the core of Erin is 
expected to pass to the east of the southeastern and central 
Bahamas today and tonight, and move between Bermuda and the east 
coast of the United States by the middle of the week.
 
Reports from Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (210 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Erin is a category 4 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Erin is likely to remain a 
dangerous major hurricane through the middle of this week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230
miles (370 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from the Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft data is 947 mb (27.96 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Outer bands of Erin will produce localized areas of heavy
rainfall across portions of Hispaniola this evening and through
Tuesday for the Turks and Caicos, the southeast Bahamas, and the
easternmost central Bahamas.  Additional rainfall of 2 to 4 inches,
with locally higher amounts to 6 inches, are forecast.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Erin, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected through this evening
across the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeast Bahamas.
Tropical storm conditions are possible in portions of the central
Bahamas tonight through Tuesday.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible over portions of the North Carolina Outer Banks beginning
late Wednesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will affect the Bahamas, Bermuda, 
the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada during the 
next several days. These rough ocean conditions are expected to 
cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult 
products from your local weather forecast office for more 
information.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
STORM SURGE:  Minor coastal flooding is possible in areas of onshore 
winds in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeast Bahamas.  
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Cape Lookout to Duck, North Carolina...2 to 4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.

inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak
