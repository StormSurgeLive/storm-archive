None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Turks and Caicos Islands
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Southeast Bahamas
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within 24
hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within 24 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the central Bahamas, the North Carolina
Outer Banks, and Bermuda should monitor the progress of Erin.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erin was located
near latitude 21.0 North, longitude 67.4 West. Erin is moving toward
the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  This general motion is
expected today, followed by a gradual turn to the north on Monday
and Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the core of Erin is expected to
pass to the east of the Turks and Caicos Islands and the
southeastern Bahamas tonight and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Erin is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuation in intensity are likely
over the next couple of days, but Erin is expected to remain a
dangerous major hurricane through the middle of this week.
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles
(335 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 946 mb (27.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Erin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: The outer bands of Erin will continue to produce areas of
heavy rainfall today across Puerto Rico. Additional rainfall of 2 to
4 inches, with locally higher amounts to 6 inches, are expected
across Puerto Rico through Monday, as well as the Turks and Caicos,
and the eastern Bahamas through San Salvador Island through Tuesday.
Locally considerable flash and urban flooding, along with landslides
or mudslides, are possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Erin, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected across the warning
area in the Turks and Caicos Islands beginning tonight. Tropical
storm conditions are possible in the watch area in the Southeast
Bahamas tonight and Monday. Squalls with wind gusts to tropical
storm force could occur over portions of the Virgin Islands and
Puerto Rico today and across the central Bahamas Monday and Tuesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erin will continue to affect portions of
the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and the Turks and
Caicos Islands during the next couple of days. These swells will
spread to the Bahamas, Bermuda, the east coast of the United
States, and Atlantic Canada during the early and middle portions of
the week. These rough ocean conditions will likely cause
life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please consult products
from your local weather forecast office for more information.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
STORM SURGE:  Minor coastal flooding is possible in areas of
onshore winds in the Turks and Caicos Islands.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large waves.

Hurricane Erin Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052025
1100 AM AST Sun Aug 17 2025
 
Erin's eye is no longer evident on satellite imagery and 
observations from the Air Force Hurricane Hunters indicate that the 
maximum winds are near 110 kt.  The central pressure has risen a bit 
this morning.  This slight decrease in intensity is probably due to 
an eyewall replacement in the inner core as reported by the 
Hurricane Hunters and is likely a temporary short-term fluctuation.  
The system remains a well-organized and dangerous major hurricane 
with a impressively symmetric cloud pattern. Upper-level outflow is 
strong over all quadrants of the system.
 
Based on fixes from the aircraft, San Juan radar, and satellite 
images, the hurricane appears to be moving west-northwestward or 
around 285/11 kt.  The track forecast philosophy is about the same 
as in previous advisories.  Over the next couple of days, Erin is 
expected to turn northward and move between two cells of the 
mid-tropospheric subtropical high.  The track guidance is in good 
agreement on the northward turn but there are differences in how 
close the hurricane will come to the U.S. east coast in the 72 hour 
time frame.  The new official forecast has been shifted a little to 
the west at 3-4 days based on the model consensus.  Some additional 
adjustments to the forecast are possible in future advisories.
 
Erin should remain over very warm waters with moderate vertical wind 
shear and in a moist low-to mid-level air mass during the next 48-72 
hours.  Therefore, some renewed increase in strength is expected 
within the next couple of days.  The NHC intensity forecast is in 
good agreement with the latest corrected consensus model, HCCA,  In 
any event, Erin should remain a dangerous major hurricane through 
the middle of this week.
 
Erin is growing in size, and that trend is expected to continue over
the next few days. The expanding wind field will result in rough
ocean conditions over much of the western Atlantic.  It should be
noted that the 34- and 50-kt wind speed probabilities beyond 36
hours in the text and graphical products are likely underestimating
the risk of those winds occurring.  This is because the forecast
wind field of Erin is considerably larger than average compared to
the wind field used to derive the wind speed probability product.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall will continue into Monday across Puerto Rico, but
is expected to diminish over the Virgin Islands later today.
Locally considerable flash and urban flooding, along with landslides
or mudslides, are possible.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Turks and Caicos
Islands and are possible in the Southeast Bahamas tonight and
Monday. Gusts to tropical storm force are possible in Erin's outer
rainbands in portions of Puerto Rico today and the central Bahamas
on Monday and Tuesday.
 
3. Erin is expected to produce life-threatening surf and rip
currents along the beaches of the Bahamas, much of the east coast of
the U.S., Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada during the next several days.
 
4. Interests along the North Carolina Outer Banks and Bermuda
should monitor the progress of Erin as there is a risk
of strong winds associated with the outer rainbands during the
middle part of the week.
