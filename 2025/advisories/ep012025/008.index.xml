BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Alvin Advisory Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
800 AM MST Fri May 30 2025
 
...LARGE SWELL AND RIP CURRENTS POSSIBLE ACROSS PORTIONS OF WESTERN
MAINLAND MEXICO AND SOUTHERN BAJA CALIFORNIA PENINSULA THROUGH THE
WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM MST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.4N 108.8W
ABOUT 385 MI...620 KM S OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 325 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Alvin was
located near latitude 17.4 North, longitude 108.8 West. Alvin is
moving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A turn toward the
north is expected later today, and this motion should continue
through the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast, and Alvin is expected to degenerate to a
remnant low on Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Alvin will affect portions of the coasts
of west-central and southwestern Mexico and the southern Baja
California Peninsula through the weekend. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

Tropical Storm Alvin Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
200 AM MST Fri May 30 2025
 
Alvin is unraveling quickly.  Overnight satellite surface wind data 
placed the center of the storm near the southern edge of the cold 
cloud tops.  The vertical wind shear analysis from CIMSS-UW 
estimates that Alvin has entered a region of strong shear.  The 
initial intensity is lowered slightly to 45 kt, based on the recent 
scatterometer observations.
 
The storm is moving north-northwestward at 9 kt.  Alvin should 
gradually turn toward the north over the next day or so as it moves 
towards a weakness in the ridge.  Only minor adjustments have been 
made to the official forecast, which lies near the various consensus 
aids.
 
The increasingly hostile environmental conditions are expected to 
weaken Alvin further over the next 24 h.  Strong vertical wind 
shear and cooling sea surface temperatures should cause the storm 
to become a post-tropical remnant low by this weekend.  No 
significant changes were made to the latest NHC intensity forecast.
