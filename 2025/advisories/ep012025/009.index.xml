BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Alvin Advisory Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
200 PM MST Fri May 30 2025
 
...TROPICAL STORM ALVIN MOVING NORTH-NORTHWESTWARD...
 
...LARGE SWELL AND RIP CURRENTS POSSIBLE ACROSS PORTIONS OF WESTERN
MAINLAND MEXICO AND SOUTHERN BAJA CALIFORNIA PENINSULA THROUGH THE
WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM MST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.1N 109.0W
ABOUT 335 MI...540 KM S OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 335 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Alvin was
located near latitude 18.1 North, longitude 109.0 West. Alvin is
moving toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A turn 
toward the north is expected tonight, and this motion should 
continue through the weekend.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Weakening is forecast, and Alvin is expected to degenerate to 
a remnant low on Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Alvin will affect portions of the coasts
of west-central and southwestern Mexico and the southern Baja
California Peninsula through the weekend. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM MST.

Tropical Storm Alvin Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
200 PM MST Fri May 30 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Alvin has gradually degraded today. 
Alvin is entering an environment of strong south-southwesterly wind 
shear.  Although much of the convection has been pushed off to the 
north and become elongated, the low-level center still appears to be 
underneath the southernmost portion of the central dense overcast.  
A pair of recent ASCAT passes missed the center, but still provided 
useful information that shows somewhat larger 34-kt radii, so these 
have been been expanded a bit.  The ASCAT data show winds up to 40 
kt about 50 n mi east of the center, but there is a good chance that 
stronger winds are still occurring slightly closer to the center 
where there was a gap in ASCAT data. The latest subjective intensity 
estimates from TAFB and SAB are T-2.5/35 kt, and the latest 
objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS are in the 41-47 kt 
range.  The intensity is held at 45 kt for this advisory since the 
low-level center has not emerged from underneath the central dense 
overcast yet, and based on the ASCAT data.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be north-northwest, or 335/9 kt.
Alvin is forecast to turn northward tonight as it moves through a 
weakness in the subtropical ridge, toward the east side of a 
mid-level cutoff low located just west of Baja California.  Little 
change is made to the previous NHC track prediction, which lies down 
the middle of the consensus model envelope.
 
Alvin will continue moving into an increasingly hostile environment
of very strong wind shear, dry air, and sea-surface temperatures
that will drop below 26C along Alvin's path in about 6 hours.  
These conditions should lead to Alvin losing its convection on
Saturday, which is depicted by the GFS and ECMWF simulated
satellite imagery.  There are no significant changes to the NHC
intensity forecast, and Alvin is forecast to degenerate to a
remnant low in about 24 hours, with dissipation predicted to 
occur in about 2 days.
