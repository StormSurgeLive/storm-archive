BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Alvin Advisory Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
200 PM MST Thu May 29 2025
 
...TROPICAL STORM ALVIN CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM MST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.1N 107.2W
ABOUT 565 MI...910 KM SSE OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 320 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Alvin was 
located near latitude 15.1 North, longitude 107.2 West. Alvin is 
moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). This general 
motion is expected to continue through today, followed by a 
northward turn tomorrow and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Some additional strengthening is expected through 
early tomorrow, but weakening is expected to begin by late Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Alvin will affect portions of the coast of
west-central Mexico and the coast of the southern Baja California
Peninsula during the next couple of days. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM MST.

Tropical Storm Alvin Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
200 PM MST Thu May 29 2025
 
Satellite imagery depicts that Alvin has continued to become better 
organized throughout the day, showing convective banding and a 
central dense overcast with cold cloud tops near -75C located over 
the low-level center. An earlier scatterometer pass shows wind 
speeds around 45 kt. Given the improving convective structure since 
that pass, and increasing objective satellite intensity estimates, 
the initial intensity has increased to 50 kt for this advisory.
 
The initial motion is 320/10 kt.  The storm is expected to continue
moving toward the northwest today, then begin turning toward the
north-northwest tomorrow as it moves around a ridge centered over
central Mexico. By tomorrow night, Alvin will begin moving northward
as it is influenced by a mid-level cut-off low. The NHC track
forecast is very near the previous one.
 
The storm will remain within a favorable environment of warm sea 
surface temperatures and low wind shear over the next 12 hours or 
so. Given the latest convective trends and conducive conditions, the 
peak intensity forecast has increased this cycle to 60 kt. Tomorrow, 
Alvin will begin to move into a hostile environment with cooler 
SSTs, higher wind shear, and a drier mid-level airmass which will 
induce weakening. Latest model derived IR imagery from both the 
ECMWF and GFS depict the system becoming devoid of convection, and 
the latest NHC forecast depicts the system becoming a remnant low in 
48 h. Thus, there is high confidence that the system will weaken to 
a remnant low before it nears the Baja California Peninsula.
