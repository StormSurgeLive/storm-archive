BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Alvin Advisory Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
800 PM MST Fri May 30 2025
 
...ALVIN WEAKENING...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 PM MST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.1N 109.1W
ABOUT 265 MI...430 KM S OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 350 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1003 MB...29.62 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM MST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Alvin was
located near latitude 19.1 North, longitude 109.1 West. Alvin is
moving toward the north near 10 mph (17 km/h). A slightly slower 
north-northwestward or northward motion is expected during the next 
day or two.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Continued weakening is forecast, and Alvin is 
expected to become a remnant low on Saturday and dissipate entirely 
on Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Alvin will affect portions of the coasts
of west-central and southwestern Mexico and the southern Baja
California Peninsula through the weekend. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM MST.

Tropical Storm Alvin Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
800 PM MST Fri May 30 2025
 
Alvin is losing strength due to the influences of strong shear and 
intrusions of dry air. The low-level center is now exposed to the 
south of a decaying area of thunderstorms, and the cloud pattern is 
becoming increasingly ragged. A blend of the latest satellite 
intensity estimates supports lowering the initial intensity to 40 
kt. Continued strong southerly shear, dry air, and cool SSTs should 
cause additional weakening, and Alvin is expected to become a 
remnant low on Saturday and dissipate entirely on Sunday.
 
The storm is moving northward at 9 kt. A slightly slower
north-northwestward or northward motion is expected within the low-
to mid-level flow until the system dissipates. Alvin is forecast to
become a weak remnant low or an open trough by the time it nears
the southern Baja California peninsula.
