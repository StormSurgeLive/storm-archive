BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Flossie Advisory Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
200 AM MST Thu Jul 03 2025
 
...FLOSSIE WEAKENS INTO A TROPICAL STORM...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM MST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.1N 111.0W
ABOUT 205 MI...330 KM SSW OF CABO SAN LUCAS MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...994 MB...29.36 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Flossie was 
located near latitude 20.1 North, longitude 111.0 West. Flossie is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue during the next couple of 
days. 
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Steady weakening is expected during the next day or 
so, with the system forecast to become a post-tropical remnant low 
later today.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Flossie will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula during the
next few days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM MST.

Tropical Storm Flossie Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
200 AM MST Thu Jul 03 2025
 
Flossie continues to rapidly weaken, with a recent ASCAT pass 
indicating instrument derived winds of only 40 to 45 kt north of 
the center. The cycloneâ€™s structure has further degraded, with deep 
convection absent and the low-level circulation now fully exposed. 
Both subjective and objective satellite current intensity estimates 
reflect this weakening trend, and the initial intensity has been 
lowered to 50 kt based on a blend of these data.

The initial motion is 300/8 kt. Flossie continues to move along the 
southwestern edge of a mid-level ridge situated over northern 
Mexico. This general motion is expected to persist for the next 
couple of days. The updated forecast track is nearly unchanged from 
the previous advisory and remains close to the consensus guidance.

Continued weakening is anticipated as the system moves over cooler 
waters and remains embedded in a dry and stable environment. With no 
deep convection, Flossie is forecast to become a post-tropical 
remnant low later today, with dissipation expected by 60 hours, if 
not sooner.
