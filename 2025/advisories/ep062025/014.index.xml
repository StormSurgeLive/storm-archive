...FLOSSIE MOVING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM MST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.0N 109.0W
ABOUT 275 MI...445 KM SSE OF CABO SAN LUCAS MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...110 MPH...175 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...967 MB...28.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Flossie was 
located near latitude 19.0 North, longitude 109.0 West. Flossie is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue during the next couple of 
days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 110 mph (175 km/h) with higher
gusts. Steady to rapid weakening is expected the next few days, 
with the system forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone late 
Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 967 mb (28.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Flossie will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico, and the Baja California peninsula during the
next few days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

Hurricane Flossie Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
800 AM MST Wed Jul 02 2025
 
Satellite imagery shows that the inner core of Flossie has started 
to degrade this morning, and the eye has become more ragged and 
cloud filled. An AMSR2 microwave pass around 0916 UTC shows that 
the northern eyewall has started to deteriorate, and is open on the 
northern side. This suggest a weakening trend has begun, and Flossie 
has likely reached peak intensity. While the system has peaked, deep 
cold convection continues to wrap around the southern and eastern 
side of the system. Satellite intensity estimates range from 90-100 
kt. Given the latest satellite trends and using a blend of the 
estimates, the initial intensity is set to 95 kt for this advisory.
 
Flossie continues to move toward the west-northwest or 300/9 knots.
This general motion is expected to continue throughout the remainder
of the forecast period, towards a weakness in the mid-level ridge.
The latest NHC track forecast was nudged slightly to the right of
the previous, and lies near the HCCA corrected consensus.
 
A steady to rapid weakening trend is expected to begin today. Along 
the forecast track, Flossie will continue to move into cooler sea 
surface temperatures and drier mid-level air.  Thus, the NHC 
intensity forecast shows a little quicker weakening trend compared 
to the previous, and lies near the simple intensity consensus. 
Flossie expected to become a post-tropical low by 36 hours, with 
dissipation following by 96 hours.
