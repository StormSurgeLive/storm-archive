couple of days, and the system is expected to become a hurricane
tonight or Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Flossie can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header
WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Flossie is expected to produce rainfall
totals of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 10 inches,
across portions of the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero,
Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco through Wednesday. This rainfall
could lead to isolated life-threatening flooding and mudslides,
especially in steep terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Flossie, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area, and are possible within the watch areas, tonight through
Tuesday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Flossie will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

      <title>Tropical Storm Flossie Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Tropical Storm Flossie Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
300 PM CST Mon Jun 30 2025
 
Flossie's satellite presentation has continued to improve throughout 
the day, with convective cold cloud tops near -80C over the 
low-level center, and well-defined curve banding features. An 
earlier scatterometer pass around 1629 UTC showed a peak wind of 47 
kt, and helped to refine the current tropical-storm-force wind 
radii. Latest objective and subjective satellite intensity estimates 
range from 45 to 55 kt, including a T/3.5 from TAFB. Given the 
satellite trends, the intensity is set to 55 kt closes to UW-CIMSS 
ADT and the TAFB Dvorak estimates.

The storm is within a favorable environment to continue 
strengthening, current SSTs are around 29-30C, with low vertical 
wind shear. The NHC intensity forecast remains on the higher end of 
the guidance envelope and now has a peak intensity of 90 kt, closest 
to the regional hurricane HAFS models. In about 48 h, environmental 
conditions become increasingly more hostile, with drier air and 
cooler sea surface temperatures, which should induce a steady 
weakening trend. By day 4, Flossie is forecast to become a 
post-tropical cyclone as the system will struggle to produce 
convection within the harsh environment.
 
The initial estimated motion is toward the northwest, or 305/10 kt. 
A northwest to west-northwest motion is expected throughout the 
forecast period steered by a mid-level ridge. The NHC track forecast 
was nudged slightly to the left and lies closest to the HCCA 
corrected consensus aids.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Flossie should bring locally 
heavy rainfall to coastal portions of the Mexican states of 
Guerrero, Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco through Wednesday. 
Life-threatening flooding and mudslides are possible, particularly 
in steep terrain.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the 
tropical storm warning area in southwestern Mexico, later today 
through Tuesday.
