DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM CST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Flossie was
located near latitude 17.4 North, longitude 105.9 West. Flossie is
moving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A general
northwestward to west-northwestward motion with a slight decrease
in forward speed is expected for the next few days. On the forecast
track, Flossie should move away from southwestern Mexico today and
tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 100 mph (155 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is expected through
Wednesday morning, and Flossie could become a major hurricane
tonight or Wednesday morning. Steady to rapid weakening is expected
starting late Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 974 mb (28.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Flossie can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header
WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Hurricane Flossie should produce additional rainfall
totals of 2 to 4 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 6 inches,
across coastal portions of the Mexican states of Michoac√°n, Colima,
and Jalisco into Wednesday. This rainfall could lead to localized
flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Flossie, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within portions of the
warning area, and are possible within the watch areas, for the next
several hours.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Flossie will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1200 PM CST.
Next complete advisory at 300 PM CST.

Hurricane Flossie Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
900 AM CST Tue Jul 01 2025
 
Flossie is still intensifying, with conventional satellite imagery 
showing a curved band pattern with cloud tops colder than -80C and a 
formative eye. In addition, recent microwave overpasses show an eye 
and eyewall present under the convective overcast.  The latest 
subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates are generally 
in the 75-85 kt range, and based on current trends the initial 
intensity is set at 85 kt.
 
The initial motion is 305/9 kt.  A general northwestward to 
west-northwestward motion with some decrease in forward speed is 
expected during the next 3-4 days as Flossie moves toward a weakness 
in the subtropical ridge.  After that time, the cyclone or its 
remnants is forecast to turn westward as they become steered more by 
the low-level flow.  The new forecast track, which generally splits 
the difference between the HCCA corrected consensus and the other 
consensus models, is a little north of the previous forecast through 
72 h and a little south of the previous track after that time.
 
The wind shear and moisture are forecast to be favorable for
strengthening as long as Flossie remains over warm water.  While
the hurricane is starting to move over decreasing sea surface
temperatures, the intensity guidance suggests it will take about
24 h to reach water cold enough to stop intensification. Based on
this, the new intensity forecast calls for another 24 h of 
strengthening. After that, Flossie is expected to rapidly weaken, 
with the system becoming post-tropical by 72 h and a remnant low by 
96 h.  The forecast is near the high end of the intensity guidance
for the first 36 h and near the intensity consensus for the rest of
the forecast period.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Outer bands of Hurricane Flossie should continue to bring locally
heavy rainfall to coastal portions of the Mexican states of
Michoac√°n, Colima, and Jalisco into Wednesday. Localized flash
flooding is possible.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the
tropical storm warning area in southwestern Mexico for the next
several hours.
