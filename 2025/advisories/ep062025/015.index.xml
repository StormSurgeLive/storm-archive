SUMMARY OF 200 PM MST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.5N 109.8W
ABOUT 235 MI...380 KM S OF CABO SAN LUCAS MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...100 MPH...155 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...974 MB...28.77 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Flossie was
located near latitude 19.5 North, longitude 109.8 West. Flossie is
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this
general motion is expected to continue during the next couple of
days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 100 mph (155 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Steady to rapid weakening is expected during 
the next few days, with the system forecast to become a 
post-tropical cyclone late Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 974 mb (28.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Flossie will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula during the
next few days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM MST.

Hurricane Flossie Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
200 PM MST Wed Jul 02 2025

Flossie is feeling the effects of decreasing sea surface 
temperatures, with the associated convection waning and becoming 
asymmetric.  The latest subjective satellite intensity estimates 
indicate weakening, and recent objective satellite estimates are in 
the 80-90 kt range.  Based on this, the initial intensity is 
decreased to a possibly generous 85 kt.  The initial wind radii have 
been revised based on a 1638Z ASCAT overpass.
 
The initial motion is 305/8 kt.  Flossie is moving toward a break 
in the subtropical ridge caused by a mid- to upper-level trough 
over California and the adjacent Pacific. A general northwestward 
motion should continue for the next couple of days. After that, 
Flossie should lose vertical depth as it weakens, with the remnant 
low being steered more toward the west-northwest by the mean 
low-level flow. The new forecast track is almost identical to the 
previous track and lies near the various consensus models.

Steady to rapid weakening is forecast to continue as Flossie moves 
over cooler water and into a drier air mass. The cyclone is 
predicted to become post-tropical in about 36 h as it stops 
producing convection, and it is expected to decay to a remnant low 
thereafter.  The system is forecast to dissipate completely by    
96 h, and this could happen earlier than currently forecast.
