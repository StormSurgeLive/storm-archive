Interests elsewhere in southwestern Mexico should monitor the
progress of Tropical Storm Flossie.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM CST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Flossie was
located near latitude 13.7 North, longitude 100.7 West. Flossie is
moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A
west-northwest to northwestward motion should continue over the next
few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Steady strengthening is forecast during the next few days,
and the system is expected to become a hurricane late Monday or
Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Flossie can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header
WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Flossie is expected to produce rainfall
totals of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 10 inches,
across portions of the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero,
Michoac√°n, Colima, and Jalisco through early this week. This
rainfall may lead to areas of life-threatening flooding and
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Flossie, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible along the coast within
the watch area late Monday and Tuesday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Flossie will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Flossie Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
300 PM CST Sun Jun 29 2025
 
Earlier SSMIS microwave data and satellite imagery depicted Flossie 
becoming better organized with curved banding features. However, 
recent imagery shows that banding has become a little more broken 
since the previous advisory, as Flossie is still trying to organize 
and consolidate. A 1600 UTC METOP-C scatterometer pass shows that 
the low-level center has become better defined, however was slightly 
south of the previously estimated position, and satellite-derived 
winds were around 31 kt. Using the scatterometer data and the latest 
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates T2.5, from both TAFB and SAB, 
the intensity is held at 35 kt for this advisory.
 
Flossie is located within a favorable environment for strengthening 
with warm sea surface temperatures, plentiful moisture and low to 
moderate wind shear. As the system becomes better organized, steady 
strengthening is forecast. Rapid intensification indices remain 
elevated in latest SHIPS guidance, however RI is not explicitly 
forecast at this time. The latest NHC intensity forecast is similar 
to the previous, closest to the hurricane regional aids, but lies 
slightly below the HCCA corrected consensus.
 
The current motion is estimated to be westward-northwestward around 
295/7 kt. The storm is forecast moving west-northwestward  with a 
turn towards the northwest anticipated tomorrow around the western 
periphery of a subtropical ridge. The latest track forecast is near 
the previous, and lies between the simple and HCCA corrected 
consensus aids.
 
Residents of Mexico should stay updated on the latest forecast.  A 
track even a little more to the right of the official forecast could 
bring more significant impacts to the coast of southwestern Mexico.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Flossie may bring locally heavy 
rainfall to the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoac√°n, 
Colima, and Jalisco through early this week. Life-threatening 
flooding and mudslides are possible, particularly in areas of steep 
terrain.
 
2. A tropical storm watch is in effect for southwestern Mexico, and 
tropical storm warnings could be required later tonight for a 
portion of the coast of southern Mexico.
