DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM CST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Flossie was
located near latitude 14.0 North, longitude 101.0 West. Flossie is
moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A
west-northwest to northwestward motion should continue over the next
few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Steady-to-rapid strengthening is forecast during the next few days,
and the system is expected to become a hurricane late Monday or
Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Flossie can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header
WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Flossie is expected to produce rainfall
totals of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 10 inches,
across portions of the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero,
Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco through early this week. This
rainfall may lead to areas of life-threatening flooding and
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Flossie, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible along the coast within
the watch area late Monday and Tuesday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Flossie will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

      <title>Tropical Storm Flossie Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>

Tropical Storm Flossie Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
900 PM CST Sun Jun 29 2025
 
Flossie is holding steady as a broad tropical storm.  New bursts of 
deep convection are forming in the southern semicircle with cloud 
top temperatures near -80 degrees C.  Earlier microwave imagery 
showed the circulation open to the east, indicating a possible dry 
air intrusion.  Subjective and objective satellite intensity 
estimates range between 31 to 45 kt, with the majority near 35 kt.  
Therefore, the intensity is held at 35 kt for this advisory.

The tropical storm is expected to strengthen during the next couple 
of days.  Warm waters, low vertical wind shear, and abundant 
mid-level moisture should allow for Flossie to strengthen.  Rapid 
intensification indices are relatively high compared to climatology, 
and the official NHC forecast shows periods of steady-to-rapid 
intensification in the next two days.  However, the forecast lies on 
the high end of the intensity guidance envelope.  Beyond the peak at 
48 h, Flossie should gradually encounter a dry and stable airmass 
and cross over cooling waters which will lead to steady weakening.  
 
The current motion is westward-northwestward at 295/7 kt. Flossie is 
forecast to move west-northwestward with a turn towards the 
northwest anticipated soon around the western edge of a subtropical 
ridge.  The track guidance envelope shifted noticeably westward.  
The latest track forecast shifted to the left of the previous 
advisory, and lies on the right side of the envelope, closest to the 
HCCA corrected consensus aid.
 
Residents of Mexico should stay updated on the latest forecast.  A 
shift in track to the right of the official forecast could bring 
more significant impacts to the coast of southwestern Mexico.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Flossie may bring locally heavy
rainfall to the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoacán,
Colima, and Jalisco through early this week. Life-threatening
flooding and mudslides are possible, particularly in areas of steep
terrain.
 
2. A tropical storm watch is in effect for southwestern Mexico, and
tropical storm warnings could be required on Monday for a portion 
of the coast of southern Mexico.
