WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Southwest coast of Mexico from Zihuatanejo to Manzanillo
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in southwestern Mexico should monitor the
progress of Tropical Depression Six-E.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM CST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Six-E
was located near latitude 13.2 North, longitude 99.7 West. The
depression is moving toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h). A
west-northwestward to northwestward motion should begin later today
and continue through the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Gradual strengthening is forecast today, followed by 
steady to rapid strengthening thereafter, and the system is expected 
to become a hurricane on Tuesday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Six-E is expected to produce rainfall
totals of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 10 inches,
across portions of the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero,
Michoac√°n, Colima, and Jalisco through early next week. This
rainfall may lead to areas of life-threatening flooding and
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Depression Six-E, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep6.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible along the coast within
the watch area Monday and Tuesday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Depression Six-E will begin
increasing along the coast of southwestern Mexico Monday and
continue into mid-week. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM CST.

Tropical Depression Six-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
300 AM CST Sun Jun 29 2025

The convection associated with the area of low pressure located 
south of southern Mexico has become much better organized over the 
past 12 hours.  Additionally, a 29/0328 UTC ASCAT-C pass showed a 
well-defined, closed low-level circulation with maximum winds around 
25 kt.  The latest subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates 
from TAFB and SAB are T-2.5 and T-2.0, respectively.  The 
disturbance is upgraded to a tropical depression based on the 
development of organized convection and a well-defined center. 

The aforementioned ASCAT pass shows that Tropical Depression Six-E 
has a large RMW.  However, the cyclone is located within a favorable 
environment with warm SSTs, a moist mid-level troposphere and low to 
moderate vertical wind shear.  The depression is forecast to remain 
in these favorable conditions for another 3 to 4 days as it 
parallels the coast of Mexico.  Due to the large RMW, only slow 
strengthening is forecast for the first 24 h.  The system is 
expected to strengthen more quickly once it establishes a stronger 
convective core, and rapid intensification appears likely to occur 
by Tuesday.  The NHC intensity forecast is at the high end of the 
intensity guidance, especially at 60-72 h, and calls for the 
system to become a significant hurricane.  By 96 h, the cyclone 
should reach cooler water, and rapid weakening is likely in 4 to 5 
days, with the system likely becoming a remnant low around day 5. 

The current motion of the depression is estimated to be westward, or 
270/10 kt.   The cyclone is forecast to generally move in a 
direction between west-northwest and northwest for the next few 
days, toward a weakness in the subtropical ridge, and the model 
guidance is in good agreement on this general scenario.  The NHC 
forecast is down the middle of the guidance envelope, close to the 
TVCE consensus.  

Residents of Mexico should stay updated on the latest forecast.  A 
track even a little to the right of the official forecast would 
bring more significant impacts to the coast of southwestern Mexico.
