DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 AM CST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Flossie was
located near latitude 16.5 North, longitude 104.7 West. Flossie is

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Steady to rapid strengthening is forecast 
during the next day or so, with weakening starting by late 
Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115
miles (185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 984 mb (29.06 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Flossie can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header
WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Hurricane Flossie is expected to produce rainfall totals
of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 8 inches, across
portions of the Mexican states of Guerrero, Michoacán, Colima, and
Jalisco through Wednesday. This rainfall could lead to isolated
life-threatening flooding and mudslides, especially in steep
terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Flossie, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within portions of the
warning area, and are possible within the watch areas, overnight 
through this afternoon.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Flossie will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Flossie Discussion Number   8...Corrected
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
900 PM CST Mon Jun 30 2025

Corrected Key Message 1 from Tropical Storm to Hurricane.
 
The satellite presentation of Flossie has continued to improve this 
evening, with a hint of an eye now possibly developing in the past 
hour or so. The latest subjective Dvorak intensity estimates came in 
at T4.0/65 knots and T3.5/55 knots from SAB and TAFB respectively. 
The objective intensity estimates range from 56 to 62 knots at 00z 
and have since increased to between 62 and 74 knots. Based on these 
data and the improved satellite appearance, the initial intensity 
has been raised to 65 knots for this advisory package, making 
Flossie a hurricane.

Flossie is heading toward the west-northwest or 300/09 knots. This 
motion with a gradual decrease in forward speed is expected during 
the next several days as the cyclone is steered into a weakness in 
the mid-level ridge to the northwest. The track forecast is very 
close to the previous advisory and is closely aligned with a 
blend of the latest HCCA, TVCE and FSSE consensus aids.

The environment will remain very conducive for strengthening during 
the next 36 hours, with warm sea surface temperatures of 28/29C, 
abundant mid-level moisture, and light vertical wind shear. In 
fact, the latest SHIPS RI probabilities show a greater than 60% 
chance of a 25-knot increase in 24 hours, and the official 
forecast reflects this. Additional strengthening is forecast 
through 36 hours, with the cyclone beginning to weaken by 48 hours 
as it moves over cooler water. Rather rapid weakening will then 
follow as Flossie moves over progressively cooler water and begins 
to entrain dry mid-level air.  The system is forecast to become a 
post-tropical low by 72 hours and a post-tropical remnant low at 
96 hours. The intensity forecast is on the high end of the 
intensity aids, closest to SHIPS and NNIC, which show rapid 
intensification.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Hurricane Flossie should bring locally
heavy rainfall to coastal portions of the Mexican states of
Guerrero, Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco through Wednesday.
Life-threatening flooding and mudslides are possible, particularly
in steep terrain.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the
tropical storm warning area in southwestern Mexico, tonight
through Tuesday.
