SUR...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 PM MST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.8N 110.2W
ABOUT 215 MI...345 KM S OF CABO SAN LUCAS MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...986 MB...29.12 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM MST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Flossie was 
located near latitude 19.8 North, longitude 110.2 West. Flossie is 
moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue during the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Rapid weakening is expected during the next day or so, with 
the system forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone late Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles
(110 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 986 mb (29.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Flossie will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula during the
next few days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM MST.

Hurricane Flossie Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
800 PM MST Wed Jul 02 2025
 
Flossie is rapidly weakening, with deep convection now confined to 
the western and southwestern quadrants of the circulation and the 
low-level center almost fully exposed. This trend is supported by 
recent Dvorak classifications, with current intensity estimates from 
TAFB at 4.5/77 kt and SAB at 4.0/65 kt. Objective satellite 
intensity estimates range between 56 and 72 kt. A blend of these 
data supports lowering the initial intensity to 65 kt.
 
The initial motion is 305/7 kt. Flossie is moving along the 
southwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge, with a weakness in 
the ridge induced by a mid- to upper-level trough over the Baja 
California region. A continued northwestward motion is expected 
during the next couple of days, followed by a gradual turn toward 
the west-northwest as the system decouples vertically. The latest 
forecast track remains very close to the previous advisory and is 
well-supported by the consensus aids.

Rapid weakening is expected to continue as Flossie moves over 
progressively cooler waters and into a more stable and drier 
environment. The cyclone is forecast to become post-tropical by late 
Thursday, or within the next 24 hours, and degenerate into a remnant 
low shortly thereafter. The system is expected to dissipate by late 
Saturday, around 72 hours from now.
