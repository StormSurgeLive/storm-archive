DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM CST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Flossie was 
located near latitude 13.4 North, longitude 99.9 West. Flossie is 
moving toward the west near 9 mph (15 km/h). A west-northwestward to 
northwestward motion should begin later today and continue over the 
next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Steady strengthening is forecast during the next few 
days, and the system is expected to become a hurricane late Monday 
or Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Flossie can be found in the Tropical 
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header 
WTPZ41 KNHC.

RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Flossie is expected to produce rainfall
totals of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 10 inches,
across portions of the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero,
Michoac√°n, Colima, and Jalisco through early next week. This
rainfall may lead to areas of life-threatening flooding and
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Flossie, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible along the coast within
the watch area late Monday and Tuesday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Flossie will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Flossie Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
900 AM CST Sun Jun 29 2025
 
Convection has continued to become better organized this morning, 
with curved banding to the north of the low-level center. Recent 
infrared satellite imagery depicts that convection is bursting near 
the low-level center with cold cloud tops near -80C. The latest 
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates were T2.5, from both TAFB and 
SAB. Using these estimates and the recent satellite trends, the 
intensity is raised to 35 kt for this advisory. Thus, the sixth 
named system in the eastern Pacific, Tropical Storm Flossie.

Flossie is located within a favorable environment for strengthening 
with warm SSTs near 30C, moist mid-levels and low to moderate wind 
shear. As the system continues to become better organized, the 
latest NHC forecast now depicts steady strengthening, with the storm 
becoming a hurricane in about 36 h. While not explicitly forecast, 
there are some above normal SHIPS rapid intensification (RI) 
probabilities and there is potential for RI, which will have to be 
monitored in subsequent forecasts. The NHC intensity forecast 
remains near the higher end of the guidance envelope near the latest 
HCCA corrected consensus aids. 
 
The current motion is estimated to be westward around 280/8 kt, 
although as the inner core continues to develop there could be some 
short-term track adjustments. The storm is forecast to begin to move 
west-northwestward later today then northwestward around the western 
periphery of a subtropical ridge. The latest track forecast is 
nudged slightly to the right, in between the simple consensus HCCA 
corrected consensus.
 
Residents of Mexico should stay updated on the latest forecast.  A
track even a little more to the right of the official forecast could
bring more significant impacts to the coast of southwestern Mexico.

KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Flossie may bring locally heavy 
rainfall to the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoac√°n, 
Colima and Jalisco through early next week. Life-threatening 
flooding and mudslides are possible, particularly in areas of steep 
terrain.
 
2. A tropical storm watch is in effect for southwestern Mexico, and 
tropical storm warnings could be required later today or tonight for 
a portion of the coast of southern Mexico.
