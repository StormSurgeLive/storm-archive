DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Flossie was
located near latitude 18.6 North, longitude 108.3 West. Flossie is

Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Flossie is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in strength is forecast this 
morning, with rapid weakening expected to begin by the end of the 
day. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 962 mb (28.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Flossie can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header
WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Hurricane Flossie should produce additional rainfall
totals of 1 to 2 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 3 inches,
across coastal portions of the Mexican states of Michoacán, Colima,
and Jalisco through today. This rainfall could lead to localized
flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Flossie, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Flossie will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico, and the Baja California peninsula during the
next few days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM MST.

Hurricane Flossie Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
200 AM MST Wed Jul 02 2025
 
Flossie remains an impressive hurricane early this morning, although 
the well-defined eye evident earlier tonight has become less 
distinct and somewhat cloud filled in recent satellite images.  The 
latest subjective Dvorak intensity estimates were T5.5/102 knots 
from TAFB and T5.0/90 knots from SAB. Meanwhile, the objective 
intensity estimates ranged from 96 to 107 knots at 06z.  Based on a 
blend of these data, the initial intensity will be held at 100 knots 
for this advisory. 

Flossie is heading toward the west-northwest or 300/9 knots. This 
general motion is expected to continue during the next several days 
as the cyclone is steered into a weakness in the mid-level ridge to 
the northwest of the system. A turn more to the west is expected 
beyond 48 hours as the increasingly shallow system becomes steered 
by the low-level trade wind flow.  The track forecast has been 
shifted slightly to the left of the previous advisory to align with 
the latest consensus guidance trends, and closely follows a blend of 
the latest GDMI, FSSE and TVCE consensus aids.

The window for additional strengthening appears to be closing 
quickly, as Flossie begins to move over slightly less conducive 
waters for intensification with sea surface temperatures now around 
27C.  Wind shear remains light and mid-level moisture remains high 
during the next 12 hours, so with the system remaining over 
adequately warm water, the intensity should change little.  Flossie 
will move over much cooler water between 12 and 24 hours, and into a 
drier mid-level environment.  This should result in rather rapid 
weakening of the system, with Flossie expected to become a 
post-tropical low by 48 hours, with dissipation following by 96 
hours. The intensity forecast has been adjusted to show a bit faster 
weakening of the system which is in line with the latest intensity 
consensus aids.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Outer bands of Hurricane Flossie continue to bring locally heavy 
rainfall to coastal portions of the Mexican states of Michoacán, 
Colima, and Jalisco into Wednesday. Localized flash flooding is 
possible.
 
2. Large swells generated by Flossie will cause life-threatening 
surf and rip current conditions along portions of the coast of 
southwestern Mexico, and the Baja California peninsula during the
next few days.
