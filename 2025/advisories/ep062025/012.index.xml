At 800 PM MST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Flossie was 
located near latitude 18.2 North, longitude 107.4 West. Flossie is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A 
west-northwestward to northwestward motion is anticipated during the 
next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 115 mph (185 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Flossie is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some additional strengthening 
is possible tonight and Wednesday morning.  Later Wednesday, steady 
to rapid weakening is expected.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 962 mb (28.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Flossie can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header

RAINFALL: Hurricane Flossie should produce additional rainfall
totals of 1 to 2 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 3 inches,
across coastal portions of the Mexican states of Michoac√°n, Colima,
and Jalisco into Wednesday. This rainfall could lead to localized
flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Flossie, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within portions of the
warning area for the next few hours.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Flossie will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico, and the Baja California peninsula during the
next few days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1100 PM MST.
Next complete advisory at 200 AM MST.

Hurricane Flossie Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
800 PM MST Tue Jul 01 2025
 
After briefly filling, the ragged eye of Flossie has reappeared on 
geostationary satellite imagery.  An SSMIS microwave satellite image 
from 0133 UTC showed that the northern eyewall was slightly eroded.  
Since then, infrared satellite observations have shown continuous 
deep convective bursts in the northeastern quadrant. Objective and 
subjective satellite intensity estimates range between 90 to 107 
kts.  The initial intensity is nudged up to 100 kt based on a blend 
of these estimates.  

Flossie has about a 12-24 hour window to strengthen in conducive 
environmental conditions.  Thereafter, global models suggest drier 
air and moderate vertical wind sheer could beginning disrupting the 
circulation on Wednesday.  These conditions should coincide with 
the storm crossing the 26 degree isotherm and moving over cooler 
waters which should hasten weakening.  Flossie is now forecast to 
become a post-tropical cyclone in 48 h.  

The hurricane is moving west-northwestward at 8 kt.  The track 
forecast reasoning has not changed.  Flossie should continue moving 
west-northwestward or northwestward toward a weakness in the 
subtropical ridge for the next few days.  As the system becomes more 
shallow, it should gradually turn westward in the low-level flow.  
Only minor changes have been made to the latest official forecast.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Outer bands of Hurricane Flossie continue to bring locally heavy
rainfall to coastal portions of the Mexican states of Michoac√°n,
Colima, and Jalisco into Wednesday. Localized flash flooding is
possible.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the
tropical storm warning area in southwestern Mexico for the next few
hours.
