Remnants Of Lorenzo Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122025
500 PM AST Wed Oct 15 2025
 
Visible satellite imagery shows that Lorenzo no longer has a 
well-defined circulation and has dissipated.  Recent microwave 
imagery also suggested that the system had opened to its west. 
Satellite intensity estimates have decreased as well, indicating 
that Lorenzo has lost its organized convection. The initial 
intensity is lowered to 30 kt based on a blend of these estimates. 
The remnants of Lorenzo have turned northeastward and are moving an 
estimated 16 kt.  This general motion with an accelerated forward 
speed is expected for the next day or so.
 
Additional information on this system can be found in High Seas
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header
NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at
