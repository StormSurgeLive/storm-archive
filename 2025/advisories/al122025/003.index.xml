Tropical Storm Lorenzo Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122025
500 PM AST Mon Oct 13 2025
 
A mid- to upper-level low to the west of Lorenzo is producing strong 
west-southwesterly shear, causing the low-level center to be mostly 
exposed to the west of the main area of deep convection.  The 
initial intensity is held at 45 kt based on the earlier ASCAT data 
and a T3.0 Dvorak classification from TAFB.  The scatterometer data 
is also the basis for the initial 34-kt wind radii, which shows the 
tropical-storm-force winds mostly limited to the eastern half of the 
storm.
 
Lorenzo is moving northwestward at 10 kt, and that motion should 
continue for about another day.  However, by late Tuesday, a turn to 
the north is forecast as a weakness develops in the subtropical 
ridge over the central Atlantic.  The storm is then expected to turn 
northeastward later in the week as a large-scale mid- to upper-level 
trough approaches from the west.  Most of the models show this 
trough cutting off, causing Lorenzo to slow down and turn eastward 
or southeastward over the weekend.  The NHC track forecast is 
generally similar to the previous one and on the right side of the 
guidance envelope, in best agreement with HCCA. Regardless of the 
details, Lorenzo is not expected to be near land during the next 
several days.
 
The strong shear over Lorenzo is likely to let up during the next 
few days, but the models also show some dry air entraining into the 
circulation.  In fact, some of the global models show Lorenzo 
remaining lopsided and even opening up into a trough.  The NHC 
intensity forecast shows some strengthening, but this is of low 
confidence as there is some possibility that Lorenzo succumbs to 
the unfavorable environmental conditions.  This prediction is a 
little lower than the previous one, but remains near the high end 
of the model guidance.
