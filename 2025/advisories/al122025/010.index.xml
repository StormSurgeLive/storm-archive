Tropical Storm Lorenzo Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122025
1100 AM AST Wed Oct 15 2025
 
Lorenzo continues to struggle to maintain organized, deep 
convection.  Unfortunately, there are no new satellite microwave or 
scatterometer data available to diagnose the state of the low-level 
circulation.  Visible imagery suggests that the center is elongated, 
but the convective remnants are still obscuring the near-surface 
structure.  The initial intensity is held at 35 kt, consistent with 
the TAFB and AiDT satellite estimates.

The tropical storm is moving north-northeastward at 12 kt.  A turn 
toward the northeast with an accelerated motion is expected later 
today as Lorenzo becomes caught up in strong southwesterly flow.  
Model guidance indicates the system will dissipate within 24 hours, 
though this could much occur sooner.
