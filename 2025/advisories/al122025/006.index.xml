Tropical Storm Lorenzo Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122025
1100 AM AST Tue Oct 14 2025
 
Lorenzo remains a poorly organized storm over the tropical central
Atlantic.  The system is producing a few clusters of deep 
convection, one of which is currently over the low-level center. The 
satellite intensity estimates have come down and now range from 30 
to 39 kt.  In addition, very recent ASCAT passes show peak winds of 
about 35 kt.  Based on these data, the initial intensity is lowered 
to 40 kt.
 
Lorenzo continues to move northwestward at 13 kt.  A turn to the
north is expected later today as the storm moves into a weakness in
the subtropical ridge.  On Wednesday, the storm is likely to turn
northeastward when it moves in the flow between an approaching
mid-to upper-level trough and the subtropical ridge over the eastern
Atlantic.  If the storm survives, the system could turn eastward or
southeastward this weekend on the northern periphery of the ridge.
The track guidance is in fair agreement, and no big changes were
made to the previous prediction.
 
The storm is currently embedded in a sheared and dry environment, 
and those conditions are expected to persist during the next several 
days.  The model guidance shows little to no strengthening.  In 
fact, most of the global models show Lorenzo remaining lopsided, and 
then opening up into a trough within the next few days.  Based on a 
combination of the models and the lower initial intensity, the NHC 
intensity forecast has again been nudged downward, and now shows 
dissipation occurring by day 4.
