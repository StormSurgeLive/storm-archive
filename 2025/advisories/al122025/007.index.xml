Tropical Storm Lorenzo Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122025
500 PM AST Tue Oct 14 2025
 
Lorenzo is really struggling over the tropical Atlantic.  The
system is now only producing a few clusters of deep convection as
dry air continues to entrain into the circulation.  Based on the
degraded satellite appearance and intensity estimates, the initial
wind speed is lowered to 35 kt.
 
Lorenzo is moving northwestward at 12 kt on the southwest side of a
subtropical ridge over the eastern Atlantic.  A turn to the north
is expected by tonight, followed by a faster northeastward motion on
Wednesday as a mid- to upper-level trough approaches from the west. 
The faster northeastward motion will likely continue until the 
system dissipates in a few days.

Dry air and moderate to strong shear should continue to affect 
Lorenzo during the next several days.  These conditions should 
cause the system to continue to degrade, and Lorenzo is now forecast 
to dissipate by day 3.  In fact, most of the models show Lorenzo 
opening into a trough even sooner than that.
