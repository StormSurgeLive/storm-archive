Tropical Storm Lorenzo Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122025
500 AM AST Wed Oct 15 2025

While convection associated with Lorenzo has increased during the 
last few hours, satellite imagery suggests the circulation is 
becoming elongated north-south as it becomes embedded in the 
mid-latitude westerlies.  Satellite intensity estimates are 
generally in the 30-40 kt range, and the initial intensity will be 
held at 35 kt.

Lorenzo has turned northward with the initial motion now 010/11 kt. 
A turn toward the northeast at a faster forward speed is expected 
later today as the system encounters stronger southwesterly flow, 
and this general motion should continue until the system 
dissipates. The new forecast track is a little to the southeast of 
the previous track and lies close to the various consensus models.

The dynamical guidance continues to indicate that Lorenzo will 
degenerate to a trough due to shear and dry air intrusion, with 
most of the models showing this happening during the next 24 h. The 
new intensity forecast moves up the time of dissipation to between 
24-36 h, and Lorenzo could dissipate earlier than that.
