      <title>Tropical Storm Kiko Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>

Tropical Storm Kiko Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112025
500 PM HST Sun Aug 31 2025
 
Kiko is gradually organizing. The tropical storm is producing bands
of deep convection near the center and on its south side. The
latest satellite intensity estimates are generally between 40 and
45 kt, and based on that data, the initial wind speed is nudged
upward to 40 kt.
 
Kiko is moving westward at 8 kt. An expansive mid-level ridge 
situated across the subtropical eastern and central Pacific should 
keep Kiko on a westward, or perhaps even a little south of due west, 
path throughout the week. The models agree on the overall synoptic 
pattern, but there are notable differences in their predicted 
forward speeds. The NHC track forecast lies near the faster end of 
the model guidance, in best agreement with the HCCA and EMXI models. 
Kiko is likely to cross into the central Pacific basin in 4 to 5 
days.
 
While the wind shear around Kiko is expected to be relatively low 
over the next several days, the surrounding moisture and SSTs along 
its forecast track are just marginally favorable for the storm. 
There are significant differences in the intensity model solutions 
that vary from Kiko remaining a tropical storm to becoming a major 
hurricane. Since Kiko appears to be developing an inner core, it 
seems likely that the storm should strengthen steadily over the next 
few days. The NHC intensity forecast is a little higher than the 
previous one and roughly near the middle of the guidance envelope.
 
Kiko is currently a compact system. Although it is forecast to get
larger, the model guidance suggests that it will likely be on the 
smaller side through the week.
