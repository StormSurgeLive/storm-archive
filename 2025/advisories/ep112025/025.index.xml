THE CENTRAL PACIFIC BASIN...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM HST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.1N 139.7W
ABOUT 1065 MI...1710 KM ESE OF HILO HAWAII
ABOUT 1265 MI...2040 KM ESE OF HONOLULU HAWAII
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...140 MPH...220 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 285 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...946 MB...27.94 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the Hawaiian Islands should monitor the progress of
Kiko.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM HST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kiko was located
near latitude 15.1 North, longitude 139.7 West. Kiko is moving
toward the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h) and this motion is
expected to continue over the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 140 mph (220 km/h) with higher
gusts. Kiko is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Only minor fluctuations in strength are 
anticipated through Saturday, with gradual weakening expected to 
begin by Sunday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 946 mb (27.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Kiko can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Hurricane Kiko are expected to begin
reaching the Big Island and Maui by Sunday. These swells will
gradually build and are forecast to peak along east facing exposures
of the Hawaiian Islands late Monday through midweek, potentially
producing life-threatening surf and rip currents. Listen for later
advisories and possible warnings from the National Weather Service
in Honolulu, Hawaii.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Future information on Kiko can be found under Central Pacific 
basin headers beginning at 500 AM HST, under AWIPS header HFOTCPCP4 
and WMO header WTPA34 PHFO.  Products will continue to be available 
on the web at hurricanes.gov

      <title>Hurricane Kiko Forecast Discussion Number 24</title>

Hurricane Kiko Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112025
500 PM HST Fri Sep 05 2025
 
Kiko has continued to intensify this afternoon and remains a 
category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. The 
eye is now surrounded by a large ring of very cold cloud tops, and 
the cyclone has taken on a structure more typical of annular 
hurricanes. A GMI microwave pass from 2224 UTC confirmed a symmetric 
inner-core with a complete ring of deep convection around the eye. 
The latest objective estimates from UW-CIMSS are as high as 122 kt. 
Subjective Dvorak classifications from SAB and TAFB are both 
T6.0/115 kt. Blending the higher objective estimates with the 
slightly lower subjective classifications yields an initial 
intensity of 120 kt.

Kiko is moving west-northwestward, or 290 degrees at 10 kt. The 
cyclone remains steered along the southwestern flank of a 
subtropical ridge, while an upper-level low north of Hawaii is 
helping to erode the western periphery of the ridge. This general 
motion with some increase in forward speed should persist through 
the weekend, with Kiko expected to cross into the central Pacific 
basin late tonight or early Saturday. The official forecast track is 
near the HCCA consensus and essentially unchanged from the previous 
advisory. However, a track slightly to the left of the official 
forecast would bring Kiko closer to the Big Island. Historically, 
cyclones approaching the Big Island from the east can slow and 
deflect northward as the island terrain disrupts the low-level flow 
and alters the steering currents. 

Kiko should remain a powerful hurricane for the next 12–24 hours 
while traversing 26–27 C waters with light north-northeasterly 
shear. Its annular structure may allow it to resist weakening longer 
than typical guidance, despite the surrounding dry environment in 
the mid- to upper levels. Beyond 48 hours, a combination of cooler 
waters, dry mid-level air, and strengthening west-southwesterly 
shear exceeding 30 kt will likely induce rapid weakening. The 
official intensity forecast holds Kiko above most of the available 
guidance into the weekend, then trends more toward the consensus 
aids later in the weekend and early next week.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Kiko is forecast to approach the Hawaiian Islands during the 
early to the middle portion of next week. Impacts from rain and wind 
remain a possibility, but it is too soon to determine the exact 
location or magnitude of these impacts, and interests there should 
continue to monitor the progress of this storm.

2. Swells generated by Kiko are expected to begin reaching the Big 
Island and Maui by Sunday. These swells will gradually build and are 
forecast to peak along east facing exposures of the Hawaiian Islands 
late Monday through midweek, potentially producing life-threatening 
surf and rip currents. Listen for later advisories and possible 
warnings from the National Weather Service.
