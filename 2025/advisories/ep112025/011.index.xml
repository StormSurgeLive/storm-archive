      <title>Hurricane Kiko Forecast Discussion Number 10</title>

Hurricane Kiko Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112025
500 AM HST Tue Sep 02 2025
 
Over the past 6 hours, Kiko's eye has become apparent on nighttime 
visible imagery, and at times it has also showed up in the infrared 
imagery.  The small hurricane is clearly intensifying.  The latest 
subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB range from 77-90 kt, 
while the UW-CIMSS objective estimates have been running in the 
60-74 kt range.  The initial intensity estimate of 75 kt represents 
an average of these estimates.

Kiko continues moving slowly westward, or 270 degrees at 5 kt. The 
main steering feature continues to be the subtropical ridge located 
to the north of Kiko.  A slow westward motion should continue for 
the next couple of days.  A turn toward the west-northwest is 
forecast by days 3 and 4 as an upper-level trough north of Hawaii 
begins to erode the western portion of the subtropical ridge.  There 
remains above normal along-track spread in the model suite, but not 
as much spread as yesterday, and the day 5 positions of the GFS and 
ECMWF are in fairly good agreement.  The official day 5 position is 
relatively close to an average of those models.  Only minor 
adjustments have been made to the official forecast, which lies 
close to the TVCE consensus.

Through the next 48 h, Kiko should remain over sea-surface 
temperatures of 27-28C, with light to moderate easterly wind shear 
of 10-15 kt.  The environmental air is a bit dry and stable, and 
this might prevent rapid intensification.  However, steady 
strengthening still appears likely over the next day or two.  By day 
4, Kiko will reach somewhat cooler water temperatures as it moves 
into a drier environment.  The new NHC forecast shows a slightly 
higher peak intensity of 100 kt, and is near the high end of the 
intensity guidance suite through day 3.  Some weakening is likely in 
4-5 days when Kiko reaches the cooler water and drier air, but the 
official forecast still maintains Kiko at hurricane strength through 
day 5.

Tropical Storm Lorena Advisory Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122025
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
800 AM MST Tue Sep 02 2025
 
...TROPICAL DEPRESSION TWELVE-E BECOMES TROPICAL STORM LORENA...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM MST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.3N 107.9W
ABOUT 240 MI...385 KM W OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
ABOUT 345 MI...550 KM SSE OF CABO SAN LUCAS MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1004 MB...29.65 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur should
monitor the progress of this system.  A Tropical Storm Watch could
be required for portions of Baja California Sur later today or on
Wednesday.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lorena was
located near latitude 18.3 North, longitude 107.9 West. Lorena is
moving toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this motion is
expected to continue for the next few days before slowing and 
turning north then northeastward toward the latter portion of this 
week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast during 
the next 48 hours and Lorena could reach hurricane strength by 
Wednesday. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Areas of heavy rainfall well east and northeast of 
Tropical Storm Lorena will continue to impact portions of 
northwestern Mexico from the states of Colima to Sinaloa today, 
with isolated flash flooding possible in areas of mountainous 
terrain.
 
Bands of heavy rainfall are expected to begin impacting Baja
California Sur by Wednesday and potentially persist through
Friday, with rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches, with maximum 
amounts of 12 inches possible across portions of Baja California 
Sur and southwestern Sonora through Friday. Uncertainty remains 
with these totals, and locally higher or lower amounts are possible 
depending on the track and strength of the system. Potentially 
significant flash flooding is a possibility.

 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

Tropical Storm Lorena Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122025
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
800 AM MST Tue Sep 02 2025

GOES-East imagery depicts a steadily improving convective structure, 
where earlier the presentation was more elongated, but more recently 
is taking on a banded structure with bursting overshooting tops near 
the center, suggesting better overall organization of the small 
core. Recent Dvorak satellite estimates from TAFB/SAB are at 2.5 
and 3.5, respectively, indicative of the intensification.  As such, 
initial intensity is set at 40 kt, slightly favoring the TAFB 
estimate though satellite trends continue to improve. Thus, Tropical 
Depression Twelve-E has been upgraded to Tropical Storm Lorena.   

The cyclone is now moving northwestward at 12 kt along the 
southwestern periphery of a mid-level ridge.  The ridge should steer 
the storm generally northwestward for the next couple of days.  
However, the strength and therefore, depth of the cyclone will have 
a sizable impact on its expected track and potential recurvature 
towards Baja California.  Model solutions that are stronger bring 
the cyclone northward and eastward relative to the overall guidance 
suite closer to Baja California earlier. Thus interests along Baja 
California Sur should monitor updates to the track closely. Given 
overall trends, a slightly faster, northward adjustment to the track 
was made.  The latest track forecast shows landfall in central Baja 
at 96 hours, but there remains significant spread in the track 
guidance, with the latest GFS forecast faster and to the east, while 
the most recent ECMWF forecast is a significant leftward outlier, 
not ever reaching the Mexican coastline. Given the spread, stay 
tuned to updates in subsequent forecast packages.  

Very warm waters and ample deep layer moisture will allow for a 
steady intensification over the next few days, with increasing 
potential for Lorena to reach hurricane status in the next next 24 
to 48 hours. Lorena is expected to cross the 26 degree C isotherm in 
2-3 days. That factor, in combination with increasing southwesterly 
vertical shear should result in weakening after that time until  
landfall across the Baja California Peninsula. The latest NHC 
intensity forecast is higher than the previous cycle, but remains a 
little under the HCCA consensus aid. 

Interests in southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur should
monitor the progress of this system.   A Tropical Storm Watch could
be required for portions of Baja California later today or
Wednesday.

Key Messages:

1.  Heavy rainfall associated with Tropical Storm Lorena will begin 
to affect Baja California Sur on Wednesday, and southwestern Sonora 
by Thursday. This will increase the risk of life-threatening flash 
floods and mudslides, especially in areas of higher terrain. 

2. Lorena is forecast to approach the Baja California peninsula 
later this week.  Although it is too soon to specify the exact 
location and magnitude of wind impacts,  residents should closely 
monitor the latest forecast updates and ensure that they have their 
preparedness plan in place. Watches could be required for a portion 
of the Baja California peninsula later today or on Wednesday.
