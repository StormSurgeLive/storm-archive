SURF: Swells generated by Kiko are expected to gradually build and
are forecast to peak along east-facing exposures of the Hawaiian
Islands late Monday through midweek, potentially producing
life-threatening surf and rip currents. Listen for later advisories
and possible warnings from the National Weather Service in Honolulu,
Hawaii.
