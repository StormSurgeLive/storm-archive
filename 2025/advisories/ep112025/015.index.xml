      <title>Hurricane Kiko Forecast Discussion Number 15</title>

Hurricane Kiko Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112025
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
1100 AM HST Wed Sep 03 2025

Kiko has strengthened to a category 4 hurricane with recent 
subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates of 5.5 and 6.0 from 
TAFB and SAB respectively.  The structure has continued to improve 
on satellite imagery with the most recent ADT estimate up to 117 
knots, and a raw data T number even higher of 6.4.  The initial 
intensity was thus set at the higher end of the subjective Dvorak 
estimates at 115 knots.
 
Kiko is moving due west, or 270 degrees, at 8 knots.  The forecast 
track reasoning has changed little for this advisory.  A general 
westward motion is expected to continue during the next couple of 
days, as the cyclone is steered by a building subtropical ridge to 
its north and northwest.  A turn toward the west-northwest is 
forecast by day 3 as an upper-level trough north of Hawaii erodes 
the western portion of the subtropical ridge, with this general 
motion then continuing through day 5.  The track guidance this cycle 
remained in good agreement through day 3.  After that time, the 
along- and cross-track spread does increase but is still in fairly 
good agreement through day 5.  The official track forecast remains 
close to the multi-model consensus aids, near the middle of the 
model envelope of solutions.
 
Kiko will remain over warm water and light vertical wind shear for 
at least the next 3 days.  Kiko's intensity will therefore likely be 
governed by inner-core structural changes.  Kiko is currently in the 
middle of a period of rapid intensification which is expected to 
last for at least another 12 hours. Thereafter, it's possible Kiko 
may undergo an eyewall replacement, though the environment could 
also allow the hurricane to develop annular characteristics. Thus, 
the intensity forecast is on the higher end of the guidance suite, 
not that far off the reliable HCCA consensus aid over the first 72 
hours. After that time, cooler SSTs and an increase in southwesterly 
vertical wind shear should lead to a faster rate of weakening.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lorena was located
near latitude 22.8 North, longitude 112.4 West. Lorena is moving
toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this motion with a 
decrease in forward speed is expected through early Thursday.
A generally slow northward motion is expected late Thursday and 
Thursday night, with a gradual turn toward the northeast on Friday. 
On the forecast track, the center of Lorena is expected to move 
parallel to the west coast of the Baja California peninsula through 
tonight, approach the coast of Baja California Sur Thursday night, 
and move inland over the Baja California peninsula on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast through this evening.  
Fast weakening is expected to begin on Thursday, and Lorena is 
expected to weaken back to a tropical storm by Friday morning.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 985 mb (29.09 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lorena can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Bands of heavy rainfall will continue to impact Baja 
California Sur and move into southwestern Sonora by Thursday, with 
this rainfall potentially persisting through Friday.  Rainfall 
totals of 5 to 10 inches, with maximum amounts of 15 inches, are 
possible across portions of Baja California Sur and southwestern 
Sonora through Friday. This will bring the risk of life-threatening 
flash floods and mudslides, especially in areas of higher terrain.

Farther northeast, 1 to 3 inches of rain, with localized totals up 
to 5 inches, are expected from portions of the Mexico states of 
Sinaloa north and northeast into portions of Arizona and southern 
New Mexico through Saturday afternoon, bringing the potential for 
isolated to scattered flash flooding.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Hurricane Lorena, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area
beginning tonight and will spread northward within the warning 
area in Baja California Sur through Thursday and into Friday. 
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area south 
of Santa Fe through tonight, and in the watch area on the east coast 
of the Baja California peninsula Friday into Friday night.
 
STORM SURGE: Coastal flooding from storm surge is likely along the
coast of Baja California Sur near and to the right of where Lorena
makes landfall.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lorena will continue affecting portions
of the south and west coasts of Baja California Sur through Friday.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.

Hurricane Lorena Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122025
200 PM MST Wed Sep 03 2025
 
The Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft that investigated 
Lorena made two passes through the center, measuring maximum 700-mb 
flight-level winds of 79 kt in the NE quadrant and a center 
dropsonde pressure of 985 mb with 7 kt of wind.  The intensity is 
held at 70 kt based on the reconnaissance data. The data also 
confirmed that Lorena is rather small in size, with the aircraft 
data indicating a similar extent of the wind field as to what was 
previous estimated. 

Lorena could still intensify for another 6-12 hours while it remains 
over warm water and in low wind shear conditions.  By 18 hours, the 
hurricane is expected to cross the 26C sea-surface temperature 
isotherm while southwesterly wind shear also begins to significantly 
increase. These conditions are expected to lead to rapid weakening 
beginning by Thursday afternoon.  Only minor adjustments were made 
to the official intensity forecast.  The official forecast is at the 
high end of the intensity guidance through 24 hours, and then lies 
closer to the middle of the guidance envelope thereafter. 

The track guidance hasn't changed too much, but the TVCE, GFEX, and 
other consensus models are a bit faster with the northeastward 
motion beyond 36 h, and the NHC track was sped up a bit after that 
time.  Otherwise, only minor changes were made to the NHC track 
forecast.  It should be noted that several models indicate a farther 
left track, with dissipation over water without making landfall.  
This scenario is possible if the hurricane rapidly weakens by 
Thursday night and starts to decouple due to the aforementioned 
increasing southwesterly shear.  Regardless of which track scenario 
pans out, there is very high confidence that heavy rainfall amounts 
leading to significant flooding will occur in Baja California Sur, 
especially since the southwesterly upper-level winds favor deep 
convection to the right side of Lorena.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall associated with Lorena will continue to impact 
Baja California Sur, moving into southwestern Sonora by Thursday. 
These rains are likely to cause life-threatening flash floods and 
mudslides. 

2. Moisture from Lorena is likely to contribute to heavy rainfall 
concerns across Arizona and southern New Mexico through Saturday. 
Isolated to scattered instances of flash flooding are possible 
across Arizona into Saturday afternoon.
 
3. The center of Lorena is forecast to move parallel to, but 
offshore of, the southwest coast of the Baja California Peninsula 
through tonight, and then move closer to the west-central coast of 
the peninsula on Thursday.  Regardless of the exact track, tropical 
storm conditions are likely along portions of the coast of Baja 
California Sur where a Tropical Storm Warning is in effect. Tropical 
storm conditions are also possible beginning Friday along the east 
coast of the Baja California peninsula, where a Tropical Storm Watch 
is in effect.  
 
4. Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions will affect
portions of the southern and western coasts of Baja California Sur
during the next couple of days.
