Hurricane Kiko Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112025
1100 PM HST Wed Sep 03 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Kiko has degraded some since the 
previous advisory, with the eye now mostly obscured by a central 
dense overcast with cloud top temperatures of -70 to -80C.  Given 
the favorable environment that the cyclone is traversing, it is 
likely that Kiko is undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle at the 
moment.  The most recent subjective Dvorak current intensity 
estimates from TAFB and SAB were 6.0/115 kt and 6.5/127 kt 
respectively, while the objective estimates from UW-CIMSS have 
ranged between 111 and 132 kt during the past several hours.  Based 
on a blend of these data, the initial intensity has been held at 125 
kt for this advisory, and Kiko remains a very powerful category 4 
hurricane.

Kiko is moving just south of due west, or 265 degrees, at 7 kt.  
This general westward motion is expected to continue through 
Thursday, as the cyclone is steered by a building subtropical ridge 
to its north and northwest.  A turn toward the west-northwest is 
forecast by Friday as an upper-level trough north of Hawaii begins 
to erode the western portion of the subtropical ridge, with this 
general motion then continuing over the weekend and into early next 
week, along with a gradual increase in forward speed.  There remains 
some along-track and cross track spread among the global models, 
although the spread has decreased considerably during the past 24 
hours.  A very slight northward adjustment has been made to the 
official track forecast, which remains in good agreement with a 
blend of the latest multi-model consensus aids. 

Kiko will remain over warm waters of 27–28C and influenced by mostly 
light vertical wind shear through around 60 hours.  The surrounding 
environmental mid-level moisture will remain drier than optimal, 
hovering between 50 and 60 percent during the next couple of days, 
before dropping below 50 percent by 60 hours.  Despite the somewhat 
dry mid-level airmass, the light vertical wind shear and warm sea 
surface temperatures should maintain Kiko as a major hurricane 
through day 3.  There will likely be some fluctuations in strength 
during the next several days with the potential for eyewall 
replacement cycles during this time.  By days 4 and 5, the cyclone 
will begin moving over cooler water with gradually increasing 
westerly vertical wind shear, and mid-level moisture plummeting 
below 40 percent.  These factors should lead to steady and 
eventually rapid weakening of Kiko as the cyclone approaches the 
Hawaiian Islands from the east-southeast.  Kiko will be influenced 
by environmental factors that can lead to the development of annular 
characteristics during the next few days along its approach, which 
can slow the rate of weakening.  As a result, the official intensity 
forecast remains on the higher end or slightly above the intensity 
aids through day 5, and is very similar to the previous advisory.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lorena was located 
near latitude 24.0 North, longitude 113.7 West. Lorena is moving 
toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this motion is 
expected to continue through this morning. A slow northward or 
north-northeastward motion is expected to begin this afternoon and 
continue into the weekend.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Lorena is expected to move parallel to the west coast of the Baja 
California peninsula today and approach the coast of Baja California 
Sur tonight through Friday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Lorena is expected to quickly weaken for the 
next couple of days, and it is forecast to weaken to a tropical 
storm later today.  Lorena is likely to degenerate into a remnant 
low near or over the Baja California peninsula by early Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles
(110 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 986 mb (29.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lorena can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Bands of heavy rainfall will continue to impact Baja
California Sur and Sonora Mexico through Friday. Additional rainfall
totals of 4 to 8 inches, with maximum storm total amounts of 15
inches, are possible across portions of Baja California Sur, far
southeast Baja California and southwestern Sonora into Friday. This
will bring the risk of life-threatening flash floods and mudslides,
especially in areas of higher terrain.
 
Elsewhere across Mexico, 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated totals
up to 6 inches, are expected across the remainder of Sonora and
northern Sinaloa. These amounts will lead to isolated to scattered
instances of flash flooding.
 
Across the southwestern United States, 1 to 3 inches of rain, with
isolated totals up to 5 inches, are expected across portions of
Arizona and New Mexico through Saturday, bringing the potential for
isolated to scattered flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Lorena, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will spread northward within the
warning area in Baja California Sur today through Friday. Tropical
storm conditions are possible within the watch area on the east
coast of the Baja California peninsula late Friday into Friday
night.
 
STORM SURGE:  Coastal flooding from storm surge is likely along the
coast of Baja California Sur near and to the right of where Lorena
makes landfall.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lorena will continue affecting portions
of the south and west coasts of Baja California Sur through Friday.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Lorena Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122025
200 AM MST Thu Sep 04 2025

Lorena has become less organized since the last advisory due to the 
impacts of increasing vertical shear and decreasing sea surface 
temperatures underneath the hurricane.  Earlier microwave 
imagery indicated that the eyewall had broken open, and current 
conventional imagery shows that the low-level center is now 
located near the southwestern edge of the convective mass. The 
various satellite intensity estimates are now trending down, and 
based on this the initial intensity is reduced to a possibly 
generous 70 kt.

The initial motion is now a slower 320/7 kt.  Lorena is expected to 
turn northward with a further decrease in forward speed later today 
as the cyclone moves farther into a break in the subtropical ridge. 
After that, the guidance is now considerably slower in moving Lorena 
to the north-northeast with the 00Z GFS now taking 60 h to reach 
Baja California Sur.  The NHC forecast track is again slowed down 
significantly and blends the previous forecast with the new 
consensus models and the 00Z GFS. It should be noted that in 
contrast to the right turn of the GFS and the regional hurricane 
models, the ECMWF and Canadian models continue to show a left turn 
as Lorena approaches the coast that would keep the center offshore 
until the cyclone dissipates.

Lorena should rapidly weaken in the increasingly unfavorable 
environment, with the cyclone now forecast to weaken to a tropical 
storm in 12 h or less.  After that, the simulated satellite imagery 
from the 00Z GFS and ECMWF shows the cyclone should stop producing 
organized convection no later than 48 h, and this could happen 
earlier. The new intensity forecast now shows the system decaying to 
a remnant low by 48 h. Whether the system crosses Baja or stays 
over the cold Pacific waters, it is expected to dissipate completely 
by 96 h.

Although Lorena is forecast to rapidly weaken, abundant moisture 
will continue to stream northeastward away from the cyclone.  
Because of that, there is still a significant risk of heavy 
rainfall and flash flooding across portions of Baja California Sur, 
Sonora, and southern Arizona and New Mexico.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall associated with Lorena will continue to impact 
Baja California Sur and Sonora Mexico through Friday. This will 
increase the risk of life-threatening flash floods and mudslides 
across northwest Mexico.
 
2. Moisture from Lorena will contribute to heavy rainfall concerns 
across Arizona and New Mexico through Saturday. Isolated to 
scattered instances of flash flooding are possible across Arizona 
into Saturday.
 
3. The center of Lorena is forecast to move parallel to, but 
offshore of, the southwest coast of the Baja California Peninsula 
today, and then move closer to the west-central coast of the 
peninsula tonight and Friday.  Regardless of the exact track, 
tropical storm conditions are likely along portions of the coast of 
Baja California Sur where a Tropical Storm Warning is in effect. 
Tropical storm conditions are also possible late Friday along the 
east coast of the Baja California peninsula, where a Tropical Storm 
Watch is in effect.
 
4. Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions will affect
portions of the southern and western coasts of Baja California Sur
during the next couple of days.
