      <title>Tropical Storm Kiko Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Kiko Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112025
500 AM HST Mon Sep 01 2025
 
Kiko has intensified overnight and remains a compact storm. A timely 
GMI microwave pass revealed a closed cyan ring around the center in 
the 37-GHz image. The system’s compact size and improving core 
structure suggest that the inner core is consolidating, which often 
precedes rapid intensification. Subjective Dvorak intensity 
estimates from TAFB are 3.0/45 kt and from SAB are 4.0/64 kt, while 
objective estimates have increased into the 40–50 kt range. Given 
this range of data and the improving satellite presentation, the 
initial intensity is set at 50 kt for this advisory.

Kiko is moving just south of due west, or 265/7 kt, steered by a 
mid-level subtropical ridge to the north. This general motion is 
expected to continue for the next 36 hours, followed by a more 
westward track through about 72 hours. Thereafter, the cyclone 
should gradually begin to turn toward the west-northwest as it 
crosses into the central Pacific basin between days 4 and 5 due to a 
potential weakness in the subtropical ridge far north of the 
Hawaiian Islands. While the overall synoptic pattern is consistent, 
there remains considerable spread in along-track speed among the 
models. The NHC forecast is nearly identical to the previous one and 
continues to lean heavily on a blend of the HCCA and EMXI aids, 
which are near the faster side of the guidance envelope.

Despite somewhat drier mid-level conditions along its forecast 
track, the combination of light vertical wind shear, warm sea 
surface temperatures, and Kiko’s small compact core should allow for 
strengthening in the short term. Rapid intensification probabilities 
from the SHIPS guidance have increased over the past 24 hours, with 
around a 30–40 percent chance of a 30-kt increase in the next 24 
hours. As a result, the official forecast reflects the potential for 
this during the first 24 hours, placing the intensity near the upper 
end of the guidance envelope during that period. Kiko’s intensity is 
forecast to peak near 85 kt in about 48 hours and then hold steady 
through day 5, which is near the middle to upper end of the guidance 
envelope.
