      <![CDATA[049 <br />ABPZ20 KNHC 011736<br />TWOEP <br /><br />Tropical Weather Outlook<br />NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br />1100 AM PDT Mon Sep 1 2025<br /><br />For the eastern and central North Pacific east of 180 longitude:<br /><br />Active Systems: <br />The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br />Storm Kiko, located in the east Pacific basin well west-southwest <br />of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.  Kiko is <br />expected to cross into the central Pacific basin by the weekend.<br /><br />South of Southwestern Mexico (EP94):<br />Showers and thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave located <br />less than 150 miles off the coast of southwestern Mexico are <br />starting to become better organized, and recent satellite-derived <br />wind data indicate that winds to 35 mph are present in the <br />disturbance close to the coast of Mexico.  This system is expected <br />to become a tropical depression by the middle of the week.  This <br />system is expected to move west-northwestward to northwestward at  <br />10 to 15 mph off the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next <br />couple of days, then could turn northward and approach the Baja <br />California peninsula later this week.  Interests in the Baja <br />California peninsula should monitor the progress of the <br />disturbance, as watches or warnings could be required for portions <br />of this area on Tuesday.  Regardless of development, heavy rainfall <br />is possible across coastal portions of southwestern and <br />west-central Mexico today through mid-week.  Heavy rainfall is also <br />expected across Baja California Sur and northwestern Mexico Tuesday <br />night through late this week.  This heavy rainfall could lead to <br />flash flooding, especially in mountainous areas.<br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br />* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br /><br />$$<br />Forecaster Hagen]]>

      <title>Tropical Storm Kiko Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>
      <description>Issued at 1100 AM HST Mon Sep 01 2025 <![CDATA[<pre>000

Tropical Storm Kiko Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112025
1100 AM HST Mon Sep 01 2025
 
Kiko continues to gradually become better organized on conventional 
satellite imagery with increasingly impressive curved banding noted 
in 1-minute GOES-18 imagery.  The latest subjective Dvorak estimates 
range from 55-65 kt while objective intensity estimates from 
UW-CIMSS continue to be in the 45-50 kt range.  Based on a blend of 
the data and improving appearance on satellite imagery over the last 
few hours, the initial intensity is increased to 55 kt for this 
advisory.  

Kiko has been moving toward the west-southwest at a slightly slower 
speed, with an estimated motion of 255/6 kt.  A strengthening 
subtropical ridge to Kiko's north should cause this general motion 
to continue for the next day or so.  After that time, Kiko should 
turn back toward the west due to its position due south of the 
strongest part of the ridge.  By the end of the forecast period, a 
west-northwestward motion is likely as Kiko starts to reach the 
southwestern portion of the ridge's influence.  There is very large 
along-track spread in the guidance, meaning that there is high 
uncertainty in Kiko's forward speed.  The latest guidance has 
trended slower.  The NHC forecast is slower and a bit to the north 
of the previous forecast, but not as slow as most of the latest 
consensus models.  This latest track forecast is fairly close to the 
12Z ECMWF model.

Relatively warm ocean temperatures and light wind shear should allow 
Kiko to steadily strengthen over the next couple of days.  If Kiko 
were to move south of the NHC forecast track, it could encounter 
stronger shear in 1-2 days, as the models show stronger upper level 
winds south of about 13N latitude.  The other factor that 
complicates the intensity forecast is the possibility that some dry 
air tries to entrain into the circulation.  The peak forecast 
intensity has been increased a bit to show a peak of 95 kt in 60-72 
hours.  This is closer to the latest HCCA and high resolution 
hurricane models, some of which bring Kiko to major hurricane 
intensity.  Late in the forecast period, some slight weakening is 
possible due to slightly cooler ocean temperatures and the potential 
for slightly drier and more stable air.  The intensity forecast lies 
near the upper end of the guidance envelope.
