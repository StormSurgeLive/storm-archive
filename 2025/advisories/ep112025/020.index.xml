Hurricane Kiko Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112025
500 PM HST Thu Sep 04 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Kiko has degraded considerably since 
the previous advisory, with the once warm and nearly cloud free eye, 
now obscured by a central dense overcast with cloud top temperatures 
of -65 to -80C.  Given the mostly favorable environment that the 
cyclone is traversing, it is likely that Kiko is once again 
undergoing an eyewall replacement.  The most recent subjective 
Dvorak current intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were 6.0/115 kt 
and 5.5/102 kt respectively, while the objective estimates from 
UW-CIMSS have ranged between 101 and 117 kt during the past several 
hours.  Based on a blend of these data and accounting for the 
degradation in satellite appearance, the initial intensity has been 
lowered to 110 kt for this advisory, and Kiko is now a category 3 
hurricane.

Kiko is moving just north of due west, or 275 degrees, at 8 kt.  A 
gradual turn toward the west-northwest is expected tonight and 
Friday, as the western extent of a subtropical ridge to the north of 
the cyclone is eroded by developing upper-level low north of Hawaii. 
This general motion along with a gradual increase in forward speed 
is forecast to continue over the weekend and through early next 
week, as Kiko moves along the southwest periphery of the subtropical 
ridge to the northeast and toward a westward moving upper-level low 
to the north and northwest of the Hawaiian Islands.  The latest 
track forecast is very close to the previous forecast through 60 
hours, and slightly to the north of the previous forecast for days 3 
through 5, following the latest guidance trends.  The track forecast 
is closest to the TVCE consensus aid, and is to the south of the 
HCCA and FSSE consensus aids.  

Kiko will remain over warm waters of 27–28C for the next 24 hours, 
while influenced by light northeasterly vertical wind shear and in a 
somewhat drier than optimal mid-level environment.  Despite the dry 
mid-level airmass, the mostly favorable environment could lead to 
some slight intensification tonight and Friday, provided that the 
eyewall replacement cycle which is likely ongoing, completes.  
Beyond 24 hours through day 3, Kiko will move over slightly cooler 
waters of 26 to 27C and into a drier mid-level environment with 
humidity levels below 50 percent.  Despite very light vertical wind 
shear, these less favorable conditions should lead to gradual 
weakening of the cyclone.  By days 4 and 5, Kiko will be moving over 
cooler water near or slightly below 26C, with west-southwesterly 
vertical wind shear ramping up to more than 30 kt by day 5, while 
mid-level moisture also plummets below 40 percent.  The increasingly 
hostile environment should lead to rapid weakening of Kiko as the 
cyclone approaches the Hawaiian Islands from the east-southeast.  
The official intensity forecast has been lowered slightly from the 
previous advisory cycle, but remains on the higher end or slightly 
above the intensity aids through day 3 due to the continued 
potential for Kiko to develop annular characteristics.  The 
intensity forecast then trends closer to the intensity consensus aid 
HCCA by days 4 and 5, with Kiko forecast to be a tropical storm by 
day 5 as it nears the eastern end of the Hawaiian Island chain.   
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Kiko is forecast to approach the Hawaiian Islands during the
early to the middle portion of next week. The risk of direct impacts
from wind and rainfall is increasing.  However, it is too soon to
determine the exact location or magnitude of these impacts, and
interests there should continue to monitor the progress of this
storm.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Baja California Sur and Sonora, Mexico, should
continue to monitor the risk of heavy rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Lorena.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM PDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lorena was
located near latitude 24.6 North, longitude 115.1 West.  Lorena is
moving toward the northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h).  A slow 
north-northwestward to northwestward motion is expected through 
early Saturday, followed by a turn toward the west-northwest over 
the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast, and Lorena is 
expected to become a remnant low by Friday morning.  The remnant 
low is likely to dissipate by late Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
to the northwest of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lorena can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Bands of heavy rainfall will continue to impact Baja
California Sur and Sonora Mexico through Friday. Additional rainfall
totals of 4 to 8 inches, with maximum storm total amounts of 15
inches, are possible across portions of Baja California Sur, far
southeast Baja California and southwestern Sonora into Friday. This
will bring the risk of life-threatening flash floods and mudslides,
especially in areas of higher terrain.
 
Elsewhere across Mexico, 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated totals
up to 6 inches, are expected across the remainder of Sonora and
northern Sinaloa. These amounts will lead to isolated to scattered
instances of flash flooding.
 
Across the southwestern United States, 1 to 2 inches of rain, with
isolated totals up to 4 inches, are expected across portions of
Arizona and New Mexico through Saturday, bringing the potential for
isolated to scattered flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Lorena, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lorena will continue affecting portions
of the west coast of Baja California Sur through Friday.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Lorena Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122025
800 PM PDT Thu Sep 04 2025
 
Lorena has not produced deep convection near its center since about 
8 AM this morning.  Waves of heavy showers and thunderstorms 
continue to stream northeastward across Baja California Sur, Sonora, 
and northern Sinaloa, but this activity cannot be directly linked 
to Lorena's circulation.  Weakening is assumed to have occurred 
since the earlier aircraft and ASCAT data, and the intensity is set 
at 40 kt based on a blend of Dvorak CI numbers and objective 
numbers (which are between 30 and 45 kt).  With Lorena over cool 
waters and southwesterly shear only expected to increase, deep 
convection is not forecast to redevelop, and Lorena is likely to 
become post-tropical Friday morning.  Winds will continue to 
steadily decrease, with the remnant low likely to dissipate by late 
Sunday.

Lorena has been moving west of the dynamical model guidance over 
the past 6 to 12 hours, and the best-performing track models since 
this morning have been the simple shallow Trajectory and Beta 
Advection (TABS) models.  Given that the circulation will remain 
shallow, the new NHC track forecast blends the TABS models with the 
latest GFS-ECWMF mean and HCCA consensus aid.  This puts the new 
forecast west of the previous prediction by a somewhat noticeable 
degree, showing more of a slow northwestward motion instead of 
northward trajectory.
 
Abundant moisture will continue to stream northeastward away from 
Lorena even though it is weakening.  Significant rainfall and flash 
flooding has already occurred over portions of Baja California Sur, 
and the risk of life-threatening flash flooding will continue across 
portions of Baja California Sur and Sonora through Friday, 
and southern Arizona and New Mexico through Saturday.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall associated with Lorena will continue to impact 
Baja California Sur and Sonora Mexico through Friday. This will 
increase the risk of life-threatening flash floods and mudslides 
across northwest Mexico.
 
2. Moisture from Lorena will contribute to heavy rainfall concerns 
across Arizona and New Mexico through Saturday. Isolated to 
scattered instances of flash flooding are possible across Arizona 
into Saturday.
 
3. Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions will affect
portions of the western coast of Baja California Sur through Friday.
