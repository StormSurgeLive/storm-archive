      <title>Hurricane Kiko Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Hurricane Kiko Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112025
1100 PM HST Mon Sep 01 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Kiko has improved since the previous 
advisory, with what appears to be a developing inner-core and hints 
of an eye evident at times in infrared satellite images.  The most 
recent subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates from TAFB and 
SAB were both 4.0/65 kt. The objective estimates from UW-CIMSS have 
ranged between 53 and 71 kt during the past several hours, and have 
been trending upwards.  Therefore, the initial intensity for this 
advisory has been raised to 65 kt, making Kiko a category 1 
hurricane.

Kiko is moving due west, or 270 degrees, at 6 kt.  This general 
motion is expected to continue during the next several days as the 
cyclone is steered by a building subtropical ridge to its north and 
northwest.  A turn toward the west-northwest is forecast by days 4 
and 5 as an upper-level trough north of Hawaii begins to erode the 
western portion of the subtropical ridge.  It should be noted that 
there remains considerable along-track spread among the global 
models, although the GFS and ECMWF day 5 positions have come into 
much better agreement since the previous model cycle.  The official 
track forecast remains in good agreement with the latest multi-model 
consensus aids and is very close to the previous advisory through 60 
hours, then slightly to the north of the previous track forecast 
from day 3 onward.

Kiko will remain over warm waters of 27–28C and influenced by mostly 
light vertical wind shear through day 4.  The surrounding 
environmental mid-level moisture appears to be a somewhat limiting 
factor for significant intensification, however, remaining between 
50 and 60 percent through day 3, then trending below 50 percent by 
days 4 and 5.  The latest intensity guidance has trended 
significantly higher from the previous model cycle, and the official 
forecast reflects this change and has been nudged upward 
accordingly.  The official intensity forecast remains on the higher 
end of the intensity guidance, and is most closely aligned with the 
FSSE intensity consensus aid.

BULLETIN
Tropical Depression Twelve-E Advisory Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122025
200 AM MST Tue Sep 02 2025
 
...TROPICAL DEPRESSION FORECAST TO STRENGTHEN LATER TODAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM MST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.6N 106.8W
ABOUT 190 MI...305 KM WSW OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1007 MB...29.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur should
monitor the progress of this system.  A Tropical Storm Watch could
be required for portions of Baja California Sur later today or on 
Wednesday.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Twelve-E
was located near latitude 17.6 North, longitude 106.8 West. The
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 
km/h), and a gradual turn toward the northwest and north-northwest
with a decrease in forward speed is expected over the next couple
of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast, and the system will likely become a
tropical storm later today.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Areas of heavy rainfall well east and northeast of the 
depression will continue to impact portions of northwestern Mexico 
from the states of Colima to Sinaloa today, with isolated flash 
flooding possible in areas of mountainous terrain.

Bands of heavy rainfall are expected to begin impacting Baja 
California Sur by Wednesday and potentially persist through 
Saturday, with rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches possible across 
portions of the area. Uncertainty remains with these totals, and 
locally higher or lower amounts are possible depending on the track 
and strength of the system. Potentially significant flash flooding 
is a possibility.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM MST.

Tropical Depression Twelve-E Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122025
200 AM MST Tue Sep 02 2025
 
The tropical depression has been relatively steady overnight.  
Periodic bursts of deep convection continue to form over the 
low-level center, with cold cloud tops of less than -80 degrees C. A 
scatterometer pass from 0335 UTC showed a small circulation with 
reliable winds of 30 kt.  The initial intensity is therefore held at 
30 kt, which is also supported by the latest TAFB T2.0 
classification.

The cyclone is still moving west-northwestward at 13 kt along the 
southwestern periphery of a mid-level ridge.  The ridge should soon 
begin to steer the depression generally northwestward for the next 
couple of days.  By the end of the week, the tropical cyclone is 
expected to slow down as it reaches a weakness in the ridge and 
gradually turn northward.  Over the weekend, the depression is 
forecast to turn north-northeastward to northeastward toward the 
Baja California peninsula.  The latest official forecast track 
is west of the previous forecast as a result of an adjustment to 
the initial position reflecting a delay in the northwestward 
turn, and lies between the simple and corrected consensus aids.  
 
Warm waters and a quiescent, moist atmosphere should allow the 
depression to steadily intensify during the next couple of days. 
The system is still expected to peak just under hurricane strength. 
By day 3, the cyclone is forecast to cross the 26 degree C isotherm 
and experience increasing vertical wind shear and decreasing 
mid-level humidities which should cause gradual weakening.  Little 
changes have been made to the latest intensity forecast.    
 
Interests in southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur should 
monitor the progress of this system.   A Tropical Storm Watch could 
be required for portions of Baja California later today or 
Wednesday.
