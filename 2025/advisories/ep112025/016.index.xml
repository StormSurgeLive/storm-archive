      <title>Hurricane Kiko Forecast Discussion Number 16</title>

Hurricane Kiko Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112025
500 PM HST Wed Sep 03 2025
 
Kiko remains a powerful category 4 hurricane, with satellite images 
showing a well-defined eye surrounded by a very cold ring of deep 
convection with cloud top temperatures of -70 to -85C.  The most 
recent subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates from TAFB and 
SAB were 6.0/115 kt and 6.5/127 kt respectively, while the objective 
estimates from UW-CIMSS have ranged between 119 and 132 kt during 
the past several hours.  Based on a blend of these data, the initial 
intensity has been raised to 125 kt for this advisory.

Kiko is moving just south of due west, or 265 degrees, at 8 kt.  
This general westward motion is expected to continue through 
Thursday night, as the cyclone is steered by a building subtropical 
ridge to its north and northwest.  A turn toward the west-northwest 
is forecast on Friday as an upper-level trough north of Hawaii 
begins to erode the western portion of the subtropical ridge, with 
this general motion then continuing through the weekend with a 
gradual increase in forward speed.  There remains some along-track  
and cross track spread among the global models, although the spread 
has decreased considerably during the past 24 hours.  The official 
track forecast remains in good agreement with a blend of the latest 
multi-model consensus aids and is nearly on top of, but slightly 
slower than, the previous forecast track.
 
Kiko will remain over warm waters of 27–28C and influenced by mostly 
light vertical wind shear through around 60 to 72 hours.  The 
surrounding environmental mid-level moisture will remain drier than 
optimal, hovering between 50 and 60 percent during the next couple 
of days, before dropping below 50 percent by day 3.  Despite the 
somewhat dry mid-level airmass, the light vertical wind shear and 
warm sea surface temperatures should maintain Kiko as a major 
hurricane through day 3.  There will likely be some fluctuations in 
strength during the next several days with the potential for eyewall 
replacement cycles during this time.  By days 4 and 5, the cyclone 
will begin moving over cooler water with gradually increasing 
westerly vertical wind shear, and mid-level moisture plummeting 
below 40 percent.  These factors should lead to steady and 
eventually rapid weakening of Kiko as the cyclone approaches the 
Hawaiian Islands from the east.  Kiko will be influenced by 
environmental factors that can lead to the development of annular 
characteristics along its approach, which can slow the rate of 
weakening.  As a result, the official intensity forecast remains on 
the higher end or slightly above the intensity aids through day 5, 
and is very close to the previous advisory.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM MST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lorena was located
near latitude 23.4 North, longitude 113.2 West.  Lorena is moving
toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this motion with a 
decrease in forward speed is expected through early Thursday.  A 
slow northward or north-northeastward motion is expected to begin 
on Thursday and continue into the weekend.  On the forecast track, 
the center of Lorena is expected to move parallel to the west coast 
of the Baja California peninsula through Thursday, approach the 
coast of Baja California Sur Thursday night, and move inland over 
the Baja California peninsula on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Lorena is expected to begin weakening quickly and become a 
tropical storm on Thursday.  Lorena is likely to degenerate into a 
remnant low near or over the Baja California peninsula by early 
Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 981 mb (28.97 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lorena can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Bands of heavy rainfall will continue to impact Baja 
California Sur and move into southwestern Sonora by Thursday, with 
this rainfall potentially persisting through Friday.  Additional 
rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches, with maximum storm total amounts 
of 15 inches, are possible across portions of Baja California Sur, 
far southeast Baja California and southwestern Sonora into Friday. 
This will bring the risk of life-threatening flash floods and 
mudslides, especially in areas of higher terrain.

Farther northeast, 1 to 3 inches of rain, with localized totals up 
to 5 inches, are expected from portions of the Mexican state of 
Sinaloa north and northeast into portions of southeast Arizona and 
southwest New Mexico through Saturday, bringing the potential for 
isolated to scattered flash flooding.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Hurricane Lorena, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area
beginning tonight and will spread northward within the warning
area in Baja California Sur through Thursday and into Friday.
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area south
of Santa Fe for the next few hours, and in the watch area on the 
east coast of the Baja California peninsula late Friday into Friday 
night.
 
STORM SURGE:  Coastal flooding from storm surge is likely along the
coast of Baja California Sur near and to the right of where Lorena
makes landfall.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lorena will continue affecting portions
of the south and west coasts of Baja California Sur through Friday.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1100 PM MST.
Next complete advisory at 200 AM MST.

Hurricane Lorena Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122025
800 PM MST Wed Sep 03 2025
 
Objective satellite intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS (ADT, 
AiDT, and SATCON) have increased by 5 to 10 kt since the Air Force 
Reserve reconnaissance mission into Lorena earlier this afternoon.  
Since the plane's data suggested an intensity of 70 kt at that 
time, the current intensity is estimated to be about 75 kt.  That 
said, Lorena is probably at its peak intensity.  There are already 
signs in conventional and microwave satellite imagery that vertical 
shear is beginning to strengthen, with a sharpening of the southern 
side of the upper-level cloud pattern and some tilt of the 
circulation with height.  The shear is forecast to gradually 
increase over the next couple of days, and Lorena will also be 
moving over waters colder than 26 degrees Celsius in about 6 to 12 
hours.  Therefore, quick weakening is shown in the official 
forecast.

Lorena continues to move toward the northwest, or 310 degrees, but 
at a slightly slower 10 kt.  As the cyclone moves farther into a 
break in the subtropical ridge, it is expected to turn northward 
and slow down further by Thursday evening, and then move only 
slowly north-northeastward into the weekend.  The 18z GFS run is 
finally playing the same tune as much of the other guidance, 
showing Lorena quickly decoupling as the shear removes its deep 
convection and leaving the low-level center drifting toward the 
west coast of Baja California Sur.  Now that there is 
near-unanimous agreement that Lorena is unlikely to move quickly 
as a deep system toward northwestern Mexico, the NHC track forecast 
has been slowed down significantly, blending the previous forecast 
with the most recent HCCA and TVCE consensus aids.  This new 
forecast brings Lorena's center to the west coast of Baja 
California Sur in about 48 hours as a weakening tropical cyclone, 
with the system reaching the east coast of the peninsula as a 
remnant low in about 60 hours.  However, based on the latest GFS- 
and ECMWF-based simulated satellite imagery, the transition to a 
remnant low could occur earlier than that.
 
Even if Lorena weakens and becomes a remnant low earlier than 
previously predicted, abundant moisture will continue to stream 
northeastward away from the cyclone.  Because of that, there is 
still a significant risk of heavy rainfall and flash flooding across 
portions of Baja California Sur, Sonora, and southern Arizona and 
New Mexico.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall associated with Lorena will continue to impact 
Baja California Sur and shift into southwestern Sonora Thursday. 
This will increase the risk of life-threatening flash floods and 
mudslides across northwest Mexico.
 
2. Moisture from Lorena will contribute to heavy rainfall concerns 
across Arizona and southwest New Mexico through Saturday. Isolated 
to scattered instances of flash flooding are possible across Arizona 
into Saturday.
 
3. The center of Lorena is forecast to move parallel to, but
offshore of, the southwest coast of the Baja California Peninsula
through Thursday, and then move closer to the west-central coast of
the peninsula Thursday night and Friday.  Regardless of the exact 
track, tropical storm conditions are likely along portions of the 
coast of Baja California Sur where a Tropical Storm Warning is in 
effect. Tropical storm conditions are also possible late Friday 
along the east coast of the Baja California peninsula, where a 
Tropical Storm Watch is in effect.
 
4. Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions will affect
portions of the southern and western coasts of Baja California Sur
during the next couple of days.
