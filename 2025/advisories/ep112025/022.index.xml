Hurricane Kiko Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112025
1100 PM HST Thu Sep 04 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Kiko has slowly deteriorated this 
evening, with the eye remaining mostly obscured by a central dense 
overcast with cloud top temperatures of -65 to -80C.  A timely 
05/0313Z WSFM microwave pass was helpful in locating the low-level 
center of Kiko, with the image also showing hints that an outer 
eyewall may be forming as part of an eyewall replacement cycle, 
which is possible considering the favorable environmental conditions 
the cyclone is traversing at the moment.  The most recent 
conventional satellite images seem to lend credence to this 
possibility of an eyewall replacement cycle, with an eye beginning 
to re-develop and a deep convective ring developing around it.  The 
most recent subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates from TAFB 
and SAB were 6.0/115 kt and 5.5/102 kt respectively, while the 
objective AiDT and ADT estimates from UW-CIMSS have ranged between 
98 and 115 kt through the evening.  Based on a blend of these data 
and accounting for recent satellite trends, the initial intensity 
has been held at 110 kt for this advisory, with Kiko remaining a 
strong category 3 hurricane.

Kiko is moving due west, or 270 degrees, at 8 kt.  A gradual turn 
toward the west-northwest is expected to begin later tonight or 
Friday, as the western extent of a subtropical ridge to the north of 
the cyclone is eroded by developing upper-level low north of Hawaii. 
This general west-northwestward motion along with a gradual increase 
in forward speed is forecast through the weekend and into early next 
week, as Kiko moves along the southwest periphery of the subtropical 
ridge to the northeast and toward a westward moving upper-level low 
to the north and northwest of the Hawaiian Islands.  The latest 
track forecast is slightly south of the previous forecast through 
day 3 due to a delay in Kiko’s west-northwest turn, then very 
similar to the previous track on days 4 and 5.  The track forecast 
is closest to the TVCE and EMXI aids and to the south of the HCCA 
and FSSE consensus.

Kiko will remain over warm waters of 27–28C for the next 24 hours, 
while influenced by light northeasterly vertical wind shear, 
although the cyclone will remain in a drier than optimal mid-level 
environment.  Despite the dry mid-level airmass Kiko will be moving 
through, the other factors appear favorable for some slight 
intensification, provided that the eyewall replacement cycle which 
is likely ongoing, completes.  From 24 hours to 60 hours, Kiko will 
move over slightly cooler waters of 26 to 27C and into a drier 
mid-level environment with humidity levels below 50 percent.  These 
less favorable conditions should lead to gradual weakening of the 
system, despite the continued very light vertical wind shear.  
Beginning on day 3 and continuing through day 5, the cyclone will be 
move over cooler water near or slightly below 26C, with 
west-southwesterly vertical wind shear ramping up steadily to more 
than 30 kt by day 5, and mid-level moisture will plummet below 40 
percent.  The increasingly hostile environment should lead to rapid 
weakening of Kiko as the cyclone approaches the Hawaiian Islands 
from the east-southeast.  The official intensity forecast has been 
lowered slightly from the previous advisory cycle, but remains on 
the higher end of the intensity aids through 60 hours, due to the 
continued potential for Kiko to develop annular characteristics.  
The intensity forecast then trends closer middle of the intensity 
consensus envelop by days 3 through 5, with Kiko forecast to be a 
tropical storm by day 5 as it moves very close to the eastern end of 
the Hawaiian Island chain.  
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Kiko is forecast to approach the Hawaiian Islands during the
early to the middle portion of next week. The risk of direct impacts
from wind and rainfall is increasing.  However, it is too soon to
determine the exact location or magnitude of these impacts, and
interests there should continue to monitor the progress of this
storm.

...MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE RISK OF LIFE-THREATENING FLASH FLOODING
CONTINUES FOR BAJA CALIFORNIA SUR AND SONORA THROUGH TODAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM PDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.5N 115.0W
ABOUT 170 MI...275 KM W OF CABO SAN LAZARO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...STATIONARY
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1002 MB...29.59 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Baja California Sur and Sonora, Mexico, should continue 
to monitor the risk of heavy rainfall and flash flooding associated 
with Lorena.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM PDT (0900 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Lorena
was located near latitude 24.5 North, longitude 115.0 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is currently nearly stationary.  A slow
north-northwestward to northwestward motion is expected through
early Saturday, followed by a turn toward the west-northwest over
the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast, and the 
remnant low is expected to dissipate by late Sunday or Sunday 
night.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lorena can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Bands of heavy rainfall will continue to impact Baja 
California Sur and Sonora Mexico through today. Additional rainfall 
totals of 4 to 8 inches, with maximum storm total amounts of 12 
inches, are possible across portions of Baja California Sur, far 
southeast Baja California, southwestern Sonora, and northern Sinaloa 
through tonight. This will bring the risk of life-threatening flash 
floods and mudslides, especially in areas of higher terrain.
 
Elsewhere across Mexico, 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated totals
up to 6 inches, are expected across the remainder of Sonora. These
amounts will lead to isolated to scattered instances of flash
flooding.
 
Across the southwestern United States, 1 to 2 inches of rain, with
isolated totals up to 4 inches, are expected across portions of
Arizona and New Mexico through Saturday, bringing the potential for
isolated to scattered flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Lorena, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lorena will continue affecting portions
of the west coast of Baja California Sur through today.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last advisory on Lorena by the National Hurricane 
Center. For additional information on the remnant low please see 
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under

Post-Tropical Cyclone Lorena Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122025
200 AM PDT Fri Sep 05 2025

Lorena has not produced organized convection near the center for the 
last 18 h, and since the center is located over sea surface 
temperatures between 24-25C there is little chance that convection 
will re-develop. While the latest scatterometer overpasses missed 
the center, satellite intensity estimates are quickly decreasing and 
are now in the 25-35 kt range.  Based on this, Lorena has 
degenerated to a remnant low with winds near 30 kt.  The system 
should continue to weaken over the cold water, with dissipation 
forecast by 72 h.

Lorena has moved little since the last advisory. Track model 
guidance indicates that the remnant low should drift northward for 
the next 12 h or so, followed by a slow motion toward the northwest 
and then west-northwest. The new forecast track is similar to, but a 
little south of, the previous track.

While Lorena is now a remnant low, the heavy rainfall threat 
continues. Abundant moisture continues to stream northeastward away 
from Lorena, and a surface trough seen in scatterometer data over 
the Gulf of California between Loreto and Guymas is triggering a 
large area of convection at this time. Significant rainfall and 
flash flooding has already occurred over portions of Baja California 
Sur, and the risk of life-threatening flash flooding will continue 
across portions of Baja California Sur and Sonora through today, and 
southern Arizona and New Mexico through Saturday.

This is the last advisory on Lorena by the National Hurricane 
Center. For additional information on the remnant low please see 
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under 
AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php

Rainfall forecasts for the United States can be found at 
https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/qpf/qpf2.shtml and outlooks of flash 
flood risks can be found at 
https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/qpf/excessive_rainfall_outlook_ero.php

For rainfall forecasts in northwestern Mexico, please see products 
from the Meteorological Service of Mexico.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall associated with Lorena will continue to impact 
Baja California Sur and Sonora Mexico through tonight, which will 
result in areas of life-threatening flash floods and mudslides 
across northwest Mexico.

2. Moisture from Lorena will contribute to heavy rainfall concerns 
across Arizona and New Mexico through Saturday. Isolated to 
scattered instances of flash flooding are possible across Arizona 
into Saturday.

3. Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions will affect
portions of the western coast of Baja California Sur through today.
