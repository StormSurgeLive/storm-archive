      <![CDATA[000<br />ABPZ20 KNHC 012311<br />TWOEP <br /><br />Tropical Weather Outlook<br />NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br />500 PM PDT Mon Sep 1 2025<br /><br />For the eastern and central North Pacific east of 180 longitude:<br /><br />Active Systems: <br />The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br />Storm Kiko, located in the east Pacific basin well west-southwest <br />of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.  Kiko is <br />expected to cross into the central Pacific basin by the weekend.<br /><br />South of Southwestern Mexico (EP94):<br />Showers and thunderstorms are becoming better organized in <br />association with a broad area of low pressure located a little more <br />than 100 miles off the coast of southwestern Mexico.  In addition, <br />earlier satellite-derived wind data indicate that winds to 35 mph <br />are occurring on its north side, close to the coast of Mexico.  This <br />system is expected to become a tropical depression or tropical storm <br />in the next day or so while it moves west-northwestward at 10 to 15 <br />mph off the coast of southwestern Mexico.  The disturbance is <br />expected to turn northwestward toward the Baja California peninsula <br />later in the week, and watches or warnings could be required for <br />portions of that area on Tuesday.  Regardless of development, heavy <br />rainfall is possible across coastal portions of southwestern and <br />west-central Mexico during the next few days, and these rains will <br />likely spread to Baja California Sur later in the week. The heavy <br />rains could lead to flash flooding, especially in mountainous areas.<br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br />* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br /><br />$$<br />Forecaster Cangialosi]]>

      <title>Tropical Storm Kiko Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Tropical Storm Kiko Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112025
500 PM HST Mon Sep 01 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Kiko has changed little since the 
previous advisory package.  The cyclone appears to be in the process 
of establishing a more well-defined inner-core structure, with 
glimpses of an eye evident at times in visible satellite images.  
The most recent subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates from 
TAFB and SAB were 3.5/55 kt and 4.0/65 kt, respectively, while the 
objective estimates from UW-CIMSS have ranged between 45 and 57 kt 
during the past several hours.  Taking a blend of these data, the 
initial intensity for this advisory has been held at 55 kt.

Kiko is moving just south of due west, or 265 degrees, at 6 kt.  
This general motion is expected to continue during the next several 
days as the cyclone is steered by a building subtropical ridge to 
its north and northwest.  A turn toward the west-northwest is 
forecast by days 4 and 5 as an upper-level trough north of Hawaii 
begins to erode the western portion of the subtropical ridge.  It 
should be noted that there remains considerable along-track spread 
among the global models — nearly 500 n mi by 120 hours — with the 
CMC the farthest east, the UKMET the farthest west, and the 
GFS/ECMWF solutions falling in between.  The official track forecast 
remains closely aligned with the latest multi-model consensus aids 
and is slightly north of the previous advisory.

Kiko will remain over warm waters of 27–28C and influenced by mostly 
light vertical wind shear through day 5.  The surrounding 
environmental mid-level moisture appears to be a limiting factor for 
significant intensification, however, remaining between 50 and 60 
percent and trending gradually lower through day 5.  Additionally, 
the slow-moving nature of Kiko and proximity to cooler waters to 
the north of the system may also inhibit significant 
intensification.  The latest intensity guidance has trended lower, 
and the official forecast reflects this change and has been nudged 
down accordingly.  The official intensity forecast remains higher 
than most of the intensity guidance, and is most closely aligned 
with a blend of the HCCA/FSSE intensity consensus aids and the 
regional hurricane models.

Tropical Depression Twelve-E Advisory Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122025
900 PM CST Mon Sep 01 2025
 
...TROPICAL DEPRESSION FORMS TO THE SOUTH OF SOUTHWESTERN MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM CST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.2N 105.4W
ABOUT 145 MI...230 KM SSW OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1007 MB...29.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.

Interests in southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur should
monitor the progress of this system.  A Tropical Storm Watch could 
be required for portions of Baja California Sur on Tuesday.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM CST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Twelve-E
was located near latitude 17.2 North, longitude 105.4 West.  The
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 
km/h), and a gradual turn toward the northwest and north-northwest 
with a decrease in forward speed is expected over the next couple 
of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast, and the system will likely become a
tropical storm on Tuesday.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Areas of heavy rainfall well east and northeast of the 
depression will continue to impact portions of northwestern Mexico 
from the states of Colima to Sinaloa tonight into Tuesday, with 
isolated flash flooding possible in areas of mountainous terrain.

Bands of heavy rainfall are expected to begin impacting portions of 
Baja California Sur by Wednesday and persist through Friday. 
Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches are possible here, although there 
is uncertainty with these totals, and higher amounts are possible. 
Potentially significant flash flooding is a possibility depending on 
the track and strength of the system.

 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM CST.

Tropical Depression Twelve-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122025
900 PM CST Mon Sep 01 2025
 
Deep convection associated with a low pressure system to the south
of southwestern Mexico has persisted and continues to become better 
organized over the past several hours.  There is a fairly 
well-defined upper-level anticyclonic outflow pattern over the area, 
with cloud tops to -70 deg C or colder near the estimated center.  
Based on the increased organization of the cloud pattern, the system 
is being designated as a tropical depression at this time.  Dvorak 
satellite classifications are 1.5/1.5 and 2.0/2.0 from TAFB and SAB, 
respectively, which supports a current intensity estimate of about 
30 kt.

The initial motion is a somewhat uncertain 295/12 kt.  A mid-level 
ridge to the northeast of the tropical cyclone should cause the 
system to move on a west-northwestward to northwestward track for 
the next couple of days.  Steering currents are expected to 
gradually weaken through the forecast period, resulting in a 
decrease in the forward speed of the cyclone.  In 3 to 5 days, the 
slow-moving system is expected to turn northward and then 
northeastward into a weakness in the ridge.  The official track 
forecast is close to the latest corrected consensus guidance, HCCA.

The tropical cyclone is currently situated in a weak shear 
environment over SSTs of around 30 deg C.  Strengthening is likely, 
and the system will probably be nearing hurricane intensity in a 
couple of days.  Later in the forecast period, cooler ocean waters 
and a more stable air mass should cause gradual weakening.  The 
official forecast is similar to the IVCN intensity model consensus.

Interests in southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur should 
monitor the progress of this system.   A Tropical Storm Watch could 
be required for portions of Baja California on Tuesday.
