Hurricane Kiko Discussion Number  22...Corrected
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112025
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
500 AM HST Fri Sep 05 2025
 
Corrected Key Message for Kiko
 
The satellite presentation of Kiko continues to slowly deteriorate 
early this morning, with the eye obscured by high clouds emanating 
from the coldest convective tops in the southeast quadrant.  The 
most recent subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates from TAFB 
and SAB are T6.0/115 kt and T5.0/90 kt. Objective estimates, 
including ADT from UW-CIMSS, are a bit on the lower end of the 
spread between 90-100 knots.  The intensity has been set at 100 kts 
as a blend of the subjective and objective intensity estimates.
 
Kiko has made the expected turn to the west-northwest, or 285 
degrees, at 8 kt.  The western extent of a subtropical ridge to the 
north of the cyclone is eroding by a developing upper-level low 
north of Hawaii.  This general west-northwestward motion along with 
a gradual increase in forward speed is forecast into early next 
week, as Kiko moves along the southwest periphery of this 
subtropical ridge towards the upper-level low to the north and 
northwest of the Hawaiian Islands.  The latest track forecast early 
on is very similar to the previous forecast, before being adjusted 
somewhat to the north from Monday onward as increasing southwesterly 
vertical wind shear leads to convective asymmetry which could induce 
a jog to the right.  The track forecast is closest to the HCCA 
consensus.
 
Kiko will remain over warm waters of 27–28C for the next 18 hours, 
while influenced by light northeasterly vertical wind shear, 
although the cyclone will remain in a drier than optimal mid-level 
environment keeping the storm size smaller than average.  Despite 
the dry mid-level airmass Kiko will be moving through, the other 
factors still appear favorable for some slight intensification, so 
the latest intensity forecast still shows a little short-term 
strengthening.  This forecast also fits in with the possibility for 
Kiko to develop annular characteristics which could keep it stronger 
than the forecast intensity guidance.  Thereafter, Kiko will move 
over slightly cooler waters and an even drier mid-level environment. 
These less favorable conditions should begin a gradual weakening 
trend, in spite of the very light vertical wind shear. Waters below 
26 C await Kiko's track after Monday, with west-southwesterly 
vertical wind shear increasing steadily to more than 30 kt by 
Wednesday, making it more likely the nearby dry air gets imported 
into Kiko's small core.  The increasingly hostile environment should 
lead to rapid weakening of the tropical cyclone as it approaches 
the Hawaiian Islands from the east-southeast.  The official
intensity forecast has been lowered slightly from the previous 
advisory cycle, but remains on the higher end of the intensity aids 
through 48 hours. The intensity forecast then trends closer to the 
middle of the intensity consensus envelope by Monday, and then 
trends lower as Kiko should convectively sputter while moving very 
close to the eastern end of the Hawaiian Island chain as a weakening 
tropical storm.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Kiko is forecast to approach the Hawaiian Islands during the 
early to the middle portion of next week. Impacts from rain and wind 
remain a possibility, but it is too soon to determine the exact 
location or magnitude of these impacts, and interests there should 
continue to monitor the progress of this storm.
