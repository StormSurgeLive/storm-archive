      <title>Hurricane Kiko Forecast Discussion Number 13</title>

Hurricane Kiko Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112025
1100 PM HST Tue Sep 02 2025
 
The low-level center of Kiko remained embedded in a large central 
dense overcast through most of the past 12 hours, with only 
the most recent satellite images now showing a more well-defined 
eye developing surrounded by a ring of deep convection.  The most 
recent subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates from TAFB and 
SAB were both 5.0/90 kt, while the objective estimates from UW-CIMSS 
have ranged between 83 and 92 kt during the past several hours. 
Based on these data and little overall change in the satellite 
presentation since the previous advisory cycle, the initial 
intensity has been held at 90 kt.
 
Kiko is moving due west, or 270 degrees, at 6 kt.  This general
motion is expected to continue during the next couple of days, as
the cyclone is steered by a building subtropical ridge to its north
and northwest.  A turn toward the west-northwest is forecast by day
3 as an upper-level trough north of Hawaii begins to erode the
western portion of the subtropical ridge, with this general motion
then continuing through day 5.  There remains some along-track
spread among the global models, particularly beyond 24 hours, with
some cross track spread also noted toward the end of the forecast
resulting from differences in the handling of the upper-level trough
and subtropical ridge to the north of Kiko.  The official track
forecast remains in good agreement with a blend of the latest
multi-model consensus aids and is nearly identical to the previous
advisory.
 
Kiko will remain over warm waters of 27–28C and influenced by most
light vertical wind shear through day 3.  The surrounding
environmental mid-level moisture will remain drier than optimal,
hovering between 50 and 60 percent through 60 hours, then trending
below 50 percent by days 3 through 5.  Despite the drier mid-level
airmass, the light vertical wind shear and warm sea surface
temperatures should maintain Kiko as a strong hurricane, with the
cyclone forecast to become a major hurricane on Wednesday and remain
at that status through day 3.  By days 4 and 5, the cyclone will
begin moving over cooler water with gradually increasing westerly
vertical wind shear, and mid-level moisture plummeting below 40
percent.  These factors should lead to a steady weakening, however,
Kiko is still forecast to be a hurricane on day 5.  The official
forecast remains on the higher end of the intensity guidance suite,
and is most closely aligned with a blend of the FSSE/HCCA intensity
consensus aids.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM MST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lorena was located 
near latitude 21.9 North, longitude 111.1 West. Lorena is moving 
toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this motion with a 
decrease in forward speed is expected through early Thursday. A 
generally slow northward motion is expected to begin by late 
Thursday and continue into late Friday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Lorena is expected to move parallel to the west coast of 
the Baja California peninsula today and Thursday and then approach 
the coast Thursday night and Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Rapid strengthening is forecast to continue through tonight. 
Fast weakening is expected to begin on Thursday, and Lorena could 
weaken back to a tropical storm by Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60
miles (95 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.24 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lorena can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Bands of heavy rainfall will continue to impact Baja
California Sur and move into southeastern Baja California and
southwestern Sonora by Thursday, with this rainfall potentially
persisting through Friday.  Rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches, with
maximum amounts of 15 inches, are possible across portions of Baja
California Sur and far southeast Baja California through Friday.
This will bring the risk of life-threatening flash floods and
mudslides, especially in areas of higher terrain.
 
Within the moisture surge ahead of Lorena, 1 to 3 inches of rain,
with localized totals to 4 inches, is expected from the northwest
Mexico states of Sinaloa and Sonora northward into Arizona through
Friday, bringing the potential for isolated to scattered flash
flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Lorena, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area
tonight and Thursday. Tropical storm conditions are possible within
the watch area south of Santa Fe today through Thursday, and in the 
watch area north of Cabo San Lazaro Thursday and Thursday night.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lorena will affect portions of the west
coast of Baja California Sur beginning this morning and continuing
through Friday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Lorena Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122025
200 AM MST Wed Sep 03 2025
 
Satellite imagery and data from the Mexican radar at Cabo San Lucas
indicate that Lorena continues to become better organized, with the
radar imagery showing an eyewall wrapped 50-70 percent of the way
around the center. Satellite intensity estimates are now in the
55-65 kt range, with subjective estimates from TAFB and SAB being
65 kt. Based on these data, the initial intensity is increased to
65 kt and Lorena is upgraded to a hurricane.
 
Steady to rapid intensification is likely during the next 24 h,
and while the forecast peak intensity of 85 kt is above the upper
edge of the intensity guidance it might be conservative.  After
that time, Lorena is forecast to move over cooler sea surface
temperatures and into an area of southwesterly vertical shear.
This should cause significant weakening, and Lorena is expected to
weaken back to a tropical storm by 60 h. There is significant
uncertainty as to whether Lorena will make landfall in Baja
California Sur (see discussion below). If it does, the system
should continue weakening and dissipate over northwestern Mexico by
120 h. If it doesn't, the cyclone should continue to weaken over
cold water, with dissipation likely west of Baja California Sur
by 120 h.
 
The initial motion is now 320/12 kt. The first 24 h or so of
the track forecast remain fairly straightforward, with a slower
northwestward motion expected while the cyclone moves around the
western periphery of a mid-level high centered over Mexico.  After
that time, Lorena will be moving into a weakness in the subtropical
ridge as it starts to encounter the less favorable environment.
The GFS model maintains a stronger and deeper Lorena and breaks open
the weakness in about 36 h, allowing the cyclone to recurve
north-northeastward into northwestern Mexico. The ECMWF and
Canadian models have a weaker Lorena and take about 12 h longer to
break open the ridge. This results in Lorena shearing apart with
the low-level center turning westward over the Pacific west of Baja
California Sur. Based on current intensity trends, the track
forecast leans toward the GFS solution and shows Lorena crossing
Baja California Sur in 60-72 h. However, there is still the
possibility that the cyclone does not reach the coast of Mexico. The
new forecast track is similar to the previous track and lies along
the east side of the consensus models.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Heavy rainfall associated with Tropical Storm Lorena will
continue to impact Baja California Sur, moving into southeastern
Baja California and southwestern Sonora by Thursday, and contribute
to heavy rainfall concerns across Arizona late Wednesday through
Friday. This will increase the risk of life-threatening flash floods
and mudslides across Mexico, especially in areas of higher terrain.
Isolated to scattered instances of flash flooding are possible
across Arizona through Friday.
 
2. Although rapid intensification is possible through tonight while
Lorena is offshore, the storm is expected to weaken while it
approaches the Baja California peninsula on Thursday and Thursday
night. Regardless, tropical storm conditions are likely along
portions of the coast of Baja California Sur where a Tropical Storm
Warning has been issued.  Tropical Storm conditions are also
possible through Friday along other portions of the west coast of
Baja California Sur where a Tropical Storm Watch is in effect.
Interests in Baja California Sur should closely monitor the latest
forecast updates.
