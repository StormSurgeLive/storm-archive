      <title>Hurricane Kiko Forecast Discussion Number 19</title>

Hurricane Kiko Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112025
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
1100 AM HST Thu Sep 04 2025

Recent IR satellite imagery indicates Kiko's presentation is 
improving as the previous eyewall replacement cycle (EWRC) process 
is likely in its final stages of concluding, with the eye beginning 
to clear out. Latest Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB remain at 
T6.0/115 kt, with objective intensity estimates only starting to 
increase again. Thus, the initial intensity for now will remain 115 
knots. 

Now that Kiko is completing its EWRC, some reintensification is 
possible. The overall environment remains favorable, with 
sea-surface temperatures (SST) remaining between 27-28 C with modest 
northeasterly shear. Previous forecasts from the interpolated 
intensity aids were below the official NHC forecast.  However, this 
area of the Pacific has historically had a low bias when it comes to 
the intensity forecasts when tropical cyclones develop a more 
annular structure, which the current environment is favorable for.  
As a result, the previous forecast was generally maintained over the 
first 72 hours, above the majority of the guidance. Beyond 72 hours, 
southwesterly shear increases quickly, and the hurricane will move 
over sub-26 C SSTs. This should hasten weakening towards the end of 
the forecast, which falls back in line with the intensity consensus 
aids.

Kiko will ride the southern periphery of a broad upper ridge 
situated over the northern Pacific leading to a continued west to 
west-northwest heading through the end of the week and weekend with 
a forward propagation likely to settle between 8-12 kts over this 
time frame. By early next week, the forward speed will increase to 
10-15 kts, with the hurricane moving a bit more poleward as it 
approaches the Hawaiian Islands, as an upper trough to the northwest 
of the islands erodes the western flank of the ridge.  This forecast 
remains close to the consensus guidance and just a little faster 
than the previous NHC forecast.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Kiko is forecast to approach the Hawaiian Islands during the
early to the middle portion of next week. The risk of direct impacts
from wind and rainfall is increasing.  However, it is too soon to
determine the exact location or magnitude of these impacts, and
interests there should continue to monitor the progress of this
storm.

BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Lorena Advisory Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122025
200 PM MST Thu Sep 04 2025
 
...RISK OF LIFE-THREATENING FLASH FLOODING CONTINUES FOR BAJA
CALIFORNIA SUR AND SOUTHWESTERN SONORA...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM MST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.6N 114.8W
ABOUT 155 MI...255 KM W OF CABO SAN LAZARO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...996 MB...29.42 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has discontinued all warnings.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests on the Baja California peninsula and in northwestern
Mexico should monitor the progress of Lorena.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lorena was
located near latitude 24.6 North, longitude 114.8 West. Lorena is
moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h). A turn toward the
north and a decrease in forward speed are expected tonight. On the
forecast track, the center of Lorena is expected to move generally
parallel to the west coast of the Baja California peninsula while 
it weakens on Friday.
 
Recent satellite-derived wind data and data from an Air Force 
Reserve reconnaissance aircraft indicate that maximum sustained 
winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Lorena is expected to quickly weaken for the next couple of days, 
and it is forecast to degenerate into a remnant low on Friday over 
water, to the west of the Baja California peninsula.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure, based on data from Air Force Reserve 
reconnaissance aircraft is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lorena can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Bands of heavy rainfall will continue to impact Baja
California Sur and Sonora Mexico through Friday. Additional rainfall
totals of 4 to 8 inches, with maximum storm total amounts of 15
inches, are possible across portions of Baja California Sur, far
southeast Baja California and southwestern Sonora into Friday. This
will bring the risk of life-threatening flash floods and mudslides,
especially in areas of higher terrain.
 
Elsewhere across Mexico, 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated totals
up to 6 inches, are expected across the remainder of Sonora and
northern Sinaloa. These amounts will lead to isolated to scattered
instances of flash flooding.
 
Across the southwestern United States, 1 to 2 inches of rain, with
isolated totals up to 4 inches, are expected across portions of
Arizona and New Mexico through Saturday, bringing the potential for
isolated to scattered flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Lorena, please see the National Weather Service 
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lorena will continue affecting portions
of the south and west coasts of Baja California Sur through Friday.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Lorena Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122025
200 PM MST Thu Sep 04 2025
 
Strong southwesterly wind shear and cold water temperatures have 
taken their toll on Lorena.  The convection has completely fallen 
apart and detached itself from the low-level circulation today, 
leaving an exposed swirl that is evident on GOES-18 visible 
channels.  An Air Force Reserve Reconnaissance Aircraft, which was 
just in the center, measured maximum 850-mb flight-level winds of 52 
kt, which corresponds to about 42 kt at the surface.  The central 
pressure is estimated at 996 mb based on dropsonde data from the 
aircraft.  Additionally, a recent ASCAT pass showed an area of 35-40 
kt winds, mostly in the NW quadrant.  The initial intensity 
estimate, based on the aforementioned data, has been reduced to 45 
kt.

Confidence is high that the cyclone will continue to weaken as it 
moves over progressively colder water and into stronger 
southwesterly wind shear.  The timing of when Lorena is forecast to 
weaken to a remnant low has been moved up to 24 h, but it could 
occur sooner, as most of the convection has already been sheared off 
well to the northeast of the low-level circulation.  The latest NHC 
track forecast has been shifted slightly to the left, or slightly 
farther offshore of the Baja California peninsula, compared to the 
previous NHC forecast, closer to the latest models.
 
Some large rainfall totals have already been observed across 
portions of Baja California Sur, and the risk of life-threatening 
flash flooding will continue across portions of the area through 
Friday.  Abundant moisture will continue to stream northeastward 
away from the cyclone.  Because of that, there is still a 
significant risk of heavy rainfall and flash flooding across 
portions of Baja California Sur, Sonora, southern Arizona and New 
Mexico.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall associated with Lorena will continue to impact 
Baja California Sur and Sonora Mexico through Friday. This will 
increase the risk of life-threatening flash floods and mudslides 
across northwest Mexico.
 
2. Moisture from Lorena will contribute to heavy rainfall concerns 
across Arizona and New Mexico through Saturday. Isolated to 
scattered instances of flash flooding are possible across Arizona 
into Saturday.

3. Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions will affect
portions of the southern and western coasts of Baja California Sur
during the next couple of days.
