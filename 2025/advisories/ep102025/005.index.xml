DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Juliette was
located near latitude 17.6 North, longitude 114.5 West.  Juliette is
moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h), and this

with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is expected, and 
Juliette has the potential to become a hurricane by Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)

Tropical Storm Juliette Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102025
200 PM MST Mon Aug 25 2025
 
A recent ASCAT-B scatterometer pass revealed that Juliette is now
producing maximum winds around 50 kt within the southeastern
quadrant.  The center is well embedded beneath a persistent burst
of deep convection, but interestingly, the cyclone has also been
producing another semi-disconnected burst of convection to the
southwest of the center.  Juliette has another 24-36 hours before
it reaches cooler waters and a drier, more stable atmosphere.
Continued strengthening is expected in the short term, and Juliette
does have the potential to become a hurricane.  In fact, the
latest SHIPS Rapid Intensification indices are showing a 40-45
percent change of a 25-kt increase over the next day.  The NHC 
forecast therefore explicitly shows Juliette becoming a hurricane 
in 24 hours.  Weakening is anticipated to begin in 36 hours, and 
Juliette could become post-tropical in about 3 days when it loses 
its deep convection.  Dissipation into a trough is likely by day 5.
 
The initial motion is west-northwestward (290 degrees) at 12 kt.  
Due to a break in the subtropical ridge which has developed near 
and to the west of the Baja California peninsula, Juliette is 
expected to gradually turn toward the northwest on Tuesday, and then 
the north-northwest by late Wednesday.  The NHC largely follows a 
blend of the previous forecast and the Google Deep Mind model, but 
overall there isn't much spread in the track guidance.
