Tropical Depression Ten-E Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102025
800 PM MST Sun Aug 24 2025
 
The depression has changed little over the past several hours, and 
it continues to maintain a broad structure with numerous bands of 
deep convection. The convection, however, is not particularly well 
organized and remains confined to the western half of the 
circulation due to moderate northeasterly vertical wind shear. The 
initial intensity remains 30 kt based on a blend of the latest 
satellite estimates.
 
Tropical Depression Ten-E is moving west-northwestward at 11 kt on 
the south side of a subtropical high. This general motion is 
expected to continue during the next day or so as the steering 
pattern persists.  After that time, a gradual turn to the northwest 
and then the north-northwest is forecast as the system moves into a 
weakness within the subtropical ridge. The NHC track forecast is 
similar to the previous one, and lies near the middle of the 
guidance envelope.
 
The shear over the system is expected to lessen soon, and that 
should allow the cyclone to strengthen over the next day or two. 
However, any strengthening is likely to be short-lived as the system 
is expected to move over sub 26C waters in about 48 hours. The 
expected track over cooler water combined with a progressively drier 
airmass should cause a weakening trend, and ultimately lead to the 
system becoming a post-tropical low in about 4 days.  The NHC 
intensity forecast is slightly higher than the previous one and lies 
fairly close to the IVCN consensus aid.
