Environmental conditions <br />appear favorable for gradual development of this system during the <br />next few days, and a tropical depression is likely to form over the <br />weekend while the system moves westward to west-northwestward at <br />around 15 mph across the central to western part of the eastern <br />Pacific basin.<br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br />* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br /><br />South of Southern Mexico:<br />Another area of low pressure could form this weekend offshore of the <br />coast of southern Mexico.

      <title>Tropical Storm Juliette Forecast Discussion Number 14</title>

Tropical Storm Juliette Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102025
800 PM PDT Wed Aug 27 2025
 
Satellite imagery shows that Julietteâ€™s low-level circulation is now 
fully exposed southwest of a diminishing area of convection, which 
has been fading quickly under persistent southwesterly shear and a 
dry mid- to upper-level environment. A 1719 UTC ASCAT-C pass 
indicated peak winds near 40 kt, consistent with the latest 
objective and subjective intensity estimates, so the initial 
intensity is held at 40 kt for this advisory. Further weakening is 
anticipated as Juliette remains embedded in increasing shear, cool 
waters, and a stable, dry environment. The system is expected to 
transition into a remnant low late Thursday and dissipate within a 
couple of days.

Juliette is moving north-northwestward, or 330/8 kt, into a weakness 
in the subtropical ridge. The forecast track has been nudged 
slightly to the left of the previous advisory and lies close to the 
consensus aids. As Juliette degenerates into a shallow system, most 
of the global models indicate the remnant low will gradually bend 
leftward while becoming steered primarily by the low-level flow by 
the weekend.

Global models also suggest that residual mid- to upper-level 
moisture associated with Juliette will lift northeastward over 
portions of northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States, 
potentially increasing rainfall chances.
