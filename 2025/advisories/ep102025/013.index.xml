Tropical Storm Juliette Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102025
200 PM PDT Wed Aug 27 2025
 
GOES-18 imagery indicates that convection associated with Juliette 
continues to gradually decrease, and the cloud tops on IR imagery 
are gradually warming.  However, there is an area of convection 
about 70 n mi wide in the NE quadrant, with the low-level center 
currently at the southwestern edge of the convective area.  The 
latest subjective Dvorak CI numbers from TAFB and SAB are 3.0/45 kt, 
while objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS have a wider range 
(35-50 kt).  A 1719 UTC ASCAT-C pass over the cyclone showed several 
34-36 kt vectors in the northeast quadrant.  The initial intensity 
is nudged downward to 40 kt for this advisory.
 
Juliette is moving over cold sea surface temperatures of 23-24C, and 
the cyclone is forecast to reach water temperatures colder than 22C 
in 6-12 h.  Juliette is also now reaching an area of increasing 
southwesterly wind shear, along with a drier, stable low- to 
mid-tropospheric environment.  These negative factors will cause 
Juliette to continue weakening, and the cyclone should become a 
remnant low in about 24 h.  Afterward, Juliette should open into a 
trough by late Friday.  The NHC intensity forecast is near the 
middle of the guidance envelope, with slightly faster weakening 
shown compared to the previous advisory.

The initial motion is estimated to be north-northwestward, or 330/12 
kt.  This motion should continue for the next 12-18 h while Juliette 
moves further into a growing weakness in the mid-level subtropical 
ridge.  As Juliette degenerates into a vertically shallow cyclone on 
Thursday, a slower forward motion toward the north is expected while 
being steered by the weaker low-level flow.  The official track 
forecast has been adjusted slightly to the left of the previous 
track, and lies close to the various consensus aids.
 
Global models predict that residual mid- to upper-tropospheric 
moisture will be advected toward portions of northwestern Mexico and 
the southwestern U.S., potentially increasing humidity conditions 
and enhancing local monsoonal rainfall toward the end of the week.
