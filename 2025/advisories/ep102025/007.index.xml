Tropical Storm Juliette Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102025
200 AM PDT Tue Aug 26 2025
 
Juliette's satellite appearance has remained fairly steady overnight 
with curved banding mainly to the south of the center. Recent 
microwave imagery shows that Juliette is still trying to develop a 
small inner core, which has not become better established since the 
previous advisory. Unfortunately, scatterometer missed tonight given 
the small size of the system it fell within the data gap. There is a 
bit of a range from subjective and objective intensity estimates 
this cycle between 44 to 65 kt. Using a blend of these estimates, 
the initial intensity for this advisory is held at 55 kt.
 
The system is moving west-northwestward at an estimated motion of 
290/ 11 kt. The storm is being steered along the southwestern edge 
of a mid-level ridge located to the north. A gradual turn to the 
northwest then north-northwest is anticipated as a weakness in the 
ridge develops over the next couple of days. The NHC forecast track 
was nudged slightly to the right in the short term between the 
consensus aids on the right with Google DeepMind and EMXI on the 
left.
 
Juliette should remain within a favorable environment, with warm sea 
surface temperatures and light to moderate wind shear for the next 
18-24 h , which will allow for some strengthening. However, by early 
Wednesday the system will be crossing into cooler sea surface 
temperatures, and into a drier airmass. Latest SHIPS model guidance 
depicts wind shear also increases in about 48 h. The latest NHC 
intensity forecast lies near the consensus aids, and shows some 
strengthening possible today, although since the inner core has not 
established, the peak intensity is now just below hurricane 
strength. A gradual weakening trend is then forecast between 24-36 
h, followed by a faster rate of weakening beyond 36 h. Juliette is 
forecast to become a remnant low by 60 h, before opening into a 
trough and dissipating by day 4.
