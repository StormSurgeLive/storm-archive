Tropical Storm Juliette Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102025
800 AM PDT Wed Aug 27 2025
 
Conventional satellite imagery this morning indicates that 
Juliette's cloud pattern has begun to deteriorate.  Deep convection 
has diminished in areal coverage while the cloud tops have warmed, 
particularly over the surface center.  A blend of the subjective 
Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB (40-50 kt) and a 
recent UW-CIMSS SATCON analysis of 48 kt yield an initial 
intensity of 45 kt for this advisory.
 
Juliette is traversing a sharp sea surface temperature gradient
(less than 24 C) while moving into a drier, stable low- to 
mid-tropospheric surrounding environment.  These negative 
contributions, along with increasing west-southwesterly deep-layer 
shear should weaken Juliette and cause the cyclone to become 
a remnant low in 36 hrs, if not sooner.  Afterward, Juliette 
should open into a trough by Friday.  The NHC intensity forecast is 
based on the IVCN intensity consensus model and the LGEM.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be north-northwestward, or 330/11 
kt. This motion should continue for the next couple of days followed 
by a gradual northward turn on Thursday evening, while Juliette 
moves further into a growing weakness in the mid-level subtropical 
high.  As Juliette degenerates into a vertically shallow cyclone 
toward the end of the period, a slower forward motion is expected 
while being steered by the weaker low-level flow.  The official 
track forecast is similar to the previous one and is close to the 
various consensus aids.
 
Global models predict that residual mid- to upper-tropospheric 
moisture will be advected toward portions of northwestern Mexico and 
the southwestern U.S., potentially increasing humidity conditions 
and enhancing local monsoonal rainfall toward the end of the week.
