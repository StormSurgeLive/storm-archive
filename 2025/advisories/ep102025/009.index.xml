Tropical Storm Juliette Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102025
800 AM PDT Tue Aug 26 2025
 
Conventional satellite imagery and a recent GPM/GMI microwave pass
indicate that Juliette has become better organized during the 
past few hours.  Deep convection has increased near and to the east 
of the surface center, and the GPM image revealed an impressive 
tightly curved band wrapping around the center from the southwest.  
Based on the cyclone's improved cloud pattern and the subjective 
intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB, the initial intensity is 
nudged upward to 60 kt.
 
Although not explicitly shown in the NHC forecast, there's still a 
possibility that Juliette could briefly become a hurricane later 
today, and a couple of the hurricane models are indicating this as 
well.  By Wednesday, however, a weakening trend is expected while 
Juliette traverses progressively cooler oceanic surface 
temperatures and moves into a more inhibiting surrounding 
thermodynamic environment.  Juliette is likely to degenerate into a 
remnant low by Thursday night and open into a trough over the 
weekend.  The NHC intensity forecast is similar to the previous 
advisory and resembles the IVCN intensity consensus aid.  
 
Juliette's initial motion is estimated to be northwestward, or
320/9 kt along the southwestern periphery of a mid-level 
subtropical ridge to the northeast.  A slower north-northwestward 
motion is expected late Wednesday in response to a growing weakness 
in the aforementioned subtropical ridge.  The official track 
forecast is nudged a bit to the left of the previous one and 
is close to the Google DeepMind ensemble and ECMWF deterministic 
models.
