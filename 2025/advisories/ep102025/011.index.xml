Tropical Storm Juliette Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102025
200 AM PDT Wed Aug 27 2025
 
Juliette still has a relatively healthy presentation this morning on
satellite imagery, with a small, but symmetric area of deep
convection near its center. However, these cold cloud tops are
warming as the cyclone begins to move over the progressively cooler
ocean waters of the eastern North Pacific. Satellite intensity
estimates are decreasing, and we also received a helpful Metop-C
ASCAT pass at 0451 UTC which only had a peak wind retrieval of 36
kt in the eastern side of the tropical storm. The initial intensity
is only being lowered to 45 kt this advisory, assuming some
scatterometer undersampling of the small circulation.
 
The tropical storm is now moving north-northwestward, estimated at 
330/11 kt. This motion should continue for the next day or so with a 
little more rightward turn as Juliette is steered poleward through a 
weakness in the mid-level ridging produced by a deep-layer trough 
located off the California coast. As the cyclone becomes vertically 
shallow, its forward motion should slow substantially as it becomes 
more steered by the light and variable low-level flow in this part 
of the eastern North Pacific. The official track forecast this cycle 
is fairly similar to the prior one, other than a little more 
eastward shift after Juliette becomes a remnant low. This forecast 
remains generally in the middle of the guidance envelope.
 
Juliette's tropical cyclone story is fading as it moves over 
sea-surface temperatures below 25C which cool further over the next 
24 hours. While vertical wind shear is currently low, it is expected 
to increase substantially after 24 hours, stripping away the storm's 
remaining convection by that time. Thus, Juliette is expected to 
become a remnant low in about 36 h. The remnant low should 
ultimately open up into a trough by the end of the week.
 
Even as Juliette becomes a remnant low, some of its mid- to 
upper-level moisture will be advected poleward towards portions of 
northwestern Mexico and the southwestern U.S., which could help to 
enhance local monsoonal rainfall for these areas in the latter half 
of this week.
