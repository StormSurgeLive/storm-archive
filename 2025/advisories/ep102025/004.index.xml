Tropical Storm Juliette Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102025
200 AM MST Mon Aug 25 2025
 
Since the time of the previous NHC advisory, the sheared convective 
burst associated with the tropical cyclone has grown larger, with a 
large area of cloud tops colder than -80C on GOES-West infrared 
imagery.  Furthermore, the low level center, which had been exposed 
to the east of the burst, appears to have moved underneath the 
eastern edge of the convection.  This suggests the moderate 
northeasterly vertical wind shear is weakening.  The UW-CIMSS 
objective intensity estimates have been steadily increasing, and 
are now in the 32-35 kt range.  TAFB provided a subjective Dvorak 
estimate of 35 kt, and an ASCAT pass from 25/0441 UTC showed a few 
35 kt vectors in the deep convection that might have been a bit 
rain-inflated.  Regardless of the accuracy of the ASCAT data, given 
the improving satellite presentation and persistence of the large, 
cold convective mass, the depression is upgraded to Tropical Storm 
Juliette with a 35-kt intensity.

Juliette is moving west-northwestward, or 290/11 kt on the south 
side of a subtropical high.  This general motion is expected to 
continue during the next day or so.  After that time, a gradual 
turn to the northwest is forecast as the system is influenced by a 
weakness in the subtropical ridge.  The model guidance has shifted 
to the left and a bit faster compared to the previous cycle, and so 
has the NHC forecast.  The latest official forecast is in best 
agreement with the HFIP corrected consensus (HCCA) model.  Spread 
in the model guidance increases by day 3, and the NHC forecast 
shows the cyclone slowing down at that time, similar to consensus 
aids.

Environmental conditions appear favorable for Juliette to strengthen 
for at least 36-42 more hours.  The 10-kt northeasterly vertical 
shear being experienced by the cyclone should diminish to single 
digits later today, while the system traverses warm ocean waters.  
By 48 h, Juliette should reach colder waters and a more stable 
atmosphere, and these conditions will induce weakening.  The latest 
NHC intensity forecast is slightly higher than the previous one and 
lies at the high end of the model guidance at 36-48 h.  The reason 
for this is that with the shift in the forecast track to the left, 
Juliette should have a few additional hours to strengthen before it 
reaches the less favorable conditions.  With the decreasing shear 
later today, there should be enough time for Juliette to become a 
high-end tropical storm.
