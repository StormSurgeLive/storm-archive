DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Humberto was
located near latitude 27.2 North, longitude 66.9 West. Humberto is
moving toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). A gradual turn
towards the north is expected over the next day or so. The hurricane 
is then forecast to turn and accelerate east-northeastward by late 
Tuesday or early Wednesday. On the forecast track, the center of 
Humberto will pass well west, and then north of Bermuda on Tuesday 
and Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts. Humberto is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Fluctuations in intensity are possible today. 
Gradual weakening is forecast after that, but Humberto is expected 
to remain a dangerous major hurricane into Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 933 mb (27.55 inches).
