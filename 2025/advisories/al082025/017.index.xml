SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Humberto was 
located near latitude 25.5 North, longitude 65.4 West. Humberto is 
moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). A gradual turn 
toward the north is expected over the next day or two. The hurricane 
is then forecast to turn and accelerate east-northeastward by late 
Tuesday or early Wednesday. On the forecast track, the center of 
Humberto will pass well west, and then north of Bermuda on Tuesday 
and Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher
gusts. Humberto is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Fluctuations in intensity are possible during
the next day or so. Gradual weakening is forecast after that, but
Humberto is expected to remain a dangerous major hurricane for the
next couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 937 mb (27.67 inches). 
An OSHEN C-Star drone recently measured a minimum pressure near 955 
mb in the eyewall of Humberto with gusts to hurricane strength at an 
anemometer height of about 2 feet (0.5 m).

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Humberto will continue to affect portions
of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
and Bermuda through much of this week. Swells from Humberto will
also affect the U.S. East Coast beginning Monday. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Hurricane Humberto is expected to bring rainfall of 1 to 
2 inches, or 25 to 50 mm, to Bermuda Monday night through Tuesday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Humberto Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
500 PM AST Sun Sep 28 2025

Humberto continues to have a small inner core, surrounded by a much 
larger ring of deep convection. This structure is evident in visible 
and IR satellite imagery, in which a moat of warmer cloud tops 
outside of the inner eyewall has been noted at times during day. 
This structure has likely caused Humberto's intensity to decrease 
today, and the 125-kt intensity estimate is on the high end of 
recent objective and subjective estimates. However, this has also 
caused the wind field to increase, which was confirmed by ASCAT data 
that arrived shortly after the issuance of the previous advisory. An 
Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to 
investigate Humberto this evening, which should provide more 
information about the strength and structure of the hurricane.

Overall, no significant changes were made to the NHC track, 
intensity, or radii forecasts for Humberto. The hurricane should 
move west and then north of Bermuda over the next few days while it 
slowly weakens but grows in size. Confidence in the forecast through 
that period is fairly high, with the model spread being smaller than 
normal. The forecast uncertainty is higher after that, but Humberto 
is subsequently expected to become a post-tropical frontal low 
between 72 and 96 h. Regardless of its exact strength or forward 
speed, Humberto will be a strong and large hurricane-strength low 
throughout the forecast period, even as its surface circulation will 
likely become ill defined by the end of the week. The NHC forecast 
is close to a blend of the multi-model consensus and the Google 
DeepMind Ensemble Mean at all times.

The primary concerns for Humberto continue to be its production of 
dangerous surf which will affect Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast 
for the next several days, and the growth of its wind field, which 
could result in tropical-storm-force winds affecting Bermuda 
by late Tuesday.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical-storm-force winds could begin to affect Bermuda by late 
Tuesday. The Bermuda Weather Service has issued a Tropical Storm 
Watch for Bermuda. Interests there should continue to monitor the 
progress of Humberto.
 
2. Dangerous marine conditions, including high surf and
life-threatening rip currents, are affecting beaches of the northern
Caribbean, Bahamas, and Bermuda. The dangerous surf conditions are
expected to begin affecting the U.S. East Coast on Monday.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Imelda was 
located by Air Force reconnaissance data near latitude 23.9 North, 
longitude 77.3 West. Imelda is moving toward the north near 7 mph 
(11 km/h). A faster motion to the north is expected later today and 
continuing through Monday. On the forecast track, the center of the 
system is expected to move across the central and northwestern 
Bahamas this afternoon and tonight and then turn east-northeastward, 
moving away from the southeastern U.S. by the middle part of this 
week. 
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Strengthening is expected during the next few days, 
and Imelda is forecast to become a hurricane by late Monday or 
Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (50 km) 
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated by aircraft dropsonde data is 
998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Imelda can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occuring in the central Bahamas 
and are expected in the northwestern Bahamas later this afternoon. 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area along the 
east coast of Florida on Monday.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Imelda is expected to produce additional
rainfall of 2 to 6 inches across eastern Cuba and 6 to 12 inches
across the northwest Bahamas through Tuesday. This rainfall will
likely produce flash and urban flooding. Mudslides are also possible
in areas of higher terrain across eastern Cuba.
 
Storm total rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches with local maxima of
7 inches are expected into Wednesday morning across portions of the
coastal Carolinas. This rainfall could result in flash, urban, and
isolated, minor river flooding. Changes in the forecast track could
result in further adjustments to these rainfall totals.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with this system, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds in the northwestern Bahamas. Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
Minor coastal flooding is possible in areas of onshore winds over
the Southeastern U.S. coastline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the surge occurs over the next several high tide cycles...
 
Volusia/Brevard County Line, Florida to the South Santee River,
South Carolina...1 to 2 ft
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Imelda and Hurricane 
Humberto will affect portions of the Bahamas this weekend, and 
spread to much of the east coast of the U.S. early this week. These 
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found

      <title>Tropical Depression Nine Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Tropical Depression Nine Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
1100 AM EDT Sun Sep 28 2025

Structurally, the depression continues to gradually become better 
organized, with an attempt at more bursting convection closer to the 
estimated center. However, recent observations from the ongoing Air 
Force Reserve Reconnaissance aircraft mission have been rather 
underwhelming, which still shows a broad wind field and a peak 
850-mb wind of only 37 kt. Based on this information, the system 
will remain a depression for this advisory with maximum sustained 
wind of 30 kt, which is a little under the satellite-based 
intensity estimates. 

The depression has not really accelerated much yet this morning, and 
it appears to be moving slowly northward at 350/6 kt. A general 
north-northwest to northward motion is expected to continue for the 
next 24-36 hours as southerly steering persists from both an upper 
trough over the southeastern United States and the subtropical ridge 
centered just east of Bermuda. After that period of time, the 
subtropical ridge's steering influence decreases as Hurricane 
Humberto's larger outer circulation creates a large weakness. Given 
the slow motion of the depression so far, it has also remained 
south of a track bifurcation point that was seen yesterday in the 
ensemble guidance. The tropical cyclone now appears more likely to 
turn sharply east-northeastward starting on Tuesday and continuing 
through the remainder of the forecast. The track guidance this cycle 
has made another south and eastward shift, and the NHC track 
forecast has been moved in that direction. In particular, the 
track guidance continues to show much more east-northeastward 
acceleration at the end of the forecast, requiring large speed 
changes in days 4 and 5, and this still might not be fast enough. 
The latest track forecast is very close to the HCCA consensus aid, 
but blends it with a little more of the Google DeepMind ensemble 
mean (GDMI) by the day 5 forecast. 
 
While the depression has not yet developed an inner core, one is 
expected to form in the next 12-24 hours. Some southerly vertical 
wind shear is expected to persist, though it never gets 
prohibitively strong, remaining under 20 kt for the next 48-72 h in 
the GFS-based SHIPS. Therefore, intensification is expected and the 
latest NHC intensity forecast is roughly in line with the intensity 
guidance consensus aids. In 3-4 days, the cyclone is expected to 
find itself in the right entrance region of an intensifying 
upper-level jet, and the enhanced upper-level divergence in that 
time may help support additional intensification even as the shear 
begins to increase towards the end of the forecast. After the system 
passes Bermuda, a strong baroclinic zone is expected to interact 
with the system, resulting in extratropical transition by day 5 as 
it gets tangled up with a frontal boundary. However, as stressed 
previously, this is a low confidence forecast at long range given 
the recent large track changes, especially since the southward shift 
in track keeps the cyclone over warmer sea-surface temperatures.
 
KEY MESSAGES:

1. The depression is expected to strengthen and bring tropical storm 
conditions to portions of the central and northwestern Bahamas 
through Monday. Tropical storm conditions are also possible
along portions of the east coast of central Florida beginning 
Monday.
 
2. Rainfall associated with the system will continue to impact 
eastern Cuba and the Bahamas through Tuesday, which will likely 
produce flash and urban flooding.  Mudslides are possible in the 
higher terrain.  Heavy rainfall across the coastal Carolinas could 
cause flash, urban, and river flooding into Wednesday morning. 
 
3. The risk of significant wind impacts along the southeastern 
United States coast is decreasing, but interests in that area should 
continue to monitor the latest forecast updates. 

4. Swells and high surf from both Humberto and Tropical Depression 
Nine are expected to produce dangerous marine conditions and rip 
currents along the east coast of Florida and the Georgia coast 
through Monday.  These conditions are expected to spread northward 
along much of the east coast of the United States early this week.
