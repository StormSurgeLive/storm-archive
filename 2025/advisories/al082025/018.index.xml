WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Humberto was located
near latitude 26.2 North, longitude 66.2 West. Humberto is moving
toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). A gradual turn toward
the north is expected over the next day or so. The hurricane is then
forecast to turn and accelerate east-northeastward by late Tuesday
or early Wednesday. On the forecast track, the center of Humberto
will pass well west, and then north of Bermuda on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 140 mph (220 km/h) with higher
gusts. Humberto is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Fluctuations in intensity are possible during
the next day or so. Gradual weakening is forecast after that, but
Humberto is expected to remain a dangerous major hurricane for
another couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 928 mb (27.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Humberto will continue to affect portions
of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
and Bermuda through much of this week. Swells from Humberto will
also affect the U.S. East Coast beginning Monday. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Hurricane Humberto is expected to bring rainfall of 1 to
2 inches, or 25 to 50 mm, to Bermuda Monday night through Tuesday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

      <title>Hurricane Humberto Forecast Discussion Number 17</title>

Hurricane Humberto Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
500 PM AST Sun Sep 28 2025

Humberto continues to have a small inner core, surrounded by a much 
larger ring of deep convection. This structure is evident in visible 
and IR satellite imagery, in which a moat of warmer cloud tops 
outside of the inner eyewall has been noted at times during day. 
This structure has likely caused Humberto's intensity to decrease 
today, and the 125-kt intensity estimate is on the high end of 
recent objective and subjective estimates. However, this has also 
caused the wind field to increase, which was confirmed by ASCAT data 
that arrived shortly after the issuance of the previous advisory. An 
Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to 
investigate Humberto this evening, which should provide more 
information about the strength and structure of the hurricane.

Overall, no significant changes were made to the NHC track, 
intensity, or radii forecasts for Humberto. The hurricane should 
move west and then north of Bermuda over the next few days while it 
slowly weakens but grows in size. Confidence in the forecast through 
that period is fairly high, with the model spread being smaller than 
normal. The forecast uncertainty is higher after that, but Humberto 
is subsequently expected to become a post-tropical frontal low 
between 72 and 96 h. Regardless of its exact strength or forward 
speed, Humberto will be a strong and large hurricane-strength low 
throughout the forecast period, even as its surface circulation will 
likely become ill defined by the end of the week. The NHC forecast 
is close to a blend of the multi-model consensus and the Google 
DeepMind Ensemble Mean at all times.

The primary concerns for Humberto continue to be its production of 
dangerous surf which will affect Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast 
for the next several days, and the growth of its wind field, which 
could result in tropical-storm-force winds affecting Bermuda 
by late Tuesday.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical-storm-force winds could begin to affect Bermuda by late 
Tuesday. The Bermuda Weather Service has issued a Tropical Storm 
Watch for Bermuda. Interests there should continue to monitor the 
progress of Humberto.
 
2. Dangerous marine conditions, including high surf and
life-threatening rip currents, are affecting beaches of the northern
Caribbean, Bahamas, and Bermuda. The dangerous surf conditions are
expected to begin affecting the U.S. East Coast on Monday.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Imelda was
located near latitude 25.0 North, longitude 77.1 West.  Imelda is
moving toward the north near 9 mph (15 km/h), and a generally 
northward motion is expected to continue through Monday.  On 
Tuesday, Imelda is expected to turn sharply to the east-northeast.  
On the forecast track, the center of the system is expected to move 
across the central and northwestern Bahamas tonight and Monday and 
then turn east-northeastward, moving away from the southeastern U.S. 
by the middle part of this week.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is expected during the next few days, and Imelda is 
forecast to become a hurricane by late Monday or Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft observations is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Imelda can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occuring in the central and
northwestern Bahamas and should continue through Monday morning.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Imelda is expected to produce additional 
rainfall of 2 to 4 inches across eastern Cuba and 4 to 8 inches 
across the northwest Bahamas through Tuesday. This rainfall will 
likely produce flash and urban flooding. Mudslides are also possible 
in areas of higher terrain across eastern Cuba.

Storm total rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches with local maxima of 6 
inches are expected through Tuesday across coastal South Carolina 
into southeast North Carolina. This rainfall could result in 
isolated flash and urban flooding.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Tropical Storm Imelda, please see the National 
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds in the northwestern Bahamas.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
Minor coastal flooding is possible in areas of onshore winds over
the Southeastern U.S. coastline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the surge occurs over the next several high tide cycles...
 
Volusia/Brevard County Line, Florida to the South Santee River,
South Carolina...1 to 2 ft
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Imelda and Hurricane
Humberto will affect portions of the Bahamas this weekend, and
spread to much of the east coast of the U.S. early this week. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ripCurrents
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 AM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 500 AM EDT.

Tropical Storm Imelda Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
1100 PM EDT Sun Sep 28 2025
 
Imelda's cloud pattern has shown little change since earlier today. 
There is a prominent band of deep convection over the eastern 
portion of the circulation.  Some deep convection is developing 
near/over the estimated center position.  Flight-level 
winds observations from Air Force and NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft investigating the storm indicate that the maximum winds 
remain near 35 kt, although the recent increase of central 
convection suggests some strengthening may soon occur.   
 
Center fixes from the Hurricane Hunters show that the motion has 
been mainly northward with the initial motion estimate remaining 
about 360/8 kt.  Imelda should continue this generally northward 
track through tomorrow while moving on the western side of a 
mid-level ridge.  Then, a trough over the southeastern U.S. is 
expected to cause the cyclone to turn sharply east-northeastward.  
This track should keep the center of Imelda offshore of the 
southeastern U.S. coast.  Later in the forecast period, the system 
should move mainly east-northeastward over the subtropical 
Atlantic, and pass near Bermuda in several days.  The official 
track forecast is similar to the one from the previous 
advisory, and close to the model consensus.

Imelda is expected to remain in an environment of moderate 
south-southwesterly vertical wind shear for the next few days.  The 
system will be moving over warm ocean waters of around 29 deg C and 
within a fairly moist mid-level air mass.  Given the mainly 
conducive environmental conditions, the cyclone is likely to 
strengthen into a hurricane within the next 1-2 days, with 
additional intensification likely thereafter.  The official 
intensity forecast is at the higher end of the model guidance.  By 
the end of the forecast period, simulated satellite imagery from 
the global models suggest the cloud pattern of an extratropical 
cyclone, and the official forecast shows extratropical transition 
around that time. 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Imelda is expected to continue to bring tropical storm
conditions to portions of the central and northwestern Bahamas
through Monday.
 
2. Rainfall associated with Imelda will continue to impact eastern 
Cuba and the Bahamas through Tuesday, which will likely produce 
flash and urban flooding.  Mudslides are possible in the higher 
terrain.  Heavy rainfall across the coastal Carolinas could cause 
isolated flash and urban flooding through Tuesday.
 
3. The risk of significant wind impacts along the southeastern
United States coast is decreasing, but interests in that area should
continue to monitor the latest forecast updates.
 
4. Swells and high surf from both Humberto and Imelda are expected
to produce dangerous marine conditions and rip currents along the
east coast of Florida and the Georgia coast through Monday.  These
conditions are expected to spread northward along much of the east
coast of the United States early this week.
