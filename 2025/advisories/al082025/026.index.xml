DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Humberto was 
located near latitude 34.8 North, longitude 68.5 West. Humberto is 
moving toward the east-northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h) and this

developing frontal boundary.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Continued weakening is forecast and Humberto is expected to
merge with a frontal boundary on Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 265 miles
(425 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Humberto can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells from Humberto are likely to cause dangerous surf and 
life-threatening rip current conditions, affecting beaches of the 
northern Caribbean, Bahamas, Bermuda, and much of the east coast of 
the United States over the next several days. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?ripCurrents
 
WIND: Gusty winds are possible over Bermuda within outer rainbands
today into Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Any distant rainbands associated with Humberto are 
expected to bring an additional 1 inch (25 mm) or less of rainfall 
to Bermuda tonight.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Humberto Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
500 PM AST Tue Sep 30 2025
 
Deep convection has persisted in the northeast quadrant through the
day and is now partially obscuring the low-level circulation.  An 
afternoon AMSR2 microwave satellite pass showed curved band wrapping 
around eastern semicircle of the hurricane.  Given the slightly 
improved satellite presentation and the earlier aircraft data, the 
initial intensity remains at 70 kt. The wind radii have been updated 
based on a couple scatterometer passes from 1339 and 1500 UTC.
 
Humberto has turned northward and is moving an estimated 15 kt as 
the hurricane nears the mid-latitude trough to its north.  Later 
today, the cyclone is expected to turn northeast and on Wednesday to 
the east-northeast in the westerly flow.  Only minor updates have 
made to the latest NHC track forecast, which lies on the leading 
edge of the track guidance envelope.

Model guidance suggests Humberto should gradually weaken while it 
merges with the mid- to upper-level trough during the next day or 
so. Humberto's dissipation has once again been moved up based on 
recent model trends, now at 36 h.  While the official intensity 
forecast shows Humberto becoming an extratropical cyclone on 
Wednesday, the European model is showing the potential that it could 
retain deep organized convection up until the cyclone becomes 
elongated and loses its closed surface circulation.  The hurricane 
is producing a large area of hazardous marine conditions over the 
western and central Atlantic, where life-threatening rip currents 
are expected to affect beaches throughout the region through the 
week.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Dangerous marine conditions, including high surf and
life-threatening rip currents, will continue to affect beaches of
the northern Caribbean, Bahamas, Bermuda, and much of the east coast
of the United States through the week.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Imelda was
located near latitude 29.7 North, longitude 73.9 West. Imelda is
moving toward the east-northeast near 15 mph (24 km/h). A much
faster east-northeast to northeast motion is expected over the next
couple of days.  On the forecast track, the core of the hurricane
will be near Bermuda Wednesday evening.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some additional strengthening is forecast during the next
day or so.  Imelda is then expected to become an extratropical low
in a couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles
(260 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on data from the Air 
Force Hurricane Hunters is 977 mb (28.85 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Imelda can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected over Bermuda by Wednesday
evening, with tropical storm conditions likely by Wednesday
afternoon.
 
RAINFALL:  Across Bermuda, 2 to 4 inches (50 to 100 mm) of rainfall
are expected from Wednesday into Thursday, which could lead to
flash flooding.
 
STORM SURGE:  In Bermuda, a dangerous storm surge is expected to
produce coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds.  The surge will
be accompanied by large and damaging waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Hurricane Imelda and Hurricane Humberto
are affecting the Bahamas, Bermuda, and much of the U.S. east coast.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.

      <title>Hurricane Imelda Forecast Discussion Number 17</title>

Hurricane Imelda Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
500 PM EDT Tue Sep 30 2025
 
The hurricane continues to gradually become better organized, with 
curved banding features becoming more prominent over the 
circulation.  Deepest convection is noted over the western 
semicircle of the system with tops to near -70 deg C.  Upper-level 
outflow is fairly well-defined at this time.  The advisory 
intensity is set at 75 kt which is in line with flight-level wind 
observations from the previous Hurricane Hunter mission.  
Subjective and objective Dvorak estimates are a little lower.  
Another Air Force Reserve Unit aircraft is scheduled to investigate 
Imelda soon to check on the intensity and structure of the tropical 
cyclone.

Imelda is moving a little faster toward the east-northeast with a 
motion estimate of 060/10 kt.  A mid-tropospheric trough near the 
U.S. east coast should cause the hurricane to continue to accelerate 
east-northeastward over the next couple of days.  The forecast track 
brings the center of the hurricane near Bermuda in less than 36 
hours, with tropical storm conditions expected to reach Bermuda by 
tomorrow afternoon.   There will likely be some binary interactions 
between Imelda and Humberto since the circulations of the two 
systems are getting very close together.  However, it is difficult 
to specify how significantly this interaction will affect 
Imelda's track. The official forecast is near the southern edge 
of the model guidance suite.  

The hurricane is expected to be within an environment of moderate 
or stronger vertical wind shear, but in a favorable thermodynamic 
environment during the next day or so.  An upper-level trough to 
the northwest of Imelda could contribute to strengthening due to 
baroclinic forcing and upper-level divergence while the system 
nears Bermuda.  This could result in a fairly potent, if not an 
entirely tropical, cyclone passing near the island tomorrow. Later 
in the forecast period, the global models show the system merging 
with a broad baroclinic zone over the north Atlantic, and the 
simulated satellite imagery from these models takes on the 
appearance of an extratropical cyclone in 2-3 days.

KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Imelda is expected bring damaging hurricane-force-winds to
Bermuda when it passes near or over that island by Wednesday
afternoon or evening.  A Hurricane Warning is in effect for
Bermuda.
 
2. Imelda is likely to cause large and damaging waves in Bermuda.
 
3. Heavy rainfall could cause flash flooding across Bermuda
Wednesday into Thursday.
 
4. Swells and high surf from both Humberto and Imelda are expected
to produce dangerous marine conditions and rip currents along much
of the East Coast of the United States during the next several days.
