DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Humberto was
located near latitude 27.2 North, longitude 66.9 West. Humberto is
moving toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). A gradual turn
towards the north is expected over the next day or so. The hurricane 
is then forecast to turn and accelerate east-northeastward by late 
Tuesday or early Wednesday. On the forecast track, the center of 
Humberto will pass well west, and then north of Bermuda on Tuesday 
and Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts. Humberto is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Fluctuations in intensity are possible today. 
Gradual weakening is forecast after that, but Humberto is expected 
to remain a dangerous major hurricane into Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 933 mb (27.55 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Humberto can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Humberto will continue to affect portions
of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
and Bermuda through much of this week. Swells from Humberto will
also affect the U.S. East Coast beginning today. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ripCurrents
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning 
Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL: Hurricane Humberto is expected to bring rainfall of 1 to
2 inches, or 25 to 50 mm, to Bermuda tonight through Tuesday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Humberto Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
1100 PM AST Sun Sep 28 2025
 
Humberto remains a powerful category 4 hurricane over the
subtropical western Atlantic.  The Air Force Hurricane Hunters have
been investigating Humberto this evening and found that the major
hurricane has concentric eyewalls, with a double wind maximum noted
in all quadrants.  Based on the flight-level wind data, the initial
intensity is set at 120 kt. Dropsonde data from the aircraft suggest
that the minimum pressure is quite low at 928 mb.
 
Humberto is moving northwestward at 12 kt in the flow on the
south-southwest side of a subtropical high.  The major hurricane is
expected to gradually turn to the north by late Monday and Tuesday
as the high shifts to the east and weakens.  After that, a trough is
expected to amplify over the north Atlantic, and that should cause
Humberto to turn sharply and accelerate east-northeastward Tuesday
night and Wednesday.  The models are in good agreement, and only
minor changes were made to the previous track forecast.  While there
is high confidence that the core of Humberto will miss Bermuda,
there is a possibility of tropical-storm-force winds occurring there
late Tuesday and Wednesday in Humberto's outer bands.
 
The intensity of Humberto will likely fluctuate over the next 12 to
24 hours, but gradual weakening is expected after that due to
increasing shear and decreasing SSTs.  Extratropical transition is
now forecast to be complete by 72 hours when the system is expected
to merge with the aforementioned mid- to upper-level trough and
develop frontal features.  The NHC intensity forecast is near the
middle of the guidance envelope.  The hurricane is expected to grow
in size as it gains latitude during the next few days, which will
result in a large area of rough seas. See Key Messages below for
more information.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical-storm-force winds could begin to affect Bermuda by late
Tuesday, and a tropical storm watch is in effect for the island.
Interests there should continue to monitor the progress of Humberto.
 
2. Dangerous marine conditions, including high surf and
life-threatening rip currents, are affecting beaches of the northern
Caribbean, Bahamas, and Bermuda. The dangerous surf conditions are
expected to begin affecting much of the east coast of the U.S. on
Monday.

hours.

Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Imelda.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Imelda was
located near latitude 25.5 North, longitude 77.1 West. Imelda is
moving toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h), and a generally 
northward motion is expected to continue today.  On Tuesday, Imelda 
is expected to turn sharply to the east-northeast.  On the forecast 
track, the center of the system is expected to move across the 
northwestern Bahamas today and then turn east-northeastward, moving 
away from the southeastern U.S. by the middle part of this week.

Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is forecast and Imelda could become a 
hurricane on Tuesday.  
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km), 
primarily east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Imelda can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occuring in portions of 
the northwestern Bahamas and should continue through today.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Imelda is expected to produce additional 
rainfall of 2 to 4 inches across eastern Cuba and 4 to 8 inches 
across the northwest Bahamas through Tuesday. This rainfall will 
likely produce flash and urban flooding. Mudslides are also possible 
in areas of higher terrain across eastern Cuba.

Storm total rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches with local maxima of 4 
inches are expected through Tuesday across northeast Florida, 
coastal South Carolina, and coastal sections of southeast North 
Carolina. This rainfall could result in isolated flash and urban 
flooding.

As Imelda passes near Bermuda, 2 to 4 inches -- 50 to 100 mm -- of 
rainfall is expected from Wednesday into Thursday.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Tropical Storm Imelda, please see the National 
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk 
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds in the northwestern Bahamas.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
Minor coastal flooding is possible in areas of onshore winds over
the Southeastern U.S. coastline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the surge occurs over the next several high tide cycles...
 
Volusia/Brevard County Line, Florida to the South Santee River,
South Carolina...1 to 2 ft
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Imelda and Hurricane
Humberto are affecting the Bahamas and will spread to much of the
east coast of the U.S. early this week. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ripCurrents
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.

Tropical Storm Imelda Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
1100 PM EDT Sun Sep 28 2025
 
Imelda's cloud pattern has shown little change since earlier today. 
There is a prominent band of deep convection over the eastern 
portion of the circulation.  Some deep convection is developing 
near/over the estimated center position.  Flight-level 
winds observations from Air Force and NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft investigating the storm indicate that the maximum winds 
remain near 35 kt, although the recent increase of central 
convection suggests some strengthening may soon occur.   
 
Center fixes from the Hurricane Hunters show that the motion has 
been mainly northward with the initial motion estimate remaining 
about 360/8 kt.  Imelda should continue this generally northward 
track through tomorrow while moving on the western side of a 
mid-level ridge.  Then, a trough over the southeastern U.S. is 
expected to cause the cyclone to turn sharply east-northeastward.  
This track should keep the center of Imelda offshore of the 
southeastern U.S. coast.  Later in the forecast period, the system 
should move mainly east-northeastward over the subtropical 
Atlantic, and pass near Bermuda in several days.  The official 
track forecast is similar to the one from the previous 
advisory, and close to the model consensus.

Imelda is expected to remain in an environment of moderate 
south-southwesterly vertical wind shear for the next few days.  The 
system will be moving over warm ocean waters of around 29 deg C and 
within a fairly moist mid-level air mass.  Given the mainly 
conducive environmental conditions, the cyclone is likely to 
strengthen into a hurricane within the next 1-2 days, with 
additional intensification likely thereafter.  The official 
intensity forecast is at the higher end of the model guidance.  By 
the end of the forecast period, simulated satellite imagery from 
the global models suggest the cloud pattern of an extratropical 
cyclone, and the official forecast shows extratropical transition 
around that time. 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Imelda is expected to continue to bring tropical storm
conditions to portions of the central and northwestern Bahamas
through Monday.
 
2. Rainfall associated with Imelda will continue to impact eastern 
Cuba and the Bahamas through Tuesday, which will likely produce 
flash and urban flooding.  Mudslides are possible in the higher 
terrain.  Heavy rainfall across the coastal Carolinas could cause 
isolated flash and urban flooding through Tuesday.
 
3. The risk of significant wind impacts along the southeastern
United States coast is decreasing, but interests in that area should
continue to monitor the latest forecast updates.
 
4. Swells and high surf from both Humberto and Imelda are expected
to produce dangerous marine conditions and rip currents along the
east coast of Florida and the Georgia coast through Monday.  These
conditions are expected to spread northward along much of the east
coast of the United States early this week.
