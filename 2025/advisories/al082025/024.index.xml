north of Bermuda today and Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 80 mph (130 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Continued weakening is forecast and Humberto is
expected to become a strong extratropical system on Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km).
 
The minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches) as indicated

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Humberto can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells from Humberto are likely to cause dangerous surf and
life-threatening rip current conditions, affecting beaches of the
northern Caribbean, Bahamas, Bermuda, and much of the east coast of
the United States over the next several days. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found

Hurricane Humberto Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
1100 AM AST Tue Sep 30 2025
 
Humberto is quickly decoupling.  Strong westerly vertical wind shear
has exposed the low-level circulation, with a curved band of deep
convection still present in the northeastern quadrant.  The Air
Force Hurricane Hunters have just completed their final mission into
Humberto, finding peak flight-level winds of 77 kt and a rising
central minimum pressure.  The initial intensity has been lowered to
a possibly generous 70 kt.
 
The hurricane is moving at an estimated 340/16 kt.  Humberto is
expect to turn northward and north-northeastward later today,
followed by a turn to the east-northeast on Wednesday with an
increase in forward motion as the hurricane merges with a large mid-
to upper-level trough over the north Atlantic.  The latest
official track forecast has shifted slightly to the west, largely
due to the current north-northwest motion.
 
Humberto should gradually weaken while it transitions into a strong
extratropical cyclone.  Global models suggest this transition will
occur sooner than previously expected, and the official forecast now 
shows Humberto as an extratropical cyclone by Wednesday.  By 
Thursday, the cyclone is forecast to elongate along a frontal 
boundary extending southwestward toward Imelda and lose its closed 
circulation.  The hurricane is producing a large area of hazardous 
marine conditions over the western and central Atlantic, where 
life-threatening rip currents are expected to affect beaches along 
the eastern seaboard through the week.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Dangerous marine conditions, including high surf and
life-threatening rip currents, will continue to affect beaches of
the northern Caribbean, Bahamas, Bermuda, and much of the east coast
of the United States through the week.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Imelda was located
by an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 29.0 North, 
longitude 76.9 West. Imelda is moving toward the northeast near 7 
mph (11 km/h).  This general motion is expected through today, 
followed by a turn towards the east-northeast at a faster forward 
speed by tonight. On the forecast track, the center of the system 
should move away from the Bahamas today and quickly be approaching 
Bermuda late on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is forecast 
during the next 48 hours.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185
miles (295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Imelda can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area by
Wednesday night, with tropical storm conditions possible by
Wednesday afternoon.
 
RAINFALL:  Storm total rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches with local
maxima of 4 inches are expected through tonight across coastal
sections of southeast North Carolina. This rainfall could result in
isolated flash and urban flooding.
 
As Imelda passes near Bermuda, 2 to 4 inches – 50 to 100 mm – of
rainfall is expected from Wednesday into Thursday.
 
STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding is possible in areas of onshore
winds over the Southeastern U.S. coastline. The water could reach
the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas
if the surge occurs over the next several high tide cycles...
 
Volusia/Brevard County Line, Florida to the South Santee River,
South Carolina...1 to 2 ft
 
SURF: Swells generated by Hurricane Imelda and Hurricane Humberto 
are affecting the Bahamas and are currently spreading to much of the 
U.S. east coast. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening 
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your 
local weather office.

      <title>Tropical Storm Imelda Forecast Discussion Number 15</title>

Tropical Storm Imelda Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
500 AM EDT Tue Sep 30 2025

Deep convection has redeveloped on the western side of Imelda 
during the past several hours, though a fair portion of the 
circulation has been overtaken by dry air aloft.  The last reports 
overnight from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that the pressure had fallen again to 983 mb, with some 
increase in flight-level winds as they exited in the western 
quadrant.  Given the improved organization on satellite since the 
plane left, I'm going to nudge the maximum winds up to 60 kt on 
this advisory, and another Hurricane Hunter should be in the area 
this morning.  

Imelda has taken the long-awaited turn away from the mainland, now 
estimated at 035/7 kt.  This general motion is expected today, 
followed by a faster motion towards the east-northeast primarily 
due to increasing mid-latitude southwesterly flow.  There remains 
some speed differences in the models, but it is notable that all of 
the guidance is near Bermuda between 36-48 h.  The new forecast is 
a touch south of the previous one, perhaps reflecting some binary 
steering influences from Humberto as the pair of tropical cyclones 
get closer together.  

The environment around Imelda is a complicated one, with lots of 
shear and dry air in the vicinity while the system remains over 
warm waters.  A recent AMSR pass also shows better low-level 
structure, so intensification is forecast today.  Imelda should 
experience a favorable trough interaction by Wednesday, forcing an 
increase in the maximum winds as Imelda undergoes a protracted 
extratropical transition with lots of upper divergence and 
convection.  Every model forecasts a strong sting jet to form on 
the south and west side of the cyclone on Wednesday during the 
later stages of the transition.  The new forecast is near a mean of 
the global and regional hurricane models, showing a potent system 
near Bermuda.  Imelda probably won't have a conventional hurricane 
structure near that island, but there is a significant risk of high 
winds due to the hybrid tropical cyclone structure expected then.  
Steady weakening is anticipated by late week after the system 
passes Bermuda.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Imelda is expected to intensify into a hurricane later today 
with the cyclone approaching Bermuda during the day Wednesday as a 
hurricane. A Hurricane Watch is in effect for the island of Bermuda 
due to the expected onset of tropical storm conditions beginning 
Wednesday afternoon.
 
2. Locally heavy rainfall across coastal sections of southeast
North Carolina could cause isolated flash and urban flooding
through tonight. As Imelda passes near Bermuda, 2 to 4 inches – 50
to 100 mm – of rainfall is expected from Wednesday into Thursday.
 
3. Swells and high surf from both Humberto and Imelda are expected
to produce dangerous marine conditions and rip currents along much
of the East Coast of the United States during the next several days.
