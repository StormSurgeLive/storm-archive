Hurricane Humberto Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
500 PM AST Sat Sep 27 2025

Humberto has quickly strengthened during the past several hours. A 
very symmetric ring of cloud tops colder than -70 deg C now 
surrounds the clear eye of the hurricane. At 1800 UTC, the TAFB 
subjective Dvorak analysis was 7.0/140 kt. Most of the objective 
techniques like the UW-CIMSS ADT and AIDT, as well as the SAB 
subjective Dvorak fix supported a slightly lower intensity, closer 
to 130 kt.  However, since that time, cloud tops around Humberto 
have gotten colder and the objective estimates have increased. 
Therefore, the intensity has been set at 140 kt, making Humberto the 
second category 5 hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season.

Some additional strengthening is possible tonight. Internal factors 
like eyewall replacement cycles will likely dominate Humberto's 
intensity for the next day or two, so fluctuations in maximum wind 
speeds are expected. All of the intensity guidance indicates that 
some slow weakening is expected to begin by Monday, before Humberto 
begins to interact with a mid-latitude trough on Tuesday. The 
cyclone should then begin its extratropical transition shortly 
thereafter, resulting in a quicker decrease in maximum winds but an 
expansion of the overall wind field. Overall, little change was 
needed to the official forecast aside from showing a higher 
intensity for the first day or two. 

Only a slight westward adjustment was made to the track forecast. 
Humberto is moving slightly faster, but westward, near 9 kt. The 
hurricane is still forecast to move around the subtropical ridge for 
the next few days before it interacts with the aforementioned trough 
and accelerates quickly northeastward. The spread in the model track 
guidance has increased since the last advisory, particularly with 
regard to how fast Humberto will accelerate northeastward in 4 or 5 
days. Confidence in that aspect of the forecast has therefore 
decreased, even though little change was made to the official 
forecast. The NHC forecast remains generally based on a blend of the 
GDMI, the AIGEFS and HCCA.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Nine was 
located near latitude 22.2 North, longitude 76.5 West. The 
depression is moving toward the northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h). A 
north-northwestward motion is expected to begin tonight and continue 
through Monday. On the forecast track, the center of the system is 
expected to move across the central and northwestern Bahamas on 
Sunday and Sunday night and approach the southeast U.S. coast early 
next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is expected during the next few days, and the system
is forecast to become a tropical storm tonight or early Sunday and 
a hurricane by late Monday or Tuesday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Nine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the central Bahamas 
beginning tonight or early Sunday and in the northwestern Bahamas on 
Sunday. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area 
along the east coast of Florida on Monday.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Nine is expected to produce additional 
rainfall of 4 to 8 across eastern Cuba and the Bahamas. Across 
Hispaniola, Jamaica, and portions of central and southern Cuba, an 
additional 1 to 3 inches of rain is expected. This rainfall will 
likely produce flash and urban flooding. Mudslides are also possible 
in areas of higher terrain across eastern Cuba.

By early next week, moisture from Tropical Depression Nine is 
expected to bring a threat of heavy rainfall from the east coast of 
Florida northward into the eastern Carolinas. Rainfall amounts of 3 
to 6 inches are possible, with localized totals of 10 inches across 
portions of the coastal Carolinas. This rainfall could result in 
flash, urban, and river flooding. Changes in the forecast track 
could result in adjustments to these rainfall totals. 
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with the system, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds in the northwestern Bahamas. Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by this system and Hurricane Humberto will
affect portions of the Bahamas this weekend, and spread to portions
of the southeast U.S. coast early next week. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ripCurrents
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM EDT.

Tropical Depression Nine Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
500 PM EDT Sat Sep 27 2025
 
The organization of the depression has not changed much since this 
morning. Some deep convection has flared up this afternoon near the 
estimated center, which appears broad in the 850-mb flight-level 
wind data from the Air Force Hurricane Hunters. The earlier 
scatterometer winds and more recent aircraft data do not suggest the 
system has intensified. The initial intensity is held at 30 kt for 
this advisory.

The center appears to be slightly south and west of previous 
estimates, with an uncertain initial motion of 315/4 kt. Over the 
next couple of days, the system should turn more north-northwestward 
within the flow between an upper trough over the southeast U.S. and 
a subtropical ridge over the Atlantic. This forecast brings the 
depression over the central and northwestern Bahamas through early 
Monday, then toward the southeast U.S. coast by Tuesday. The NHC 
track forecast is very similar to the previous one, with only a 
slight nudge westward based on the initial position adjustments 
during the day. Warm waters and strong upper-level divergence should 
promote strengthening during the next few days, but this could be 
tempered by moderate southerly shear over the system from an 
upper-level trough. The NHC intensity forecast shows steady 
strengthening through early next week, with the system becoming a 
hurricane by 60 h. This prediction lies close to the latest IVCN and 
HCCA aids. 

There is still above-average uncertainty in the details of the 
long-range forecast. In general, the models agree that the presence 
of Hurricane Humberto to the east will result in a weakening of the 
prevailing steering currents, causing the system to slow down and 
meander near the southeast U.S. coast on Tuesday. While the chances 
of a landfall appear lower than yesterday, there are still some 
hurricane regional models and ensemble solutions that show this 
possibility. Given the expected asymmetric storm structure, a risk 
of significant heavy rainfall, storm surge, and wind impacts exists 
for the southeast U.S. coast even if the storm center remains 
offshore. The increased track spread at 96-120 h is related to 
whether the system feels the effects of an amplifying upper-level 
trough behind Humberto over the western Atlantic. While many global 
models show a sharp eastward turn and acceleration away from land, 
the system fails to be captured by the trough in the 12z ECMWF and 
lingers offshore. The NHC track forecast at days 4-5 maintains a 
consensus approach and shows a slower eastward motion, but future 
track adjustments are likely as confidence increases. The system may 
be in close proximity to fronts by the end of the period, so 
extratropical transition could begin around or shortly after day 5.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The depression is expected to strengthen and bring tropical storm
conditions to portions of the central and northwestern Bahamas
through Sunday night. Tropical storm conditions are also possible
along portions of the east coast of central Florida beginning
Monday, where a Tropical Storm Watch is in effect.
 
2. Rainfall will continue to impact eastern Cuba, Hispaniola, 
Jamaica, and the Bahamas through the weekend, which will likely 
produce flash and urban flooding. Mudslides are possible in the 
higher terrain. 
 
3. There is a significant threat of heavy rainfall early next week 
from portions of the east coast of Florida northward into the 
Carolinas, which could cause flash, urban, and river flooding. 
 
4. The depression is expected to be at or near hurricane intensity 
when it is closest to the southeast U.S. coast early next week, 
where there is a risk of storm surge and wind impacts. Although it 
is too soon to specify the exact location and magnitude of impacts, 
residents should closely monitor the latest forecast updates and 
ensure that they have their hurricane plan in place.
