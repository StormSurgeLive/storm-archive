WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Gusty winds are possible in Bermuda Tuesday and Wednesday in outer
rainbands. Interests in Bermuda should continue to follow the
latest forecasts for both Humberto and Imelda.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Humberto was
located near latitude 30.1 North, longitude 68.5 West. Humberto is
moving toward the north-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). A turn to
the north is expected on Tuesday, followed by a much faster
northeast or east-northeast motion on Wednesday and Thursday. On the
forecast track, the center of Humberto will pass west, and then
north of Bermuda on Tuesday and Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Humberto is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Although weakening is forecast, Humberto
is expected to become a strong extratropical system in a couple of
days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 65 miles (100 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220
miles (350 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 963 mb (28.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Humberto can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells from Humberto are likely to cause dangerous surf and
life-threatening rip current conditions, affecting beaches of the
northern Caribbean, Bahamas, Bermuda, and much of the east coast of
the United States over the next several days. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?ripCurrents
 
WIND: Gusty winds are possible over Bermuda within outer rainbands
Tuesday into Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Hurricane Humberto is expected to bring rainfall of 1 to
2 inches – 25 to 50 mm – to Bermuda tonight through Tuesday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Hurricane Humberto Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
1100 PM AST Mon Sep 29 2025
 
Northwesterly vertical wind shear is causing Humberto to lose
strength tonight.  Geostationary satellite and microwave images
indicate that the cloud pattern has become asymmetric with the
inner core now fragmented and located near the western edge of the
cloud mass.  The Air Force Hurricane Hunters have been investigating
the hurricane over the past few hours and have found that the
minimum pressure has increased to around 963 mb.  The aircraft data
also indicate that the maximum winds have lowered to around 100 kt.
 
Humberto is moving north-northwestward at 12 kt on the southwest
side of a subtropical ridge.  The hurricane should turn northward on
Tuesday as the ridge shifts east and weakens. On Wednesday, a mid-
to upper-level trough is expected to amplify over the north
Atlantic, causing Humberto to turn sharply to the northeast or
east-northeast and accelerate.  The models are in good agreement,
and no significant changes were made to the previous forecast.
This track takes the core of Humberto well west and then north of
Bermuda.
 
Continued steady weakening is expected as northwesterly vertical
wind shear and intrusions of dry air persist over the next day or
two.  By late Wednesday, Humberto is expected to merge with a mid-
to upper-level trough, and that should cause the system to develop
frontal features and complete extratropical transition.  Humberto is
expected to grow significantly in size as it becomes extratropical.
The large extratropical low in combination with Imelda will cause
rough marine conditions over a large portion of the western and
central Atlantic.  See Key Messages below for more information.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Humberto's outer rainbands could produce gusty winds and heavy
rainfall over Bermuda on Tuesday and Wednesday. Please follow
local updates from the Bermuda Weather Service for impacts from
both Humberto and Imelda.
 
2. Dangerous marine conditions, including high surf and
life-threatening rip currents, will continue to affect beaches of
the northern Caribbean, Bahamas, Bermuda, and much of the east coast
of the United States through the week.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Government of the Bahamas has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warning for the northwestern Bahamas.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Imelda was
located near latitude 28.4 North, longitude 77.2 West. Imelda is
moving toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h). A turn toward the 
northeast is expected later tonight followed by a turn toward the 
east-northeast at a faster forward speed on Tuesday. On the 
forecast track, the center of the system should move away from
the northwestern Bahamas tonight and away from the southeastern 
United States on Tuesday. The center should approach Bermuda on 
Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast over the next couple of days, and
Imelda is forecast to become a hurricane Tuesday or Tuesday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft data is 987 mb (29.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Imelda can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area by
Wednesday night, with tropical storm conditions possible by
Wednesday afternoon.
 
Wind gusts to tropical-storm force are possible over portions of
the extreme northwestern Bahamas during the next few hours.
 
RAINFALL:  Storm total rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches with local 
maxima of 4 inches are expected through tonight across coastal 
sections of southeast North Carolina. This rainfall could result in 
isolated flash and urban flooding.

As Imelda passes near Bermuda, 2 to 4 inches – 50 to 100 mm – of 
rainfall is expected from Wednesday into Thursday.
 
STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding is possible in areas of onshore
winds over the Southeastern U.S. coastline. The water could reach
the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas
if the surge occurs over the next several high tide cycles...
 
Volusia/Brevard County Line, Florida to the South Santee River,
South Carolina...1 to 2 ft
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Imelda and Hurricane
Humberto are affecting the Bahamas and are currently spreading to
much of the U.S. east coast. These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found

      <title>Tropical Storm Imelda Forecast Discussion Number 14</title>

Tropical Storm Imelda Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
1100 PM EDT Mon Sep 29 2025

Satellite imagery and reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft indicate that Imelda has lost some organization 
since the last advisory. The aircraft data shows a broad center 
with a radius of maximum winds of at least 35 n mi, and the 
satellite imagery currently shows no organized convection near the 
aircraft-reported center. In addition, satellite fixes from TAFB 
and SAB were well to the northeast of the aircraft position, 
suggesting the vortex has a significant vertical tilt. Despite 
the ragged structure, the aircraft-reported winds support keeping 
an initial intensity of 55 kt.

The initial motion is now 010/7 kt.  A turn toward the northeast is 
expected tonight, followed by a turn toward the east-northeast and 
a faster forward speed. This change is due partly to Hurricane 
Humberto eroding the steering influence of a subtropical ridge east 
of Bermuda, and partly due to a deep-layer trough that is digging 
southward to the north and northwest of Imelda. The track guidance 
overall is a bit slower than earlier, and based on this the new 
forecast track is a little slower than the previous track. The new
forecast track indicates that tropical storm conditions are 
expected to begin on the island of Bermuda in 36-48 h.

Imelda is currently in an upper-level wind environment that has 
moderate shear, but is strongly divergent, and this is forecast to 
continue for the next 36-48 h. This should allow some 
strengthening. However, the current state of the storm is not 
conducive, and thus the new intensity forecast calls for slower 
strengthening than the previous forecast.  In 48-60 h, the shear 
increases, and interaction with the deep-layer trough will likely 
start the extratropical transition process.  This should be complete 
by 72 h.  While there may be "sting jet" winds during the transition 
as mentioned in the previous discussion, the guidance is in good 
agreement that the system should steadily decay after the transition 
is complete.  Overall, the new intensity forecast is a little weaker 
compared to the previous forecast.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Imelda is expected to intensify into a hurricane Tuesday or 
Tuesday night with the cyclone approaching Bermuda during the day 
Wednesday as a hurricane. A Hurricane Watch is in effect for the 
island of Bermuda due to the expected onset of tropical storm 
conditions beginning Wednesday afternoon.
 
2. Locally heavy rainfall across coastal sections of southeast 
North Carolina could cause isolated flash and urban flooding 
through tonight. As Imelda passes near Bermuda, 2 to 4 inches – 50 
to 100 mm – of rainfall is expected from Wednesday into Thursday.
 
3. Swells and high surf from both Humberto and Imelda are expected
to produce dangerous marine conditions and rip currents along much
of the East Coast of the United States during the next several days.
