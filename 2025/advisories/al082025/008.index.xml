An area of low pressure <br />is expected to form along the wave by tonight when it moves near the <br />southeast Bahamas.  This low is expected to become a tropical <br />depression when it is in the vicinity of the central and northwest <br />Bahamas over the weekend, and then track northwestward or northward <br />over the southwestern Atlantic.  <br /><br />Regardless of development, heavy rains and gusty winds are ongoing <br />in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and the Turks and Caicos Islands, <br />and are likely to spread across the Bahamas and eastern Cuba during <br />the next day or two. Interests in all of these areas should monitor <br />the progress of the system. While there remains considerable <br />uncertainty in the long-range track and intensity of the system, <br />there is a significant risk of wind, rainfall, and storm surge <br />impacts for a portion of the southeast U.S. coast early next week. <br />Interests in this area should also monitor the progress of the <br />system. <br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br />* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br /><br />$$<br />Forecaster Cangialosi]]>

SUMMARY OF 300 PM GMT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...40.0N 22.8W
ABOUT 245 MI...395 KM ENE OF LAJES AIR BASE IN THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 65 DEGREES AT 31 MPH...50 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...992 MB...29.30 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Gabrielle was located near latitude 40.0 North, longitude 22.8 West.
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east-northeast near
31 mph (50 km/h). A turn toward the east with a decrease in forward 
speed is expected through Saturday, followed by a turn toward the 
southeast and south through early next week. On the forecast track, 
the center of post-tropical Gabrielle will continue moving away from 
the Azores today, then approach the coast of Portugal by early 
Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast through tonight, with 
weakening expected over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Gusty winds across the central and southeastern Azores will
continue to diminish this afternoon.
 
RAINFALL: Gabrielle is expected to produce less than an inch, or 25
mm, of additional rainfall across the Azores today. Any flooding
caused by Gabrielle across the terrain of the central Azores should
subside today.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Gabrielle will affect the Azores through
the weekend and will reach the coasts of Portugal, northwestern
Spain, and northern Morocco on Saturday. These swells are expected
to produce life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products issued by your local weather office.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Gabrielle Discussion Number  39
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
300 PM GMT Fri Sep 26 2025

Gabrielle is a storm-force extratropical cyclone with frontal 
boundaries that extend east-northeastward and southwestward from the 
cyclone.  The center continues moving away from the Azores, and 
winds have dropped below gale-force across the islands.  Recent 
ASCAT passes missed the center, but winds up to 43 kt were measured 
by the instrument well away from the center in the southeast 
quadrant.  Global models show 10-meter winds up to 55 kt in their 
fields at the current time, so the initial intensity will be held 
at 55 kt.  

Some intensification is possible this evening, and the 06Z GFS model 
indicates a sting jet could briefly cause winds up to 70-75 kt in 
the western semicircle in about 6 h from now.  The NHC forecast  
brings Gabrielle to 60 kt in 12 h, but doesn't necessarily account 
for brief stronger winds that could occur between the current time 
and the 12 h point.  Global models are in good agreement on steady 
weakening after hour 12, and the NHC intensity forecast is based on 
a blend of the GFS and ECMWF.  It's possible that gale force winds 
near 35 kt, with higher gusts, could affect portions of the west 
coast of Portugal around early Sunday.

The current motion is quickly east-northeastward, or 065/27 kt.  A 
turn toward the east along with a decrease in forward speed is 
expected in 12-24 h.  After that, the cyclone is expected to turn
southeastward as it approaches the coast of Portugal.  This should 
be followed by an even slower southeastward to southward motion 
while Gabrielle decays and eventually dissipates near southern 
Portugal and northern Morocco.  The forecast track has been shifted 
slightly to the northeast, or left, of the previous NHC track, 
closer to the latest simple and corrected consensus models.
 
This is the final advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center 
on Gabrielle.  Future information on marine impacts can be found in 
High Seas Forecasts issued by Meteo France under WMO header FQNT50 
LFPW and available on the web at 
https://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/raw/fq/fqnt50.lfpw..txt.  Future 
information on potential land-based impacts in Portugal can be found 
in products issued by the Portugal Meteorological Institute at 
https://www.ipma.pt/en/index.html

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Winds across the Azores will continue to subside this afternoon.
 
2.  Any flooding caused by Gabrielle across the high terrain of the
central Azores should subside this afternoon.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Humberto was 
located near latitude 22.3 North, longitude 57.7 West. Humberto is 
moving toward the northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h).   A 
west-northwestward to northwestward motion with a gradual increase 
in forward speed is expected during the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 90 mph (150 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Significant strengthening is expected over the 
next couple of days, and Humberto is forecast to become a major 
hurricane later today or on Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles
(165 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Humberto will begin affecting portions of
the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and
Bermuda this weekend. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Humberto Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
500 AM AST Fri Sep 26 2025
 
Humberto has become better organized during the past several hours.
Conventional satellite imagery has shown a growing central dense
overcast, with hints of an eye-like feature near the center.
Microwave imagery revealed a well-defined rain band wrapping around
a vertically-aligned vortex, suggesting the developing of an
eyewall.  Satellite classifications have risen notably on this
cycle and the initial intensity is set to 65 kt, closest to the
TAFB Dvorak and SATCON estimates.
 
The hurricane is drifting slowly in weak steering currents with an 
estimated motion of 320/3 kt.  Model guidance is in relatively good 
agreement, showing Humberto gradually increasing speed while moving 
west-northward to northwestward along the southern side of a 
subtropical ridge during the next few days.  By early next week, the 
hurricane is expected to turn northward around the westward 
periphery of the high and begin accelerating northeastward.  Only 
minor adjustments have been made to the latest official track 
forecast.

Humberto is showing signs of steady-to-rapid intensification.  The 
hurricane is over warm waters and seems to be experiencing less 
vertical wind shear than the global models are currently suggesting. 
Statistical rapid intensity indicators, such as DTOPS, are showing 
elevated probabilities of a 25 to 30 kt increase in the next 24 
hours.  Given these probabilities and the recent increase in initial 
intensity, the NHC intensity forecast has been increased, 
particularly in the near-term forecast, and lies above most of the 
guidance.  By the middle of the forecast period, it is closer the 
the corrected consensus aid, HCCA, and still shows Humberto becoming 
a major hurricane this weekend.
