Hurricane Humberto Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
500 PM AST Fri Sep 26 2025

Satellite data indicate Humberto has strengthened into the third 
major hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. The eye of 
the hurricane has cleared out this afternoon and is surrounded by a 
ring of deep, cold convective cloud tops. Based on these 
developments, the latest subjective Dvorak classifications and 
objective intensity estimates have risen to 90-102 kt. The initial 
intensity of Humberto is set at 100 kt for this advisory. NOAA buoy 
41044, located about 50 n mi southwest of the center, has reported 
falling pressures and tropical-storm-force gusts this afternoon.

Humberto remains in a low shear environment over very warm 
sea-surface temperatures, and its well-defined inner core structure 
appears conducive to further intensification unless an eyewall 
replacement cycle occurs. The latest intensity guidance favors 
continued strengthening, and this is reflected in the updated NHC 
forecast. There are differences noted in the upper-air pattern of 
the global models later in the period, likely related to the 
evolution and future path of Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine. But in 
general, increasing deep-layer shear over the hurricane should 
induce at least gradual weakening by early next week. Although the 
peak winds are forecast to decrease, the wind field is expected to 
expand as Humberto gains latitude and curves around Bermuda at days 
3-5. 
 
The hurricane is moving slowly northwestward (295/4 kt). A slow 
westward to west-northwestward motion should continue through the 
next day or so, followed by a turn toward the northwest later this 
weekend with a gradual increase in forward speed as a subtropical 
ridge slides eastward over the central Atlantic. A slight southward 
adjustment was made to the near-term NHC track forecast based on 
today's trends, but otherwise this portion of the forecast is 
similar to the previous one. Later in the period, the models are 
fairly consistent on a sharp recurvature of the hurricane between 
the ridge and an upper trough digging over the northwestern 
Atlantic, though there are larger along-track speed differences 
noted. This part of the forecast generally lies between the 
multi-model consensus aids and the Google DeepMind solution.

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine can be found in
the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and
WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the central Bahamas
beginning Saturday night or early Sunday and are possible in
portions of the northwestern Bahamas on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: The disturbance is expected to produce the following storm 
total rainfall amounts through Monday morning.

Eastern Cuba: 8 to 12 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 16 
inches possible. 

Bahamas: 4 to 8 inches are expected. 

Hispaniola, Jamaica, and portions of central and southern Cuba: 2 to 
4 inches of additional rainfall are expected. 

This rainfall will likely produce flash and urban flooding. 
Mudslides are also possible in areas of higher terrain across 
eastern Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica. 

An increasing threat of heavy rainfall from this system is forecast 
over the southern Mid-Atlantic through coastal Georgia which could 
cause flash, urban, and river flooding into next week. 

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine, please see the 
National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds in the northwestern Bahamas. Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by both this system and Hurricane Humberto
will affect portions of the Bahamas this weekend, and spread to
portions of the southeast U.S. coast early next week.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found

Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
1100 PM EDT Fri Sep 26 2025
 
Many thanks to the crew of a NOAA P-3 Hurricane Hunter aircraft,
which has been flying a surveillance mission in the disturbance this
evening.  Dropsonde data from this flight, as well as surface
observations from Cuba, suggest that the system is still a trough
of low pressure, and the trough axis is a little farther west than
previously estimated.  Maximum winds remain near 30 kt, and the
pressure has dropped slightly to 1007 mb based on the dropsonde
data.
 
The current motion is now estimated to be northwestward, or 305/8 
kt.  The system is expected to slow down and turn 
north-northwestward by Saturday morning and continue that trajectory 
over the weekend, embedded in the southerly flow between a 
deep-layer trough over the southeastern U.S. and a ridge over the 
west-central Atlantic.  The track models are in good agreement for 
the first 3 days of the forecast.  The new NHC forecast track has 
been shifted westward during that period, mainly due to the 
westward adjustment of the initial position, but it is also a bit 
slower than the previous prediction based on the latest guidance.  
There is significantly more uncertainty in the track forecast after 
day 3, but at the very least it appears that the system will slow 
down considerably and perhaps even stall near the coast of South 
Carolina.  Interestingly, the 18z GFS and ECMWF solutions no longer 
show the system moving inland over the southeastern U.S. and have 
come more in line with their respective ensemble means, as well as 
the HCCA consensus aid and Google DeepMind mean.  For this new 
forecast, a very slow, nearly stationary motion is shown on day 5, 
with perhaps some hint of the start of a northeastward motion.  
That said, even if the system stalls just offshore, it would still 
be large enough to cause wind and coastal flooding impacts along 
the southeastern U.S. coast, as well as heavy rainfall/flooding 
concerns in inland areas.
 
Global models suggest it will still take another 24 hours or so for 
the system to develop a well-defined circulation and organized 
convection to be classified as a tropical depression.  After that 
time, strengthening is expected while the system moves over very 
warm waters and within a divergent upper-level environment.  The 
NHC forecast continues to show the system reaching hurricane 
strength in 3-4 days, which is close to the HCCA and IVCN consensus 
aids.  Stronger shear, and possibly the beginnings of an 
interaction with a nearby frontal boundary, could cause some 
weakening by day 5. 

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The disturbance is forecast to become a tropical storm this
weekend and bring tropical storm conditions to portions of the
central and northwestern Bahamas, where Tropical Storm Warnings and
Watches, respectively, are in effect. Rainfall associated with
this system will impact eastern Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the
Bahamas through the weekend.
 
2.  There is an increasing threat of heavy rainfall early next
week from coastal Georgia through the Carolinas and into the
southern Mid-Atlantic states, which could cause flash, urban, and
river flooding.
 
3. The system is expected to be at or near hurricane intensity
when it approaches the southeast U.S. coast early next week, where
there is a risk of storm surge and wind impacts. Residents in that
area should monitor updates to the forecast and ensure they have
their hurricane plan in place.
