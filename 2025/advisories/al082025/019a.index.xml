DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Humberto was 
located located by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
near latitude 27.5 North, longitude 67.3 West. Humberto is moving 
toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). A gradual turn towards 
the north is expected over the next day or so. The hurricane is then 
forecast to turn and accelerate east-northeastward by late Tuesday 
or early Wednesday. On the forecast track, the center of Humberto 
will pass west, and then north of Bermuda on Tuesday and Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 145 mph (230 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Humberto is a category 4 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Fluctuations in intensity are 
possible today. Gradual weakening is forecast after that, but 
Humberto is expected to remain a dangerous major hurricane into 
Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185
miles (295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 938 mb (27.70 inches) 
based on Air Force Reserve reconnaissance dropsonde data.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Humberto can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Humberto will continue to affect portions
of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
and Bermuda through much of this week. Swells from Humberto will
also affect the U.S. East Coast beginning today. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?ripCurrents
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning
Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL: Hurricane Humberto is expected to bring rainfall of 1 to
2 inches, or 25 to 50 mm, to Bermuda tonight through Tuesday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Humberto Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
500 AM AST Mon Sep 29 2025

Humberto has gone through some inner-core structural changes. 
Earlier aircraft data indicated that the hurricane had a double 
eyewall structure, but a 29/0546 UTC AMSR2 microwave pass indicates 
that the inner eyewall is starting to get overtaken by the outer 
eyewall.  Given the the apparent continued weakening of the inner 
eyewall as inferred from GOES-19 imagery since the time of the 
microwave pass, Humberto's maximum sustained winds are probably near 
the lower end of the recent objective and subjective estimates, so 
the initial intensity is nudged downward slightly to 115 kt.  
Another Air Force plane will be in Humberto in a few hours to better 
assess the intensity.
 
Humberto is still moving northwestward, or 320 degrees at 12 kt in 
the flow on the south-southwest side of a subtropical high.  The 
major hurricane is expected to gradually turn to the north over the 
next 24 hours as the high shifts to the east and weakens.  After 
that, a trough is expected to amplify over the north Atlantic, and 
that should cause Humberto to turn sharply and accelerate 
east-northeastward Tuesday night and Wednesday.  The NHC forecast is 
similar to the previous one through 24 h, but then has been shifted 
slightly to the northwest, or left, of the previous forecast after 
that time, close to the latest model consensus.  Confidence in the 
track forecast is high through 48 h.  While there is high confidence 
that the core of Humberto will miss Bermuda, there is a possibility 
of tropical-storm-force winds occurring there late Tuesday and 
Wednesday in Humberto's outer bands.
 
The intensity of Humberto will likely fluctuate over the next 12 h 
or so, but gradual weakening is expected after that due to 
increasing shear and decreasing SSTs.  Extratropical transition is 
expected to be complete in 60-72 hours when the system is forecast 
to merge with the aforementioned mid- to upper-level trough and 
develop frontal features.  The NHC intensity forecast is between the 
middle and higher end of the guidance envelope.  The hurricane is 
expected to grow in size as it gains latitude during the next few 
days, which will result in a large area of rough seas.  See Key 
Messages below for more information.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical-storm-force winds could begin to affect Bermuda by late
Tuesday, and a tropical storm watch is in effect for the island.
Interests there should continue to monitor the progress of Humberto.
 
2. Dangerous marine conditions, including high surf and 
life-threatening rip currents, are affecting beaches of the northern 
Caribbean, Bahamas, and Bermuda. The dangerous surf conditions are 
expected to begin affecting much of the east coast of the U.S. 
today.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Portions of the Northwestern Bahamas, including Eleuthera, the
Abacos, Grand Bahama Island and the surrounding keys.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area in this case within 12
hours.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Imelda.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Imelda was 
located by NOAA and Air Force Reconnaissance aircraft near latitude 
26.3 North, longitude 77.0 West. Imelda is moving toward the north 
near 9 mph (15 km/h), and a generally northward motion is expected 
to continue today. On Tuesday, Imelda is expected to turn sharply to 
the east-northeast. On the forecast track, the center of the system 
is expected to start moving away from the northwestern Bahamas today 
and then turn east-northeastward, moving away from the southeastern 
U.S. by the middle part of this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Gradual strengthening is forecast and Imelda could 
become a hurricane on Tuesday.  
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated by NOAA and Air Force 
Reconnaissance dropsonde data is 993 mb (29.33 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Imelda can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occuring in portions of
the northwestern Bahamas and should continue through today.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Imelda is expected to produce additional
rainfall of 2 to 4 inches across eastern Cuba and 4 to 8 inches
across the northwest Bahamas through Tuesday. This rainfall will
likely produce flash and urban flooding. Mudslides are also possible
in areas of higher terrain across eastern Cuba.
 
Storm total rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches with local maxima of 4
inches are expected through Tuesday across northeast Florida,
coastal South Carolina, and coastal sections of southeast North
Carolina. This rainfall could result in isolated flash and urban
flooding.
 
As Imelda passes near Bermuda, 2 to 4 inches -- 50 to 100 mm -- of
rainfall is expected from Wednesday into Thursday.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Imelda, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds in the northwestern Bahamas.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
Minor coastal flooding is possible in areas of onshore winds over
the Southeastern U.S. coastline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the surge occurs over the next several high tide cycles...
 
Volusia/Brevard County Line, Florida to the South Santee River,
South Carolina...1 to 2 ft
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Imelda and Hurricane
Humberto are affecting the Bahamas and will spread to much of the
east coast of the U.S. early this week. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ripCurrents
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

      <title>Tropical Storm Imelda Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Tropical Storm Imelda Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
500 AM EDT Mon Sep 29 2025

Imelda continues to slowly become better organized.  Earlier 
aircraft data indicated that the pressure has fallen to 996 mb, and 
satellite imagery shows persistent convection near and north of the 
center.  The initial intensity is set to 40 kt with numerous 35 kt 
wind vectors on the evening scatterometer pass and higher Dvorak 
estimates.  

The storm is progressing northward at about 7 kt.  This motion is 
forecast to continue today due to steering along the western side 
of the subtropical ridge.  Humberto is forecast to erode the ridge 
by Tuesday, causing an abrupt turn of Imelda to the east-northeast 
with some acceleration as the cyclone encounters faster mid- 
latitude flow.  There is increasing confidence in the storm staying 
well offshore of the southeastern United States coast.  The 
latest track guidance is similar to the previous cycle, although 
faster at the end, and remains close to Bermuda.  The medium range 
forecast beyond Bermuda is quite uncertain with a complicated flow 
pattern due to a digging north Atlantic trough and 
then-extratropical Humberto interactions.

Imelda is forecast to gradually strengthen within an environment of 
moderate south-southwesterly vertical wind shear, warm ocean waters 
and within a fairly moist mid-level air mass for the next couple of 
days.  Thereafter, an upper-level trough will help to initiate 
extratropical transition, and some of the models are showing this 
as a favorable trough interaction, causing a larger and stronger 
cyclone.  The GFS and ECMWF models are also showing a sting jet 
developing as well about the time that Imelda is near Bermuda, so 
that situation will have to be watched closely.  The official 
forecast remains at the higher end of the model guidance.  Most of 
the global models are showing a faster extratropical transition 
after Imelda moves past Bermuda, and that is indicated in the new 
NHC forecast.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Imelda is expected to continue to bring tropical storm conditions 
to portions of the northwestern Bahamas today.
 
2. Rainfall associated with Imelda will continue to impact eastern 
Cuba and the Bahamas through Tuesday, which will likely produce 
flash and urban flooding.  Mudslides are possible in the higher 
terrain.  Heavy rainfall across the coastal Carolinas could cause 
isolated flash and urban flooding through Tuesday.

3. Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Imelda as a
Hurricane Watch could be required late today.
 
4. Swells and high surf from both Humberto and Imelda are expected
to produce dangerous marine conditions and rip currents along the
east coast of Florida and the Georgia coast today.  These conditions 
are expected to spread northward along much of the east coast of the 
United States early this week.
