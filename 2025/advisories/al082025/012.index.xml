Hurricane Humberto Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
1100 AM AST Sat Sep 27 2025

Since the last advisory, Humberto's eye has once again become better 
defined and recent WSF-M microwave imagery at 1001 UTC did not 
indicate the presence of concentric eyewalls. Together, these data 
suggest Humberto completed its eyewall replacement cycle. Recent 
objective and subjective intensity estimates range from near 120 kt 
to just below 130 kt, so the initial intensity remains 125 kt. 

With the previous eyewall cycle completing, Humberto may resume 
strengthening today, and this is still indicated in the official 
forecast. Fluctuations in intensity, up or down, will be possible 
with with any additional eyewall replacement cycles, and the 
predictability of the specific timing of such events is quite low, 
even as the SHIPS secondary eyewall prediction indicates a 2 in 3 
chance that another one will occur in the next two days. With the 
environment otherwise expected to be favorable for strengthening, 
the NHC forecast continues to show strengthening and maintains 
Humberto at or above its current strength through the weekend. Next 
week, Humberto should begin to interact with a mid-latitude trough 
and undergo a transformation resulting in a significant expansion of 
its surface wind field and eventual extratropical transition. While 
Humberto's peak winds should decrease as a result, the spread of its 
impacts will likely increase as the cyclone grows in size.
 
The hurricane has accelerated a little, with a forward speed now 
near 7 kt. Humberto will move around the subtropical ridge for the 
next few days and then accelerate northeastward as it interacts with 
the aforementioned mid-latitude trough. The official forecast is 
very similar to the previous one, but with a slightly faster 
forward speed. The NHC forecast remains closest to a blend of the 
Google DeepMind and NOAA AIGEFS ensemble means, and the previous 
official forecast.

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine can be found in
the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and
WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the central Bahamas
beginning tonight or early Sunday and in the northwestern Bahamas 
on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: The disturbance is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 
8 to 12 inches with isolated maximum totals of 16 inches possible 
in eastern Cuba, and 4 to 8 inches of rain in the Bahamas. This 
rainfall will likely produce flash and urban flooding. Mudslides 
are also possible in areas of higher terrain across eastern Cuba, 
Hispaniola, and Jamaica.
 
Moisture from the disturbance will lead to a threat of heavy 
rainfall well to the north across portions of the Southeast U.S. and 
Virginia into early next week which could cause flash, urban, and 
river flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with the system, please see the National Weather Service 
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds in the northwestern Bahamas. Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by both this system and Hurricane Humberto 
will affect portions of the Bahamas this weekend, and spread to 
portions of the southeast U.S. coast early next week. These swells 
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ripCurrents

Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
500 AM EDT Sat Sep 27 2025

Satellite imagery this morning shows an increase in vorticity at 
the western edge of a convective cluster located near the Ragged 
Islands in the Bahamas. However, this has not reached the stage 
where it could be called a well-defined center of circulation.  
Based on this, the system is continued as a potential tropical 
cyclone with maximum winds near 30 kt.

The initial motion is a somewhat uncertain 315/6 kt.  Later today, 
the system should turn north-northwestward between the subtropical 
ridge over the Atlantic and a deep-layer trough over the 
southeastern United States.  The track models are in good 
agreement during this part of the system's life, and this portion 
of the new forecast track is almost the same as the previous track. 
After 72 h, the guidance continues to be quite divergent. Most of 
the deterministic and consensus models now show a turn toward the 
east caused by Hurricane Humberto passing to the east of the system 
and breaking down the ridge. However, the HMON and HAFS-A models 
still show landfall in the southeastern United States, as do several 
ECMWF and GFS ensemble members. Given the current guidance and the 
trends, the new forecast track calls for a slow turn to the 
northeast and east after 72 h, but at a much slower forward speed 
than most of the guidance. It should be noted that while this 
forecast keeps the system offshore, it would still be large enough 
and close enough to cause wind and coastal flooding impacts along
the southeastern U.S. coast, as well as heavy rainfall/flooding
concerns in inland areas.

Based on current trends in the satellite imagery and the global 
models, the disturbance will likely take another 12-18 h to become 
a tropical cyclone. After that happens, strengthening is expected 
through 72 h as the system moves through an upper-level wind 
environment of moderate shear and strong divergence. The intensity 
forecast continues to show the system reaching hurricane strength 
in 3-4 days, which is in agreement with the intensity consensus. 
Some weakening is expected by 120 h due to shear and possible 
interaction with a frontal system approaching from the northwest.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The disturbance is forecast to become a tropical storm this
weekend and bring tropical storm conditions to portions of the
central and northwestern Bahamas, where Tropical Storm Warnings are 
in effect.

2. Rainfall associated with this system is expected to impact 
eastern Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Bahamas through the 
weekend, which will likely produce flash and urban flooding.  
Mudslides are possible in the higher terrain. 
 
3.  There is an increasing threat of heavy rainfall early next
week from coastal Georgia through the Carolinas and into the
southern Mid-Atlantic states, which could cause flash, urban, and
river flooding.
 
4. The system is expected to be at or near hurricane intensity
when it approaches the southeast U.S. coast early next week, where
there is a risk of storm surge and wind impacts. Residents in that
area should monitor updates to the forecast and ensure they have
their hurricane plan in place.
