This system is producing a large area of disorganized <br />showers and thunderstorms, and gusty winds. Gradual development of <br />this system is expected, and it will likely become a tropical <br />depression during the next day or so while it moves northwestward or <br />northward across the central and northwestern Bahamas.  <br /><br />Regardless of development, heavy rains and gusty winds are ongoing <br />in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the <br />southeastern Bahamas and eastern Cuba, and are likely to spread <br />across the remainder of the Bahamas over the weekend. Interests in <br />all of these areas should monitor the progress of the system.  <br />Tropical storm watches or warnings could be required for portions of <br />the Bahamas and advisories on a potential tropical cyclone could be <br />issued as early as later today. While there remains considerable <br />uncertainty in the long-range track and intensity of the system, <br />there is a significant risk of wind, rainfall, and storm surge <br />impacts for a portion of the southeast U.S. coast early next week. <br />Interests in this area should also monitor the progress of the <br />system. <br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br />* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br /><br />$$<br />Forecaster Cangialosi/Reinhart/Hagen]]>

SUMMARY OF 300 PM GMT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...40.0N 22.8W
ABOUT 245 MI...395 KM ENE OF LAJES AIR BASE IN THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 65 DEGREES AT 31 MPH...50 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...992 MB...29.30 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Gabrielle was located near latitude 40.0 North, longitude 22.8 West.
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east-northeast near
31 mph (50 km/h). A turn toward the east with a decrease in forward 
speed is expected through Saturday, followed by a turn toward the 
southeast and south through early next week. On the forecast track, 
the center of post-tropical Gabrielle will continue moving away from 
the Azores today, then approach the coast of Portugal by early 
Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast through tonight, with 
weakening expected over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Gusty winds across the central and southeastern Azores will
continue to diminish this afternoon.
 
RAINFALL: Gabrielle is expected to produce less than an inch, or 25
mm, of additional rainfall across the Azores today. Any flooding
caused by Gabrielle across the terrain of the central Azores should
subside today.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Gabrielle will affect the Azores through
the weekend and will reach the coasts of Portugal, northwestern
Spain, and northern Morocco on Saturday. These swells are expected
to produce life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products issued by your local weather office.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Gabrielle Discussion Number  39
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072025
300 PM GMT Fri Sep 26 2025

Gabrielle is a storm-force extratropical cyclone with frontal 
boundaries that extend east-northeastward and southwestward from the 
cyclone.  The center continues moving away from the Azores, and 
winds have dropped below gale-force across the islands.  Recent 
ASCAT passes missed the center, but winds up to 43 kt were measured 
by the instrument well away from the center in the southeast 
quadrant.  Global models show 10-meter winds up to 55 kt in their 
fields at the current time, so the initial intensity will be held 
at 55 kt.  

Some intensification is possible this evening, and the 06Z GFS model 
indicates a sting jet could briefly cause winds up to 70-75 kt in 
the western semicircle in about 6 h from now.  The NHC forecast  
brings Gabrielle to 60 kt in 12 h, but doesn't necessarily account 
for brief stronger winds that could occur between the current time 
and the 12 h point.  Global models are in good agreement on steady 
weakening after hour 12, and the NHC intensity forecast is based on 
a blend of the GFS and ECMWF.  It's possible that gale force winds 
near 35 kt, with higher gusts, could affect portions of the west 
coast of Portugal around early Sunday.

The current motion is quickly east-northeastward, or 065/27 kt.  A 
turn toward the east along with a decrease in forward speed is 
expected in 12-24 h.  After that, the cyclone is expected to turn
southeastward as it approaches the coast of Portugal.  This should 
be followed by an even slower southeastward to southward motion 
while Gabrielle decays and eventually dissipates near southern 
Portugal and northern Morocco.  The forecast track has been shifted 
slightly to the northeast, or left, of the previous NHC track, 
closer to the latest simple and corrected consensus models.
 
This is the final advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center 
on Gabrielle.  Future information on marine impacts can be found in 
High Seas Forecasts issued by Meteo France under WMO header FQNT50 
LFPW and available on the web at 
https://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/raw/fq/fqnt50.lfpw..txt.  Future 
information on potential land-based impacts in Portugal can be found 
in products issued by the Portugal Meteorological Institute at 
https://www.ipma.pt/en/index.html

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Winds across the Azores will continue to subside this afternoon.
 
2.  Any flooding caused by Gabrielle across the high terrain of the
central Azores should subside this afternoon.

...HUMBERTO RAPIDLY STRENGTHENS TO A MAJOR HURRICANE...
...FURTHER INTENSIFICATION EXPECTED OVER THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...22.3N 58.1W
ABOUT 430 MI...690 KM NE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...115 MPH...185 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...962 MB...28.41 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Humberto was 
located near latitude 22.3 North, longitude 58.1 West. Humberto is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h). A 
west-northwestward to northwestward motion at a slightly faster 
forward speed is forecast through the weekend, followed by a turn 
toward the north-northwest on Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 115 mph (185 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Humberto is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Additional strengthening is 
forecast over the next couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles 
(165 km). NOAA buoy 41044 located to the southwest of Humberto 
recently reported a sustained wind of 36 mph (57 km/h) and a gust of 
49 mph (80 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 962 mb (28.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Humberto will begin affecting portions of
the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and
Bermuda this weekend. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Humberto Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
1100 AM AST Fri Sep 26 2025
 
Humberto continues to rapidly strengthen this morning. Infrared 
satellite images show a ring of deep, cold inner core convection 
wrapping around an eye that has recently emerged in conventional 
satellite imagery. Objective satellite intensity estimates are 
quickly climbing, and the initial intensity is raised to 80 kt for 
this advisory, in best agreement with recent UW-CIMSS ADT and AiDT 
estimates. A recent ASCAT-B pass over the hurricane was used to
update the 34- and 50-kt wind radii of Humberto.
 
The rapidly improving satellite structure, along with conducive
environmental and oceanic conditions, suggest that significant to
rapid intensification (RI) is likely to continue in the short term.
In fact, the latest DTOPS guidance shows a greater than 80 percent
chance of Humberto strengthening by 30 kt in the next 24 h. Thus,
rapid intensification is explicitly forecast here, and the NHC
intensity forecast has been raised during the first 48-72 h of the
forecast period. This forecast most closely follows the regional
hurricane models and the HFIP corrected consensus (HCCA), on the
higher end of the guidance envelope. By early next week, there are
indications that deep-layer shear will increase over Humberto, and
some weakening is shown beyond 72 h. Note that as Humberto gains
latitude, the wind field is forecast to expand while the hurricane
curves around Bermuda at days 4-5.
 
The hurricane is moving slowly northwestward at about 4 kt.
Humberto should move toward the west-northwest and northwest during
the next couple of days along the southern periphery of a
subtropical ridge over the western and central Atlantic. As this
ridge slides eastward, the hurricane is forecast to recurve around
this feature, turning northward and then accelerating northeastward
early next week. The models are in very good agreement on this
sharp recurvature over the western Atlantic, and only minor
adjustments were made to the latest NHC track forecast.
