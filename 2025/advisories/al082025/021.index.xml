with a Hurricane Watch due to the forecast for Imelda.
 
Interests in Bermuda should continue to follow the latest forecast 
for both Humberto and Imelda.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor 
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Humberto was
located near latitude 29.1 North, longitude 68.1 West. Humberto is
moving toward the north-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). A gradual
turn towards the north is expected over the next day or so. The
hurricane is then forecast to turn and accelerate east-northeastward
by late Tuesday or early Wednesday. On the forecast track, the
center of Humberto will pass west, and then north of Bermuda on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 140 mph (220 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Humberto is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Weakening is forecast over the next several 
days, although Humberto is expected to remain a dangerous major 
hurricane into Tuesday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185
miles (295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 942 mb (27.82 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Humberto can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells from Humberto are likely to cause dangerous surf and
life-threatening rip current conditions, affecting beaches of the
northern Caribbean, Bahamas, Bermuda, and much of the east coast of
the United States over the next several days. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?ripCurrents
 
WIND: Gusty winds are possible over Bermuda within outer rainbands 
Tuesday into Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Hurricane Humberto is expected to bring rainfall of 1 to
2 inches – 25 to 50 mm – to Bermuda tonight through Tuesday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Humberto Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082025
500 PM AST Mon Sep 29 2025
 
After some brief re-intensification this morning, satellite imagery 
depicts that Humberto has started to feel the impacts of wind shear. 
The ring of deep convection has become a little more broken on 
infrared imagery, particularly on the western side of the system. 
Earlier Hurricane Hunter aircraft data depicted that the eyewall was 
open on the southwest side, and recent microwave imagery shows that 
the eyewall may be completely open on the western side. As the 
previous aircraft was departing, the pressure had come up a couple 
millibars which also suggests the system may have begun to weaken, 
and thus that trend is followed in this advisory.  Using the latest 
satellite trends, and a combination of intensity estimates with 
previous aircraft data, the intensity is lowered to 120 kt for this 
advisory. Another Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 
scheduled to investigate the system late this evening to help 
evaluate the intensity and structure of the system.
 
Humberto is moving north-northwestward at an estimated motion of 
330/11 kt. The system should continue to round the western 
periphery of the mid-level ridge and gradually turn to the north 
then northeast over the next day or so. A trough moving into the 
northern Atlantic will then pick up the system, and cause Humberto 
to accelerate to the northeast to east-northeast over the next 
several days. There is slightly more along-track spread with the 
forward speed towards the end of the forecast period in the latest 
guidance envelope. The NHC track forecast is near the previous one, 
however slightly slower at long range, and lies near the consensus 
track aids.
 
A weakening trend has started with Humberto, as wind shear appears 
to have started to disrupt the circulation. Wind shear is forecast 
to continue increasing over the system, and sea surface temperatures 
will also cool along the forecast track. Model simulated IR images 
depicts that Humberto will become more asymmetric with most of the 
convection displaced to the eastern side of the circulation due to 
the shear. In about 60 h, both the GFS and ECMWF guidance depict 
that the system should merge with the previously mentioned trough 
digging across the north Atlantic and develop frontal features. As 
the system becomes extratropical across the north Atlantic, the wind 
field is anticipated to grow in size. The latest NHC intensity 
forecast lies on the higher end of the guidance envelope given the 
latest increase in intensity, and then shows weakening throughout 
the period. By 96h, the system is expected to dissipate and merge 
within the larger trough.
 
Along the forecast track, Humberto is expected to move to the west
and north of Bermuda, gusty winds and heavy rainfall are possible
within outer rainbands late Tuesday and Wednesday. 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Gusty winds and heavy rainfall are possible within outer
rainbands of Humberto. The Tropical Storm Watch has been replaced
with a Hurricane Watch, due to the forecast of Imelda. Please follow
local updates from Bermuda Weather Service for impacts from
Humberto.
 
2. Dangerous marine conditions, including high surf and
life-threatening rip currents, are affecting beaches of the northern
Caribbean, Bahamas, Bermuda, and much of the east coast of the
United States.

...IMELDA FORECAST TO BECOME A HURRICANE TOMORROW MORNING...
...HURRICANE WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FOR ISLAND OF BERMUDA...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM EDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...27.7N 77.3W
ABOUT 90 MI...145 KM N OF GREAT ABACO ISLAND
ABOUT 205 MI...335 KM ESE OF CAPE CANAVERAL FLORIDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 360 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Bermuda Weather Service has issued a Hurricane Watch for
Bermuda.
 
The government of the Bahamas has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warning for the Northwestern Bahamas except for Grand Bahama and
Great Abaco Island.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Extreme Northwestern Bahamas, including Great Abaco, Grand Bahama
Island and the surrounding keys.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area in this for the next few
hours.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Imelda was 
located near latitude 27.7 North, longitude 77.3 West. Imelda is 
moving toward the north near 9 mph (15 km/h), and a general 
northward motion is expected to continue tonight. On Tuesday, Imelda 
is expected to turn sharply to the east-northeast and accelerate. On 
the forecast track, the center of the system is expected to start 
moving away from the northwestern Bahamas this afternoon and then 
turn east-northeastward, moving away from the southeastern U.S. but 
approaching the island of Bermuda on Wednesday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecasted over the 
next several days, and Imelda is forecast to become a hurricane on 
Tuesday morning. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 986 mb (29.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Imelda can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area by
Wednesday night, with tropical storm conditions possible by
Wednesday afternoon.
 
Tropical storm conditions are occuring in portions of the extreme
northwestern Bahamas and should continue through tonight.
 
RAINFALL:  Tropical Storm Imelda is expected to produce additional 
rainfall of 1 to 3 inches across the northwest Bahamas through 
tonight. This rainfall may produce flash and urban flooding. 

Storm total rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches with local maxima of 4 
inches are expected through tonight across northeast Florida, 
coastal South Carolina, and coastal sections of southeast North 
Carolina. This rainfall could result in isolated flash and urban 
flooding.

As Imelda passes near Bermuda, 2 to 4 inches – 50 to 100 mm – of 
rainfall is expected from Wednesday into Thursday.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Imelda, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds in the northwestern Bahamas.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
Minor coastal flooding is possible in areas of onshore winds over
the Southeastern U.S. coastline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the surge occurs over the next several high tide cycles...
 
Volusia/Brevard County Line, Florida to the South Santee River,
South Carolina...1 to 2 ft
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Imelda and Hurricane 
Humberto are affecting the Bahamas and are currently spreading to 
much of the east coast of the U.S.. These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found

Tropical Storm Imelda Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092025
500 PM EDT Mon Sep 29 2025
 
Since the prior advisory, Imelda's structure on satellite imagery 
continues to improve. Curved bands are now wrapping around the 
western side of the tropical storm's circulation, and the last few 
fixes from the NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters did show 
enhanced winds wrapping around the western side, becoming more 
symmetric, though some northward tilt with height was still 
persisting on the last Tail Doppler Radar (TDR) swath from the 
NOAA-P3 aircraft. Satellite intensity estimates have continued to 
gradually rise since that time, so the initial intensity is being 
raised to 55 kt this advisory, in best agreement with the SAB 
subjective Dvorak fix of T3.5/55-kt and the latest SATCON intensity 
estimate of 54 kt. 

Imelda continues to move northward, estimated at 360/8 kt. This 
motion should continue through tonight, but as Humberto erodes the 
steering influence of a subtropical ridge east of Bermuda, the 
cyclone is expected to make a sharp turn to the east-northeast as 
the storm steering becomes dominated by the deep-layer trough that 
is digging southward upstream of Imelda. The latest track guidance 
trajectory is quite similar to the prior cycle, though it has once 
again shifted a bit faster beyond 36 h. There also remains a 
substantial amount of along-track spread in both the deterministic 
and ensemble guidance this afternoon. The NHC track forecast is a 
little faster than the prior cycle, once again attempting to blend 
the HCCA and Google DeepMind ensemble mean (GDMI). Based on the 
forecast track, tropical storm conditions are expected to begin on 
the Island of Bermuda in about 48 h, and in response, the Bermuda 
Weather Service has issued a Hurricane Watch for the island this 
advisory. 

Further intensification is expected over the next several days as 
Imelda remains in a low to moderate vertical wind shear environment 
along with sufficient mid-level moisture and warm sea-surface 
temperatures above 28 C. In 48-60 h, the shear starts quickly 
increasing, but a favorable trough interaction may temper this 
negative factor initially. This interaction may enhance the winds 
along the cyclone's western flank, as seen in the most recent set of 
hurricane-regional model runs. These enhanced winds may then evolve 
into a "sting jet" like feature as the system becomes extratropical 
in the 60-72 h time frame. The exact timing of this transition 
remains difficult to forecast, since the cyclone will still be under 
fairly warm SSTs at 60-72 h. The official intensity forecast is on 
the high side of the guidance envelope, but near the HCCA consensus 
aid.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Imelda is expected to intensify into a hurricane on Tuesday with 
the cyclone approaching Bermuda during the day Wednesday as a 
hurricane. A Hurricane Watch is now in effect for the island of 
Bermuda due to the expected onset of tropical storm conditions 
beginning Wednesday afternoon. 

2. Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue for another 
few hours on Great Abaco and Grand Bahama island in the northwestern 
Bahamas.
 
2. Rainfall associated with Tropical Storm Imelda will continue to 
impact the Bahamas through tonight, which may produce flash and 
urban flooding.  Locally heavy rainfall across the coastal Carolinas 
could cause isolated flash and urban flooding through tonight.
 
3. Swells and high surf from both Humberto and Imelda are expected
to produce dangerous marine conditions and rip currents along much
of the East Coast of the United States during the next several days.
