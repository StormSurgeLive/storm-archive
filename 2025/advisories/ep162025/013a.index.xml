DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM MST (0000 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Priscilla was 
located near latitude 20.3 North, longitude 111.2 West. Priscilla is 
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this motion is 
expected to continue for the next couple of days, followed by a turn 
toward the north Thursday night. On the forecast track, the center 
of Priscilla is expected to move parallel to, but offshore of, the 
coast of Baja California Sur through Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 110 mph (175 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected through tonight. 
Weakening is forecast to begin on Wednesday and continue through the 
rest of the week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles 
(295 km). A weather station on Socorro island, located about 105 
miles (170 km) south of Priscilla's eye, recently reported a 
sustained wind of 52 mph (84 km/h) with a gust of 73 mph (117 km/h). 
An elevated station near Cabo San Lucas in Baja California Sur also 
recently reported a wind gust of 57 mph (92 km/h). 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 958 mb (28.29 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Pacific coast
of Baja California Sur within the watch area later today through
Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: From today into Wednesday, 1 to 2 inches of rain are 
expected in southern Baja California Sur, with local storm totals up 
to 4 inches as the outer bands of Priscilla reach the area. This 
rainfall could bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas 
of higher terrain.  Moisture from Priscilla should bring 1 to 2 
inches of rain, with local amounts to 4 inches, to portions of 
west-central Mexico, which could lead to flash flooding within the 
area’s terrain.  From late this week into this weekend, moisture 
from Priscilla may lead to heavy rainfall and a flash flood risk 
over portions of the U.S. Desert Southwest.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of
the coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as
portions of the coast of the southern Baja California peninsula.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions, in addition to some coastal flooding. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Priscilla Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
200 PM MST Tue Oct 07 2025
 
Priscilla's structure hasn't changed much from 6 hours ago.  The 
hurricane continues to display a large eye, about 50 n mi in 
diameter.  A ring of convection with cloud tops colder than -60 
degrees C completely surrounds the eye at a radius of about 40 n mi. 
Earlier, a ring with cloud tops colder than -70C briefly surrounded 
the eye.  The eye itself is a bit messy with low clouds seen on 
GOES-18 1-minute imagery swirling inside.  The latest subjective and 
objective intensity estimates are mostly ranging from 95-108 kt.  
Given the large and broad nature of the eye and eyewall, the initial 
intensity is maintained at 95 kt, near the lower end of the 
satellite estimates. 

Over the next 12 hours, Priscilla should maintain its intensity or 
possibly strengthen slightly while the hurricane remains over warm 
waters and in a moist, moderate shear environment.  After that, the 
hurricane is forecast to move over progressively cooler waters, 
reaching the 26 degree C sea-surface temperature isotherm in 36 
hours.  Priscilla will also be moving into a drier environment as it 
gains latitude.  Therefore, the NHC forecast calls for weakening 
beginning Wednesday.  Southwesterly vertical wind shear is forecast 
to increase over the cyclone in 3 days, and simulated satellite 
images from the GFS and ECMWF models indicate that Priscilla should 
lose its convection and become a remnant low shortly after 72 hours, 
before the system reaches the Baja California peninsula.  Enhanced 
moisture is likely to be transported northward over portions of the 
southwestern U.S. late this week, resulting in the potential for 
heavy rainfall.
 
The hurricane has jogged toward the west-northwest over the past 6 
hours, and the initial motion estimate is 295 degrees at 8 kt.  
A general northwestward motion is expected through Thursday as 
Priscilla moves around the southwestern periphery of a mid-level 
ridge over northern Mexico.  Priscilla is forecast to move 
parallel to, but remain offshore of, the southern Baja California 
peninsula through Thursday.  By Thursday night, an amplifying
trough off the U.S. West Coast is forecast to erode the steering
ridge to the north of Priscilla.  The weakness in the ridge should
induce a northward turn later this week and into the weekend.  The
track models are still in fairly good agreement through about 60 h, 
but there are still some speed differences in the guidance after 
that time, as Priscilla weakens to a remnant low.  The new NHC 
track forecast is slightly to the left of the previous one through 
36 h, mainly due to the farther west initial position.  Thereafter, 
the new official forecast is on top of the previous one, and lies 
in between the latest GFEX and HFIP Corrected Consensus (HCCA) 
solutions.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Baja California 
Sur Pacific coastline within the Tropical Storm Watch area tonight 
into Wednesday. Interests elsewhere in the Baja California peninsula 
should monitor the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Priscilla will impact portions of 
Baja California Sur tonight into Wednesday.  Its moisture will lead 
to heavy rainfall across west-central Mexico from today into 
Thursday morning and across the Desert Southwest from late this week 
into this weekend, which could result in flash flooding, 
particularly in areas of higher terrain.
 
3.  Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico as well as the coast
of the southern Baja California peninsula. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, in 
addition to some coastal flooding.

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  31
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
200 PM PDT Tue Oct 07 2025

Octave continues to produce clusters of deep convection, though this 
activity is becoming more fragmented and displaced southwest of the 
now exposed low-level center. This structure is largely the result 
of increasing east-northeasterly shear related to much larger 
Hurricane Priscilla to the northeast. While the subjective Dvorak 
estimates remain T3.0/45-kt, the objective intensity estimates are 
now all under 40 kt, and a recent scatterometer pass only had a peak 
derived wind of 37 kt. Thus, the initial intensity for Octave is 
lowered to 40 kt this advisory.  

Now that the center is mostly exposed, its been a little easier to 
track the center, with its motion estimated east-southeastward at 
110/7 kt. Octave's primary steering currents are low to mid-level 
westerlies that are partially related to the circulation of 
Priscilla and the larger monsoonal flow that has developed across 
the eastern Pacific. As the storm reaches Priscilla's longitude, 
Octave's track will likely bend more poleward as it rounds the outer 
edge of Priscilla's flow. The latest NHC track forecast is 
close to the prior one, but is a little faster after 24 h, following 
the latest trends in the HCCA and Google DeepMind guidance.

The current 20-25 kt of vertical wind shear is expected to increase 
further to 30-35 kt over the next 24-36 h. Thus, Octave is expected 
to continue weakening, but will likely to continue to produce 
sheared bursts of deep convection as it continues to traverse warm 
sea-surface temperatures. After 48 hours, most of the guidance shows 
the cyclone degenerating into a trough, roughly between Priscilla to 
its northwest and another developing system (EP90) to its southeast. 
The NHC intensity forecast is a bit lower than earlier, and now 
shows dissipation in 60 h, though this could occur sooner than shown 
here given the hostile environmental conditions. This forecast is 
roughly in the middle of the model consensus.
