Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Pacific coast
of Baja California Sur within the watch area for the next several
hours.
 
RAINFALL: As Priscilla moves off the west coast of Baja California,
up to an inch of rain is expected across the Baja California
peninsula.  Farther north across the southwestern United States,
heavy rain from Priscillaâ€™s moisture is expected to lead to 2 to 4
inches, with local storm total amounts to 6 inches, across portions
of central and northern Arizona, southern Utah, and southwest
Colorado from Thursday into Saturday afternoon.  Scattered
occurrences of flash flooding are anticipated from central Arizona
across southern Utah across the Four Corners into southwest Colorado
and far northwest New Mexico.

SURF: Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting the Pacific
coast of Baja California Sur as well as portions of coastal
southwestern and west-central Mexico. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, in addition
to some coastal flooding.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
