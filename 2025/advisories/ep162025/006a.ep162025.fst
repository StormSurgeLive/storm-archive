DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM MST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Priscilla was
located near latitude 16.9 North, longitude 107.2 West.  Priscilla 
is moving toward the north-northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h).  This
general motion with a bend to the northwest at a slightly faster 
forward speed is expected over the next few days.  On the forecast 
track, the center of the system is expected to move offshore of and 
parallel to the coast of southwestern Mexico and Baja California 
Sur through the early-to-middle part of this week.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is expected during 
the next few days, and Priscilla is forecast to become a category 2 
hurricane later this week before weakening likely commences on 
Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195
miles (315 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 984 mb (29.06 inches).
