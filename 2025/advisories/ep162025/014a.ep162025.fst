DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM MST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Priscilla was
located near latitude 20.9 North, longitude 111.8 West.  Priscilla 
is moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this 
motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days, followed 
by a turn toward the north Thursday night.  On the forecast track, 
the center of Priscilla is expected to move parallel to, but 
offshore of, the coast of Baja California Sur through Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Additional weakening is expected for the next few days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195
miles (315 km).  A weather station on Socorro island, located about 
155 miles (250 km) south-southeast of Priscilla's eye, recently 
reported a wind gust of 36 mph (57 km/h). 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 962 mb (28.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Pacific coast
of Baja California Sur within the watch area through Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: 1 to 2 inches of rain are expected in southern Baja
California Sur into Wednesday, with local storm totals up to 4
inches as the outer bands of Priscilla reach the area.  This
rainfall could bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas
of higher terrain.  Moisture from Priscilla should bring 1 to 2
inches of rain, with local amounts to 4 inches, to portions of
west-central Mexico, which could lead to flash flooding within the
areaâ€™s terrain.  From late this week into this weekend, moisture
from Priscilla leads to heavy rainfall and a flash flood risk over
portions of the U.S. Desert Southwest.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at

SURF: Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of
the coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as
portions of the coast of the southern Baja California peninsula.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions, in addition to some coastal flooding.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
