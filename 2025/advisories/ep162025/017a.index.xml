DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM MST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Priscilla was
located near latitude 22.3 North, longitude 113.3 West. Priscilla is
moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h) and this general 
motion is expected to continue through Thursday. A turn toward the 
north is expected Thursday night. On the forecast track, the center 
of Priscilla is expected to move parallel to, but offshore of, the 
coast of Baja California Sur through Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are now near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Weakening is forecast, and Priscilla is expected to become 
a remnant low by Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 986 mb (29.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Pacific coast
of Baja California Sur within the watch area through this evening.
 
RAINFALL: As Priscilla moves off the west coast of Baja California,
up to an inch of rain is expected across the Baja California
peninsula.  Farther north across the southwestern United States,
heavy rain from Priscillaâ€™s moisture is expected to lead to 2 to 4
inches, with local storm total amounts to 6 inches, across portions
of central and northern Arizona, southern Utah, and southwest
Colorado from Thursday into Saturday afternoon.  Scattered
occurrences of flash flooding are anticipated from central Arizona
across southern Utah across the Four Corners into southwest Colorado
and far northwest New Mexico.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting the Pacific
coast of Baja California Sur as well as portions of coastal
southwestern and west-central Mexico. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, in addition
to some coastal flooding.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM MST.

Tropical Storm Priscilla Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
200 PM MST Wed Oct 08 2025

The satellite presentation of Priscilla has fallen apart quickly 
over the past 18 hours.  Over the past 6 hours, deep convection has 
gradually diminished.  The latest CI numbers from TAFB and SAB are 
65 kt, while objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS have 
decreased to the 47-53 kt range.  An ASCAT-C pass from 1750 UTC 
showed peak vectors of 55 kt.  Given the low bias due to the 
resolution of this instrument, the initial intensity is maintained 
at 60 kt.
 
The initial motion estimate is northwestward, or 315 degrees at 7 
kt.  Priscilla is moving along the southwestern side of a mid-level 
high pressure ridge near the Texas/Mexico border.  In 24-36 hours or 
so, a large trough or cutoff low near the California coast should 
induce a turn toward the north.  By 48 hours, Priscilla will likely 
have weakened into a shallow cyclone moving in the low-level 
environmental flow.  The latest NHC track forecast has been adjusted 
very slightly to the right of the previous official forecast, and 
lies close to the HFIP Corrected Consensus (HCCA) approach.
 
Water temperatures along Priscilla's path are quickly decreasing.  
The cyclone is expected to cross the 26 degree C isotherm in about 
12 hours.  Priscilla is also moving into an increasingly dry 
environment.  The GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite imagery show 
the storm losing its convection and degenerating to a remnant low 
in about 48 hours, but given how the convection looks now, it 
wouldn't be surprising if this occurred sooner.  The global and 
regional models then show the remnant low dissipating by hour 72.  
There are no major changes to the NHC intensity forecast, which is 
near the middle of the guidance envelope.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Baja California
Sur Pacific coastline within the Tropical Storm Watch area though 
this evening.  Interests elsewhere in the Baja California peninsula 
should monitor the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.  Moisture associated with Priscilla will lead to heavy rainfall 
and a flash flood risk across portions of Arizona, southern Utah, 
through the Four Corners into southwest Colorado and far northwest 
New Mexico from Thursday into Saturday.
 
3.  Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting the Pacific 
coast of Baja California Sur as well as portions of the coast of 
southwestern and west-central Mexico. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, in
addition to some coastal flooding.

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  35
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
200 PM PDT Wed Oct 08 2025

Visible satellite imagery revealed that the low-level center is 
exposed on the northeast side of a convective mass, which has been 
decreasing in coverage and intensity over the past few hours.  
Subjective Dvorak CI numbers range from 30-45 kt.  A recent ASCAT 
pass showed peak vectors of 38 kt, so the initial intensity has 
been set to 40 kt.  The ASCAT data also indicated that the 
circulation is still closed/well-defined.  However, the 
northwesterly winds associated with Priscilla's circulation are 
only located about 100 n mi to the northeast of Octave.  It is 
possible that the Octave could dissipate at any time over the next 
24 hours, even though dissipation isn't explicitly forecast until 
beyond 24 h.

Octave is moving toward the east-northeast at 10 kt.  A gradual 
bend toward the northeast with some acceleration is expected as 
Octave moves around the southern side of Priscilla. There are no 
significant changes to the track forecast, which lies near the HFIP 
Corrected Consensus (HCCA).

Strong easterly shear over 30 kt is expected to continue for the 
remainder of Octave's lifetime.  While bursts of convection may 
still form, any convection should quickly be sheared off to the 
west.  GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite show Octave losing its 
convection by hour 24, but as noted above, Octave could lose its 
closed circulation and dissipate at any time.  The closer Octave 
gets to Priscilla, the sooner Octave is likely to dissipate.  The 
intensity forecast shows slow weakening until dissipation.
