Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Pacific coast
of Baja California Sur within the watch area today.
 
RAINFALL: As Priscilla moves off the west coast of Baja California,
up to an inch of rain is expected across the Baja California
peninsula.  Farther north across the southwestern United States,
heavy rain from Priscillaâ€™s moisture is expected to lead to 2 to 4
inches, with local storm total amounts to 6 inches, across portions
of central and northern Arizona and southern Utah from Thursday into
Saturday morning.  Scattered occurrences of flash flooding are
anticipated from central Arizona across southern Utah and the Four
Corners into southwest Colorado and far northwest New Mexico.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service 
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at

SURF: Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of
the coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as
portions of the coast of the southern Baja California peninsula.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions, in addition to some coastal flooding.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
