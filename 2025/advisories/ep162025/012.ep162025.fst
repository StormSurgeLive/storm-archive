DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Priscilla was
located near latitude 19.8 North, longitude 110.1 West. Priscilla is
moving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h) and a continued
northwestward motion is expected over the next couple of days,
followed by a turn toward the north Thursday night or Friday. On the
forecast track, the center of Priscilla is expected to move parallel
to, but offshore of, the coast of west-central Mexico and Baja
California Sur during the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 110 mph (175 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is expected, and 
Priscilla is forecast to become a major hurricane later today.  
Weakening is forecast to begin on Wednesday and continue through the 
rest of the week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 50 miles (85 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).  Socorro island, located about 80 miles (130 km) southwest
of Priscilla's eye, recently reported a sustained wind of 52 mph
(84 km/h) with a gust of 75 mph (120 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 959 mb (28.32 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Pacific coast
of Baja California Sur within the watch area later today and
Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: From today into Wednesday, 1 to 2 inches of rain are
expected in southern Baja California Sur, with local storm totals up
to 4 inches as the outer bands of Priscilla reach the area. This
rainfall could bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas
of higher terrain.  Moisture from Priscilla should bring 1 to 2
inches of rain, with local amounts to 4 inches, to portions of
west-central Mexico, which could lead to flash flooding within the
areaâ€™s terrain.  From late this week into this weekend, moisture
from Priscilla leads to heavy rainfall and a flash flood risk over
portions of the U.S. Desert Southwest.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at

SURF: Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as portions
of the coast of the southern Baja California peninsula. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
