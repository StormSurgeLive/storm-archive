DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM MST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Priscilla was
located near latitude 16.7 North, longitude 107.3 West. Priscilla is
moving toward the north-northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h).  This
general motion with a bend to the northwest at a slightly faster 
forward speed is expected over the next few days.  On the forecast 
track, the center of the system is expected to move offshore of and 
parallel to the coast of southwestern Mexico and Baja California 
Sur through the early-to-middle part of this week
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is expected during the next few days, and
Priscilla is forecast to become a category 2 hurricane later this
week before weakening likely commences on Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles
(315 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 986 mb (29.12 inches).
