CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Punta San Telmo to Punta Mita, Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case during the next day or
so.
 
Interests in southern Baja California Sur should monitor the
progress of Priscilla.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Priscilla was
located near latitude 17.2 North, longitude 107.3 West. Priscilla is
moving toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h).  This 
general motion with a bend to the northwest at a slightly faster
forward speed is expected over the next few days.  On the forecast
track, the center of the system is expected to move offshore of and
parallel to the coast of southwestern Mexico and Baja California
Sur through the early-to-middle part of this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast, and 
Priscilla is expected to become a category 2 hurricane, and could 
approach major hurricane status within the next couple of days 
before weakening likely commences by midweek.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles
(315 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 977 mb (28.85 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
along the southwestern coast of Mexico today.
 
RAINFALL: Outer bands from Priscilla will continue to bring heavy 
rain to portions of southwestern Mexico today. Across coastal 
portions of Michoac√°n and far western Guerrero, additional rainfall 
amounts of 2 to 4 inches are expected, with local amounts up to 6 
inches. Across Colima, western Jalisco, and the rest of Guerrero 
along the coast, 1 to 3 inches of additional rainfall are expected. 
This rainfall will bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in 
areas of higher terrain.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service 
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Priscilla have begun to affect portions of 
the coast of southwestern Mexico and will reach portions of the 
coast of west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California 
peninsula today.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening 
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your 
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 500 AM MST.
Next complete advisory at 800 AM MST.

Hurricane Priscilla Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
200 AM MST Mon Oct 06 2025
 
Priscilla is gradually becoming better organized on satellite 
images over the past few hours.  There is a rather 
impressive-looking convective band wrapping around the western, 
southern and eastern portions of the circulation, with cloud 
tops to -80 deg C or colder in the band.  Cirrus cloud 
motions indicate that the upper-level outflow pattern is 
expanding at this time.  The advisory intensity estimate is set at 
75 kt based on a blend of subjective and objective intensity 
estimates from TAFB, SAB, and UW-CIMSS.

The hurricane is moving a little west of north or 340/5 kt.  A more 
northwestward track with some acceleration is expected by later 
today as mid-level ridging becomes better established over Mexico.  
There continues to be a fair amount of spread in the model guidance 
tracks, with the GFS on the southwestern side of the guidance 
envelope and the ECMWF and corrected consensus, HCCA, near the 
northeastern side.  The official forecast is nudged ever so 
slightly to the right of the previous forecast based mainly on 
Priscilla's more northward motion over the past several hours.  
The NHC forecast is close to the latest ECMWF and Google DeepMind 
ensemble solutions.

Vertical wind shear appears to be abating somewhat over the system. 
Priscilla will be moving over very warm waters for the next couple 
of days and the environment looks to be quite conducive for 
strengthening.  As noted earlier, if Priscilla develops a tighter 
inner core, rapid intensification will become more likely.  The 
official intensity forecast shows significant additional 
strengthening over the next 48 hours and is in line with the latest 
corrected consensus intensity model guidance.  Steady weakening is 
likely to commence in 2-3 days due to the tropical cyclone crossing 
a sharp SST gradient and heading over cooler waters.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico within the watch area today.  Interests 
in the southern portion of Baja California Sur should also monitor 
the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Priscilla will impact coastal 
sections of southwestern Mexico today, which could result in flash 
flooding, particularly in areas of higher terrain.

 3.  Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico and will reach the coasts of
west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California peninsula 
today.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
200 AM PDT Mon Oct 06 2025

Satellite imagery indicates that Octave has begun to weaken over the 
past several hours, with its central dense overcast diminishing in 
size and its cloud tops warming. This trend, combined with a 0602 
UTC Metop-C ASCAT pass showing peak surface winds near 50 kt, 
supports setting the initial intensity at 60 kt, making Octave a 
tropical storm.

The initial motion is eastward at around 6 kt, and this general 
motion is expected to continue through much of the day today. A 
gradual bend toward the east-southeast is forecast tonight through 
Wednesday in response to a mid- to upper-level trough extending 
southwestward off the U.S. West Coast and a much larger Hurricane 
Priscilla tracking northwestward well to the east. By late 
Wednesday, Octave is expected to turn toward the northeast as it 
begins to interact with and eventually become absorbed by Priscilla. 
There remains a decent amount of cross- and along-track spread 
among the guidance during the midweek period, largely due to 
uncertainties associated with this binary interaction. The new NHC 
forecast is very similar to the previous advisory and closely 
follows the consensus aid.

Global models suggest Octave has likely peaked in intensity, which 
aligns with recent trends. Drier mid-level air entraining into the 
circulation and gradually increasing vertical wind shear will 
support continued weakening during the next couple of days. 
Thereafter, stronger shear combined with interaction with Priscilla 
should induce additional weakening. Octave is forecast to open up 
into a trough and be absorbed by Priscilla by the end of the 
forecast period. The intensity forecast remains close to the 
previous NHC advisory and near the middle portion of the guidance 
envelope.
