The disturbance is forecast to move <br />west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph, roughly parallel to the coast <br />of southern and southwestern Mexico, and interests there should <br />monitor its progress.  Regardless of development, the disturbance <br />is expected to produce periods of heavy rainfall along portions of <br />the southern and southwestern coasts of Mexico through the end of <br />the week, which could lead to localized flooding.<br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent. <br />* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br /><br />$$<br />Forecaster Hagen]]>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Baja California Sur from Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lazaro,
Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within 12 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the Baja California peninsula should monitor
the progress of Priscilla.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM MST (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Priscilla 
was located near latitude 21.7 North, longitude 112.7 West. 
Priscilla is moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and 
this general motion is expected to continue through Thursday, 
followed by a turn toward the north Thursday night. On the forecast 
track, the center of Priscilla is expected to move parallel to, but 
offshore of, the coast of Baja California Sur through Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Continued weakening is forecast during the next
48 hours.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 985 mb (29.09 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Pacific coast
of Baja California Sur within the watch area today.
 
RAINFALL: As Priscilla moves off the west coast of Baja California,
up to an inch of rain is expected across the Baja California
peninsula.  Farther north across the southwestern United States,
heavy rain from Priscillaâ€™s moisture is expected to lead to 2 to 4
inches, with local storm total amounts to 6 inches, across portions
of central and northern Arizona and southern Utah from Thursday into
Saturday morning.  Scattered occurrences of flash flooding are
anticipated from central Arizona across southern Utah and the Four
Corners into southwest Colorado and far northwest New Mexico.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of
the coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as
portions of the coast of the southern Baja California peninsula.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions, in addition to some coastal flooding.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

Hurricane Priscilla Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
800 AM MST Wed Oct 08 2025

Priscilla has rapidly weakened over the past 12 hours.  Deep 
convection in the northern semicircle has become almost 
non-existent, and the convection in the southern semicircle has also 
decreased in coverage and intensity.  Subjective CI numbers were 75 
kt at 12Z, but the final-T numbers were 55 kt.  Objective intensity 
estimates from UW-CIMSS have decreased to the 60-70 kt range.  
Despite the appearance of the deep convection falling apart, a 
recent 37 GHz GPM pass suggests that Priscilla may still be fairly 
powerful in the low-levels, below the freezing level, so I have only 
brought the intensity down to 65 kt, maintaining Priscilla as a 
hurricane for this advisory.  Priscilla is expected to weaken to a 
tropical storm within the next few hours.

The initial motion estimate is slowly northwestward, or 310 degrees 
at 6 kt.  Priscilla is currently moving along the southwestern 
side of a mid-level high pressure ridge near the Texas/Mexico 
border.  In 36 hours or so, a large trough or cutoff low near the 
California coast should induce a turn toward the north.  By 60 
hours, Priscilla will likely have weakened into a shallow cyclone 
moving in the low-level environmental flow.  The official track 
forecast is very near the previous NHC forecast track through 48 h, 
but is notably slower and farther south at 60-72 h, and lies close 
to the HFIP Corrected Consensus (HCCA) approach.
 
Priscilla has weakened faster than anticipated so far, possibly due 
to enhanced upwelling of cool water due to the cyclone's slow 
motion.  Sea-surface temperatures will continue to rapidly decrease 
along Priscilla's path, reaching 26 degrees C in about 18 hours.  
Priscilla is expected to degenerate into a remnant low in about 60 
hours, with dissipation just after 72 hours.  The official intensity
forecast has been lowered from the previous NHC forecast due to the 
lower initial intensity, and lies near the middle of the model 
guidance suite.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Baja California
Sur Pacific coastline within the Tropical Storm Watch area today.
Interests elsewhere in the Baja California peninsula should monitor
the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.  Moisture associated with Priscilla will lead to heavy rainfall 
and a flash flood risk across portions of Arizona, Utah, through the 
Four Corners into southwest Colorado and far northwest New Mexico 
from Thursday into Saturday morning.
 
3.  Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico as well as the coast
of the southern Baja California peninsula. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, in
addition to some coastal flooding.

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  34
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
800 AM PDT Wed Oct 08 2025
 
Convection has increased with Octave over the past few hours, mainly 
in the southwest quadrant, as strong east-northeasterly wind shear, 
partially due to the outflow from Priscilla, continues to affect the 
cyclone.  In fact, the SHIPS guidance is diagnosing 30 to 35 kt of 
shear currently.  GOES-W imagery indicates that the low-level center 
is near the northeastern edge of this convective mass, and recent 
AMSR2 and GPM microwave passes confirm this structure.  Subjective 
Dvorak CI numbers from TAFB and SAB range from 30-45 kt, while 
UW-CIMSS objective estimates range from 32-41 kt.  Since the 
aforementioned increase in convection is recent, the intensity for 
this advisory is held at 35 kt.
 
The initial motion is toward the east, or 080 degrees, at 10 kt.  A 
turn to the east-northeast is expected soon, followed by a gradual 
northeastward turn tonight as Octave moves south of Priscilla and 
near another developing system (EP90) to its southeast, located near 
the southern coast of Mexico. The forecast track is similar to the 
previous NHC advisory and lies near the various consensus aids.
 
Easterly shear over 30 kt is expected to continue along the storm's 
path through Thursday.  Octave could maintain its intensity for 
another 12 h due to its motion in the same direction as the shear 
vector and the current ongoing convective burst.  However, all 
global models are in agreement that Octave will no longer have a 
closed circulation by hour 36.  It's possible that the circulation 
could dissipate sooner than that.  GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite 
imagery suggest that Octave could lose its convection and become a 
remnant low in about 24 h.  Regardless, Octave is unlikely to still 
be a tropical cyclone on Thursday.
