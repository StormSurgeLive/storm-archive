Friday night.  On the forecast track, the center of Priscilla is 
expected to remain offshore of the coast of Baja California Sur, and 
dissipate by Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Weakening is forecast, with Priscilla expected to become a 
post-tropical remnant low on Friday and dissipate by Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  As Priscilla moves offshore of the west coast of Baja
California, up to an inch of rain is expected across the Baja
California peninsula.  For the southwestern United States, 2 to 4
inches of rain, with local storm total maxima to 6 inches, are
expected across portions of central and northern Arizona, southern
Utah, and southwest Colorado through Saturday.  Flash flooding is
likely in  portions of central Arizona, with scattered areas of
flash flooding expected across the remainder of Arizona, southern
Utah, southwest Colorado, and far northwest New Mexico.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting the Pacific
coast of Baja California Sur.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, in addition to
some coastal flooding. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM PDT.

Tropical Storm Priscilla Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
800 PM PDT Thu Oct 09 2025
 
Priscilla has proven to be a resilient tropical cyclone this 
evening, despite moving over cool waters near 24C.  Since the 
previous advisory, the system has maintained a well-defined curved 
band that wraps more than halfway around the center.  The latest 
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB are 2.5/35 
kt and 3.5/55 kt, respectively.  Based on a blend of these data, 
along with the large area of 40-kt winds noted in a scatterometer 
pass earlier today and some improvement in the cycloneâ€™s structure, 
the initial intensity has been increased to 45 kt.

Priscilla is moving north-northwest, or 345 degrees, at 7 kt.  A 
turn toward the north and a decrease in forward speed are expected 
tonight through Friday as the cyclone moves between a longwave 
trough to its northwest and a mid- to upper-level ridge over Texas 
and northern Mexico.  A turn toward the northeast is forecast after 
24 hours as the system becomes shallower and increasingly steered by 
the low-level flow.  The updated NHC track forecast lies close to a 
blend of the previous advisory and the multi-model consensus aids.

Priscilla will be moving over progressively cooler waters and into a 
drier mid-level environment during the next day or so, while also 
encountering increasing southwesterly vertical wind shear.  These 
factors should result in steady weakening.  Simulated satellite 
imagery from the GFS and ECMWF indicates that Priscilla will lose 
its deep convection within about 12 hours, with both models showing 
the system degenerating into a trough by 48 hours, if not sooner. 
The NHC intensity forecast calls for Priscilla to become a 
post-tropical remnant low within 24 hours, with dissipation expected 
by 48 hours.
 
Remnant moisture associated with Priscilla remains the primary 
hazard across portions of southwestern United States.  Heavy 
rainfall and flash flooding are likely into the weekend over parts 
of central Arizona, with scattered areas of flash flooding possible 
across the remainder of Arizona, southern Utah, southwestern 
Colorado, and far northwestern New Mexico.  Please monitor forecasts 
and updates from local National Weather Service offices in the 
southwest U.S. at weather.gov and from the Weather Prediction Center 
at wpc.ncep.gov.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM CST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Raymond was
located near latitude 16.5 North, longitude 102.3 West.  Raymond is
moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this 
general motion is expected to continue through early Friday.  A 
turn toward the northwest is expected by late Friday, followed by a 
northward turn by early Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center 
of the cyclone is expected to move parallel to the southwestern 
coast of Mexico through Friday and then approach the southern Baja 
California Sur over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some strengthening is forecast through Friday, followed by a 
weakening trend over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within the
warning area tonight through Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Outer bands from Raymond will bring heavy rain to portions
of southwestern Mexico through Saturday.  Across coastal portions of
Guerrero and MichoacÃ¡n, rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches are
expected, with local amounts of 6 inches or more in MichoacÃ¡n.  This
rainfall will bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas of
higher terrain.  Across coastal portions of Oaxaca, Colima, and
Jalisco, rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are expected.  Moisture
from Raymond will also bring the potential for additional heavy
rainfall over portions of the Southwest U.S. early next week.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with the storm, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the storm are expected to spread
westward along the southwestern coast of Mexico through Friday and
reach southern Baja California Sur on Saturday.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Raymond Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172025
300 PM CST Thu Oct 09 2025
 
Satellite images and a recent partial ASCAT-C scatterometer pass 
were used to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Raymond at the 
intermediate advisory. Since that time, deep convection continues to 
burst mainly along the western and southern side of the circulation 
with cold cloud tops near -80C. Latest subjective and objective 
estimates range from 30 to 43 kt. Unfortunately, there was a 
scatterometer gap over the much of the system, and no recent 
microwave imagery to gain a better idea of the intensity and 
structure of the system. Using the the previous satellite derived 
winds and the intensity estimates, the initial intensity is held at 
40 kt.
 
The initial motion is estimated west-northwestward, or 290/13 kt, 
although this is a little uncertain given the recent formation of 
the center.  A strong mid-level ridge over northern Mexico  will 
steer the system swiftly towards the west-northwest to northwest 
over the next couple of days, with the center paralleling the 
southwestern coast of Mexico. The system will begin to move more 
north-northwestward then northward as it rounds the western 
periphery of the ridge towards the Baja California peninsula. The 
NHC track is near the previous forecast, which lies near the 
consensus aids.
 
Strong easterly shear is expected to displace most of the convection 
over the western semicircle over the next few days, although the 
system will remain over very warm sea surface temperatures near 
29-30C and within a preferable upper-level wind environment. Thus, 
some strengthening is forecast in the short term. In about a day or 
so, drier air and a more stable environment will cause the system to 
start weakening as it approaches Baja California. Global model 
simulated IR imagery shows the system struggling to produce 
organized convection by day 3, with the system becoming 
post-tropical, and ultimately dissipating by day 4.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico through late Friday.  Interests in
southern Baja California Sur should monitor the progress of the
system.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Raymond will impact coastal 
sections of southwestern Mexico through Saturday, which could result 
in flash flooding, particularly in areas of higher terrain.
