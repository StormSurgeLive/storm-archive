Environmental conditions <br />appear conducive for gradual development over the next few days, <br />and a tropical depression is likely to form late this week if the <br />system remains over water.  The disturbance is forecast to move <br />west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph, roughly parallel to the coast <br />of southern and southwestern Mexico, and interests there should <br />monitor its progress.  Regardless of development, the disturbance <br />is expected to produce periods of heavy rainfall along portions of <br />the southern and southwestern coasts of Mexico through the end of <br />the week, which could lead to localized flooding.<br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent. <br />* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br /><br />$$<br />Forecaster Hagen]]>

COAST OF BAJA CALIFORNIA SUR...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM MST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.4N 112.5W
ABOUT 195 MI...315 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...982 MB...29.00 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Baja California Sur from Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lazaro,
Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within 12 to 24 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the Baja California peninsula should monitor
the progress of Priscilla.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Priscilla was
located near latitude 21.4 North, longitude 112.5 West. Priscilla is
moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue through Thursday, followed by a turn 
toward the north Thursday night. On the forecast track, the center 
of Priscilla is expected to move parallel to, but offshore of, the 
coast of Baja California Sur through Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Continued weakening is forecast during the next
48 hours.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles 
(260 km). Los Cabos International Airport in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, 
recently reported a sustained wind of 38 mph (61 km/h) with a gust 
to 49 mph (79 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 982 mb (29.00 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Pacific coast
of Baja California Sur within the watch area today.
 
RAINFALL: As Priscilla moves off the west coast of Baja California,
up to an inch of rain is expected across the Baja California
peninsula.  Farther north across the southwestern United States,
heavy rain from Priscillaâ€™s moisture is expected to lead to 2 to 4
inches, with local storm total amounts to 6 inches, across portions
of central and northern Arizona and southern Utah from Thursday into
Saturday morning.  Scattered occurrences of flash flooding are
anticipated from central Arizona across southern Utah and the Four
Corners into southwest Colorado and far northwest New Mexico.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service 
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of
the coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as
portions of the coast of the southern Baja California peninsula.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions, in addition to some coastal flooding.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1100 AM MST.
Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

Hurricane Priscilla Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
200 AM MST Wed Oct 08 2025
 
Although it is still a hurricane, Priscilla is gradually weakening. 
Deep convection within the system has diminished significantly, 
especially over the eastern portion of the circulation, and the eye 
has become poorly-defined.  Cloud tops have warmed to -60 to -70 deg 
C.  Using a blend of subjective Dvorak CI- and T-numbers, the 
intensity is set to 85 kt for this advisory.  This is also in good 
agreement with a blend of objective estimates from UW-CIMSS.

The initial motion estimate is slowly northwestward, or around 305/7 
kt.  Priscilla is currently moving along the southwestern side of a 
mid-level high pressure system centered near Texas.  In 48 hours or 
so, a large trough or cutoff low near the California coast should 
induce a turn toward the north.  By 72 hours, Priscilla will likely 
have weakened into a shallow cyclone moving in the low-level 
environmental flow.  The official track forecast lies between the 
simple and corrected dynamical model consensus solutions and is 
quite close to the previous NHC forecast.

Priscilla has weakened while moving over ocean waters that have 
likely been cooled by upwelling beneath the large and slow-moving 
tropical cyclone.  The system should traverse even cooler waters to 
the west of Baja California Sur during the next couple of days, 
resulting in steady weakening.  Priscilla is expected to degenerate 
into a remnant low in about 72 hours.  The official intensity 
forecast is on the high side of the model guidance suite, suggesting 
that the system could weaken even faster than indicated here.

KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Baja California
Sur Pacific coastline within the Tropical Storm Watch area today. 
Interests elsewhere in the Baja California peninsula should monitor 
the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.   Moisture associated with Priscilla will lead to heavy rainfall 
and a flash flood risk across portions of the southwestern United 
States from late this week into this weekend. 

3.  Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico as well as the coast
of the southern Baja California peninsula. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, in
addition to some coastal flooding.

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  34
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
800 AM PDT Wed Oct 08 2025
 
Convection has increased with Octave over the past few hours, mainly 
in the southwest quadrant, as strong east-northeasterly wind shear, 
partially due to the outflow from Priscilla, continues to affect the 
cyclone.  In fact, the SHIPS guidance is diagnosing 30 to 35 kt of 
shear currently.  GOES-W imagery indicates that the low-level center 
is near the northeastern edge of this convective mass, and recent 
AMSR2 and GPM microwave passes confirm this structure.  Subjective 
Dvorak CI numbers from TAFB and SAB range from 30-45 kt, while 
UW-CIMSS objective estimates range from 32-41 kt.  Since the 
aforementioned increase in convection is recent, the intensity for 
this advisory is held at 35 kt.
 
The initial motion is toward the east, or 080 degrees, at 10 kt.  A 
turn to the east-northeast is expected soon, followed by a gradual 
northeastward turn tonight as Octave moves south of Priscilla and 
near another developing system (EP90) to its southeast, located near 
the southern coast of Mexico. The forecast track is similar to the 
previous NHC advisory and lies near the various consensus aids.
 
Easterly shear over 30 kt is expected to continue along the storm's 
path through Thursday.  Octave could maintain its intensity for 
another 12 h due to its motion in the same direction as the shear 
vector and the current ongoing convective burst.  However, all 
global models are in agreement that Octave will no longer have a 
closed circulation by hour 36.  It's possible that the circulation 
could dissipate sooner than that.  GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite 
imagery suggest that Octave could lose its convection and become a 
remnant low in about 24 h.  Regardless, Octave is unlikely to still 
be a tropical cyclone on Thursday.
