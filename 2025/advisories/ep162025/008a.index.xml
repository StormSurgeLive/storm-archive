SUMMARY OF 1100 AM MST...1800 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.0N 107.6W
ABOUT 205 MI...335 KM SW OF CABO CORRIENTES MEXICO
ABOUT 370 MI...595 KM SSE OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Punta San Telmo to Punta Mita, Mexico
* Baja California Sur from Cabo San Lucas to Santa Fe
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area.
 
Interests elsewhere in southern Baja California Sur should monitor
the progress of Priscilla.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM MST (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Priscilla was
located near latitude 18.0 North, longitude 107.6 West. Priscilla is
moving toward the north-northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h). This general
motion with a bend to the northwest at a slightly faster forward
speed is expected over the next few days. On the forecast track, the
center of the system is expected to move offshore of and parallel to
the coast of west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur through the
early-to-middle part of this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts. Strengthening is forecast, and Priscilla is expected to 
become a category 2 hurricane, and could approach major hurricane 
status within the next couple of days before weakening likely 
commences by midweek.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 50 miles (85 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 973 mb (28.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
along the southwestern coast of Mexico today, and are possible in
Baja California Sur Tuesday night into Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Outer bands from Priscilla will continue to bring heavy
rain to portions of southwestern Mexico today. Across coastal
portions of Michoac√°n and Colima, additional rainfall amounts of 1
to 2 inches are expected.  From Tuesday into Wednesday, 2-4 inches
(with local amounts up to 6 inches) are expected in southern
portions of Baja California Sur as outer bands of Priscilla reach
that area. This rainfall will bring a risk of flash flooding,
especially in areas of higher terrain.  Moisture from Priscilla
should bring heavy rainfall potential over the Southwestern U.S.
late this week into this weekend.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico, and will reach
portions of the coast of the southern Baja California peninsula
today.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

Hurricane Priscilla Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
800 AM MST Mon Oct 06 2025

Priscilla remains a large hurricane with a fairly large radius of 
maximum winds (RMW).  The ASCAT data from late Sunday evening 
suggested that the winds may have been a bit lower than the 
subjective Dvorak estimates at that time.  Although the curved band 
that extends across the eastern and southern semicircles has become 
a bit more impressive over the past few hours, the convection in the 
northwest quadrant is still not very strong.  The inner core is 
still rather broad, and it does not appear that the RMW has 
contracted yet.  The latest subjective Dvorak estimates remain a 
consensus 77 kt from TAFB and SAB, and the intensity will be held at 
75 kt for this advisory.

Priscilla is still moving slowly toward the north-northwest, or 340 
degrees at 4 kt.  A more northwestward track with some acceleration 
is expected by later today as mid-level ridging becomes better 
established over Mexico.  The model guidance hasn't changed too 
much this cycle, and the NHC forecast is very similar to the 
previous official forecast.  The NHC forecast is close to the 
latest Google DeepMind Ensemble Mean.

Although the SHIPS guidance is forecasting moderate wind shear to 
continue through the next 48 h, the large circulation of Priscilla 
should be able to fight off some of the adverse affects of the 
shear.  Priscilla will be moving over very warm waters for the next 
couple of days and the environment looks to be quite conducive for
strengthening.  The rate of intensification for the next 24 h will 
likely be slow to steady since Priscilla has yet to develop a 
tight inner core.  Only minor changes were made to the previous 
official forecast, which shows a peak intensity as a strong 
Category 2 around Tuesday evening, which is near the higher end of 
the intensity guidance suite.  Steady to rapid weakening is likely 
to commence in 2-3 days due to the tropical cyclone reaching 
sharply cooler waters.

Based on the latest forecast, which brings the tropical-storm-force 
wind radii fairly close to portions of Baja California Sur in 36-48 
h, the government of Mexico has issued a tropical storm watch from 
Cabo San Lucas to Santa Fe.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico today, and in Baja California Sur 
Tuesday night into Wednesday, within the watch areas.  Interests 
elsewhere in the southern portion of Baja California Sur should 
monitor the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Priscilla will impact coastal 
sections of southwestern Mexico as well as portions of Baja 
California Sur, which could result in flash flooding, particularly 
in areas of higher terrain.

3.  Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the 
coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico and will reach the 
coasts of the southern Baja California peninsula today.  These 
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
800 AM PDT Mon Oct 06 2025
 
Octave continues to lose strength this morning.  Satellite images 
show that the associated deep convection has been gradually 
shrinking, and the cloud pattern is now more asymmetric with the 
low-level center located near the southwestern edge of the 
thunderstorm activity.  There is a big spread in the satellite 
intensity estimates that currently range from 45 kt to about 80 kt. 
Based on the degraded structure, the initial wind speed is set 
closer to the lower end of the range at 55 kt.  A satellite view of 
the eastern Pacific basin shows how small Octave is compared to 
Priscilla.  In fact, Octave's wind field is less than one-third of 
the size of Priscilla.

The storm is moving eastward at 6 kt on the south side of a 
large-scale trough near the west coast of the U.S.  A continued 
eastward or east-southeastward motion is forecast for another 
day or two, followed by a faster motion to the northeast when Octave
becomes influenced by the flow on Priscilla's southeast side.  The 
track forecast is fairly similar to the previous one, and this 
prediction lies closest to the HCCA and Google Deep Mind solutions.

Continued weakening is expected as Octave moves into an environment 
of increasing shear and drier air.  Most of the models show Octave 
opening up into a trough or dissipating completely in a few days as 
it becomes absorbed into the outer circulation of Priscilla.  The 
NHC intensity forecast is lower than the previous one, and leans 
closer to the lower end of the model guidance given the expected 
unfavorable environmental conditions.
