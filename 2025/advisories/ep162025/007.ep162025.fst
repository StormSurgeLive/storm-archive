DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Priscilla was
located near latitude 17.2 North, longitude 107.3 West. Priscilla is
moving toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h).  This 
general motion with a bend to the northwest at a slightly faster
forward speed is expected over the next few days.  On the forecast
track, the center of the system is expected to move offshore of and
parallel to the coast of southwestern Mexico and Baja California
Sur through the early-to-middle part of this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast, and 
Priscilla is expected to become a category 2 hurricane, and could 
approach major hurricane status within the next couple of days 
before weakening likely commences by midweek.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles
(315 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 977 mb (28.85 inches).

SURF: Swells generated by Priscilla have begun to affect portions of 
the coast of southwestern Mexico and will reach portions of the 
coast of west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California 
peninsula today.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
