The government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical Storm Watch
from Punta San Telmo to southeast of Manzanillo
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Manzanillo to Punta Mita, Mexico
* Baja California Sur from Cabo San Lucas to Santa Fe
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area.
 
Interests elsewhere in the Baja California peninsula should monitor
the progress of Priscilla.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Priscilla was
located near latitude 18.3 North, longitude 108.0 West. Priscilla is
moving toward the north-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h). A turn 
toward the northwest at a slightly faster forward speed is expected 
over the next few days. On the forecast track, the center of the 
system is expected to move offshore of and parallel to the coast of 
west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur through the middle part 
of this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Strengthening is expected over the next day or two, and 
Priscilla is forecast to become a category 2 hurricane before 
weakening begins by midweek.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles
(335 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 972 mb (28.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
along the west-central coast of Mexico through today, and are
possible in Baja California Sur Tuesday night into Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Outer bands from Priscilla will continue to bring heavy
rain to portions of west-central Mexico today. Across coastal
portions of Michoac√°n and Colima, additional rainfall amounts of 1
to 2 inches are expected.  From Tuesday into Wednesday, 1 to 2
inches with local storm total amounts to 4 inches are expected in
southern portions of Baja California Sur due to the outer bands of
Priscilla. This rainfall could bring a risk of flash flooding,
especially in areas of higher terrain.  Moisture from Priscilla
should bring heavy rainfall potential over the Southwest U.S. late
this week into this weekend.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as portions
of the coast of the southern Baja California peninsula.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 500 PM MST.
Next complete advisory at 800 PM MST.

Hurricane Priscilla Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
800 AM MST Mon Oct 06 2025

Priscilla remains a large hurricane with a fairly large radius of 
maximum winds (RMW).  The ASCAT data from late Sunday evening 
suggested that the winds may have been a bit lower than the 
subjective Dvorak estimates at that time.  Although the curved band 
that extends across the eastern and southern semicircles has become 
a bit more impressive over the past few hours, the convection in the 
northwest quadrant is still not very strong.  The inner core is 
still rather broad, and it does not appear that the RMW has 
contracted yet.  The latest subjective Dvorak estimates remain a 
consensus 77 kt from TAFB and SAB, and the intensity will be held at 
75 kt for this advisory.

Priscilla is still moving slowly toward the north-northwest, or 340 
degrees at 4 kt.  A more northwestward track with some acceleration 
is expected by later today as mid-level ridging becomes better 
established over Mexico.  The model guidance hasn't changed too 
much this cycle, and the NHC forecast is very similar to the 
previous official forecast.  The NHC forecast is close to the 
latest Google DeepMind Ensemble Mean.

Although the SHIPS guidance is forecasting moderate wind shear to 
continue through the next 48 h, the large circulation of Priscilla 
should be able to fight off some of the adverse affects of the 
shear.  Priscilla will be moving over very warm waters for the next 
couple of days and the environment looks to be quite conducive for
strengthening.  The rate of intensification for the next 24 h will 
likely be slow to steady since Priscilla has yet to develop a 
tight inner core.  Only minor changes were made to the previous 
official forecast, which shows a peak intensity as a strong 
Category 2 around Tuesday evening, which is near the higher end of 
the intensity guidance suite.  Steady to rapid weakening is likely 
to commence in 2-3 days due to the tropical cyclone reaching 
sharply cooler waters.

Based on the latest forecast, which brings the tropical-storm-force 
wind radii fairly close to portions of Baja California Sur in 36-48 
h, the government of Mexico has issued a tropical storm watch from 
Cabo San Lucas to Santa Fe.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico today, and in Baja California Sur 
Tuesday night into Wednesday, within the watch areas.  Interests 
elsewhere in the southern portion of Baja California Sur should 
monitor the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Priscilla will impact coastal 
sections of southwestern Mexico as well as portions of Baja 
California Sur, which could result in flash flooding, particularly 
in areas of higher terrain.

3.  Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the 
coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico and will reach the 
coasts of the southern Baja California peninsula today.  These 
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
200 PM PDT Mon Oct 06 2025
 
Octave has been steadily weakening throughout the day.  Deep
convection has been withering away, and only a few disorganized
patches remain.  The low-level circulation is still quite well
organized, however. The initial intensity is lowered to 45 kt, based
on recent ASCAT data that showed peak winds around 40 kt.  A
satellite view of the eastern Pacific basin shows how small Octave
is compared to Priscilla.  In fact, Octave's wind field is less than
one-third of the size of Priscilla.
 
The storm is moving eastward at 6 kt on the south side of a
large-scale trough near the west coast of the U.S.  A continued
eastward or east-southeastward motion is forecast for another
day or two, followed by a faster motion to the northeast when Octave
becomes influenced by the flow on Priscilla's southeast side.  The
track forecast remains in general agreement with the Google Deep
Mind ensemble mean and HCCA.
 
Octave will likely lose a little more strength during the next day
or so while it remains over marginal SSTs and in a generally dry
environment.  While the storm's intensity could plateau during the
middle portion of the week, there is good agreement among the models
that Octave will open into a trough or become absorbed into the
outer circulation of Priscilla in a few days.  The NHC intensity
forecast is again lower than the previous one, and leans closer to
the lower end of the model intensity guidance.
