DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM MST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Priscilla was 
located near latitude 15.6 North, longitude 106.7 West. Priscilla is 
moving toward the northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h). A slow, generally 
northward drift is expected through Sunday, followed by a faster 
northwestward motion beginning on Monday. On the forecast track, the 
center of Priscilla is expected to move offshore of and parallel to 
the coast of southwestern Mexico through early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast during the next few days, and Priscilla is
expected to become a hurricane by Sunday night or Monday.
 
Priscilla is a large tropical storm, with tropical-storm-force winds 
extending outward up to 140 miles (220 km) from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
along the southwestern coast of Mexico on Sunday and Monday.
 
RAINFALL: Outer bands from Priscilla will bring heavy rain to 
portions of southwestern Mexico through Monday. Across coastal 
portions of Michoac√°n and far western Guerrero, rainfall amounts of 
4 to 6 inches are expected, with local amounts up to 8 inches. 
Across Colima, western Jalisco, and the rest of Guerrero along the 
coast, 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected. This rainfall will bring 
a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas of higher terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico and will reach portions of the coast of
west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California peninsula by
Monday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1100 PM MST.
Next complete advisory at 200 AM MST.

Tropical Storm Priscilla Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
800 PM MST Sat Oct 04 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Priscilla suggests the storm is 
contending with some shear this evening. The low-level circulation 
appears to be partially exposed to the east of the central 
convection. Large curved bands wrap around the northern and western 
parts of the circulation. The satellite intensity estimates range 
from 36-45 kt, and the initial intensity is held at 40 kt based on a 
blend of these estimates and the earlier scatterometer data.

The initial motion estimate is an uncertain 325/3 kt. Priscilla has 
not moved much since earlier today, and recent satellite images 
suggest there could be a couple of small vortices rotating around a 
broader system center. While Priscilla continues to organize and the 
storm remains in weak steering currents, a slow and erratic 
northward to northwestward motion is expected during the next day or 
so. By Monday, a somewhat faster northwestward motion is forecast 
while Priscilla moves between a strengthening ridge over northern 
Mexico and an upper-level trough over the western U.S. The 
cross-track model spread increases greatly at days 3-5. This is 
likely related to differences in the amplitude of the upper trough 
off the U.S. West Coast, and the strength and positioning of the 
ridge over northern Mexico during this period. The 96-120 h NHC 
track forecast was adjusted a bit slower and farther left, following 
the latest model trends and remaining between the simple and 
corrected consensus aids.

Despite the storm's large size, most of the intensity guidance 
favors steady to even significant strengthening over the next few 
days. Warm sea-surface temperatures and strong upper-level 
divergence should provide favorable conditions for intensification 
once Priscilla consolidates an inner core. There are indications 
that moderate easterly shear will persist into early next week, but 
the large system should be less susceptible to those negative 
effects once its structure improves. The NHC forecast shows 
Priscilla reaching hurricane strength by Monday with some continued 
strengthening thereafter. A weakening trend is forecast beyond 72 h 
as Priscilla is expected to encounter cooler waters and a drier, 
more stable environment while gaining latitude.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico within the watch area Sunday and
Monday. Interests in the southern portion of Baja California Sur
should monitor the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Priscilla will impact coastal 
sections of southwestern Mexico through Monday, which could result 
in flash flooding, particularly in areas of higher terrain.
 
3.  Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico and will reach the coasts of
west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California peninsula by
Monday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
800 PM PDT Sat Oct 04 2025
 
Octave's organization has held relatively steady since the previous
advisory.  Overshooting cloud tops continue to burst through a
modestly-sized central dense overcast.  An earlier AMSR2 37 GHz
overpass showed a curved band wrapping around the northern and
western quadrants of the storm.  Subjective and objective Dvorak
estimates range from 42 kt to 65 kt, and the initial intensity is
held at 55 kt representing a blend of these values.
 
The storm is still slowing moving north-northwestward at 4 kt.  A
turn to the north is expected shortly, followed by an accelerated
eastward motion in about 24 hours.  Much of this track prediction
depends on the evolution of Tropical Storm Priscilla, located about
1100 miles to the east of Octave.   The NHC track forecast has
shifted slightly north of the previous track forecast due to a more
northward initial position and lies between HCCA and the Google Deep
Mind ensemble mean.
 
Octave has a short window of 18-24 hours with relatively conducive
atmospheric conditions to intensify.  Weak vertical wind shear and
adequate mid-level moisture should allow Octave to strengthen.  By 
Monday, increasing upper-level winds are expected to disrupt 
Octave's circulation and induce a gradual weakening trend.  Octave 
is still forecast to open into a trough on the southern side of 
Tropical Storm Priscilla by the end of the forecast period.  Only 
minor adjustments were made to the latest official intensity 
prediction.
