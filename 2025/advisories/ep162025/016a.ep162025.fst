up to an inch of rain is expected across the Baja California
peninsula.  Farther north across the southwestern United States,
heavy rain from Priscillaâ€™s moisture is expected to lead to 2 to 4
inches, with local storm total amounts to 6 inches, across portions

Saturday morning.  Scattered occurrences of flash flooding are
anticipated from central Arizona across southern Utah and the Four
Corners into southwest Colorado and far northwest New Mexico.

SURF: Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of
the coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as
portions of the coast of the southern Baja California peninsula.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions, in addition to some coastal flooding.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
