DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Priscilla was 
located near latitude 19.9 North, longitude 110.8 West. Priscilla is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A 
northwestward motion is expected for the next couple of days, 
followed by a turn toward the north Thursday night. On the forecast 
track, the center of Priscilla is expected to move parallel to, but 
offshore of, the coast of Baja California Sur through Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 110 mph (175 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Little change in strength is expected through tonight. 
Weakening is forecast to begin on Wednesday and continue through the 
rest of the week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles 
(295 km).  Socorro island, located about 70 miles (115 km) south of 
Priscilla's eye, recently recorded a sustained wind of 54 mph     
(88 km/h) with a gust of 76 mph (122 km/h).

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Pacific coast
of Baja California Sur within the watch area later today through
Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: From today into Wednesday, 1 to 2 inches of rain are
expected in southern Baja California Sur, with local storm totals up
to 4 inches as the outer bands of Priscilla reach the area. This
rainfall could bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas
of higher terrain.  Moisture from Priscilla should bring 1 to 2
inches of rain, with local amounts to 4 inches, to portions of
west-central Mexico, which could lead to flash flooding within the
areaâ€™s terrain.  From late this week into this weekend, moisture
from Priscilla leads to heavy rainfall and a flash flood risk over
portions of the U.S. Desert Southwest.

SURF: Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of 
the coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as 
portions of the coast of the southern Baja California peninsula. 
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions, in addition to some coastal flooding. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
