SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Punta San Telmo to Punta Mita, Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within the next day or
so.
 
Interests in southern Baja California Sur should monitor the
progress of Priscilla.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Priscilla was
located near latitude 16.4 North, longitude 107.1 West. Priscilla is
moving toward the north-northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h) and this
general motion at a slightly faster forward speed is expected over
the next few days. On the forecast track, the center of the system
is expected to move offshore of and parallel to the coast of
southwestern Mexico through the early part of this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast during the next 48 
hours, and Priscilla is likely to become a hurricane over the next 
day or so.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.27 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
along the southwestern coast of Mexico today into Monday.
 
RAINFALL: Outer bands from Priscilla will bring heavy rain to 
portions of southwestern Mexico through Monday. Across coastal 
portions of Michoac√°n and far western Guerrero, additional rainfall 
amounts of 2 to 4 inches are expected, with local amounts up to 6 
inches. Across Colima, western Jalisco, and the rest of Guerrero 
along the coast,1 to 3 inches of additional rainfall are expected. 
This rainfall will bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in 
areas of higher terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico and will reach portions of the coast of
west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California peninsula by
Monday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1100 AM MST.
Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

      <title>Tropical Storm Priscilla Forecast Discussion Number 3</title>

Tropical Storm Priscilla Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
200 AM MST Sun Oct 05 2025
 
Priscilla is strengthening.  The storm is producing very deep
convection, with coldest cloud tops of near -80 deg C, over the
southern and western portion of the circulation and convective
banding features are becoming better defined.  The advisory
intensity is set at 55 kt based on subjective Dvorak T-numbers from 
TAFB and SAB, along with ASCAT observations.
 
Since the center is still not very clearly-defined, the initial
motion estimate is a somewhat uncertain 325/4 kt.  Steering
currents remain weak over the area, and there may be some shifts in
the center position due to re-organization of the system.
Nonetheless, Priscilla is expected to move on the western side of a
ridge over northwestern Mexico and the southeastern side of a
mid-level trough off the California coast.  This should result in a
generally northwestward track with some increase in forward speed
during the next few days.  The cross-track model spread increases
greatly at days 3-5. This is likely related to differences in
the amplitude of the upper trough off the U.S. West Coast, and the
strength and positioning of the ridge over northern Mexico during
this period. The official track forecast is close to the previous
one and is on the northern side of the guidance suite.
 
Priscilla is over very warm waters and within a highly moist low-
to mid-level air mass.  These conditions are conducive for
significant strengthening.  However, moderate easterly shear is
expected to prevail over the system during the next few days, which
could at least partially counteract the otherwise conducive factors
for intensification.  The official intensity forecast is about the
same as the previous one and on the high side of the model
intensity guidance envelope.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico within the watch area today and
Monday. Interests in the southern portion of Baja California Sur
should monitor the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Priscilla will impact coastal
sections of southwestern Mexico through Monday, which could result
in flash flooding, particularly in areas of higher terrain.
 
3.  Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico and will reach the coasts of
west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California peninsula by
Monday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.

Hurricane Octave Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
800 AM PDT Sun Oct 05 2025

Octave has become better organized since the previous advisory, with 
banded convection becoming more prominent on the east side of the 
center.  A 05/1008 UTC AMSR2 pass showed an eye on microwave 
imagery.  Some earlier GOES-18 images from around 1100-1200 UTC 
showed a possible eye, but deep, banded convection has covered it up 
since that time.  Objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS have 
risen to the 60-75 kt range, while the TAFB Dvorak estimate remains 
T-4.0/65 kt.  Based on the aforementioned intensity estimates, as 
well as the improved inner-core organization as noted on microwave 
images, Octave's initial intensity is increased to 70 kt, making it 
the ninth hurricane of the 2025 east Pacific hurricane season.

Octave appears to be drifting slowly northeastward, or 045 degrees 
at 3 kt.  A turn toward the east at a slightly faster forward speed 
is expected Monday as the cyclone is pushed in that direction by an 
upper-level trough to its northwest.  By early Tuesday, the main 
weather feature affecting Octave's track will likely be a large and 
powerful Priscilla, which should cause Octave to turn toward the 
east-southeast.  By Wednesday, models are in agreement that Octave 
should be located south of Priscilla.  Once Octave gets southeast of 
Priscilla, an acceleration toward the northeast is expected.  The 
new NHC track forecast takes Octave a bit faster toward the east, 
but not quite as fast as the latest HFIP Corrected Consensus (HCCA) 
model.  The official forecast lies a bit south of the latest Google 
Deep Mind ensemble mean.

Octave is currently moving through sea-surface temperatures between 
26 and 27 degrees C, and it is forecast to remain over similar water 
temperatures for the remainder of its lifetime.  The shear is 
expected to remain fairly low for another 24-36 h.  A decent number 
of typically reliable intensity models are showing weakening, 
especially in the 12 to 36 hour period, so confidence is not very 
high as to whether Octave could strengthen slightly, maintain its 
intensity, or weaken during the next day or so.  The new NHC 
intensity forecast is higher than the previous one (mainly due to 
the stronger initial intensity), and is near the higher end of the 
guidance over the first day.  By 36 h, increasing easterly shear, 
partially the result of the outflow from Priscilla, is expected to 
lead to weakening.  The NHC intensity forecast is closer to the 
middle of the guidance envelope from 36 h onward.  Octave is 
forecast to dissipate in 4 to 5 days as it becomes absorbed by the 
larger circulation of Priscilla, and the models are in pretty good 
agreement on this scenario.
