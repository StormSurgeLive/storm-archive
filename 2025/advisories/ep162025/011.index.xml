None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Baja California Sur from Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lazaro,
Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area.
 
Interests elsewhere in the Baja California peninsula should monitor
the progress of Priscilla.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Priscilla was 
located near latitude 19.4 North, longitude 109.5 West. Priscilla is 
moving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and a continued 
northwestward motion is expected over the next few days. On the 
forecast track, the center of Priscilla is expected to move parallel 
to, but offshore of, the coast of west-central Mexico and Baja 
California Sur during the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 100 mph (155 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is expected, and 
Priscilla could be at or near major hurricane strength later today. 
Weakening is forecast to begin on Wednesday and continue through the 
rest of the week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 50 miles (85 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 967 mb (28.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Pacific coast
of Baja California Sur within the watch area later today and
Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: From today into Wednesday, 1 to 2 inches of rain are
expected in southern Baja California Sur, with local totals up to 4
inches as the outer bands of Priscilla reach the area. This rainfall
could bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas of higher
terrain.  Moisture from Priscilla should bring heavy rainfall
potential over the Southwest U.S. late this week into this weekend.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as portions
of the coast of the southern Baja California peninsula. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 500 AM MST.
Next complete advisory at 800 AM MST.

Hurricane Priscilla Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
200 AM MST Tue Oct 07 2025
 
Priscilla is strengthening early this morning. The inner core
structure has improved, with deep convective cloud tops surrounding
the center of the hurricane. An eye feature has recently emerged in
proxy-visible and infrared satellite images. ASCAT-C data from 04
UTC show the tropical-storm-force wind field remains quite broad,
but the radius of maximum wind appears to have contracted from prior
estimates. The initial intensity is raised to 85 kt, representing a
blend of recent UW-CIMSS DPRINT estimates (79-87 kt) and a 5.0/90 kt
Dvorak classification from TAFB at 06 UTC.
 
The intensity of Priscilla is likely to peak in the next 12-24 h 
while the hurricane remains over warm waters and in a moist, 
moderate shear environment. Given the rapidly improving satellite 
structure, the NHC forecast shows Priscilla nearing major hurricane 
strength later today, in best agreement with the HAFS regional 
models. Thereafter, the hurricane is expected to move over 
progressively cooler waters and into a drier mid-level environment 
while gaining latitude. Thus, the NHC forecast calls for steady 
weakening beginning Wednesday and continuing through the rest of the 
week. Southwesterly shear is forecast to increase over Priscilla as 
it approaches the Baja California peninsula in 96-120 h, and 
Priscilla could become post-tropical by late Friday or Saturday if 
its convection is stripped away as shown in the GFS and ECMWF 
simulated satellite imagery. This enhanced moisture is likely to be 
transported northward over portions of the southwestern U.S. late 
this week, resulting in the potential for heavy rainfall.
 
The hurricane is moving northwestward (310/9 kt) around the
southwestern portion of a mid-level ridge over northern Mexico. This
motion should continue for the next couple of days while the center
of Priscilla moves parallel to, but remains offshore of, the
southern Baja California peninsula. By Thursday, an amplifying
trough off the U.S. West Coast is forecast to erode the steering
ridge to the north of Priscilla. The weakness in the ridge should
induce a northward turn later this week and into the weekend. The
updated NHC track forecast lies slightly to the left of the
previous prediction. This is mostly related to an initial position
adjustment based on earlier microwave and scatterometer data that
indicated Priscilla was slightly south of previous estimates.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Baja California
Sur Pacific coastline within the Tropical Storm Watch area later
today into Wednesday. Interests elsewhere in the Baja California
peninsula should monitor the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Priscilla will impact portions of
southern Baja California Sur, which could result in flash flooding,
particularly in areas of higher terrain.
 
3.  Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico as well as the coast
of the southern Baja California peninsula. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
200 AM PDT Tue Oct 07 2025
 
Satellite imagery indicates that Octave continues to produce bursts
of deep convection, with a new area of cold cloud tops redeveloping
and expanding over and north of the low-level circulation center
during the past several hours. A 0541 UTC METOP-C ASCAT pass showed
that the storm's compact structure remains intact, with peak surface
winds around 40 kt. Subjective Dvorak estimates from both TAFB and
SAB remain 3.0/45 kt, and objective intensity estimates range from
26 to 41 kt. Based on these data and consistent satellite trends,
the initial intensity is held at 45 kt for this advisory.

The initial motion is toward the east-southeast, or 110 degrees, at
around 6 kt. This motion is expected to continue today as the storm
moves along the southern periphery of a mid- to upper-level trough
extending southwestward from the U.S. West Coast, and south of a
much larger Hurricane Priscilla tracking northwestward well to the
east-northeast. A gradual turn back toward the east is forecast 
tonight into Wednesday, followed by a northeastward acceleration by 
Thursday as Octave begins to interact with, and possibly become, 
absorbed by Priscilla. This forecast track is very similar to the
previous NHC advisory and represents a blend of the consensus aids
and the Google DeepMind guidance.

Given Octave’s compact structure, the system may be able to maintain 
its intensity for another day or so before succumbing to an 
increasingly hostile environment of strengthening shear and drier 
air. A steady weakening trend is forecast thereafter, and Octave is 
expected to dissipate by Thursday as it interacts with Priscilla’s 
larger circulation. The new NHC intensity forecast is similar to the 
previous one and lies near the middle portion of the guidance 
envelope.
