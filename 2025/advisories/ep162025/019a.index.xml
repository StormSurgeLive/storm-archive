...PRISCILLA OFFSHORE BAJA CALIFORNIA SUR...
...RISK OF FLASH FLOODING ACROSS THE U.S. SOUTHWEST DURING THE NEXT
FEW DAYS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM MST...1200 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...23.5N 114.5W
ABOUT 295 MI...475 KM W OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 320 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...994 MB...29.36 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Baja California Sur from Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lazaro,
Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within 12 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the Baja California peninsula should monitor
the progress of Priscilla.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM MST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Priscilla was 
located near latitude 23.5 North, longitude 114.5 West. Priscilla is 
moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A turn toward the 
north-northwest and north is anticipated later today and tonight.  
On the forecast track, the center of Priscilla is expected to move 
parallel to, but offshore of, the coast of Baja California Sur 
through today.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts. Weakening is forecast, and Priscilla is expected to 
become a post-tropical cyclone by Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Pacific coast
of Baja California Sur within the watch area for the next few
hours.
 
RAINFALL:  As Priscilla moves off the west coast of Baja California, 
up to an inch of rain is expected across the Baja California 
peninsula.  For the southwestern United States, 2 to 4 inches of 
rain, with local storm total maxima to 6 inches, are expected across 
portions of central and northern Arizona, southern Utah, and 
southwest Colorado through Saturday afternoon.  Numerous occurrences 
of flash flooding are anticipated in central Arizona, with scattered 
instances of flash flooding expected across the remainder of 
Arizona, southern Utah, southwest Colorado, and far northwest New 
Mexico.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting the Pacific
coast of Baja California Sur as well as portions of coastal
southwestern and west-central Mexico.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, in addition
to some coastal flooding. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM MST.

Tropical Storm Priscilla Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
200 AM MST Thu Oct 09 2025
 
Priscilla has been gradually losing its organized deep convection
overnight.  As a result, objective and subjective satellite 
intensity estimates have fallen, and the initial intensity is 
lowered to 45 kt for this advisory.  While scatterometer data did 
not measure the core of the storm, it did show tropical-storm-force 
winds about 40 miles offshore of Baja California Sur.  The wind 
radii have been adjusted accordingly.
 
The estimated motion is northwestward at 7 kt.  As Priscilla becomes 
a shallow vortex, it is expected to turn north-northwestward later 
this morning in the low-level flow. By Friday, the system should 
slow and drift northward, stalling off the coast of the Baja 
California Peninsula until the circulation opens into a trough.
 
The storm has moved over the 26 degree C isotherm toward 
progressively cooler waters.  Mid-level humidities are also falling, 
and vertical wind shear is forecast to increase substantially.  
These atmospheric and oceanic conditions should accelerate 
Priscilla's transition into a post-tropical cyclone.  The latest NHC 
intensity forecast now calls for Priscilla to become a post-tropical 
cyclone in 24 hours and dissipate off the coast of Baja California 
in a couple of days or so.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Baja California
Sur Pacific coastline within the Tropical Storm Watch area for the
next several hours.  Interests elsewhere in the Baja California
peninsula should monitor the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.  Moisture associated with Priscilla will lead to heavy rainfall
and a flash flood risk across portions of Arizona, southern Utah,
through the Four Corners into southwest Colorado and far northwest
New Mexico through Saturday.
 
3.  Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting the Pacific
coast of Baja California Sur as well as portions of the coast of
southwestern and west-central Mexico. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, in addition
to some coastal flooding.

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  37
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
200 AM MST Thu Oct 09 2025
 
Octave has managed to hold onto a small area of deep convection 
since the previous advisory, despite east-southeasterly shear 
analyzed by UW-CIMSS to be around 22 kt. However, the satellite 
presentation has degraded, with the low-level circulation becoming 
more ragged.  The latest subjective Dvorak current intensity 
estimates from TAFB and SAB were both 2.0/30 kt, while recent 
objective estimates from UW-CIMSS ranged between 29 and 34 kt.  
Considering the deterioration in satellite appearance and the latest 
intensity estimates, the initial intensity for this advisory has 
been lowered to 35 kt.

Octave is now moving east-northeastward, or 065 degrees at 16 kt. 
This general motion is expected to continue this morning, followed 
by an eastward turn later today or tonight toward a newly developing 
tropical cyclone (Invest 90E) off the southwestern coast of Mexico. 
The NHC forecast track follows a blend of the Google DeepMind 
ensemble mean and the latest multi-model consensus aids.

Octave appears to be nearing the end of its life, as strong easterly 
shear of more than 30 kt is expected to continue affecting the 
system during the next day or so.  The current burst of deep 
convection southwest of the low-level center is forecast to collapse 
soon, according to the latest GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite 
imagery.  This may already be occurring, with recent infrared 
satellite images showing warming cloud tops and the remaining 
convection becoming further displaced to the southwest of the 
low-level center.  The new NHC intensity forecast calls for Octave 
to become a post-tropical remnant low in 12 hours and dissipate by 
24 hours.
