A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests in southern Baja California Sur should monitor the
progress of Priscilla.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products 
issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Priscilla was
located near latitude 15.5 North, longitude 106.6 West.  Priscilla 
is moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A slow, 
generally northward drift is expected through Sunday, followed by a 
faster northwestward motion beginning on Monday.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Priscilla is expected to move offshore of and 
parallel to the coast of southwestern Mexico through early next 
week.
 
Satellite-derived wind data indicate that maximum sustained winds 
are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.  Strengthening is 
forecast during the next few days, and Priscilla is expected to 
become a hurricane by Sunday night.
 
Priscilla is a large tropical storm, with tropical-storm-force 
winds extending outward up to 140 miles (220 km) from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area Sunday and Monday.
 
RAINFALL: Outer bands from Priscilla will bring heavy rain to
portions of southwestern Mexico through Monday.  Across coastal
portions of Michoac√°n and far western Guerrero, rainfall amounts of
4 to 6 inches are expected, with local amounts up to 8 inches.
Across Colima, western Jalisco, and the rest of Guerrero along the
coast, 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected. This rainfall will bring
a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas of higher terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico and will reach portions of the
coast of west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California
peninsula by Monday.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 500 PM MST.
Next complete advisory at 800 PM MST.

Tropical Storm Priscilla Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
200 PM MST Sat Oct 04 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Invest 99E has continued to improve 
today, with an elongated convective band having formed through 
the western and northern part of the circulation.  Given the 
system‚Äôs broad nature, its center definition had been questionable, 
particularly based on ASCAT data from yesterday evening.  However, a 
recent 1645 UTC ASCAT pass showed that the center has become 
significantly better defined, with 35-40 kt winds occurring north 
and northwest of the center.  Based on these data, advisories are 
being initiated on Tropical Storm Priscilla, with an estimated 
intensity of 40 kt.

Priscilla is moving northwestward (315 degrees) at 8 kt.  A 
large-scale trough is currently located over the western United 
States and extends southward over Baja California, leaving 
Priscilla in an environment of weak steering currents.   In the 
short term, that should cause the storm to slow down and drift in a 
general northward direction for the next 36 hours.  After that 
time, Priscilla is expected to settle in to a more steady 
northwestward track as a stronger mid-level ridge builds over 
northern Mexico and the deep-layer trough remains entrenched over 
the western United States.  For most of the forecast period, the 
NHC track forecast leans on the eastern side of the guidance 
envelope, in the vicinity of the ECMWF, HCCA consensus aid, and 
Google DeepMind ensemble mean.

Priscilla will be moving over sea surface temperatures of about 29 
degrees Celsius during the next couple of days, coincident with a 
period of strong upper-level divergence.  These conditions should 
support strengthening, although the system's large size could limit 
the rate of intensification in the short term.  That said, some of 
the Rapid Intensification (RI) indices are greater than 50% within 
36 and 48 hours, so if Priscilla can develop a tighter inner core 
within the larger wind field, more significant strengthening would 
be possible.  The NHC intensity forecast calls for Priscilla to 
become a hurricane by Sunday night, with strengthening continuing 
through Tuesday.  Cooler water temperatures and a less favorable 
atmosphere should induce weakening by Wednesday and Thursday.

 
KEY MESSAGES:

1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the 
coast of southwestern Mexico within the watch area Sunday and 
Monday.  Interests in the southern portion of Baja California Sur 
should also monitor the progress of Priscilla.

2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Priscilla will impact coastal 
sections of southwestern Mexico through Monday, which could result 
in flash flooding, particularly in areas of higher terrain.

3.  Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico and will reach the coasts of 
west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California peninsula by 
Monday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and 
rip current conditions.

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
200 PM PDT Sat Oct 04 2025
 
Deep convection has continued to pulse today near the center of 
Octave. Recent visible and microwave satellite imagery indicates a 
well-organized inner-core structure, which was confirmed by a recent 
ASCAT scatterometer pass. Based on the current satellite 
presentation and a blend of subjective and objective satellite 
intensity estimates, the intensity is increased slightly to 55 kt 
for this advisory.
 
The storm has begun to turn more northward and is now moving 
north-northwestward with an estimated motion of 330/5 kt. A 
continued northward and eventual eastward turn is forecast this 
weekend and early next week. The track forecast depends somewhat on 
the interaction of Octave with Tropical Storm Priscilla to its east 
and a trough to its north during the next several days. The NHC 
track forecast for this advisory is similar to the prior advisory 
and represents a blend of track consensus aids and the Google 
DeepMind solution.
 
Vertical wind shear is expected to remain weak for the next 24 h.
During this period, conditions are forecast to remain marginally 
favorable for some slight intensification. However, after 24 h as 
Octave turns toward the east, wind shear is expected to increase as 
the storm interacts with trough and the larger tropical storm to 
its east. Late this weekend, Octave is forecast to begin a 
weakening trend that will continue until the system dissipates 
after 96 h. The current NHC intensity forecast is slightly higher
than the prior advisory during the next day or so, and it remains
near the middle of the guidance envelope.
