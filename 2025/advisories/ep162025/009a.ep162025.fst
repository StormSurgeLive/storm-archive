At 500 PM MST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Priscilla was
located near latitude 18.8 North, longitude 108.0 West. Priscilla is
moving toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A turn

west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur through the middle part 
of this week.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Strengthening is expected over the next day or two, and 
Priscilla is forecast to become a category 2 hurricane before 
weakening begins by midweek.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 972 mb (28.71 inches).

especially in areas of higher terrain.  Moisture from Priscilla
