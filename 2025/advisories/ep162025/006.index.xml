DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM MST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Priscilla was
located near latitude 16.7 North, longitude 107.3 West. Priscilla is
moving toward the north-northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h).  This
general motion with a bend to the northwest at a slightly faster 
forward speed is expected over the next few days.  On the forecast 
track, the center of the system is expected to move offshore of and 
parallel to the coast of southwestern Mexico and Baja California 
Sur through the early-to-middle part of this week
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is expected during the next few days, and
Priscilla is forecast to become a category 2 hurricane later this
week before weakening likely commences on Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles
(315 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 986 mb (29.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
along the southwestern coast of Mexico today into Monday.
 
RAINFALL: Outer bands from Priscilla will bring heavy rain to
portions of southwestern Mexico through Monday. Across coastal
portions of Michoac√°n and far western Guerrero, additional rainfall
amounts of 2 to 4 inches are expected, with local amounts up to 6
inches. Across Colima, western Jalisco, and the rest of Guerrero
along the coast, 1 to 3 inches of additional rainfall are expected.
This rainfall will bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in
areas of higher terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico and will reach portions of the coast of
west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California peninsula by
Monday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1100 PM MST.
Next complete advisory at 200 AM MST.

Hurricane Priscilla Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
200 PM MST Sun Oct 05 2025
 
Priscilla has become markedly better organized this afternoon. A 
well-defined curved band has formed along the southern semicircle 
of the tropical cyclone, and there have been occasional hints of a 
ragged eye showing up on the visible images. A scatterometer pass 
at 1713 UTC showed the circulation has become better embedded in 
the central dense overcast, though there haven't been any recent 
high-resolution microwave images to confirm that Priscilla is better 
vertically aligned.  Subjective Dvorak fixes from SAB and TAFB still 
support T4.0/65 kt, and the objective estimates from UW-CIMSS are 
also increasing, now in the 59-66 kt range. Thus, the initial 
intensity is being increased to 65 kt, making Priscilla the 10th 
hurricane of the 2025 Eastern Pacific Season. Wind radii were also 
adjusted based on the earlier scatterometer data. 

The hurricane continues to move very slowly, with a best guess at an 
estimated motion of 330/3 kt. There isn't much change to the track 
reasoning, with the current lack of motion mainly due to light 
steering currents from a weak ridge eroded by a larger mid- to 
upper-level trough over the western Gulf and Texas. This feature is 
expected to lift out, allowing the ridging over Mexico to gradually 
become re-established. The end result should cause Priscilla to 
gradually accelerate to the north-northwest with a subtle bend 
leftward over the next 2-3 days. There remains a notable amount of 
spread in the track guidance in 72 hours, with the GFS continuing to 
be on the far south and west side of the guidance envelope, and the 
ECMWF on the north and east side. The NHC track forecast is very 
similar to the prior one, splitting the difference between these 
outliers, and lies close to a blend of the HCCA and GDMI track 
aids. 

Shear analysis from UW-CIMSS indicates that the Priscilla is 
experiencing 20 kt of east-northeasterly shear, and yet the cyclone 
has been able to intensify, likely aided by plenty warm sea-surface 
temperatures, and ample deep-layer moisture. The shear is expected 
to stay about the same in magnitude over the next 2-3 days, and in 
general the intensity guidance has come up from the previous cycle. 
SHIPS rapid intensification (RI) indices are elevated, and if 
Priscilla can establish a tighter inner core, it is not out the 
question the hurricane could intensify more than shown here. For 
now, the NHC intensity forecast will show more gradual 
intensification, assuming the shear tempers a faster rate of 
deepening, but now has peak of 90 kt, a little higher than 
before. This is a bit higher than the HCCA intensity aid, but lower 
than some of the more aggressive models (HAFS-A/B, COAMPS-TC, 
Florida State Superensemble). After 72 h, Priscilla is forecast to 
move over a sharply cooling sea-surface temperature gradient, which 
should induce rapid weakening by the end of the forecast period.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the 
coast of southwestern Mexico within the watch area through Monday. 
Interests in the southern portion of Baja California Sur should also 
monitor the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Priscilla will impact coastal
sections of southwestern Mexico through Monday, which could result
in flash flooding, particularly in areas of higher terrain.
 
3.  Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico and will reach the coasts of
west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California peninsula by
Monday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.

Hurricane Octave Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
200 PM PDT Sun Oct 05 2025
 
The structure of Octave has changed little since the previous 
advisory. The low-level center continues to be underneath the 
eastern side of the tightly wound curved banding, associated with 
the core of the hurricane.  There continues to be hints of an eye 
in visible satellite imagery.  Subjective Dvorak estimates are a 
consensus 65 kt from TAFB and SAB, while objective intensity 
estimates range from 55-80 kt.  The initial intensity is held at 70 
kt.

The initial motion estimate is slightly faster toward the northeast, 
or 055 degrees at 5 kt.  A turn toward the east at a slightly faster 
forward speed is expected Monday as the cyclone is pushed in that 
direction by an upper-level trough to its northwest.  By early 
Tuesday, the main weather feature affecting Octave's track will 
likely be a large and powerful Priscilla, which should cause Octave 
to turn toward the east-southeast.  By Wednesday, models are in 
agreement that Octave should be located south of Priscilla.  Once 
Octave gets southeast of Priscilla, an acceleration toward the 
northeast is expected until Octave's circulation likely dissipates 
in a little less than 4 days.  The NHC forecast has been adjusted 
slightly to the north of the previous official forecast through 60 
hours, and lies roughly in between the latest GFEX and the Google 
Deep Mind Ensemble mean.

Octave is straddling the sea-surface temperature (SST) gradient and 
is forecast to move parallel to the SST gradient for the next couple 
of days, with the eye likely to encounter SSTs in the 26 to 26.5 
degree C range.  Wind shear should remain relatively low through the 
next 24-36 hours.  Octave is forecast to gradually encounter a 
slightly drier and more stable airmass on Monday.  All of the models 
show Octave weakening beginning shortly, but given the environmental 
conditions, it wouldn't be surprising to see the cyclone maintain 
its intensity for another 12-24 h.  The NHC intensity forecast is 
near the high end of the model guidance for the first 24 h, then 
lies near the middle of the guidance envelope thereafter.  By 36 h, 
increasing easterly shear, partially the result of the outflow from 
Priscilla, is expected to lead to weakening.  Model guidance 
suggests that either Octave will be absorbed by the stronger 
Priscilla or that the outflow from Priscilla will disrupt Octave's 
circulation, opening it into a trough.  Regardless of which scenario 
occurs, Octave should dissipate within 4 days.
