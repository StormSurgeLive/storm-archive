SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Punta San Telmo to Punta Mita, Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests in southern Baja California Sur should monitor the
progress of Priscilla.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM MST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Priscilla was 
located near latitude 16.3 North, longitude 106.9 West. Priscilla is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h) and this 
general motion at a slightly faster forward speed is expected over 
the next few days.  On the forecast track, the center of the system 
is expected to move offshore of and parallel to the coast of 
southwestern Mexico through the early part of this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast during the next 48 
hours, and Priscilla is likely to become a hurricane over the next 
day or so. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.27 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
along the southwestern coast of Mexico today and Monday.
 
RAINFALL: Outer bands from Priscilla will bring heavy rain to
portions of southwestern Mexico through Monday. Across coastal
portions of Michoacán and far western Guerrero, rainfall amounts of
4 to 6 inches are expected, with local amounts up to 8 inches.
Across Colima, western Jalisco, and the rest of Guerrero along the
coast, 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected. This rainfall will bring
a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas of higher terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico and will reach portions of the coast of
west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California peninsula by
Monday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM MST.

Tropical Storm Priscilla Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
200 AM MST Sun Oct 05 2025
 
Priscilla is strengthening.  The storm is producing very deep
convection, with coldest cloud tops of near -80 deg C, over the
southern and western portion of the circulation and convective
banding features are becoming better defined.  The advisory
intensity is set at 55 kt based on subjective Dvorak T-numbers from 
TAFB and SAB, along with ASCAT observations.
 
Since the center is still not very clearly-defined, the initial
motion estimate is a somewhat uncertain 325/4 kt.  Steering
currents remain weak over the area, and there may be some shifts in
the center position due to re-organization of the system.
Nonetheless, Priscilla is expected to move on the western side of a
ridge over northwestern Mexico and the southeastern side of a
mid-level trough off the California coast.  This should result in a
generally northwestward track with some increase in forward speed
during the next few days.  The cross-track model spread increases
greatly at days 3-5. This is likely related to differences in
the amplitude of the upper trough off the U.S. West Coast, and the
strength and positioning of the ridge over northern Mexico during
this period. The official track forecast is close to the previous
one and is on the northern side of the guidance suite.
 
Priscilla is over very warm waters and within a highly moist low-
to mid-level air mass.  These conditions are conducive for
significant strengthening.  However, moderate easterly shear is
expected to prevail over the system during the next few days, which
could at least partially counteract the otherwise conducive factors
for intensification.  The official intensity forecast is about the
same as the previous one and on the high side of the model
intensity guidance envelope.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico within the watch area today and
Monday. Interests in the southern portion of Baja California Sur
should monitor the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Priscilla will impact coastal
sections of southwestern Mexico through Monday, which could result
in flash flooding, particularly in areas of higher terrain.
 
3.  Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico and will reach the coasts of
west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California peninsula by
Monday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
200 AM PDT Sun Oct 05 2025
 
Satellite imagery indicates that Octave remains a compact tropical 
cyclone, with the diameter of its central dense overcast (CDO) near 
150 miles. Intermittent bursts of deep convection continue near the 
embedded center, with cloud-top temperatures occasionally exceeding 
−80 degrees C. Subjective Dvorak Current Intensity estimates are 
4.0/65 kt from TAFB and 3.5/55 kt from SAB, while objective 
estimates are as high as 60 kt. An ASCAT-B pass at 0534 UTC 
depicted the small and compact system, with peak surface winds just 
over 50 kt and tropical-storm-force winds extending only about 60 n 
mi from the center. A blend of these data supports an initial 
intensity of 60 kt for this advisory.

Octave is now moving slowly north-northeastward at about 3 kt, and 
this motion is expected to continue today while the storm gradually 
turns northeastward within a weak steering pattern between an 
upper-level trough along the U.S. West Coast and Tropical Cyclone 
Priscilla, which is drifting northwestward well to the east off the 
southwestern coast of Mexico. Beginning Monday, Octave should turn 
eastward and gradually accelerate. By midweek, forecast uncertainty 
increases significantly as Octave becomes increasingly influenced by 
Priscilla’s evolution and track. The new NHC forecast track is very 
similar to the previous advisory and closely follows the consensus 
aids, with Octave expected to dissipate by day 5 (Thursday night) as 
it becomes absorbed by the larger Tropical Cyclone Priscilla.

Octave has intensified slightly since the previous advisory, and 
with the environment remaining marginally conducive for the next 12 
to 18 hours, some additional strengthening cannot be ruled out. 
Guidance, however, generally supports the intensity holding steady 
during this period, which is reflected in this forecast through the 
day today. Thereafter, increasing vertical wind shear, combined with 
the interaction with Priscilla, should induce a gradual weakening 
trend. Octave is forecast to open up into a trough and be absorbed 
by Priscilla by the end of the forecast period. The intensity 
forecast remains close to the previous NHC advisory and near the 
middle to upper portion of the guidance envelope.
