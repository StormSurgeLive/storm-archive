hours.
 
RAINFALL: As Priscilla moves off the west coast of Baja California,
up to an inch of rain is expected across the Baja California 
peninsula.  Farther north across the southwestern United States, 
heavy rain from Priscillaâ€™s moisture is expected to lead to 2 to 4 
inches, with local storm total amounts to 6 inches, across portions 
of central and northern Arizona, southern Utah, and southwest 
Colorado through Saturday afternoon.  Scattered occurrences of flash 
flooding are anticipated from central Arizona across southern Utah 
across the Four Corners into southwest Colorado and far northwest 
New Mexico.

SURF: Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting the Pacific
coast of Baja California Sur as well as portions of coastal
southwestern and west-central Mexico. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, in addition
to some coastal flooding. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
