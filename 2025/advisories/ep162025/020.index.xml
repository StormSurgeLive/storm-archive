DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Priscilla was
located near latitude 23.8 North, longitude 114.7 West. Priscilla is
moving toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A turn 
toward the north is anticipated later today and tonight. On the 
forecast track, the center of Priscilla is expected to move
parallel to, but offshore of, the coast of Baja California Sur.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Weakening is forecast, and Priscilla is expected to 
become a post-tropical cyclone by Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Gusty winds will be possible along the west coast of Baja
California Sur today.
 
RAINFALL:  As Priscilla moves off the west coast of Baja California,
up to an inch of rain is expected across the Baja California
peninsula.  For the southwestern United States, 2 to 4 inches of
rain, with local storm total maxima to 6 inches, are expected across
portions of central and northern Arizona, southern Utah, and
southwest Colorado through Saturday.  Flash flooding is likely in 
portions of central Arizona, with scattered areas of flash flooding 
expected across the remainder of Arizona, southern Utah, southwest 
Colorado, and far northwest New Mexico.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting the Pacific
coast of Baja California Sur as well as portions of coastal
southwestern and west-central Mexico.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, in addition
to some coastal flooding. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

Tropical Storm Priscilla Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
200 AM MST Thu Oct 09 2025
 
Priscilla has been gradually losing its organized deep convection
overnight.  As a result, objective and subjective satellite 
intensity estimates have fallen, and the initial intensity is 
lowered to 45 kt for this advisory.  While scatterometer data did 
not measure the core of the storm, it did show tropical-storm-force 
winds about 40 miles offshore of Baja California Sur.  The wind 
radii have been adjusted accordingly.
 
The estimated motion is northwestward at 7 kt.  As Priscilla becomes 
a shallow vortex, it is expected to turn north-northwestward later 
this morning in the low-level flow. By Friday, the system should 
slow and drift northward, stalling off the coast of the Baja 
California Peninsula until the circulation opens into a trough.
 
The storm has moved over the 26 degree C isotherm toward 
progressively cooler waters.  Mid-level humidities are also falling, 
and vertical wind shear is forecast to increase substantially.  
These atmospheric and oceanic conditions should accelerate 
Priscilla's transition into a post-tropical cyclone.  The latest NHC 
intensity forecast now calls for Priscilla to become a post-tropical 
cyclone in 24 hours and dissipate off the coast of Baja California 
in a couple of days or so.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Baja California
Sur Pacific coastline within the Tropical Storm Watch area for the
next several hours.  Interests elsewhere in the Baja California
peninsula should monitor the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.  Moisture associated with Priscilla will lead to heavy rainfall
and a flash flood risk across portions of Arizona, southern Utah,
through the Four Corners into southwest Colorado and far northwest
New Mexico through Saturday.
 
3.  Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting the Pacific
coast of Baja California Sur as well as portions of the coast of
southwestern and west-central Mexico. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, in addition
to some coastal flooding.

* Zihuatanejo to Cabo Corrientes, Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within the next 36
hours.
 
Interests in southern Baja California Sur should monitor the
progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM CST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression
Seventeen-E was located near latitude 16.2 North, longitude 100.8
West.  The depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 14 
mph (22 km/h), and this general motion is expected to continue 
through early Friday.  A turn toward the northwest is expected by 
late Friday, followed by a northward turn by early Sunday.  On the 
forecast track, the center of the depression is expected to move 
parallel to the southwestern coast of Mexico through Friday and 
then be near southern Baja California Sur Saturday and Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast through Friday, but weakening is 
likely over the weekend.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the eastern 
part of the watch area later today and could spread westward across 
the remainder of the area through late Friday.

RAINFALL: Outer bands from the tropical depression will bring heavy 
rain to portions of southwestern Mexico through Saturday.  Across 
coastal portions of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoacán, Colima, and 
Jalisco, rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches are expected, with local 
amounts of 6 inches or more in Guerrero and Michoacán. This rainfall 
will bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas of higher 
terrain.  Moisture from the tropical depression will bring the 
potential for additional heavy rainfall over portions of the 
Southwest U.S. early next week.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with the depression, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are expected to spread
westward along the southwestern coast of Mexico through Friday and
reach southern Baja California Sur on Saturday.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Tropical Depression Seventeen-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172025
900 AM CST Thu Oct 09 2025
 
The large area of disturbed weather located near the southwestern 
coast of Mexico (Invest 90E) has continued to gain organization.  
Convective banding has become more evident in the southern and 
western part of the circulation, and the latest Dvorak estimates 
from TAFB and SAB are T2.0 and T1.5, respectively.  The convective 
pattern does suggest that the circulation might still be a bit 
elongated, but hourly observations from a cruise ship, the 
Norwegian Joy (C6CX3), helped to locate the main center of 
circulation, pressure minimum, and estimated winds.  The 
circulation and convection are now organized enough to classify the 
system as a tropical depression.

The center we're now tracking is somewhat discontinuous from a 
feature we were tracking yesterday farther to the east, and the 
initial motion is a rough estimate of west-northwestward, or 285/12 
kt.  Strong mid-level ridging over northern Mexico and the 
south-central U.S. is expected to steer the depression on a quick 
west-northwestward to northwestward track during the next 48 hours, 
with the center paralleling the southwestern coast of Mexico through 
late Friday.  The system is then likely to round the western 
periphery of the high and move toward the Baja California peninsula 
in 2-3 days.  The model guidance is in fairly good agreement for 
this first forecast, and the NHC track is close to a blend of the 
TVCE and HCCA consensus aids.

The depression is being affected by strong easterly shear which is 
likely to continue for the next 24 hours.  However, the system is 
also over very warm waters (29-30 degrees Celsius), in an 
environment of strong upper-level divergence, and moving 
quickly, which should all allow for some modest strengthening 
during that time.  The NHC forecast is near the top end of 
the guidance and close to the HCCA aid in the short term.  Although 
the shear is forecast to decrease some after 24 hours, the 
mid-level environment is expected to become drier and more stable 
while the upper-level winds become more convergent.  Those changes 
should induce weakening while the system is approaching the southern 
Baja California peninsula.  Although a remnant low point is 
provided over northwestern Mexico on day 4, it is likely that the 
system will dissipate before that time.

KEY MESSAGES:

1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the 
coast of southwestern Mexico through late Friday.  Interests in 
southern Baja California Sur should monitor the progress of the 
system.

2.  Heavy rainfall associated with the tropical depression will 
impact coastal sections of southwestern Mexico through Saturday, 
which could result in flash flooding, particularly in areas of 
higher terrain.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Octave Discussion Number  38
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
800 AM MST Thu Oct 09 2025
 
Octave's low-level center has become exposed due to increasing wind 
shear. The small area of convection that the system had produced 
overnight has collapsed. Given the wind shear, Octave is not 
forecast to regain convection and thus is designated as a remnant 
low with an initial intensity of 30 kt. The center of Octave has 
already become a little more ragged on satellite imagery and the 
system is expected to open up into a trough and dissipate later 
today.
 
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system.  For additional information on the remnant
low please see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather
Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and
on the web at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php
