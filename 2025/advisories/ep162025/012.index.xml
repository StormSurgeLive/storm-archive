None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Baja California Sur from Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lazaro,
Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area.
 
Interests elsewhere in the Baja California peninsula should monitor
the progress of Priscilla.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Priscilla was
located near latitude 19.8 North, longitude 110.1 West. Priscilla is
moving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h) and a continued
northwestward motion is expected over the next couple of days,
followed by a turn toward the north Thursday night or Friday. On the
forecast track, the center of Priscilla is expected to move parallel
to, but offshore of, the coast of west-central Mexico and Baja
California Sur during the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 110 mph (175 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is expected, and 
Priscilla is forecast to become a major hurricane later today.  
Weakening is forecast to begin on Wednesday and continue through the 
rest of the week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 50 miles (85 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).  Socorro island, located about 80 miles (130 km) southwest
of Priscilla's eye, recently reported a sustained wind of 52 mph
(84 km/h) with a gust of 75 mph (120 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 959 mb (28.32 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Pacific coast
of Baja California Sur within the watch area later today and
Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: From today into Wednesday, 1 to 2 inches of rain are
expected in southern Baja California Sur, with local storm totals up
to 4 inches as the outer bands of Priscilla reach the area. This
rainfall could bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas
of higher terrain.  Moisture from Priscilla should bring 1 to 2
inches of rain, with local amounts to 4 inches, to portions of
west-central Mexico, which could lead to flash flooding within the
areaâ€™s terrain.  From late this week into this weekend, moisture
from Priscilla leads to heavy rainfall and a flash flood risk over
portions of the U.S. Desert Southwest.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as portions
of the coast of the southern Baja California peninsula. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1100 AM MST.
Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

Hurricane Priscilla Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
200 AM MST Tue Oct 07 2025
 
Priscilla is strengthening early this morning. The inner core
structure has improved, with deep convective cloud tops surrounding
the center of the hurricane. An eye feature has recently emerged in
proxy-visible and infrared satellite images. ASCAT-C data from 04
UTC show the tropical-storm-force wind field remains quite broad,
but the radius of maximum wind appears to have contracted from prior
estimates. The initial intensity is raised to 85 kt, representing a
blend of recent UW-CIMSS DPRINT estimates (79-87 kt) and a 5.0/90 kt
Dvorak classification from TAFB at 06 UTC.
 
The intensity of Priscilla is likely to peak in the next 12-24 h 
while the hurricane remains over warm waters and in a moist, 
moderate shear environment. Given the rapidly improving satellite 
structure, the NHC forecast shows Priscilla nearing major hurricane 
strength later today, in best agreement with the HAFS regional 
models. Thereafter, the hurricane is expected to move over 
progressively cooler waters and into a drier mid-level environment 
while gaining latitude. Thus, the NHC forecast calls for steady 
weakening beginning Wednesday and continuing through the rest of the 
week. Southwesterly shear is forecast to increase over Priscilla as 
it approaches the Baja California peninsula in 96-120 h, and 
Priscilla could become post-tropical by late Friday or Saturday if 
its convection is stripped away as shown in the GFS and ECMWF 
simulated satellite imagery. This enhanced moisture is likely to be 
transported northward over portions of the southwestern U.S. late 
this week, resulting in the potential for heavy rainfall.
 
The hurricane is moving northwestward (310/9 kt) around the
southwestern portion of a mid-level ridge over northern Mexico. This
motion should continue for the next couple of days while the center
of Priscilla moves parallel to, but remains offshore of, the
southern Baja California peninsula. By Thursday, an amplifying
trough off the U.S. West Coast is forecast to erode the steering
ridge to the north of Priscilla. The weakness in the ridge should
induce a northward turn later this week and into the weekend. The
updated NHC track forecast lies slightly to the left of the
previous prediction. This is mostly related to an initial position
adjustment based on earlier microwave and scatterometer data that
indicated Priscilla was slightly south of previous estimates.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Baja California
Sur Pacific coastline within the Tropical Storm Watch area later
today into Wednesday. Interests elsewhere in the Baja California
peninsula should monitor the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Priscilla will impact portions of
southern Baja California Sur, which could result in flash flooding,
particularly in areas of higher terrain.
 
3.  Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico as well as the coast
of the southern Baja California peninsula. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
800 AM PDT Tue Oct 07 2025

Octave is maintaining some clusters of deep convection primarily 
over the western portions of its circulation.  However, convective 
banding features are mostly lacking.  There is some limited 
upper-level outflow over the southern semicircle of the system.  The 
estimated intensity is held at 45 kt for this advisory, although 
this might be generous given the satellite appearance of the storm 
and an earlier scatterometer overpass.

The cyclone center is estimated to be near the southeastern side of 
the main area of deep convection, with an initial motion of around 
110/6 kt.  Octave is currently embedded within a broad area of low- 
to mid-level westerlies, and this should maintain a mainly eastward 
motion for the next day or so.  Later, the system should move 
east-northeastward as it becomes partially entrained into the large 
circulation of Hurricane Priscilla centered several hundred miles 
to its east-northeast.  The official forecast is close to the 
previous one and in good agreement with the simple and corrected 
consensus track model guidance.
 
Easterly vertical wind shear is expected to increase over Octave, 
and the low-level circulation of the storm should become 
increasingly disrupted by the influence of Priscilla.  So, 
although the system should remain over marginally warm SSTs during 
the next few days, the upper- and lower-level flow environment is 
likely to become less conducive during the next 48 hours.  Octave 
is forecast to weaken to dissipation in 60-72 hours.  This is 
similar to the previous official forecast and the model consensus.
