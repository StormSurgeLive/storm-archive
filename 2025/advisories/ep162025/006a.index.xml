DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM MST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Priscilla was
located near latitude 16.9 North, longitude 107.2 West.  Priscilla 
is moving toward the north-northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h).  This
general motion with a bend to the northwest at a slightly faster 
forward speed is expected over the next few days.  On the forecast 
track, the center of the system is expected to move offshore of and 
parallel to the coast of southwestern Mexico and Baja California 
Sur through the early-to-middle part of this week.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is expected during 
the next few days, and Priscilla is forecast to become a category 2 
hurricane later this week before weakening likely commences on 
Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195
miles (315 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 984 mb (29.06 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
along the southwestern coast of Mexico tonight and into Monday.
 
RAINFALL: Outer bands from Priscilla will bring heavy rain to
portions of southwestern Mexico through Monday.  Across coastal
portions of Michoac√°n and far western Guerrero, additional rainfall
amounts of 2 to 4 inches are expected, with local amounts up to 6
inches.  Across Colima, western Jalisco, and the rest of Guerrero
along the coast, 1 to 3 inches of additional rainfall are expected.
This rainfall will bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in
areas of higher terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Priscilla have begun to affect portions 
of the coast of southwestern Mexico and will reach portions of the 
coast of west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California 
peninsula by Monday.  These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM MST.

Hurricane Priscilla Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
800 PM MST Sun Oct 05 2025

The satellite appearance of Priscilla has become more ragged since 
the last advisory, with very deep but asymmetric convection in the 
southeastern portion of the hurricane's eyewall.  While there have 
been no recent microwave images to confirm, it does appear that the 
hurricane is still having trouble becoming vertically stacked.  The 
initial intensity remains 65 kt, which remains close to a consensus 
of various estimates.  

There is no change to the initial motion, 330/3 kt, with Priscilla 
moving slowly due to a distant ridge.  A track more to the 
northwest with some acceleration is expected by late tomorrow as 
ridging becomes better established over Mexico.  There continues to 
be a lot of spread in the guidance, with the GFS continuing to
be on the far south and west side of the guidance envelope, and the
ECMWF on the north and east side.  The new forecast remains on the 
northern side of the guidance envelope, closest to a blend of the 
NOAA corrected consensus aid HCCA and the Google DeepMind ensemble 
GDMI.

Moderate northeasterly shear persists near Priscilla, which is 
probably causing the less organized current structure.  Model 
guidance is fairly consistent that the hurricane will adjust to 
this shear given the other very conducive conditions including warm 
waters and high mid-level humidities, causing gradual 
strengthening.  The chances for rapid intensification should be 
monitored in case Priscilla gets a tighter inner core.  The new 
forecast is very similar to the previous one, on the higher side of 
the intensity consensus.  Significant weakening is expected to 
start in about 3 days due to the hurricane moving across a sharp 
SST gradient into cool waters. 
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico within the watch area through Monday.
Interests in the southern portion of Baja California Sur should also
monitor the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Priscilla will impact coastal
sections of southwestern Mexico through Monday, which could result
in flash flooding, particularly in areas of higher terrain.
 
3.  Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico and will reach the coasts of
west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California peninsula by
Monday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.

Hurricane Octave Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
800 PM PDT Sun Oct 05 2025
 
Octave continues to show some signs of strengthening.  Geostationary
satellite data show hints of an eye in the infrared and last-light
visible imagery.  A 2358 UTC GPM microwave pass suggested Octave
still had a small, slightly tilted inner core.  The initial
intensity is nudged up to 75 kt to represent a blend of the 
objective and subjective Dvorak estimates.
 
The hurricane is moving northeastward at 6 kt and is expected to
turn eastward on Monday.  Octave is forecast to follow in the wake
of the larger Hurricane Priscilla, which should cause Octave to bend
to the east-southeast on Tuesday, followed by a turn back towards
the northeast on Wednesday.  There is a lot of spread in the model
guidance by the end of the forecast period, and this portion of the
forecast is considered highly uncertain.  The official track
prediction lies between the Google DeepMind and corrected consensus
aids, slightly north of the previous forecast.
 
Global models suggest Octave may have hit its high note.  The center
of the hurricane has shifted north of the 26 degree C isotherm and
the vertical wind shear is expected to gradually strengthen.  After
a couple of days, the shear should drastically increase as Octave
nears the outflow of Priscilla which will accelerate weakening.  Few
changes have been made to the latest NHC forecast and dissipation is
still expected within 4 days.
