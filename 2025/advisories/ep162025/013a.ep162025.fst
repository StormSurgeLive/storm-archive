DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK

At 500 PM MST (0000 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Priscilla was 
located near latitude 20.3 North, longitude 111.2 West. Priscilla is 
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this motion is 
expected to continue for the next couple of days, followed by a turn 
toward the north Thursday night. On the forecast track, the center 
of Priscilla is expected to move parallel to, but offshore of, the 
coast of Baja California Sur through Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 110 mph (175 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected through tonight. 
Weakening is forecast to begin on Wednesday and continue through the 
rest of the week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles 
(295 km). A weather station on Socorro island, located about 105 
miles (170 km) south of Priscilla's eye, recently reported a 
sustained wind of 52 mph (84 km/h) with a gust of 73 mph (117 km/h). 
An elevated station near Cabo San Lucas in Baja California Sur also

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Pacific coast
of Baja California Sur within the watch area later today through
Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: From today into Wednesday, 1 to 2 inches of rain are 
expected in southern Baja California Sur, with local storm totals up 
to 4 inches as the outer bands of Priscilla reach the area. This 
rainfall could bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas 
of higher terrain.  Moisture from Priscilla should bring 1 to 2 
inches of rain, with local amounts to 4 inches, to portions of 
west-central Mexico, which could lead to flash flooding within the 
areaâ€™s terrain.  From late this week into this weekend, moisture 
from Priscilla may lead to heavy rainfall and a flash flood risk 
over portions of the U.S. Desert Southwest.

associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service

SURF: Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of
the coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as
portions of the coast of the southern Baja California peninsula.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions, in addition to some coastal flooding. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
