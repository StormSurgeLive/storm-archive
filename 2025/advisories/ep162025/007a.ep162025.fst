DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM MST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Priscilla was 
located near latitude 17.3 North, longitude 107.4 West. Priscilla is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h). This general 
motion with a bend to the northwest at a slightly faster forward 
speed is expected over the next few days. On the forecast track, the 
center of the system is expected to move offshore of and parallel to 
the coast of southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur through the 
early-to-middle part of this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast, and Priscilla is 
expected to become a category 2 hurricane, and could approach major 
hurricane status within the next couple of days before weakening 
likely commences by midweek.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195
miles (315 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 975 mb (28.80 inches).
