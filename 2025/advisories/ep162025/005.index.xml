DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Priscilla was 
located near latitude 16.4 North, longitude 107.1 West. Priscilla is 
moving slowly toward the north-northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h) and 
this general motion at a slightly faster forward speed is expected 
over the next few days. On the forecast track, the center of the 
system is expected to move offshore of and parallel to the coast of 
southwestern Mexico through the early part of this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is expected during the 
next several days, and Priscilla is forecast to become a category 2 
hurricane later this week. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 986 mb (29.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
along the southwestern coast of Mexico today into Monday.
 
RAINFALL: Outer bands from Priscilla will bring heavy rain to
portions of southwestern Mexico through Monday. Across coastal
portions of Michoac√°n and far western Guerrero, additional rainfall
amounts of 2 to 4 inches are expected, with local amounts up to 6
inches. Across Colima, western Jalisco, and the rest of Guerrero
along the coast, 1 to 3 inches of additional rainfall are expected.
This rainfall will bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in
areas of higher terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico and will reach portions of the coast of
west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California peninsula by
Monday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 500 PM MST.
Next complete advisory at 800 PM MST.

      <title>Tropical Storm Priscilla Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>

Tropical Storm Priscilla Discussion Number   4...Corrected
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
800 AM MST Sun Oct 05 2025

Corrected typo in the first sentence

After the last advisory, a helpful AMSR2 pass revealed that 
Priscilla remains tilted vertically near its core, with the 
low-level center on 37 GHz being located north of the mid-level 
center seen on 89 GHz, with no evidence of an eye feature showing up 
yet. Some of this misalignment could be due to 15-20 kt of 
northeasterly shear affecting the tropical storm. The 12 UTC 
subjective Dvorak fixes from TAFB and SAB were both T4.0/65-kt, but 
given the earlier AMSR2 structure, the initial intensity is being 
held at 55 kt this advisory, closer to the lower ADT and SATCON 
intensity estimates.
 
Priscilla does not appear to be in a hurry to move anywhere, with
the latest estimated motion essentially a north-northwest drift at
330/3 kt. The lack of much forward motion is related to weaker than
usual mid-level ridging placed to its north, which has been eroded
by a larger mid- to upper-level trough currently over the western
Gulf and Texas. This feature is expected to lift north and out,
allowing the ridging over Mexico to gradually become re-established.
The end result should cause Priscilla to gradually accelerate to the
north-northwest with a subtle bend leftward over the next 2-3 days.
As mentioned previously, the cross-track spread in the track
guidance increases after this point, related to a digging
upper-level trough off the U.S. West coast that will erode the ridge
once again. The track guidance overall is a bit slower than the
previous cycle, and the NHC track forecast was also adjusted slower,
but still along the previous forecast track, close to the HCCA and
GDMI track aids.
 
While Priscilla is producing a lot of very deep convection, with
tops as cold at -80 to -85C, it does not appear to be right over the
center, but rather displaced south due to the tropical cyclone's
current tilt. This structure could also be causing some dry air to
be ingested into the system's core, resulting in this short-term
hiccup in intensification. Since Priscilla's large-scale environment
remains moist, it is assumed that the storm will mix out this dry
air and soon resume strengthening, likely becoming a hurricane
before the end of the day. However, northeasterly vertical wind
shear is still expected to remain between 15-20 kt over the next
36-48 hours, and that could temper a faster rate of intensification
than shown in the NHC intensity forecast. None the less, a peak of
85 kt is a little higher than the prior cycle, following the trends
in the intensity guidance. There is some spread in the
hurricane-regional model guidance, with both HAFS-A/B showing a
higher peak intensity than the HWRF/HMON runs. The latest intensity
forecast opts to split the difference, and lies near the latest HFIP
Corrected Consensus aid. Towards the end of the forecast, the system
will be moving over a sharply cooling sea-surface temperature
gradient, which should induce a weakening trend.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico within the watch area today and
Monday. Interests in the southern portion of Baja California Sur
should monitor the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Priscilla will impact coastal
sections of southwestern Mexico through Monday, which could result
in flash flooding, particularly in areas of higher terrain.
 
3.  Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico and will reach the coasts of
west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California peninsula by
Monday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.

Hurricane Octave Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
800 AM PDT Sun Oct 05 2025

Octave has become better organized since the previous advisory, with 
banded convection becoming more prominent on the east side of the 
center.  A 05/1008 UTC AMSR2 pass showed an eye on microwave 
imagery.  Some earlier GOES-18 images from around 1100-1200 UTC 
showed a possible eye, but deep, banded convection has covered it up 
since that time.  Objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS have 
risen to the 60-75 kt range, while the TAFB Dvorak estimate remains 
T-4.0/65 kt.  Based on the aforementioned intensity estimates, as 
well as the improved inner-core organization as noted on microwave 
images, Octave's initial intensity is increased to 70 kt, making it 
the ninth hurricane of the 2025 east Pacific hurricane season.

Octave appears to be drifting slowly northeastward, or 045 degrees 
at 3 kt.  A turn toward the east at a slightly faster forward speed 
is expected Monday as the cyclone is pushed in that direction by an 
upper-level trough to its northwest.  By early Tuesday, the main 
weather feature affecting Octave's track will likely be a large and 
powerful Priscilla, which should cause Octave to turn toward the 
east-southeast.  By Wednesday, models are in agreement that Octave 
should be located south of Priscilla.  Once Octave gets southeast of 
Priscilla, an acceleration toward the northeast is expected.  The 
new NHC track forecast takes Octave a bit faster toward the east, 
but not quite as fast as the latest HFIP Corrected Consensus (HCCA) 
model.  The official forecast lies a bit south of the latest Google 
Deep Mind ensemble mean.

Octave is currently moving through sea-surface temperatures between 
26 and 27 degrees C, and it is forecast to remain over similar water 
temperatures for the remainder of its lifetime.  The shear is 
expected to remain fairly low for another 24-36 h.  A decent number 
of typically reliable intensity models are showing weakening, 
especially in the 12 to 36 hour period, so confidence is not very 
high as to whether Octave could strengthen slightly, maintain its 
intensity, or weaken during the next day or so.  The new NHC 
intensity forecast is higher than the previous one (mainly due to 
the stronger initial intensity), and is near the higher end of the 
guidance over the first day.  By 36 h, increasing easterly shear, 
partially the result of the outflow from Priscilla, is expected to 
lead to weakening.  The NHC intensity forecast is closer to the 
middle of the guidance envelope from 36 h onward.  Octave is 
forecast to dissipate in 4 to 5 days as it becomes absorbed by the 
larger circulation of Priscilla, and the models are in pretty good 
agreement on this scenario.
