None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Baja California Sur from Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lazaro,
Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area.
 
Interests elsewhere in the Baja California peninsula should monitor
the progress of Priscilla.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM MST (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Priscilla was 
located near latitude 19.8 North, longitude 110.6 West. Priscilla is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A 
northwestward motion is expected over the next couple of days, 
followed by a turn toward the north Thursday night or Friday. On the 
forecast track, the center of Priscilla is expected to move parallel 
to, but offshore of, the coast of west-central Mexico and Baja 
California Sur during the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 110 mph (175 km/h) with higher
gusts. Additional strengthening is expected, and Priscilla is 
forecast to become a major hurricane later today. Weakening is 
forecast to begin on Wednesday and continue through the rest of the 
week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 50 miles (85 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185
miles (295 km). Socorro island, located about 70 miles (115 km) 
south-southwest of Priscilla's eye, recently recorded a sustained 
wind of 55 mph (89 km/h) with a gust of 76 mph (122 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 959 mb (28.32 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Pacific coast
of Baja California Sur within the watch area later today and
Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: From today into Wednesday, 1 to 2 inches of rain are
expected in southern Baja California Sur, with local storm totals up
to 4 inches as the outer bands of Priscilla reach the area. This
rainfall could bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas
of higher terrain.  Moisture from Priscilla should bring 1 to 2
inches of rain, with local amounts to 4 inches, to portions of
west-central Mexico, which could lead to flash flooding within the
areaâ€™s terrain.  From late this week into this weekend, moisture
from Priscilla leads to heavy rainfall and a flash flood risk over
portions of the U.S. Desert Southwest.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as portions
of the coast of the southern Baja California peninsula. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

Hurricane Priscilla Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
800 AM MST Tue Oct 07 2025
 
Cloud top temperatures associated with Priscilla's eyewall 
convection continue to cool, and the structure of the eye has 
gradually been improving over the past 6 h.  Subjective Dvorak 
classifications from TAFB and SAB range from 90-102 kt, and 
objective numbers have risen to the 88-102 kt range.  The initial 
intensity has been raised to 95 kt, which is an average of the 
latest satellite estimates.
 
Intensity guidance is in good agreement that Priscilla should peak 
in strength in about 12 hours or so while the hurricane remains over 
warm waters and in a moist, moderate shear environment. Priscilla is 
now explicitly forecast to become a category 3 hurricane over the 
next 12 hours.  After that, the hurricane is forecast to move over 
progressively cooler waters, reaching the 26 degree C sea-surface 
temperature isotherm around hour 36.  Priscilla will also be moving 
into a drier environment as it gains latitude.  Therefore, the NHC 
forecast calls for weakening beginning Wednesday. Southwesterly 
vertical wind shear is forecast to increase over the cyclone in 3 to 
4 days, and simulated satellite images from the GFS and ECMWF models 
indicates that Priscilla should lose its convection and become a 
remnant low shortly before the system reaches the Baja California 
peninsula.  Enhanced moisture is likely to be transported northward 
over portions of the southwestern U.S. late this week, resulting in 
the potential for heavy rainfall.
 
The hurricane is moving northwestward (305/9 kt) around the
southwestern portion of a mid-level ridge over northern Mexico. This
motion should continue for the next couple of days while the center
of Priscilla moves parallel to, but remains offshore of, the
southern Baja California peninsula.  By Thursday, an amplifying
trough off the U.S. West Coast is forecast to erode the steering
ridge to the north of Priscilla.  The weakness in the ridge should
induce a northward turn later this week and into the weekend.  The
track models are in fairly good agreement through about 60 h.
Thereafter, spread increases, mainly in the along-track direction.
The new NHC track forecast is nearly on top of the previous
prediction, perhaps a tad faster, and lies in between the faster
HFIP Corrected Consensus (HCCA) and the slower Google Deep Mind
Ensemble Mean.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Baja California
Sur Pacific coastline within the Tropical Storm Watch area later
today into Wednesday. Interests elsewhere in the Baja California
peninsula should monitor the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Priscilla will impact portions of
Baja California Sur today into Wednesday. Its moisture will lead to
heavy rainfall across west-central Mexico from today into Thursday
morning and across the U.S. Desert Southwest from late this week
into this weekend, which could result in flash flooding,
particularly in areas of higher terrain.
 
3.  Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico as well as the coast
of the southern Baja California peninsula. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
800 AM PDT Tue Oct 07 2025

Octave is maintaining some clusters of deep convection primarily 
over the western portions of its circulation.  However, convective 
banding features are mostly lacking.  There is some limited 
upper-level outflow over the southern semicircle of the system.  The 
estimated intensity is held at 45 kt for this advisory, although 
this might be generous given the satellite appearance of the storm 
and an earlier scatterometer overpass.

The cyclone center is estimated to be near the southeastern side of 
the main area of deep convection, with an initial motion of around 
110/6 kt.  Octave is currently embedded within a broad area of low- 
to mid-level westerlies, and this should maintain a mainly eastward 
motion for the next day or so.  Later, the system should move 
east-northeastward as it becomes partially entrained into the large 
circulation of Hurricane Priscilla centered several hundred miles 
to its east-northeast.  The official forecast is close to the 
previous one and in good agreement with the simple and corrected 
consensus track model guidance.
 
Easterly vertical wind shear is expected to increase over Octave, 
and the low-level circulation of the storm should become 
increasingly disrupted by the influence of Priscilla.  So, 
although the system should remain over marginally warm SSTs during 
the next few days, the upper- and lower-level flow environment is 
likely to become less conducive during the next 48 hours.  Octave 
is forecast to weaken to dissipation in 60-72 hours.  This is 
similar to the previous official forecast and the model consensus.
