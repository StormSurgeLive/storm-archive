Additional development <br />is expected, and a tropical depression will likely form later <br />tonight or tomorrow. The system is forecast to move very slowly <br />west-northwestward, parallel to but offshore of the southwestern <br />coast of Mexico for the next several days. Interests along the <br />southwestern coast of Mexico should monitor the progress of this <br />system. For additional information on this system, please see High <br />Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent. <br />* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br /><br />South of Southern Mexico:<br />An area of low pressure is expected to form off the southern coast <br />of Mexico by the middle of next week. Thereafter, environmental <br />conditions are forecast to be conducive for gradual development of <br />the disturbance. A tropical depression could form during the middle <br />to latter part of next week while moving west-northwestward to <br />northwestward, near or parallel to the coast of Mexico.<br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br />* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br /><br />&&<br />High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br />found under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on <br />the web at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php <br /><br />$$<br />Forecaster Reinhart]]>

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
800 PM PDT Fri Oct 03 2025
 
Octave still has the appearance of a sheared tropical cyclone.
Infrared geostationary satellite imagery shows that cloud top
temperatures have generally warmed over the past few hours. Similar
to the previous night, isolated bursts of convection are
currently forming within the western portion of the circulation.
This can also be seen on an AMSR2 microwave pass from earlier
this afternoon that had a fragmented curved band wrapping around
the southern and western sides of Octave.  The initial intensity is
held at 50 kt, representing a blend of the subjective and objective
Dvorak estimates that range between 39 to 55 kt.
 
The tropical storm is still moving west-northwestward at 7 kt.  
Octave is expected to turn more to the northwest soon, followed by 
a northward motion on Sunday with a decreased forward speed as the 
mid-level ridge to the east weakens.  By early next week, the 
cyclone should begin to move eastward, but the track guidance 
envelope is quite large by the middle-to-latter portions of the 
forecast period.  This is because models differ on how much Octave 
will interact with a trough over the western United States and how 
quickly a developing disturbance (Invest 99-E) will organize.  The 
only changes to the latest NHC track forecast are that it lies 
slightly south and west of the previous forecast in the first 36 h, 
due the delayed turn to the northwest.
 
Vertical wind shear is gradually relaxing over the cyclone which 
could lead to some slight strengthening in about a day.  Most of the
reliable models are no longer showing Octave becoming a hurricane.  
By 48 h, the vertical wind shear is expected to increase and 
gradually weaken the cyclone as it moves eastward towards the much 
larger system to its east.  Only minor adjustments have been made 
to the official intensity forecast, which lies in the middle of the 
guidance suite.
