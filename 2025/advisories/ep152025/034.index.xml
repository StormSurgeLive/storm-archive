The disturbance is forecast to move <br />west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph, roughly parallel to the coast <br />of southern and southwestern Mexico, and interests there should <br />monitor its progress.  Regardless of development, the disturbance <br />is expected to produce periods of heavy rainfall along portions of <br />the southern and southwestern coasts of Mexico through the end of <br />the week, which could lead to localized flooding.<br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent. <br />* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br /><br />$$<br />Forecaster Hagen]]>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Baja California Sur from Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lazaro,
Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within 12 to 24 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the Baja California peninsula should monitor
the progress of Priscilla.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM MST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Priscilla was
located near latitude 21.1 North, longitude 112.2 West. Priscilla is
moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue for the next day or two, followed by 
a turn toward the north Thursday night. On the forecast track, the 
center of Priscilla is expected to move parallel to, but offshore 
of, the coast of Baja California Sur through Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Continued weakening is forecast during the next
48 hours.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160
miles (260 km). Los Cabos International Airport in Cabo San Lucas, 
Mexico, recently reported a sustained wind of 38 mph (61 km/h) with 
a gust to 55 mph (89 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Pacific coast
of Baja California Sur within the watch area today.
 
RAINFALL: Moisture associated with Priscilla will lead to locally
heavy rainfall and a flash flood risk across portions of the Baja
California peninsula during the next couple of days and over
portions of the southwestern United States from late this week
into this weekend.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of
the coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as
portions of the coast of the southern Baja California peninsula.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions, in addition to some coastal flooding.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM MST.

Hurricane Priscilla Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
200 AM MST Wed Oct 08 2025
 
Although it is still a hurricane, Priscilla is gradually weakening. 
Deep convection within the system has diminished significantly, 
especially over the eastern portion of the circulation, and the eye 
has become poorly-defined.  Cloud tops have warmed to -60 to -70 deg 
C.  Using a blend of subjective Dvorak CI- and T-numbers, the 
intensity is set to 85 kt for this advisory.  This is also in good 
agreement with a blend of objective estimates from UW-CIMSS.

The initial motion estimate is slowly northwestward, or around 305/7 
kt.  Priscilla is currently moving along the southwestern side of a 
mid-level high pressure system centered near Texas.  In 48 hours or 
so, a large trough or cutoff low near the California coast should 
induce a turn toward the north.  By 72 hours, Priscilla will likely 
have weakened into a shallow cyclone moving in the low-level 
environmental flow.  The official track forecast lies between the 
simple and corrected dynamical model consensus solutions and is 
quite close to the previous NHC forecast.

Priscilla has weakened while moving over ocean waters that have 
likely been cooled by upwelling beneath the large and slow-moving 
tropical cyclone.  The system should traverse even cooler waters to 
the west of Baja California Sur during the next couple of days, 
resulting in steady weakening.  Priscilla is expected to degenerate 
into a remnant low in about 72 hours.  The official intensity 
forecast is on the high side of the model guidance suite, suggesting 
that the system could weaken even faster than indicated here.

KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Baja California
Sur Pacific coastline within the Tropical Storm Watch area today. 
Interests elsewhere in the Baja California peninsula should monitor 
the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.   Moisture associated with Priscilla will lead to heavy rainfall 
and a flash flood risk across portions of the southwestern United 
States from late this week into this weekend. 

3.  Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico as well as the coast
of the southern Baja California peninsula. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, in
addition to some coastal flooding.

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
200 AM PDT Wed Oct 08 2025
 
Satellite imagery indicates that Octave continues to produce small 
bursts of deep convection, with a new area of convection 
redeveloping south of the low-level circulation center during the 
past few hours. Overall, the cyclone remains sheared and poorly 
organized, with the low-level center partially exposed on the 
northeastern edge of the convection. Since the overnight ASCAT pass 
did not sample the circulation center, the initial intensity is set 
at 35 kt, which represents a blend of the subjective Dvorak and 
objective satellite estimates.

The initial motion is toward the east, or 080 degrees, at around 9 
kt, and this motion is expected to continue through the morning 
hours today. A turn toward the northeast is expected later today 
into Thursday as Octave moves south of Hurricane Priscilla and near 
another developing system (EP90) to its southeast, located near the 
southwest coast of Mexico. This forecast track is very similar to 
the previous NHC advisory and represents a blend of the consensus 
aids and the Google DeepMind guidance.

Although the current intensity is estimated at 35 kt, this value may 
be somewhat generous given the recent degradation in Octave’s 
satellite presentation under strengthening easterly shear. Simulated 
satellite imagery from the global models indicates that intermittent 
bursts of convection should continue through the day today before 
diminishing thereafter. Thus, the new NHC forecast now shows the 
system becoming a post-tropical remnant low in 24 hours, and 
dissipating by 48 hours. The intensity forecast is similar to the 
previous one and lies near the middle portion of the guidance 
envelope.
