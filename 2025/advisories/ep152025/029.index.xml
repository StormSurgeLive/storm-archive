None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Baja California Sur from Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lazaro,
Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area.
 
Interests elsewhere in the Baja California peninsula should monitor
the progress of Priscilla.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM MST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Priscilla was 
located near latitude 19.1 North, longitude 109.0 West. Priscilla is 
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A continued 
northwestward motion at a slightly faster forward speed is expected 
over the next few days. On the forecast track, the center of 
Priscilla is expected to move parallel to, but offshore of, the 
coast of west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur during the 
next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Strengthening is expected over the next day or so, and 
Priscilla is forecast to become a category 2 hurricane on Tuesday 
before weakening begins by midweek.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 50 miles (85 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185
miles (295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 972 mb (28.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible on the Pacific coast of 
Baja California Sur within the watch area on Tuesday and Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: From Tuesday to Wednesday, 1 to 2 inches of rain are 
expected in southern Baja California Sur, with local totals up to 4 
inches as the outer bands of Priscilla reach the area. This rainfall 
could bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas of higher 
terrain. Moisture from Priscilla could bring heavy rainfall 
potential over the Southwest U.S. late this week into this weekend.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as portions
of the coast of the southern Baja California peninsula. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM MST.

Hurricane Priscilla Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
800 PM MST Mon Oct 06 2025

Priscilla remains a large hurricane this evening, with broad curved 
bands developing and rotating around the center on GOES-18 satellite 
imagery. Since the prior advisory, there was a 0057 UTC WSF-M 
microwave pass that showed the inner-core starting to tighten up 
with a nearly closed 37-GHz cyan ring. This may foreshadow a period 
of more intensification in the near future. Subjective Dvorak 
estimates from TAFB/SAB remain unchanged from earlier today at 
T4.5/77-kt and objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS range 
from 68-78 kt, so the initial intensity remains 75 kt for this 
advisory. 

The hurricane appears to finally be moving a little faster to the 
northwest, with the estimated motion at 320/8 kt. A continued 
northwestward track with a little faster forward motion is expected 
over the next 24-48 hours as ridging becomes re-established to the 
northeast of Priscilla. After this time, an amplifying shortwave 
trough is expected to cutoff just off the Western U.S. coastline, 
eroding the ridge north of the hurricane. In response, the majority 
of the guidance shows Priscilla turning northward as it moves in the 
flow between the ridge and the digging trough. The track guidance 
shifted a little more right this cycle, and the NHC track was nudged 
in that direction. However, it still remains slower and not as far 
right as some of the hurricane-regional models and the ECMWF track 
forecast, remaining close to a blend of the HFIP Corrected Consensus 
Approach (HCCA) and Google DeepMind ensemble mean (GDMI).

The improving core structure on microwave imagery suggests that 
Priscilla might be finally ready to intensify a little more in the 
short term. With shear remaining between 15-20 kt, and sea-surface 
temperatures (SSTs) remaining above 28 C for the next 24-36 h, the 
hurricane is expected to intensify and reach a peak intensity during 
this time. Afterwards, Priscilla is expected to cross a sharp SST 
gradient into much cooler water, leading to steady weakening beyond 
36 hours. The NHC intensity forecast is similar to the prior 
advisory, electing to remain close to the HCCA intensity aid. Shear 
also increases rapidly after 72 h, and the tropical cyclone could 
lose its remaining convection right as it approaches the Baja 
California coastline, leading to the system becoming a remnant low. 
Regardless, enhanced moisture is likely to make its way toward 
portions of the southwestern United States during the latter half 
of this week. 
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Baja California 
Sur Pacific coastline Tuesday night into Wednesday, within the 
Tropical Storm Watch area. Interests elsewhere in the Baja 
California peninsula should monitor the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Priscilla will impact portions of 
southern Baja California Sur, which could result in flash flooding, 
particularly in areas of higher terrain.
 
3.  Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico as well as the coast
of the southern Baja California peninsula.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
200 AM PDT Tue Oct 07 2025
 
Satellite imagery indicates that Octave continues to produce bursts
of deep convection, with a new area of cold cloud tops redeveloping
and expanding over and north of the low-level circulation center
during the past several hours. A 0541 UTC METOP-C ASCAT pass showed
that the storm's compact structure remains intact, with peak surface
winds around 40 kt. Subjective Dvorak estimates from both TAFB and
SAB remain 3.0/45 kt, and objective intensity estimates range from
26 to 41 kt. Based on these data and consistent satellite trends,
the initial intensity is held at 45 kt for this advisory.

The initial motion is toward the east-southeast, or 110 degrees, at
around 6 kt. This motion is expected to continue today as the storm
moves along the southern periphery of a mid- to upper-level trough
extending southwestward from the U.S. West Coast, and south of a
much larger Hurricane Priscilla tracking northwestward well to the
east-northeast. A gradual turn back toward the east is forecast 
tonight into Wednesday, followed by a northeastward acceleration by 
Thursday as Octave begins to interact with, and possibly become, 
absorbed by Priscilla. This forecast track is very similar to the
previous NHC advisory and represents a blend of the consensus aids
and the Google DeepMind guidance.

Given Octave’s compact structure, the system may be able to maintain 
its intensity for another day or so before succumbing to an 
increasingly hostile environment of strengthening shear and drier 
air. A steady weakening trend is forecast thereafter, and Octave is 
expected to dissipate by Thursday as it interacts with Priscilla’s 
larger circulation. The new NHC intensity forecast is similar to the 
previous one and lies near the middle portion of the guidance 
envelope.
