Tropical Depression Fifteen-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
200 AM MST Tue Sep 30 2025

The area of low pressure located well south-southwest of the 
southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula has become better 
organized over the past several hours.  Satellite imagery shows 
persistent convection and the development of a well-defined curved 
band.  In addition, a recent 0355 UTC Metop-B ASCAT pass revealed a 
well-defined center along with a couple of 30-kt wind barbs.  As a 
result, the system has met the criteria to be classified as a 
tropical cyclone.  The latest subjective Dvorak intensity estimates 
from TAFB and SAB were 2.0/30 kt and 2.5/35 kt, respectively.  Based 
on a blend of these data, advisories are being initiated on Tropical 
Depression Fifteen-E with an initial intensity of 30 kt.

Fifteen-E is estimated to be moving slowly west-northwestward, or 
295 degrees at 4 kt.  This west-northwestward motion is expected to 
continue today, along the southern periphery of a low- to mid-level 
ridge situated north of the cyclone.  A turn toward the 
north-northwest is expected later today as a weak low to the north 
of Fifteen-E erodes the ridge, with this general motion likely 
continuing through around 48 hours.  Thereafter, a building 
mid-level ridge to the north of the cyclone is forecast to steer 
Fifteen-E west-northwestward beyond 48 hours through the end of the 
forecast period.  The official track forecast lies near the middle 
of the guidance envelope and is closest to the TVCE consensus aid.

Fifteen-E will remain over warm waters and within a moist 
environment during the next several days, but moderate to strong 
east-northeasterly vertical wind shear is expected to hinder 
significant intensification.  Some slight strengthening is forecast 
during the next 12 hours, and Fifteen-E is expected to reach 
tropical storm strength later today.  Little change in strength is 
anticipated through much of the forecast period, followed by some 
modest strengthening on days 4 and 5 as the shear is forecast to 
relax slightly.  The intensity forecast is of low confidence and 
remains near the middle of the guidance envelope, closest to a 
blend of the SHIPS and HCCA intensity aids.
