Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
200 PM PDT Thu Oct 02 2025

Octave continues to be disrupted by strong easterly vertical wind 
shear.  There is a rather sharp edge of the cloud shield on the 
eastern side of the upper-level cloud pattern and the low-level 
center remains near this eastern edge.  Convective banding features 
are not very well defined and the upper-tropospheric outflow 
continues to be inhibited to the east of the system.  The advisory 
intensity has been adjusted to 50 kt based on a recent ASCAT 
overpass and the 34-kt wind radii have also been adjusted slightly 
based on the scatterometer data.

Center fixes indicate that the motion remains west-northwestward, 
or 285/7 kt.  The tropical cyclone continues to move along the 
southern side of a weak mid-level subtropical ridge, and should 
continue to do so for the next couple of days.  By 72 hours or so, 
Octave should turn northward and slow down as it encounters a 
weakness in the ridge.  Later in the forecast period, the system is 
expected to turn eastward as it begins to become drawn into a larger 
developing tropical cyclone off the southwest coast of Mexico.  The 
official forecast track is similar to the previous one also similar 
to the multi-model consensus prediction.

Dynamical models indicate that the vertical wind shear over Octave 
is not expected to decrease significantly for the next couple of 
days.  Later in the forecast period, the shear is likely to lessen 
although the air mass is expected to become somewhat drier by that 
time and the developing tropical cyclone to the east of Octave could 
also have a negative influence.  The official forecast calls for 
some re-strengthening around day 3, however it is above most of the 
model guidance.  This should be considered a low-confidence 
forecast.
