Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
200 PM MST Tue Sep 30 2025

Octave continues to become a little better organized this afternoon, 
with curved bands forming primarily along the southwestern side of 
the small cyclone. The wind field appears so small that 
scatterometer data largely missed the small circulation in the 
narrow 100 n mi gap between passes. The latest subjective Dvorak 
intensity estimates were T3.0/45 kt from SAB, and T2.5/35 kt from 
TAFB. The initial intensity is raised to 40 kt this advisory, a 
blend of the two estimates, and near the latest ADT estimate of 
T2.8/41 kt and D-PRINT estimate of 40 kt. 

Octave is still moving northwestward, with the latest motion 
estimated at 320/4 kt. A turn more to the north-northwest is 
anticipated over the next day or so as Octave interacts with the 
remnant low-level vorticity of another small disturbance that is 
passing the system by to the north. Most of the guidance shows 
Octave quickly absorbing the weaker system, and after that is 
complete, low to mid-level ridging builds back in, resulting in the 
cyclone turning back west-northwestward from 36-72 h. Towards the 
end of the forecast, steering currents are expected to collapse as a 
longwave trough erodes the mid-level ridging and low-level monsoonal 
flow becomes more established to the east of Octave. Compared to the 
previous cycle, the track guidance has trended westward, and the NHC 
track forecast has been shifted a little farther west early on, but 
more substantially by the end of the forecast period, though it 
remains east of the latest HCCA and Google DeepMind ensemble mean 
(GDMI). 

The tropical storm has been able to intensify a little today despite 
being under 20-25 kt of east-northeasterly vertical wind shear. This 
shear is expected to persist for the next 36-48 hours, and thus only 
a slight bit of additional intensification is expected tonight 
followed by a pause in strengthening. After 60 h, Shear is expected 
to decrease to 10-15 kt, and how much the storm is able to intensify 
will be related to its structural characteristics. Octave is 
expected to remain a small tropical cyclone, so its possible it 
could be prone to more rapid intensity changes (both up or down) 
than shown here. For now, the intensity was bumped up a little 
towards the end of the forecast period, but remains much lower than 
some of the more aggressive hurricane-regional model guidance (HWRF, 
HAFS-A) which develop an inner core with Octave much sooner than the 
remainder of the guidance. The NHC intensity forecast is closest to 
the HFIP corrected consensus approach (HCCA).
