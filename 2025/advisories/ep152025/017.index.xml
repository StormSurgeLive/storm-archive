However, recent <br />satellite-derived wind data depict a circulation that remains <br />somewhat broad, but if current trends persist, advisories on a <br />tropical depression could be initiated on Saturday. The system is <br />forecast to move very slowly west-northwestward, remaining offshore <br />of the southwestern coast of Mexico during the next several days. <br />Interests along the southwestern coast of Mexico should continue to <br />monitor the progress of this system. For additional information, <br />please see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather <br />Service.<br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent. <br />* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br /><br />South of Southern Mexico:<br />An area of low pressure is expected to form off the southern coast <br />of Mexico by the middle of next week. Gradual development of this <br />system is possible thereafter, and a tropical depression could form <br />during the middle to latter part of next week while moving <br />west-northwestward to northwestward, near or parallel to the coast <br />of Mexico.<br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br />* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br /><br />&&<br /><br />High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br />found under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on <br />the web at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php <br /><br />$$<br />Forecaster Gibbs]]>

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
200 AM PDT Sat Oct 04 2025
 
Octave is still trying to become better organized this morning, as 
shear starts to decrease over the system. In recent satellite 
images, a large convective band has started to become better 
established on the western side of the system with cold cloud tops 
near -80 C. However, recent satellite-derived winds depicted peak 
winds of only 34 kt, although it did not sample the convective band 
to the west. Subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates 
have held steady and range from 45 to 55 kt. Using a blend of these 
estimates and the lower satellite derived wind speeds, the intensity 
is lowered to 45 kt for this advisory.
 
The storm is moving west-northwest at an estimated motion of 290/7 
kt. Octave should gradually turn towards the northwest later today, 
followed by a northward turn on Sunday with a decrease in forward 
speed as steering currents weaken. In about 48 h, there continue to 
be differences within the track guidance envelope and it is due to 
how much interaction occurs with a trough to the north of the system 
and a developing disturbance (Invest 99E) to the east. The latest 
NHC track forecast is similar to the previous in the short-term, but 
is slightly faster with the eastward motion closest to the HCCA and 
Google DeepMind solutions.
 
Wind shear has started to decrease over the system, with marginally 
warm sea surface temperatures near 27 C along the forecast track. 
Thus, slight intensification is possible over the next day or two. 
By 48 h, the vertical wind shear is expected to increase and a 
weakening trend is forecast as it interacts with a much larger 
system to the east. The NHC intensity forecast is near the previous, 
showing some slight strengthening possible, although a lower peak 
intensity and lies near the simple intensity consensus aids.
