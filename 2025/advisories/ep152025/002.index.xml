Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
800 AM MST Tue Sep 30 2025
 
The convective structure of the depression has continued to improve
this morning, with cold cloud tops (-80C CMG) developing over the
surface center, and a deep convective curved band located in the
east semicircle of the cyclone.  Subjective Dvorak intensity
estimates from TAFB and SAB are T2.0 and T3.0, and the UW-CIMSS
objective intensity analyses range from 34-39 kt.  Based on a blend
of these data and the cyclone's improved satellite presentation, the
initial intensity is raised to 35 kt, upgrading Tropical Depression 
Fifteen-E to Tropical Storm Octave.
 
Although Octave should remain over warm oceanic surface 
temperatures, and move within a surrounding environment with ample 
low- to mid-level moisture, moderate deep-layer east-northeasterly 
shear is expected to hamper significant development.  Accordingly, 
the forecast reflects little change in strength through Thursday.  
Afterward, the statistical Decay-SHIPS intensity guidance and the 
global models indicate that the shear will diminish some, allowing 
for some additional intensification through day 5, and the intensity 
forecast follows suit.
 
Octave's initial motion is estimated to be northwestward, or
325/4 kt.  The cyclone is forecast to turn north-northwestward to
northward later today in response to a mid-tropospheric cut-off
low drifting southward toward Octave.  Beyond the 60 hour period, 
model guidance indicates that a subtropical ridge will build to the 
north of the cyclone and induce a west-northwestward motion through 
Saturday, while the cut-off mentioned above weakens and ultimately 
dissipates.  By day 5, the global models agree that Octave will 
slow in forward speed and gradually turn toward the northwest and 
north-northwest, while the ridge to the north of the cyclone erodes. 
The NHC forecast lies close to the various consensus aids and has 
been shifted a bit to the right of the previous forecast after 36 
hours.
