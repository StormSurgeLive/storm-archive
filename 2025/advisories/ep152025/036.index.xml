SUMMARY OF 800 PM MST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...22.6N 113.6W
ABOUT 235 MI...380 KM W OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 320 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...989 MB...29.21 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Baja California Sur from Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lazaro,
Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within 12 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the Baja California peninsula should monitor
the progress of Priscilla.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM MST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Priscilla was
located near latitude 22.6 North, longitude 113.6 West. Priscilla is
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this general
motion is expected to continue through Thursday. A turn toward the
north is expected Thursday night. On the forecast track, the center
of Priscilla is expected to move parallel to, but offshore of, the
coast of Baja California Sur through Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are now near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts. Weakening is forecast, and Priscilla is expected to become
a remnant low by Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km)
from the center. Puerto Cortes, Mexico, recently reported a wind
gust of 40 mph (65 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 989 mb (29.21 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Pacific coast
of Baja California Sur within the watch area for the next several
hours.
 
RAINFALL: As Priscilla moves off the west coast of Baja California,
up to an inch of rain is expected across the Baja California
peninsula.  Farther north across the southwestern United States,
heavy rain from Priscillaâ€™s moisture is expected to lead to 2 to 4
inches, with local storm total amounts to 6 inches, across portions
of central and northern Arizona, southern Utah, and southwest
Colorado from Thursday into Saturday afternoon.  Scattered
occurrences of flash flooding are anticipated from central Arizona
across southern Utah across the Four Corners into southwest Colorado
and far northwest New Mexico.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting the Pacific
coast of Baja California Sur as well as portions of coastal
southwestern and west-central Mexico. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, in addition
to some coastal flooding.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1100 PM MST.
Next complete advisory at 200 AM MST.

Tropical Storm Priscilla Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
800 PM MST Wed Oct 08 2025

Some convection has re-developed in association with Priscilla, 
mainly in disorganized bands well removed from the center. This 
convection is not well-enough organized to keep the satellite 
intensity estimates from decreasing.  Based on these decreases since 
the previous advisory, the initial intensity is reduced to 50 kt.
 
The initial motion estimate remains northwestward, or 320/8 kt. As 
mentioned previously, Priscilla is moving along the southwestern 
side of a mid-level high pressure ridge near the Texas/Mexico 
border.  In 24 h or so, a large mid-latitude trough or cutoff low 
near the California coast should cause a northward turn. By 48 h, 
Priscilla will likely have weakened into a shallow cyclone steered 
by the low-level flow, which is rather weak.  The track guidance has 
not changed significantly since the last advisory, and the new 
forecast track is very similar to the previous track.

The forecast track takes Priscilla over colder sea surface 
temperatures and into a drier environment, and these factors should 
cause continued weakening. The latest simulated satellite imagery 
from the GFS and ECMWF models forecast the cyclone to stop producing 
convection in about 36 h, and the new intensity forecast calls for 
the system to decay to a remnant low at that time.  The remnant low 
is still shown as dissipating by 72 h in agreement with the global 
models. The new intensity forecast is an update of the previous 
forecast.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Baja California
Sur Pacific coastline within the Tropical Storm Watch area for the 
next several hours.  Interests elsewhere in the Baja California 
peninsula should monitor the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.  Moisture associated with Priscilla will lead to heavy rainfall 
and a flash flood risk across portions of Arizona, southern Utah, 
through the Four Corners into southwest Colorado and far northwest 
New Mexico from Thursday into Saturday. 
 
3.  Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting the Pacific 
coast of Baja California Sur as well as portions of the coast of 
southwestern and west-central Mexico. These swells are likely to 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, in addition 
to some coastal flooding.

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  36
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
800 PM MST Wed Oct 08 2025
 
Octave has regained a small area of deep convection this evening but 
remains highly sheared, with the latest UW-CIMSS analysis indicating 
23 kt of easterly shear.  The most recent subjective Dvorak current 
intensity estimate from TAFB is 2.5/35 kt, while a SATCON and 
AI-based estimate from UW-CIMSS were 39 and 40 kt, respectively. 
Considering a Metop-C ASCAT pass from earlier today that showed 
several 38-kt wind barbs, along with the redevelopment of deep 
convection near the center, the initial intensity for this advisory 
is held at a possibly generous 40 kt.

Octave has accelerated since the previous advisory and is now moving 
east-northeastward, or 075 degrees at 15 kt.  This general motion 
should continue tonight, taking the cyclone south of Priscilla.  A 
turn toward the east is expected on Thursday as Octave moves toward 
a newly developing tropical cyclone (Invest 90E) off the 
southwestern coast of Mexico.  Octave is forecast to open into a 
trough by 36 hours, if not sooner, before being absorbed into the 
larger circulation of 90E.  The new NHC forecast track lies slightly 
south of the previous one and follows a blend of the Google DeepMind 
ensemble mean and the latest multi-model consensus aids.

Octaveâ€™s days are numbered, with more than 30 kt of easterly 
vertical wind shear forecast to persist over the system during the 
next couple of days.  The current burst of deep convection southwest 
of the low-level center may be its last, as suggested by simulated 
satellite imagery from the latest GFS and ECMWF runs.  The new NHC 
intensity forecast is unchanged from the previous advisory, calling 
for Octave to become a post-tropical remnant low in 24 hours and 
dissipate by 36 hours.
