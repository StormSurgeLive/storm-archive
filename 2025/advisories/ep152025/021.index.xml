DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM MST (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Priscilla
was located near latitude 15.8 North, longitude 106.8 West.
Priscilla is moving toward the northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A 
slow, generally northward drift is expected on Sunday, followed by 
a faster northwestward motion beginning on Monday.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Priscilla is expected to move offshore of 
and parallel to the coast of southwestern Mexico through early 
next week.

Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast during the next few days, and 
Priscilla is expected to become a hurricane by Monday.

Priscilla is a large tropical storm, with tropical-storm-force 
winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km) from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
along the southwestern coast of Mexico on Sunday and Monday.
 
RAINFALL: Outer bands from Priscilla will bring heavy rains to
portions of southwestern Mexico through Monday.  Across coastal
portions of Michoac√°n and far western Guerrero, rainfall amounts of
4 to 6 inches are expected, with local amounts up to 8 inches.
Across Colima, western Jalisco, and the rest of Guerrero along the
coast, 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected.  This rainfall will bring
a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas of higher terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico and will reach portions of the coast of
west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California peninsula by
Monday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 200 AM MST.

Tropical Storm Priscilla Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
800 PM MST Sat Oct 04 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Priscilla suggests the storm is 
contending with some shear this evening. The low-level circulation 
appears to be partially exposed to the east of the central 
convection. Large curved bands wrap around the northern and western 
parts of the circulation. The satellite intensity estimates range 
from 36-45 kt, and the initial intensity is held at 40 kt based on a 
blend of these estimates and the earlier scatterometer data.

The initial motion estimate is an uncertain 325/3 kt. Priscilla has 
not moved much since earlier today, and recent satellite images 
suggest there could be a couple of small vortices rotating around a 
broader system center. While Priscilla continues to organize and the 
storm remains in weak steering currents, a slow and erratic 
northward to northwestward motion is expected during the next day or 
so. By Monday, a somewhat faster northwestward motion is forecast 
while Priscilla moves between a strengthening ridge over northern 
Mexico and an upper-level trough over the western U.S. The 
cross-track model spread increases greatly at days 3-5. This is 
likely related to differences in the amplitude of the upper trough 
off the U.S. West Coast, and the strength and positioning of the 
ridge over northern Mexico during this period. The 96-120 h NHC 
track forecast was adjusted a bit slower and farther left, following 
the latest model trends and remaining between the simple and 
corrected consensus aids.

Despite the storm's large size, most of the intensity guidance 
favors steady to even significant strengthening over the next few 
days. Warm sea-surface temperatures and strong upper-level 
divergence should provide favorable conditions for intensification 
once Priscilla consolidates an inner core. There are indications 
that moderate easterly shear will persist into early next week, but 
the large system should be less susceptible to those negative 
effects once its structure improves. The NHC forecast shows 
Priscilla reaching hurricane strength by Monday with some continued 
strengthening thereafter. A weakening trend is forecast beyond 72 h 
as Priscilla is expected to encounter cooler waters and a drier, 
more stable environment while gaining latitude.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico within the watch area Sunday and
Monday. Interests in the southern portion of Baja California Sur
should monitor the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Priscilla will impact coastal 
sections of southwestern Mexico through Monday, which could result 
in flash flooding, particularly in areas of higher terrain.
 
3.  Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico and will reach the coasts of
west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California peninsula by
Monday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
200 AM PDT Sun Oct 05 2025
 
Satellite imagery indicates that Octave remains a compact tropical 
cyclone, with the diameter of its central dense overcast (CDO) near 
150 miles. Intermittent bursts of deep convection continue near the 
embedded center, with cloud-top temperatures occasionally exceeding 
‚àí80 degrees C. Subjective Dvorak Current Intensity estimates are 
4.0/65 kt from TAFB and 3.5/55 kt from SAB, while objective 
estimates are as high as 60 kt. An ASCAT-B pass at 0534 UTC 
depicted the small and compact system, with peak surface winds just 
over 50 kt and tropical-storm-force winds extending only about 60 n 
mi from the center. A blend of these data supports an initial 
intensity of 60 kt for this advisory.

Octave is now moving slowly north-northeastward at about 3 kt, and 
this motion is expected to continue today while the storm gradually 
turns northeastward within a weak steering pattern between an 
upper-level trough along the U.S. West Coast and Tropical Cyclone 
Priscilla, which is drifting northwestward well to the east off the 
southwestern coast of Mexico. Beginning Monday, Octave should turn 
eastward and gradually accelerate. By midweek, forecast uncertainty 
increases significantly as Octave becomes increasingly influenced by 
Priscilla‚Äôs evolution and track. The new NHC forecast track is very 
similar to the previous advisory and closely follows the consensus 
aids, with Octave expected to dissipate by day 5 (Thursday night) as 
it becomes absorbed by the larger Tropical Cyclone Priscilla.

Octave has intensified slightly since the previous advisory, and 
with the environment remaining marginally conducive for the next 12 
to 18 hours, some additional strengthening cannot be ruled out. 
Guidance, however, generally supports the intensity holding steady 
during this period, which is reflected in this forecast through the 
day today. Thereafter, increasing vertical wind shear, combined with 
the interaction with Priscilla, should induce a gradual weakening 
trend. Octave is forecast to open up into a trough and be absorbed 
by Priscilla by the end of the forecast period. The intensity 
forecast remains close to the previous NHC advisory and near the 
middle to upper portion of the guidance envelope.
