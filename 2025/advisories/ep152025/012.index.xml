Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
800 PM PDT Thu Oct 02 2025
 
Octave appears to be in a delicate state this evening.  Hints of the 
low-level circulation appeared on the last-light GOES visible 
imagery while the afternoon's decaying convection drifted westward. 
However, a new burst of deep convection has developed just to the 
west of the center.  Objective and subjective satellite intensity 
estimates have remained rather steady.  Therefore, the initial 
intensity remains at 50 kt, representing a blend of the TAFB and SAB 
Dvorak estimates.
 
The cyclone is moving steadily west-northwestward at 6 kt along the 
southern side of a weak subtropical ridge.  The ridge should 
continue to steer Octave in this direction for the next couple of 
days.  By day 3, the storm should slowly drift northward followed by 
a sharp turn to the east as it moves in the wake of a stronger 
tropical cyclone (Invest 99) off the coast of southwestern Mexico.  
The official forecast track is similar to the previous one, and is 
also similar to the multi-model consensus prediction.

Both the GFS and ECMWF indicate that the atmospheric conditions 
could become a little more conducive in about a day and a half.  If 
Octave can maintain its current state, vertical wind shear is 
expected to abate Friday night or Saturday morning.  The latest NHC 
intensity forecast calls for gradual strengthening between 48 to 72 
h, followed by steady weakening as the vertical wind shear is 
expected to increase once again.  The near-term prediction lies on 
the high end of the guidance envelope and blends closer to the 
corrected consensus aid, HCCA, by the mid-to-latter portion of the 
forecast period.
