DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM MST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Priscilla was 
located near latitude 20.6 North, longitude 111.5 West. Priscilla is 
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this motion is 
expected to continue for the next couple of days, followed by a turn 
toward the north Thursday night. On the forecast track, the center 
of Priscilla is expected to move parallel to, but offshore of, the 
coast of Baja California Sur through Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 105 mph (165 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional weakening is expected on Wednesday, 
continuing through the rest of the week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles 
(315 km). A weather station on Socorro island, located about 130 
miles (205 km) south-southeast of Priscilla's eye, recently reported 
a wind gust of 54 mph (87 km/h). 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 962 mb (28.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Pacific coast
of Baja California Sur within the watch area through Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: 1 to 2 inches of rain are expected in southern Baja
California Sur into Wednesday, with local storm totals up to 4
inches as the outer bands of Priscilla reach the area . This
rainfall could bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas
of higher terrain.  Moisture from Priscilla should bring 1 to 2
inches of rain, with local amounts to 4 inches, to portions of
west-central Mexico, which could lead to flash flooding within the
area’s terrain.  From late this week into this weekend, moisture
from Priscilla leads to heavy rainfall and a flash flood risk over
portions of the U.S. Desert Southwest.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of
the coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as
portions of the coast of the southern Baja California peninsula.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions, in addition to some coastal flooding. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1100 PM MST.
Next complete advisory at 200 AM MST.

Hurricane Priscilla Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
800 PM MST Tue Oct 07 2025
 
While Priscilla remains a large and formidable hurricane, its 
satellite structure is starting to show signs of decay. The eyewall 
cloud top temperatures have warmed over the past 3-6 hours, and the 
last several microwave passes show that the eye is now open to the 
north. Some of these changes could be due to ocean upwelling, which 
the hurricane-regional models have been forecasting to occur in the 
relatively shallow warm waters the large hurricane has been 
traversing through. While both TAFB and SAB Dvorak CI estimates were 
constrained at T5.5/102-kt, their data-T numbers have declined, and 
based on the further degradation on satellite imagery since that 
time, the initial intensity is being set to 90 kt for this advisory, 
which is on the lower end of the intensity estimates. 

Priscilla has resumed a more northwestward motion, estimated at 
310/8 kt. The track philosophy remains unchanged, with a 
northwestward motion at a similar pace expected to continue for the 
next couple of days as a mid-level ridge remains in place to the 
northeast of the hurricane. The ridging then becomes eroded and 
shifted east as a shortwave trough, currently over British Columbia, 
digs in southward and ultimately cuts off just offshore of the 
western U.S. coastline. This synoptic evolution will likely cause 
Priscilla to turn northward from 48-72 hours. However, the cyclone 
will also become more vertically shallow and may not feel the full 
effects of the evolving mid-level steering, ultimately slowing down 
substantially by the end of the forecast. The track guidance this 
cycle has shifted a little rightward, with the Google DeepMind 
ensemble mean (GDMI) aid a notable rightward outlier. The NHC track 
was adjusted a little right, but not as far right as GDMI, staying 
between it and the reliable HFIP Corrected Consensus Approach (HCCA) 
aid. It is worth noting there is quite a bit of along track spread 
in the ensemble guidance in 48-72 h, so the forward motion at the 
end of the forecast track is more uncertain than usual.

The hurricane appears past its peak tonight with the recent 
structural decline on satellite imagery. While SHIPS guidance 
indicates sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) under the hurricane should 
be in the 28 C range, the HAFS-A/B and HWRF SSTs forecast output 
suggests the large hurricane has upwelled much cooler ocean waters 
that may take several days for the satellite-based SST methods to 
properly depict. With this in mind, the NHC intensity forecast is 
lower than the previous cycle, in good agreement with the intensity 
aids, showing steady weakening over the next 2-3 days as Priscilla 
moves into even cooler SSTs. Shear also increases quickly out of the 
southwest beyond 48 hours, and both the GFS/ECMWF show Priscilla's 
remaining convection shearing off in 72 h, which will mark when the 
NHC forecast shows Priscilla as a remnant low near to the central 
Baja California coastline. The global models show the remnant low 
dissipating shortly thereafter.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Baja California
Sur Pacific coastline within the Tropical Storm Watch area tonight
into Wednesday. Interests elsewhere in the Baja California peninsula
should monitor the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.  Rainfall associated with Priscilla will impact portions of Baja 
California Sur into Wednesday.  Moisture associated with Priscilla 
will lead to heavy rainfall across west-central Mexico from tonight 
into Thursday morning and across the U.S. Desert Southwest from 
late this week into this weekend.  This could result in flash 
flooding, particularly in areas of higher terrain.
 
3.  Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico as well as the coast
of the southern Baja California peninsula. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, in
addition to some coastal flooding.

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
800 PM PDT Tue Oct 07 2025

Satellite imagery shows that Octave continues to produce 
intermittent bursts of deep convection, primarily across the 
southern and southwestern portions of the circulation due to 
easterly shear influencing the system. An earlier ASCAT pass 
indicated that the system remains intact, though the strongest winds 
are now confined to the southern semicircle. Subjective Dvorak 
estimates from TAFB and SAB are both 3.0/45 kt, while objective 
estimates range between 25 and 33 kt. Based on these data and the 
persistent satellite presentation, the initial intensity is held at 
40 kt for this advisory.

The initial motion is toward the east-southeast, or 100 degrees, at 
around 6 kt. This motion is expected to continue into early 
Wednesday as the storm moves along the southern periphery of a mid- 
to upper-level trough extending southwestward from the U.S. West 
Coast and beneath the much larger Hurricane Priscilla tracking 
northwestward several hundred miles to the northeast. A turn toward 
the northeast, along with some acceleration, is expected late 
Wednesday into Thursday as Octave moves south of Priscilla and near 
another developing system (EP90) to its southeast near the southwest 
coast of Mexico. This forecast track is very similar to the previous 
NHC advisory and represents a blend of the consensus aids and the 
Google DeepMind guidance.

Given Octave’s compact structure, the system may be able to maintain 
its intensity into early Wednesday before succumbing to an 
increasingly hostile environment of strengthening shear and drier 
air. A steady weakening trend is forecast thereafter, and Octave is 
expected to dissipate by Thursday as it interacts with Priscilla’s 
larger circulation to the north and EP90 to its southeast. The new 
NHC intensity forecast is similar to the previous one and lies near 
the middle portion of the guidance envelope.
