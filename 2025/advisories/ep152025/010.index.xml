Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
800 AM PDT Thu Oct 02 2025

Octave continues to be affected by strong easterly vertical wind 
shear associated with an upper-level anticyclone to its northeast.  
The cloud pattern has not changed much in organization, with some 
limited convective banding features over the southern and western 
portions of the circulation.  Upper-tropospheric outflow continues 
to be impeded to the east of the cyclone.  The advisory intensity 
estimate is held at 55 kt in agreement with a subjective Dvorak 
estimate from TAFB.  Objective values from UW-CIMSS range from 49 
to 54 kt at this time.

The system is moving west-northwestward at around 285/7 kt.  Octave 
is currently being steered by the flow on the southern perimeter of 
a mid-level ridge.  This ridge is predicted to weaken over the next 
few days, which should cause the system to slow and turn northward 
in around 72 hours.  A generally eastward motion is expected by the 
end of the forecast period, as Octave becomes drawn into the larger 
circulation of a developing tropical cyclone off the southwest coast 
of Mexico.  The official track forecast is close to the latest 
corrected dynamical consensus model, HCCA, track.

Dynamical guidance indicates that the vertical wind shear over 
Octave will abate in a few days while the system traverses 
marginally warm ocean waters.  Thus, there is a relatively small 
window of opportunity for strengthening later in the forecast 
period.  This is also shown in the official intensity forecast, 
which is at the high end of the model guidance suite.
