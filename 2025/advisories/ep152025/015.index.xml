The system is forecast to move <br />very slowly west-northwestward, parallel to but offshore of the <br />southwestern coast of Mexico for the next several days. Interests <br />along the southwestern coast of Mexico should monitor the progress <br />of this system.<br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent. <br />* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br /><br />South of Southern Mexico:<br />An area of low pressure is expected to form off the south coast of <br />Mexico by the middle of next week. Environmental conditions are <br />expected to be conducive for gradual development of the disturbance <br />thereafter while it moves generally west-northwestward to <br />northwestward near or parallel to the coast of Mexico.<br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br />* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br /><br />$$<br />Forecaster D.

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
200 PM PDT Fri Oct 03 2025
 
While Octave's overall appearance has remained steady since this
morning, its center appears to be just embedded enough within the 
central dense overcast produced by its convection for recent 
subjective Dvorak estimates to come up to T3.5 or 55 kt. Objective 
intensity estimates are still a little lower, so the intensity has 
been nudged up slightly to 50 kt for this advisory. There was no 
useful ASCAT data available for this afternoon's analysis, but 
earlier SAR data also generally supported an intensity near 50 kt 
with wind radii similar to what NHC previously analyzed.

No changes of note were made to the NHC track or intensity 
forecasts, but both aspects of the forecast remain highly uncertain, 
especially beyond the next 24 hours. Octave should still continue 
west-northwestward for another day or so, before it slows down and 
turns northward. Next week Octave will likely begin moving slowly 
eastward, but exactly how fast and how far north it moves before 
will depend on how much Octave interacts with a trough well to its 
north and a large disturbance developing to its east. The NHC track 
forecast is still near the middle of the multi-model and 
single-model ensemble envelopes but confidence in the forecast has 
not increased, especially beyond 72 hours.

Similarly, Octave's intensity will probably change little for the 
next 12 to 24 hours. After that, it will have a brief period of a 
day or so where the shear is expected to lessen and the cyclone 
could intensity further. The Google DeepMind Ensemble Mean continues 
to be an outlier in showing Octave reaching hurricane strength, but 
the ensemble shows that there is a wide range of possibilities from 
a near steady-state tropical storm to a strong hurricane. The 
official forecast is still on the high end of the other intensity 
guidance, but is lower than the GDM mean. By the end of the 
forecast period, Octave will likely weaken as it interacts with the 
much larger disturbance currently located to its east.
