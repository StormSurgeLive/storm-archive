Interests in southern Baja California Sur should monitor the 
progress of Priscilla.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products 
issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM MST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Priscilla was 
located near latitude 15.4 North, longitude 106.6 West. Priscilla is 
moving toward the northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h). A slow, generally 
northward drift is expected through Sunday, followed by a faster 
northwestward motion beginning on Monday. On the forecast track, 
the center of Priscilla is expected to move offshore of and parallel 
to the coast of southwestern Mexico through early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Strengthening is forecast during the next few days, and Priscilla is 
expected to become a hurricane by Sunday night.
 
Priscilla is a large tropical storm, with tropical-storm-force winds 
extending outward up to 140 miles (220 km) from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area 
along the southwestern coast of Mexico on Sunday and Monday.
 
RAINFALL: Outer bands from Priscilla will bring heavy rain to 
portions of southwestern Mexico through Monday. Across coastal 
portions of Michoac√°n and far western Guerrero, rainfall amounts of 
4 to 6 inches are expected, with local amounts up to 8 inches. 
Across Colima, western Jalisco, and the rest of Guerrero along the 
coast, 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected. This rainfall will bring 
a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas of higher terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the 
coast of southwestern Mexico and will reach portions of the coast of 
west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California peninsula by 
Monday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and 
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local 
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM MST.

Tropical Storm Priscilla Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
200 PM MST Sat Oct 04 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Invest 99E has continued to improve 
today, with an elongated convective band having formed through 
the western and northern part of the circulation.  Given the 
system‚Äôs broad nature, its center definition had been questionable, 
particularly based on ASCAT data from yesterday evening.  However, a 
recent 1645 UTC ASCAT pass showed that the center has become 
significantly better defined, with 35-40 kt winds occurring north 
and northwest of the center.  Based on these data, advisories are 
being initiated on Tropical Storm Priscilla, with an estimated 
intensity of 40 kt.

Priscilla is moving northwestward (315 degrees) at 8 kt.  A 
large-scale trough is currently located over the western United 
States and extends southward over Baja California, leaving 
Priscilla in an environment of weak steering currents.   In the 
short term, that should cause the storm to slow down and drift in a 
general northward direction for the next 36 hours.  After that 
time, Priscilla is expected to settle in to a more steady 
northwestward track as a stronger mid-level ridge builds over 
northern Mexico and the deep-layer trough remains entrenched over 
the western United States.  For most of the forecast period, the 
NHC track forecast leans on the eastern side of the guidance 
envelope, in the vicinity of the ECMWF, HCCA consensus aid, and 
Google DeepMind ensemble mean.

Priscilla will be moving over sea surface temperatures of about 29 
degrees Celsius during the next couple of days, coincident with a 
period of strong upper-level divergence.  These conditions should 
support strengthening, although the system's large size could limit 
the rate of intensification in the short term.  That said, some of 
the Rapid Intensification (RI) indices are greater than 50% within 
36 and 48 hours, so if Priscilla can develop a tighter inner core 
within the larger wind field, more significant strengthening would 
be possible.  The NHC intensity forecast calls for Priscilla to 
become a hurricane by Sunday night, with strengthening continuing 
through Tuesday.  Cooler water temperatures and a less favorable 
atmosphere should induce weakening by Wednesday and Thursday.

 
KEY MESSAGES:

1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the 
coast of southwestern Mexico within the watch area Sunday and 
Monday.  Interests in the southern portion of Baja California Sur 
should also monitor the progress of Priscilla.

2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Priscilla will impact coastal 
sections of southwestern Mexico through Monday, which could result 
in flash flooding, particularly in areas of higher terrain.

3.  Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico and will reach the coasts of 
west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California peninsula by 
Monday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and 
rip current conditions.

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
800 PM PDT Sat Oct 04 2025
 
Octave's organization has held relatively steady since the previous
advisory.  Overshooting cloud tops continue to burst through a
modestly-sized central dense overcast.  An earlier AMSR2 37 GHz
overpass showed a curved band wrapping around the northern and
western quadrants of the storm.  Subjective and objective Dvorak
estimates range from 42 kt to 65 kt, and the initial intensity is
held at 55 kt representing a blend of these values.
 
The storm is still slowing moving north-northwestward at 4 kt.  A
turn to the north is expected shortly, followed by an accelerated
eastward motion in about 24 hours.  Much of this track prediction
depends on the evolution of Tropical Storm Priscilla, located about
1100 miles to the east of Octave.   The NHC track forecast has
shifted slightly north of the previous track forecast due to a more
northward initial position and lies between HCCA and the Google Deep
Mind ensemble mean.
 
Octave has a short window of 18-24 hours with relatively conducive
atmospheric conditions to intensify.  Weak vertical wind shear and
adequate mid-level moisture should allow Octave to strengthen.  By 
Monday, increasing upper-level winds are expected to disrupt 
Octave's circulation and induce a gradual weakening trend.  Octave 
is still forecast to open into a trough on the southern side of 
Tropical Storm Priscilla by the end of the forecast period.  Only 
minor adjustments were made to the latest official intensity 
prediction.
