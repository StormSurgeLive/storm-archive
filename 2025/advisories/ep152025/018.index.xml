If current trends <br />persist, advisories on a tropical depression could be initiated <br />later today or tonight. The system is forecast to move slowly <br />west-northwestward, remaining offshore of the southwestern coast of <br />Mexico during the next several days. Interests along the <br />southwestern coast of Mexico should continue to monitor the progress <br />of this system. For additional information, including gale warnings, <br />please see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather <br />Service.<br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent. <br />* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br /><br />South of Southern Mexico:<br />An area of low pressure is expected to form off the southern coast <br />of Mexico by the middle of next week. Gradual development of this <br />system is possible thereafter, and a tropical depression could form <br />during the middle to latter part of next week while moving <br />west-northwestward to northwestward, near or parallel to the coast <br />of Mexico.<br />* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br />* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br /><br />&&<br /><br />High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br />found under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on <br />the web at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php <br /><br />$$<br />Forecaster Hogsett]]>

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
800 AM PDT Sat Oct 04 2025
 
Octave's overall appearance has remained steady this morning, with 
its center embedded within a large area of persistent deep 
convection. A recent AMSR-2 microwave pass also indicates that the 
tropical storm is maintaining a well-organized structure, with 
curved bands apparent in the microwave imagery. A blend of 
subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates, and the 
persistence of deep convection throughout the morning, support a 
slight increase in the intensity to 50 kt for this advisory.

The storm is moving northwestward with an estimated motion of 310/6 
kt. This motion is expected to continue today before beginning a 
northward and eventually eastward turn later this weekend and early 
next week. The precise timing of the eastward turn is somewhat 
uncertain, as it depends on the interaction of Octave with Invest 
99E to its east and a trough to its north. The NHC track forecast 
for this advisory is similar to the prior advisory and represents a 
blend of track consensus aids and the faster Google DeepMind 
solution. 

Vertical wind shear is expected to remain weak for the next 24 h. 
Within this narrow window of time, conditions are forecast to 
remain marginally favorable for some slight intensification. 
However, after 24 h as Octave turns toward the east, wind shear is 
expected to increase as the storm interacts with the much larger 
system to its east. Late this weekend, Octave is forecast to begin 
a weakening trend that will continue throughout the forecast 
period. The current NHC intensity forecast is slightly higher 
than the prior advisory during the next day or so, and it remains 
near the middle of the guidance envelope.
