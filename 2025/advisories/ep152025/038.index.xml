----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...23.8N 114.7W
ABOUT 165 MI...265 KM WSW OF CABO SAN LAZARO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 330 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has discontinued all watches.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor 
products issued by your local national meteorological service.
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Priscilla was
located near latitude 23.8 North, longitude 114.7 West. Priscilla is
moving toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A turn 
toward the north is anticipated later today and tonight. On the 
forecast track, the center of Priscilla is expected to move
parallel to, but offshore of, the coast of Baja California Sur.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Weakening is forecast, and Priscilla is expected to 
become a post-tropical cyclone by Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Gusty winds will be possible along the west coast of Baja
California Sur today.
 
RAINFALL:  As Priscilla moves off the west coast of Baja California,
up to an inch of rain is expected across the Baja California
peninsula.  For the southwestern United States, 2 to 4 inches of
rain, with local storm total maxima to 6 inches, are expected across
portions of central and northern Arizona, southern Utah, and
southwest Colorado through Saturday.  Flash flooding is likely in 
portions of central Arizona, with scattered areas of flash flooding 
expected across the remainder of Arizona, southern Utah, southwest 
Colorado, and far northwest New Mexico.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting the Pacific
coast of Baja California Sur as well as portions of coastal
southwestern and west-central Mexico.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, in addition
to some coastal flooding. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

Tropical Storm Priscilla Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
200 AM MST Thu Oct 09 2025
 
Priscilla has been gradually losing its organized deep convection
overnight.  As a result, objective and subjective satellite 
intensity estimates have fallen, and the initial intensity is 
lowered to 45 kt for this advisory.  While scatterometer data did 
not measure the core of the storm, it did show tropical-storm-force 
winds about 40 miles offshore of Baja California Sur.  The wind 
radii have been adjusted accordingly.
 
The estimated motion is northwestward at 7 kt.  As Priscilla becomes 
a shallow vortex, it is expected to turn north-northwestward later 
this morning in the low-level flow. By Friday, the system should 
slow and drift northward, stalling off the coast of the Baja 
California Peninsula until the circulation opens into a trough.
 
The storm has moved over the 26 degree C isotherm toward 
progressively cooler waters.  Mid-level humidities are also falling, 
and vertical wind shear is forecast to increase substantially.  
These atmospheric and oceanic conditions should accelerate 
Priscilla's transition into a post-tropical cyclone.  The latest NHC 
intensity forecast now calls for Priscilla to become a post-tropical 
cyclone in 24 hours and dissipate off the coast of Baja California 
in a couple of days or so.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Baja California
Sur Pacific coastline within the Tropical Storm Watch area for the
next several hours.  Interests elsewhere in the Baja California
peninsula should monitor the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.  Moisture associated with Priscilla will lead to heavy rainfall
and a flash flood risk across portions of Arizona, southern Utah,
through the Four Corners into southwest Colorado and far northwest
New Mexico through Saturday.
 
3.  Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting the Pacific
coast of Baja California Sur as well as portions of the coast of
southwestern and west-central Mexico. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, in addition
to some coastal flooding.

...OCTAVE BECOMES A POST-TROPICAL CYCLONE...
...THIS IS THE LAST NHC ADVISORY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM MST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.7N 110.5W
ABOUT 360 MI...580 KM S OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA

PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 65 DEGREES AT 17 MPH...28 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1006 MB...29.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Octave
was located near latitude 17.7 North, longitude 110.5 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east-northeast near 17
mph (28 km/h). This motion will continue until the system  
dissipates into an open trough later today.

with higher gusts. The system is expected to continue to weaken and 
dissipate into an open trough later today.

 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Post-Tropical Cyclone Octave Discussion Number  38
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
800 AM MST Thu Oct 09 2025
 
Octave's low-level center has become exposed due to increasing wind 
shear. The small area of convection that the system had produced 
overnight has collapsed. Given the wind shear, Octave is not 
forecast to regain convection and thus is designated as a remnant 
low with an initial intensity of 30 kt. The center of Octave has 
already become a little more ragged on satellite imagery and the 
system is expected to open up into a trough and dissipate later 
today.
 
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system.  For additional information on the remnant
low please see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather
Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and
on the web at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php
