Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
800 AM PDT Fri Oct 03 2025
 
Octave has changed little during the past several hours. The system 
still appears to be sheared, and satellite intensity estimates are 
similar to six hours ago, so the intensity is held at 45 kt for this 
advisory. The outlook for Octave is relatively high confidence for 
the next day or so. Octave should continue moving west-northwestward 
near 7 kt, steered by a small mid-level ridge centered between 
Octave and the Baja California Peninsula. During that time, it 
should also remain somewhat sheared with its intensity only 
fluctuating slightly up or down over that period. Confidence in the 
NHC forecast is high through Saturday.

However, by Saturday evening, the uncertainty in the forecast grows 
substantially. First, the aforementioned ridge is expected to 
weaken, resulting in very weak steering flow for the following 
couple of days. A trough over the far northern east Pacific will 
probably cause Octave to turn and drift eastward during that time. 
After that, another larger disturbance to Octave's east will likely 
also influence Octave's track, potentially causing it to move faster 
toward the east by the middle of next week. With steering currents 
weak, only small changes in the environment could have a large 
impact on Octave's track. The spread in the track guidance grows 
substantially beyond 48 h, so confidence in the forecast is much 
lower at that point.

The intensity is likewise uncertain beyond 24 to 36 h.  The shear 
affecting Octave is expected to lessen, and the tropical storm 
should be in an environment otherwise conducive for strengthening 
for at least a day or two. Octave's relatively small size could make 
it susceptible to relatively quick changes in intensity, up or 
down. All of the traditional dynamical intensity models forecast 
that Octave will change little in strength during that period. On 
the other hand, Google DeepMind (GDM) ensemble shows a very 
different story with an unusually large range of possibilities 
between tropical depression and major hurricane strength. The NHC 
forecast has not been changed, and is on the high end of the 
traditional guidance, but below the GDM ensemble mean. Because of 
this discrepancy, confidence in the intensity forecast is low, 
despite the fact that no changes were made to the NHC forecast with 
this advisory.
