Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within 24 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the Baja California peninsula should monitor
the progress of Priscilla.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM MST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Priscilla was
located near latitude 20.9 North, longitude 111.8 West.  Priscilla 
is moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this 
motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days, followed 
by a turn toward the north Thursday night.  On the forecast track, 
the center of Priscilla is expected to move parallel to, but 
offshore of, the coast of Baja California Sur through Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Additional weakening is expected for the next few days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195
miles (315 km).  A weather station on Socorro island, located about 
155 miles (250 km) south-southeast of Priscilla's eye, recently 
reported a wind gust of 36 mph (57 km/h). 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 962 mb (28.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Priscilla can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Pacific coast
of Baja California Sur within the watch area through Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: 1 to 2 inches of rain are expected in southern Baja
California Sur into Wednesday, with local storm totals up to 4
inches as the outer bands of Priscilla reach the area.  This
rainfall could bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas
of higher terrain.  Moisture from Priscilla should bring 1 to 2
inches of rain, with local amounts to 4 inches, to portions of
west-central Mexico, which could lead to flash flooding within the
area’s terrain.  From late this week into this weekend, moisture
from Priscilla leads to heavy rainfall and a flash flood risk over
portions of the U.S. Desert Southwest.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of
the coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as
portions of the coast of the southern Baja California peninsula.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions, in addition to some coastal flooding.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM MST.

Hurricane Priscilla Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
800 PM MST Tue Oct 07 2025
 
While Priscilla remains a large and formidable hurricane, its 
satellite structure is starting to show signs of decay. The eyewall 
cloud top temperatures have warmed over the past 3-6 hours, and the 
last several microwave passes show that the eye is now open to the 
north. Some of these changes could be due to ocean upwelling, which 
the hurricane-regional models have been forecasting to occur in the 
relatively shallow warm waters the large hurricane has been 
traversing through. While both TAFB and SAB Dvorak CI estimates were 
constrained at T5.5/102-kt, their data-T numbers have declined, and 
based on the further degradation on satellite imagery since that 
time, the initial intensity is being set to 90 kt for this advisory, 
which is on the lower end of the intensity estimates. 

Priscilla has resumed a more northwestward motion, estimated at 
310/8 kt. The track philosophy remains unchanged, with a 
northwestward motion at a similar pace expected to continue for the 
next couple of days as a mid-level ridge remains in place to the 
northeast of the hurricane. The ridging then becomes eroded and 
shifted east as a shortwave trough, currently over British Columbia, 
digs in southward and ultimately cuts off just offshore of the 
western U.S. coastline. This synoptic evolution will likely cause 
Priscilla to turn northward from 48-72 hours. However, the cyclone 
will also become more vertically shallow and may not feel the full 
effects of the evolving mid-level steering, ultimately slowing down 
substantially by the end of the forecast. The track guidance this 
cycle has shifted a little rightward, with the Google DeepMind 
ensemble mean (GDMI) aid a notable rightward outlier. The NHC track 
was adjusted a little right, but not as far right as GDMI, staying 
between it and the reliable HFIP Corrected Consensus Approach (HCCA) 
aid. It is worth noting there is quite a bit of along track spread 
in the ensemble guidance in 48-72 h, so the forward motion at the 
end of the forecast track is more uncertain than usual.

The hurricane appears past its peak tonight with the recent 
structural decline on satellite imagery. While SHIPS guidance 
indicates sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) under the hurricane should 
be in the 28 C range, the HAFS-A/B and HWRF SSTs forecast output 
suggests the large hurricane has upwelled much cooler ocean waters 
that may take several days for the satellite-based SST methods to 
properly depict. With this in mind, the NHC intensity forecast is 
lower than the previous cycle, in good agreement with the intensity 
aids, showing steady weakening over the next 2-3 days as Priscilla 
moves into even cooler SSTs. Shear also increases quickly out of the 
southwest beyond 48 hours, and both the GFS/ECMWF show Priscilla's 
remaining convection shearing off in 72 h, which will mark when the 
NHC forecast shows Priscilla as a remnant low near to the central 
Baja California coastline. The global models show the remnant low 
dissipating shortly thereafter.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Baja California
Sur Pacific coastline within the Tropical Storm Watch area tonight
into Wednesday. Interests elsewhere in the Baja California peninsula
should monitor the progress of Priscilla.
 
2.  Rainfall associated with Priscilla will impact portions of Baja 
California Sur into Wednesday.  Moisture associated with Priscilla 
will lead to heavy rainfall across west-central Mexico from tonight 
into Thursday morning and across the U.S. Desert Southwest from 
late this week into this weekend.  This could result in flash 
flooding, particularly in areas of higher terrain.
 
3.  Swells generated by Priscilla are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico as well as the coast
of the southern Baja California peninsula. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, in
addition to some coastal flooding.

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
200 AM PDT Wed Oct 08 2025
 
Satellite imagery indicates that Octave continues to produce small 
bursts of deep convection, with a new area of convection 
redeveloping south of the low-level circulation center during the 
past few hours. Overall, the cyclone remains sheared and poorly 
organized, with the low-level center partially exposed on the 
northeastern edge of the convection. Since the overnight ASCAT pass 
did not sample the circulation center, the initial intensity is set 
at 35 kt, which represents a blend of the subjective Dvorak and 
objective satellite estimates.

The initial motion is toward the east, or 080 degrees, at around 9 
kt, and this motion is expected to continue through the morning 
hours today. A turn toward the northeast is expected later today 
into Thursday as Octave moves south of Hurricane Priscilla and near 
another developing system (EP90) to its southeast, located near the 
southwest coast of Mexico. This forecast track is very similar to 
the previous NHC advisory and represents a blend of the consensus 
aids and the Google DeepMind guidance.

Although the current intensity is estimated at 35 kt, this value may 
be somewhat generous given the recent degradation in Octave’s 
satellite presentation under strengthening easterly shear. Simulated 
satellite imagery from the global models indicates that intermittent 
bursts of convection should continue through the day today before 
diminishing thereafter. Thus, the new NHC forecast now shows the 
system becoming a post-tropical remnant low in 24 hours, and 
dissipating by 48 hours. The intensity forecast is similar to the 
previous one and lies near the middle portion of the guidance 
envelope.
