Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
200 AM PDT Fri Oct 03 2025
 
Octave remains a sheared tropical cyclone, with the low-level center 
mostly exposed and displaced east of a recent burst of deep 
convection. The latest subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates 
from TAFB and SAB are 3.5/55 kt and 3.0/45 kt, respectively, while 
the UW-CIMSS objective estimates have ranged between 35 and 44 kt 
during the past several hours. A recent 03/0435Z Metop-B ASCAT pass 
was helpful in determining the tropical-storm-force wind radii and 
the center location, and it also indicated peak winds of 38 kt. 
Based on a blend of these data, and accounting for some 
undersampling in the scatterometer data, the initial intensity is 
set at 45 kt for this advisory.

Octave is estimated to be moving west-northwestward, or 290 degrees 
at 7 kt.  This general motion is expected to continue through 
tonight as the cyclone is steered along the southern periphery of a 
weak subtropical ridge located to its north.  Octave is forecast to 
slow considerably and turn northward by late Saturday, followed by a 
sharp eastward turn by late Sunday as a mid-level trough approaches 
from the northwest and the subtropical ridge to its east weakens due 
to the influence of a larger tropical cyclone developing offshore of 
the southwestern or west-central coast of Mexico.  The new NHC track 
forecast is similar to the previous prediction and lies near a blend 
of the multi-model consensus aids.

Octave will remain over warm waters and within a moist environment 
for the next few days.  East-southeasterly vertical wind shear is 
expected to continue impacting the cyclone for the next 12 to 24 
hours, which should inhibit strengthening.  Beyond 24 hours, the 
shear is forecast to decrease to light levels, while the cyclone 
remains over waters near 27C and within a sufficiently moist 
environment.  These conditions should allow for some modest 
strengthening over the weekend.  By days 4 and 5, Octave is forecast 
to encounter increasing southeasterly shear and a drier mid-level 
environment, which should result in steady weakening.  The official 
intensity forecast has been lowered slightly to account for a 
notable decrease among the various intensity aids.  The forecast now 
lies above most of the intensity guidance throughout the period, and 
future forecasts may need to adjust the intensity downward further 
if the weakening trends in the guidance persist.
