Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
200 AM MST Wed Oct 01 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Octave has improved during the past 
several hours, with a well-defined curved band now wrapping more 
than halfway around the low-level center.  This improvement in 
structure appears to be due to a decrease in vertical wind shear, 
which has lessened to around 16 kt according to the latest UW-CIMSS 
analysis.  The most recent subjective Dvorak intensity estimates 
from TAFB and SAB also indicate a stronger system, both coming in 
at 3.5/55 kt, while the UW-CIMSS objective estimates are lower, 
ranging between 33 and 40 kt since the previous advisory.  Based on 
a blend of these data, and considering the improved satellite 
presentation, the initial intensity has been raised to 50 kt for 
this advisory, which may be conservative.

Octave is estimated to be moving north-northwestward, or 335 degrees 
at 6 kt.  This general motion is expected to continue today as the 
cyclone moves into a weakness in the subtropical ridge created by a 
disturbance to its north.  Once that disturbance is absorbed by 
Octaveâ€™s circulation, a mid-level ridge is forecast to become 
re-established to the north of the cyclone, steering it westward to 
west-northwestward from tonight through Saturday.  By 120 hours, 
Octave is expected to slow considerably and turn eastward as a 
longwave trough approaches from the northwest and the subtropical 
ridge to its east is eroded by a developing tropical cyclone 
offshore of southwestern Mexico.  The new NHC track forecast has 
been shifted west of the previous one to account for the delay in 
the cyclone turning toward the north-northwest and to better match 
the latest guidance trends.  The forecast lies near the middle of 
the guidance envelope and is close to a blend of the GDMI, FSSE, 
TVCE, and HCCA track aids.

Octave will remain over warm water and within a moist environment 
for the next several days.  However, vertical wind shear is forecast 
to fluctuate between moderate and strong levels, which should hinder 
significant intensification.  Some additional strengthening is 
possible today, followed by little change in intensity over the next 
few days.  Modest intensification could occur by days 4 and 5 as the 
shear relaxes, although sea surface temperatures will be slightly 
cooler and the mid-level environment less moist by that time. 
Confidence in the intensity forecast remains low due to considerable 
spread among the guidance.  The official forecast has been adjusted 
higher to account for the cycloneâ€™s improved structure and is most 
closely aligned with the SHIPS and LGEM intensity aids.
