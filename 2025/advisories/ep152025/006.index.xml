      <title>Tropical Storm Octave Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Octave Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152025
800 AM PDT Wed Oct 01 2025
 
Octave's cloud pattern has changed little in organization over the 
past few hours.  A convective band wraps around the southern and 
eastern portion of the circulation with a banding feature also 
noted over the western semicircle.  The advisory intensity is set 
at 55 kt in agreement with a subjective Dvorak estimate from TAFB.  
Objective Dvorak and microwave estimates from UW-CIMSS are a little 
lower than that value.

The cyclone is moving generally northwestward, or around 325/7 kt.  
A west-northwestward track is likely during the next day or so, 
along the southern side of a subtropical high pressure area. Later 
in the forecast period, a turn to the north into a weakness in the 
subtropical ridge is expected.  Around day 5, Octave is forecast to 
turn eastward in response to a trough off the California coast.  The 
official forecast is close to the latest track model consensus.

The system should remain over marginally warm waters and in a moist 
mid- to low-level environment for the next several days.  Easterly 
vertical wind shear could relax somewhat in 2-3 days, which would 
allow for some strengthening, and the system could eventually become 
a hurricane.  However, the small size of the cyclone suggests that 
it could also be more responsive to less conducive conditions in the 
future environment.  The official intensity forecast is conservative 
and lies more or less in the middle to upper portion of the model 
guidance, which continues to show considerable spread.
