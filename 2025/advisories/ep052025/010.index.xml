DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM CST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erick was located 
near latitude 15.2 North, longitude 97.1 West. Erick is moving 
toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion 
is expected to continue through Thursday night.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Erick is expected to make landfall in the 
western portion of the Mexican state of Oaxaca or the eastern 
portion of the Mexican state of Guerrero early Thursday morning, and 
then continue inland over southern Mexico during the day on 
Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 125 mph (205 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Erick is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some additional strengthening 
could occur before landfall.  After landfall, Erick should rapidly 
weaken over the mountains of Mexico, and the system is likely to 
dissipate Thursday night or early Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 950 mb (28.06 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Erick can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header
WTPZ45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Erick will produce rainfall totals of 8 to 12 inches, with
maximum totals of 16 inches, across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and
Guerrero. This rainfall will lead to life-threatening flooding and
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain. Rainfall totals of
2 to 4 inches, with maximum totals of 6 inches, are expected across
the Mexican states of Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with Erick,
please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning 
area beginning during the next few hours, and they are possible in 
the hurricane watch area on Thursday. Tropical Storm conditions are 
currently spreading onshore in the hurricane warning area.  Tropical 
storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning area 
beginning during the next few hours. Wind speeds atop and on the 
windward sides of hills and mountains are often up to 30 percent 
stronger than the near-surface winds indicated in this advisory, and 
in some elevated locations could be even greater.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous, life-threatening storm surge is expected 
to produce coastal flooding near and to the east of where the center 
crosses the coast, in areas of onshore winds.  The surge will be 
accompanied by large and destructive waves.

SURF: Swells generated by Erick will continue affecting the coast of
southern Mexico through Thursday.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1200 AM CST.
Next complete advisory at 300 AM CST.

Hurricane Erick Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052025
900 PM CST Wed Jun 18 2025
 
Erick's rapid intensification continued through 18/23Z. as an Air
Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near that time reported
that the central pressure had fallen to 953 mb.  However, since
that time, the satellite appearance of the hurricane went through 
a period when it was a little degraded, suggesting that the 
intensification rate may have slowed. This may be due to an 
attempted eyewall replacement cycle, as the aircraft data suggested 
concentric wind maxima during its pass through the center.  The 
intensity is a little uncertain, as the plane had to abort due to 
computer problems before it could probe the northeastern eyewall.  
Based on the central pressure, the observed wind structure, and the 
various satellite intensity estimates, the initial intensity is set 
to a possibly conservative 110 kt.
 
The initial motion estimate is northwestward at 320/8 kt.  This
motion should bring the center to the Mexican coast in the state of
Oaxaca within the next 12 h, with a subsequent northwestward motion
bringing the system farther inland over southern Mexico on Thursday
and Thursday night.  The forecast guidance is essentially the same
as for the previous advisory, and the new forecast track has a
slight nudge to the right based on the current location and motion.
 
Conditions continue to be favorable for strengthening, and it is
possible that Erick could get stronger before landfall if the
possible eyewall replacement completes.  Regardless of additional
intensification, rapid weakening is expected after landfall, and
Erick is expected to dissipate over southern Mexico Thursday night
or Friday.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erick continues to intensify and is now a major hurricane.  It 
is expected to be a major hurricane when it reaches the coast of 
Mexico in the western portion of the state of Oaxaca or the eastern 
portion of the state of Guerrero within the hurricane warning area 
early Thursday.  Devastating wind damage is possible where the core 
of the storm moves onshore.  Weather conditions are already 
deteriorating, and preparations to protect life and property should 
be rushed to completion.
 
2. Erick will produce heavy rainfall across portions of Central
America and Southwest Mexico through this week.  Life-threatening
flooding and mudslides are likely, especially in areas of steep
terrain.
 
3. A dangerous, life-threatening storm surge is expected to produce
coastal flooding near and to the east of where the center crosses
the coast, in areas of onshore winds.  The surge will be accompanied
by large and destructive waves.
