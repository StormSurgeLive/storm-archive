dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Watches and warnings may be extended westward along the coast later
today or tonight.  Interests elsewhere in southern Mexico should
monitor the progress of Erick.

products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 PM CST (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Erick was
located near latitude 12.6 North, longitude 94.1 West.  Erick is
moving toward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A slower
motion toward the northwest is expected to begin later today,
followed by a faster northwestward motion Wednesday through Friday.
On the forecast track, the center of Erick is expected to approach
the coast of southern Mexico Wednesday night and move inland or be
near the coast on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Rapid strengthening is forecast during the next
day or two, and Erick is expected to become a hurricane by tonight
or early Wednesday.  Erick is forecast to be near or at major
hurricane strength when it approaches the coast of southern Mexico
Wednesday night and Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Erick can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header
WTPZ45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Erick could produce rainfall totals of 8 to
16 inches, with maximum totals of 20 inches, across the Mexican
states of Oaxaca and Guerrero. This rainfall may produce life
threatening flooding and mudslides, especially in areas of steep
terrain. Rainfall totals of 3 to 5 inches, with maximum totals of 8
inches, are possible across the Mexican states of Chiapas,
Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Erick, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area Wednesday night and Thursday and possible in the hurricane
watch area on Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in
the tropical storm warning area late Wednesday and Wednesday night.
 
STORM SURGE: Dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding near and to the east of where the center crosses the coast
in areas of onshore winds.  The surge will be accompanied by large
and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erick are expected to begin affecting the
coast of southern Mexico in a day or so.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

      <title>Tropical Storm Erick Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>

Tropical Storm Erick Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052025
900 AM CST Tue Jun 17 2025
 
Erick's structure continues to show signs of organization, with a
partial 0819 UTC AMSR2 microwave pass possibly showing the initial
development of an inner core.  Subjective Dvorak estimates from
TAFB and SAB are T2.5/35 kt, and the latest objective ADT estimate
is just over 40 kt.  Based on a blend of these data, the initial
intensity is raised to 40 kt.
 
Erick appears to have slowed down a bit and is moving
west-northwestward (300 degrees) at 8 kt.  The storm is reaching
the western extent of a mid-level ridge to the north, with a
mid-/upper-level trough located over northern Mexico.  These
features should cause Erick to turn northwestward later today, with
that trajectory continuing for the next 3 days.  Speed-wise, the
cyclone is likely to move at its slowest (around 6 kt) this evening
but then gradually accelerate during the next several days.
Although the models are in good agreement on the general track of
Erick, the storm's parallel trajectory to the coast of Mexico will
play an important role in exactly which areas receive the most
significant wind and surge impacts.  The updated NHC track forecast 
has been nudged westward, and generally lies between the HCCA and 
TVCE consensus aids.
 
The environment appears ideal for rapid strengthening.  Vertical
shear is expected to be very low, with the cyclone moving over
waters of around 29 degrees Celsius and within a moist
mid-level environment of around 80 percent relative humidity.
As a result of these conditions, Rapid intensification (RI) indices
are rather high, particular for the 36- and 48-hour periods.  The
NHC intensity forecast explicitly shows RI occurring while Erick
approaches the coast of southern Mexico, with a 48-hour intensity
just below major hurricane strength.  Despite this increase in the
forecast intensity, there are still a few models (including the
normally skillful HCCA aid) that show Erick reaching major
hurricane strength, and additional upward adjustments in the
forecast could be required later today.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erick is expected to rapidly intensify before reaching the coast
of southern Mexico on Thursday, and a hurricane warning is now in
effect for portions of the coast of Oaxaca.  A hurricane watch is
in effect for portions of the Guerrero coast.
 
2. Erick will produce heavy rainfall across portions of Central 
America and Southwest Mexico through this week.  Life threatening 
flooding and mudslides are possible, especially in areas of steep 
terrain.
 
3. A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal flooding
near and to the east of where the center crosses the coast, in
areas of onshore winds.
