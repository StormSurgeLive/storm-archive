DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 AM CST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erick was located
near latitude 15.5 North, longitude 97.5 West. Erick is moving
toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion
is expected to continue through tonight.  On the forecast track, the
center of Erick is expected to make landfall in the western portion
of the Mexican state of Oaxaca or the eastern portion of the Mexican
state of Guerrero this morning, and then continue inland over
southern Mexico later today.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 145 mph (230 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Erick is a category 4 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.   Some additional strengthening
could occur before landfall.  After landfall, Erick should rapidly
weaken over the mountains of Mexico, and the system is likely to
dissipate Thursday night or early Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 939 mb (27.73 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Erick can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header
WTPZ45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Erick will produce rainfall totals of 8 to 12 inches, with
maximum totals of 16 inches, across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and
Guerrero. This rainfall will lead to life-threatening flooding and
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain. Rainfall totals of
2 to 4 inches, with maximum totals of 6 inches, are expected across
the Mexican states of Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with Erick,
please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area beginning during the next few hours, with extremely
destructive winds near the core of Erick.  Hurricane conditions
are possible in the hurricane watch area today. Tropical Storm
conditions are currently spreading onshore in the hurricane warning
area.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm
warning area beginning during the next few hours. Wind speeds atop
and on the windward sides of hills and mountains are often up to 30
percent stronger than the near-surface winds indicated in this
advisory, and in some elevated locations could be even greater.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous, life-threatening storm surge is expected
to produce coastal flooding near and to the east of where the center
crosses the coast, in areas of onshore winds.  The surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Erick will continue affecting the coast of
southern Mexico through today.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1200 AM CST.
Next complete advisory at 300 AM CST.

Hurricane Erick Special Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052025
1200 AM CST Thu Jun 19 2025
 
This is a special advisory mainly to update the intensity of Erick. 
After an earlier eyewall replacement, satellite images indicate 
very deep convection is wrapping around the eye of the hurricane.  
Using a blend of objective ADT Dvorak estimates and SATCON values 
from UW/CIMSS yields a current intensity estimate of 125 kt, which 
is used for this advisory.  Some additional strengthening is 
possible during the next couple of hours, although the interaction 
with land should halt the intensification process.  Erick will 
weaken rapidly after making landfall.

A slight leftward adjustment was made to the forecast track based 
on the recent motion, which is now 305/8 kt.

This special advisory is being issued in lieu of the 06Z 
intermediate advisory.


KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erick is now an extremely dangerous category 4 hurricane, and 
devastating wind damage is likely where the core moves onshore.  
Weather conditions are already deteriorating in the warning area, 
and preparations to protect life and property should have been 
completed.

2. Erick will produce heavy rainfall across portions of Central
America and Southwest Mexico through this week.  Life-threatening
flooding and mudslides are likely, especially in areas of steep
terrain.
 
3. A dangerous, life-threatening storm surge is expected to produce
coastal flooding near and to the east of where the center crosses
the coast, in areas of onshore winds.  The surge will be accompanied
by large and destructive waves.
