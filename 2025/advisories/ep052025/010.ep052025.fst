DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM CST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erick was located 
near latitude 15.2 North, longitude 97.1 West. Erick is moving 
toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion 
is expected to continue through Thursday night.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Erick is expected to make landfall in the 
western portion of the Mexican state of Oaxaca or the eastern 
portion of the Mexican state of Guerrero early Thursday morning, and 
then continue inland over southern Mexico during the day on 
Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 125 mph (205 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Erick is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some additional strengthening 
could occur before landfall.  After landfall, Erick should rapidly 
weaken over the mountains of Mexico, and the system is likely to 
dissipate Thursday night or early Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 950 mb (28.06 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Erick can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header
WTPZ45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Erick will produce rainfall totals of 8 to 12 inches, with
maximum totals of 16 inches, across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and
Guerrero. This rainfall will lead to life-threatening flooding and
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain. Rainfall totals of
2 to 4 inches, with maximum totals of 6 inches, are expected across
the Mexican states of Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco.

WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning 
area beginning during the next few hours, and they are possible in 
the hurricane watch area on Thursday. Tropical Storm conditions are 
currently spreading onshore in the hurricane warning area.  Tropical 
storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning area 
beginning during the next few hours. Wind speeds atop and on the 
windward sides of hills and mountains are often up to 30 percent 
stronger than the near-surface winds indicated in this advisory, and 
in some elevated locations could be even greater.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous, life-threatening storm surge is expected 
to produce coastal flooding near and to the east of where the center 
crosses the coast, in areas of onshore winds.  The surge will be 
accompanied by large and destructive waves.

SURF: Swells generated by Erick will continue affecting the coast of
southern Mexico through Thursday.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
