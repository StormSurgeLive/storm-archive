DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 AM CST (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Erick was 
located near latitude 13.1 North, longitude 95.1 West. Erick is 
moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h). A northwestward 
motion with a gradual increase in forward speed is expected over the 
next couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of Erick is 
expected to approach the coast of southern Mexico late tonight and 
move inland or be near the coast on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Rapid strengthening is forecast during the next day or two, and 
Erick is expected to become a hurricane later today. Erick is 
forecast to be near or at major hurricane strength when it 
approaches the coast of southern Mexico Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Erick can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header
WTPZ45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Erick could produce rainfall totals of 8 to
16 inches, with maximum totals of 20 inches, across the Mexican
states of Oaxaca and Guerrero. This rainfall may produce life
threatening flooding and mudslides, especially in areas of steep
terrain. Rainfall totals of 3 to 5 inches, with maximum totals of 8
inches, are possible across the Mexican states of Chiapas,
Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Erick, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area early Thursday and possible in the hurricane watch area on 
Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical 
storm warning area later today and tonight.
 
STORM SURGE: Dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding near and to the east of where the center crosses the coast
in areas of onshore winds.  The surge will be accompanied by large
and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Erick are expected to begin affecting the
coast of southern Mexico later today.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.

      <title>Tropical Storm Erick Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Erick Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052025
900 PM CST Tue Jun 17 2025
 
Satellite imagery shows that Erick is becoming increasingly 
well-organized. Deep convection has expanded and cooled, with 
enhanced infrared imagery indicating cloud tops as cold as -85 C 
near the center. A recent SSMIS microwave pass revealed an improved 
inner-core structure, including a developing curved band. The latest 
Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB were T3.0 and T4.0, respectively, 
and objective ADT values are approaching T3.5. In addition, 
just-received synthetic aperture radar data indicate winds near 
50 kt. The initial intensity is increased to 50 kt for this 
advisory to represent a blend of these estimates.

Erick is moving northwestward at about 310/6 kt. This slowing in 
forward speed is consistent with a weakening of the mid-level ridge 
to the north, caused by a mid- to upper-level trough progressing 
eastward across the central United States. This general motion is 
expected to continue through landfall, with only a gradual increase 
in forward speed. The track guidance remains in good agreement and 
continues to show the center of Erick approaching the coast of 
southern Mexico within the next 24 to 36 hours. Although confidence 
in the overall track is relatively high, small deviations could lead 
to significant changes in where and when the strongest winds and 
coastal impacts occur. The official forecast lies near the consensus 
of the HCCA and TVCE aids and is very close to the previous NHC 
track.

The environment ahead of Erick remains highly conducive for 
additional strengthening, with sea surface temperatures near 29 C, 
low vertical wind shear, and abundant mid-level moisture. Several 
dynamic regional models bring Erick to major hurricane strength 
before landfall, and the Rapid Intensification (RI) guidance 
continues to indicate a significant chance for rapid strengthening 
in the next 24 to 36 hours. The NHC forecast remains near the upper 
end of the guidance envelope but could still be somewhat 
conservative, especially if the current trend of improved structure 
continues overnight.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erick is expected to rapidly intensify before reaching the coast
of southern Mexico on Thursday, and a hurricane warning is in effect
for portions of the coast of Oaxaca and Guerrero coast.
 
2. Erick will produce heavy rainfall across portions of Central
America and Southwest Mexico through this week.  Life-threatening
flooding and mudslides are possible, especially in areas of steep
terrain.
 
3. A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal flooding
near and to the east of where the center crosses the coast, in
areas of onshore winds.
