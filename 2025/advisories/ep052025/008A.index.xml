DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 PM CST (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erick was located
near latitude 14.2 North, longitude 96.3 West. Erick is moving
toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A northwestward motion
with a gradual increase in forward speed is expected later today or
tonight. On the forecast track, the center of Erick is expected to
approach the coast of southern Mexico late tonight and move inland 
on Thursday.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that maximum sustained winds have increased to near 100 mph (155 
km/h) with higher gusts.  Rapid strengthening is expected to 
continue today, and Erick is forecast to reach major hurricane 
strength tonight or early Thursday as it approaches the coast of 
southern Mexico.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105
miles (165 km).
 
The minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data is 971 mb 
(28.67 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Erick can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header
WTPZ45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Erick will produce rainfall totals of 8 to 16 inches, with
maximum totals of 20 inches, across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and
Guerrero. This rainfall will lead to life-threatening flooding and
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain. Rainfall totals of
2 to 4 inches, with maximum totals of 6 inches, are expected across
Guatemala and the Mexican states of Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima,
Jalisco and Mexico City.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Erick, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area early Thursday and possible in the hurricane watch area on
Thursday. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the
warning area by this evening or overnight, and preparations to
protect life and property should be rushed to completion.  Tropical
storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning area
beginning late today and tonight.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding near and to the east of where the center crosses the coast
in areas of onshore winds. The surge will be accompanied by large
and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Erick will continue affecting the coast of
southern Mexico through Thursday.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Erick Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052025
900 AM CST Wed Jun 18 2025
 
Erick has become significantly better organized with an increasingly
symmetric and large central convective area with very cold cloud
tops.  GOES satellite imagery also shows impressive banding
structures both to the north and south of the central convective
area.  The latest subjective Dvorak numbers from TAFB and SAB range
from 65-77 kt, while the recent ADT estimate is in the 65-70 kt
range.  Since the time of the subjective estimates at 12Z, GOES
images suggest that the inner-core stucture has improved
significantly and an eye may be forming.  The intensity is 
therefore increased to 75 kt for this advisory, and Erik has begun 
its anticipated period of rapid intensification.  An Air Force 
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is currently enroute to Erick, 
which should provide a better estimate of the intensity.
 
Erick continues moving to the northwest, or 310/7 kt.  This general
motion, along with perhaps a slight acceleration, is expected
through landfall, which is forecast to occur early Thursday along
the southern coast of Mexico. The track guidance remains in good
agreement, and confidence in the overall track is high. Users should
keep in mind that small track deviations could still lead to
significant changes in where the strongest winds and coastal impacts
occur due to the oblique angle of approach. The official forecast
track is unchanged from the previous advisory and lies very close to
the HCCA aid.
 
Very favorable atmospheric and oceanic conditions surround Erick,
with warm ocean waters, low vertical wind shear and a moist
mid-level troposphere, and these conditions are expected to persist
through landfall.  The 06Z HAFS models are forecasting Erick to
become a major hurricane.  The various SHIPS rapid intensification
indices indicate a high likelihood of continued rapid strengthening
over the next 24 h, which would result in Erick becoming a major
hurricane.  The new NHC forecast explicitly shows Erick becoming a
major hurricane, but it's possible this forecast could be
conservative, especially if the current trend of improved structure
continues today.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erick is rapidly intensifying and is expected to be a major
hurricane when it reaches the coast of western Oaxaca or eastern
Guerrero within the hurricane warning area on Thursday.  Devastating
wind damage is possible where the core of the storm moves onshore.  
Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to 
completion.
 
2. Erick will produce heavy rainfall across portions of Central
America and Southwest Mexico through this week.  Life-threatening
flooding and mudslides are likely, especially in areas of steep
terrain.
 
3. A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal flooding
near and to the east of where the center crosses the coast, in
areas of onshore winds.
