DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM CST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erick was located
near latitude 14.9 North, longitude 96.7 West. Erick is moving
toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A northwestward motion
with a slight increase in forward speed is expected later today or
tonight. On the forecast track, the center of Erick is expected to
approach the coast of southern Mexico late tonight and move inland
on Thursday morning.
 
Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds have increased to near     
120 mph (195 km/h) with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening   
is expected until the center makes landfall.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to     
90 miles (150 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from the the Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft data is 953 mb (28.14 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Erick can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header
WTPZ45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Erick will produce rainfall totals of 8 to 12 inches, with
maximum totals of 16 inches, across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and
Guerrero. This rainfall will lead to life-threatening flooding and
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain. Rainfall totals of
2 to 4 inches, with maximum totals of 6 inches, are expected across
the Mexican states of Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Erick, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning 
area beginning during the next several hours, and they are possible 
in the hurricane watch area on Thursday. In the hurricane warning 
area, tropical storm conditions are expected to begin during the 
next few hours, and preparations to protect life and property 
should be rushed to completion.  Tropical storm conditions are 
expected in the tropical storm warning area beginning during the 
next several hours.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous, life-threatening storm surge is expected
to produce coastal flooding near and to the east of where the center
crosses the coast, in areas of onshore winds.  The surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Erick will continue affecting the coast of
southern Mexico through Thursday.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Erick Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052025
300 PM CST Wed Jun 18 2025

An Air Force Reconnaissance aircraft completed its mission into 
Erick this morning and found 93-kt flight-level winds at 700 mb 
along with a dropsonde central pressure of 971 mb around 17Z.  The 
recon data showed strengthening in between the 1530Z fix and the 17Z 
fix.  An eye has been present in visible and infrared satellite 
imagery since about 15Z this morning, and recent satellite imagery 
shows the eye continuing to become more circular with warming eye 
temperatures.  The eye is nearly completely surrounded by a large 
area of convective cloud tops colder than -70C.  As a result, 
satellite intensity estimates have been increasing quickly.  The 
18Z subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB range from 90-102 
kt.  Recent objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS are in the 
95-100 kt range.  Based on a blend of the data, the initial 
intensity is estimated to be 95 kt, and this might be a bit 
conservative.
 
The initial motion estimate is northwestward, or 315/8 kt.  This 
general motion, along with perhaps a slight acceleration, is 
expected through landfall, which is forecast to occur early Thursday 
morning along the southern coast of Mexico.  Erick has been moving 
to the right of the previous official forecast, and as a result, 
the new guidance shows landfall slightly to the east of the 
previous track.  The new NHC track forecast is shifted eastward, 
close to the latest TVCE and HCCA consensus aids.  Confidence in 
the track forecast is high.

Erick has been rapidly strengthening for the past 12 hours, and 
given the extremely favorable atmospheric and oceanic conditions 
along Erick's forecast track, further intensification in the short 
term appears very likely.  The 12Z HAFS models and the 18Z SHIPS 
guidance have Erick becoming a major hurricane soon.  The various 
SHIPS Rapid Intensification indices all show greater than a 70 
percent chance of 20 kt strengthening in the next 12 h.  The new 
NHC forecast shows 110 kt at 12 h, which is at the high end of the 
intensity guidance suite.  There is a possibility that Erick could 
strengthen more than forecast.

The next Air Force Reconnaissance aircraft is scheduled to be in 
the hurricane in a few hours, around 2330 UTC today.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erick continues to rapidly intensify and is expected to be a 
major hurricane when it reaches the coast of western Oaxaca or 
eastern Guerrero within the hurricane warning area late tonight or 
early Thursday.  Devastating wind damage is possible where the core 
of the storm moves onshore.  Weather conditions are already 
deteriorating, and preparations to protect life and property should 
be rushed to completion before sunset.
 
2. Erick will produce heavy rainfall across portions of Central
America and Southwest Mexico through this week.  Life-threatening
flooding and mudslides are likely, especially in areas of steep
terrain.
 
3. A dangerous, life-threatening storm surge is expected to produce 
coastal flooding near and to the east of where the center crosses 
the coast, in areas of onshore winds.  The surge will be accompanied 
by large and destructive waves.
