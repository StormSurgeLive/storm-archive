Hurricane Iona Discussion Number   7
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Mon Jul 28 2025
 
After rapidly strengthening overnight, the cloud pattern and
overall structure of Iona has changed little during the past 6
hours.  A fairly symmetric Central Dense Overcast is seen over the
center in geostationary satellite imagery, but there has been no
recent microwave data to examine the inner core structure. The
latest subjective satellite intensity estimates are T4.0/65 kt
from SAB, and T3.5/55 kt from both PHFO and JTWC.  Objective
estimates remain lower, although it is possible that the small size 
of the cyclone is making it difficult for those techniques to 
capture the true intensity.  The initial intensity for this advisory 
will remain 65 kt, in line with the higher subjective estimate from 
SAB.
 
Iona is located within a low-shear environment and over sea surface
temperatures of around 28C.  Those conditions favor strengthening,
however some nearby dry mid-level air may have been entrained in 
the circulation which likely caused the recent pause in
intensification.  Given the favorable upper-air pattern and warm 
sea surface temperatures, additional strengthening appears likely.  
The regional hurricane models are more aggressive this cycle and 
indicate that Iona could be near or at major hurricane strength in 
a day or so.  As a result, the lastest official forecast calls 
for rapid strengthening during the next 24 hours and the peak 
intensity is raised slightly from the previous advisory.  Around 
midweek, slightly lower SSTs and an increase in vertical
wind shear are expected to cause gradual weakening through the
remainder of the forecast period.  The updated NHC intensity 
forecast is close to the regional models through 24 hours, and then 
follows the latest multi-model (IVCN) consensus aid after that time.
 
Iona is moving westward or 270 degrees at 9 kt.  The storm is
forecast to move along the southern portion of a subtropical ridge
that is well established over the central Pacific.  This steering
pattern should take the storm westward during the next day or so,
followed by a faster west-northwestward motion after midweek. The
updated track forecast is once again near the center of the model
envelope, close to the various consensus aids.  Confidence remains
high that Iona will stay well south of the Hawaiian Islands.

Tropical Storm Keli Discussion Number   2
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Mon Jul 28 2025

ASCAT data from around 1830 Z showed a small area of 
tropical-storm-force winds just north of the center of the system.  
Based on that data, the depression has been upgraded to Tropical 
storm Keli with maximum winds of about 35 kt. Although the winds 
are estimated to be higher than earlier this morning, satellite 
images indicate that the deep convection has generally decreased 
during the past few hours. Keli is a very compact storm with its 
associated cloud field extending only about 90 n mi across. 
 
The storm is moving westward at about 9 kt. Keli is expected to 
continue westward, following Iona, during the next few days as it 
remains on the south side of a narrow mid-level ridge. The latest 
track models have trended a little to the north and are faster this 
cycle, and the official forecast has been nudged in those 
directions.
 
The environmental conditions could favor a little more strengthening 
during the next day or so while the storm is over relatively warm 
water, embedded in a moist air mass, and in generally moderate 
shear conditions. By the middle of the week, however, Iona's outflow 
will likely impinge on the cyclone. These unfavorable upper-level 
winds and stable air should end the opportunity for strengthening 
and cause weakening. Most of the models show Keli dissipating in 
about 2 days, except for the GFS which hangs on to the cyclone for 
about 3 days. Based on the latest guidance, the official forecast 
has moved up dissipation by 24 hours.
