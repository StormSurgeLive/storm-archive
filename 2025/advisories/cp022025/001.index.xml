Hurricane Iona Discussion Number   6
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
500 AM HST Mon Jul 28 2025
 
Iona has continued to become better organized overnight with a 
couple of recent microwave images depicting a well-defined low- to 
mid-level eye feature.  Recent geostationary satellite imagery has 
shown what appears to be a banded-type eye becoming apparent.  The 
latest subjective satellite intensity estimates were T4.0/65 kt from 
SAB, T3.5/55 kt from PHFO, and T3.0/45 kt from JTWC.  Given the 
recent improvement in structure as seen in the microwave images, the 
initial intensity is increased to 65 kt, making Iona the first 
hurricane in the Central Pacific basin of the 2025 hurricane season.
 
Iona remains in an environment favorable for strengthening.  The
cyclone is over SSTs of around 28C, and the shear is forecast to
remain 10 kt or less during the next 24 to 36 hours.  The only
inhibiting factor appears to be some drier mid-level air in the
surrounding environment.  Given these conditions, steady to 
possibly rapid strengthening is anticipated during the next 24 to 
36 hours, and the official intensity forecast again shows a 
higher peak than the previous advisory. After 36 hours, slightly 
lower SSTs and an increase in vertical wind shear are likely to 
result in gradual weakening throughout much of the remainder of the 
forecast period.  The updated intensity forecast is in good 
agreement with the FSSE, HCCA, and IVCN consensus aids, and is 
close to the peak shown by most of the regional hurricane models.
 
The storm is moving westward or 270 degrees at around 10 kt.  There
has been no change in the track forecast reasoning.  Iona should
continue to move westward along the southern side of a mid-level
ridge during the next couple of days.  After that time, a faster
west-northwestward motion is expected as Iona reaches the
southwestern portion of the ridge.  The updated track forecast is
very similar to the previous advisory and is a blend of the various
track consensus aids.  Confidence remains high that Iona will stay 
well south of the Hawaiian Islands.

Tropical Depression Two-C Discussion Number   1
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
500 AM HST Mon Jul 28 2025

Satellite data indicate that a new tropical depression has formed
over the central Pacific basin a little less than 400 n mi
east-northeast of Hurricane Iona. ASCAT data from several hours ago
indicated that the system had a well-defined circulation
with maximum winds of about 30 kt north of the center. More
recently, microwave images show that the system is very compact, and
its cloud pattern extends no more than 90 n mi across. The initial
intensity is set at 30 kt based on the earlier ASCAT data and the
latest satellite intensity estimates. It should be noted that the
formation of this system was poorly predicted by most of the
models. The small size of the depression, the complexity of the
ITCZ breakdown, and close proximity to Iona all contributed to the
forecasting difficulties.
 
The depression is moving westward at about 11 kt, but this motion is
somewhat uncertain since it has only recently formed. The system is
expected to continue westward, following Iona, during the next few
days as it remains on the south side of a narrow mid-level ridge.
The cyclone might move a little south of due west late in the week
when it is expected to weaken and move in the low-level flow. The
official track forecast generally follows the various consensus
aids.
 
The environmental conditions could favor a little strengthening
during the next day or so while the depression is over relatively
warm water, embedded in a moist airmass, and in generally low shear
conditions. However, as Iona gets stronger by the middle of the
week, its outflow will likely impinge on the depression. This should
end the opportunity for strengthening and cause weakening.  In fact,
the models show little to no strengthening and seem to have a poor
grasp on the cyclone. Therefore, the official intensity forecast
lies above all of the guidance in the short term given recent trends
and the system’s current structure.
