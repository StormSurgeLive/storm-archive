Hurricane Iona Discussion Number  13
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Tue Jul 29 2025
 
The satellite presentation has continued to deteriorate this 
evening, with the low-level center of Iona obscured by a central 
dense overcast with gradually warming cloud top temperatures.  The 
cyclone is continuing to be influenced by increasing westerly 
vertical wind shear while also moving over cooler sea surface 
temperatures around or slightly below 27C, as depicted by the 
Real-time, Global, Sea Surface Temperature Analysis.  The latest 
subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates ranged from 
4.5/77 knots to 5.5/102 knots, while the latest objective intensity 
estimates range from 77 to 87 knots.  Taking a blend of these data 
the initial intensity has been lowered to 90 knots for this 
advisory.
 
Iona is moving westward, or 275 degrees, at 15 knots.  This general 
motion is expected to continue during the next couple of days as the 
cyclone moves along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge to 
the north.  A turn toward the west-northwest and a gradual decrease 
in forward speed is expected late in the week and over the weekend, 
as the system is steered into a weakness in the mid-level ridge to 
the north.  The official track forecast remains near the center of 
the tightly clustered guidance envelope and is very close to the 
previous advisory. Confidence remains high that Iona will stay well 
south of the Hawaiian Islands.

The cyclone is expected to undergo rapid weakening tonight and 
Wednesday as it experiences increasing westerly vertical wind shear 
while also moving over cooler sea surface temperatures of 26.5 to 
27C.  The intensity forecast then shows little change in strength 
Thursday through Friday as sea surface temperatures begin to warm, 
vertical wind shear gradually eases, and mid-level moisture 
increases.  Iona should then begin to gradually weaken by days 4 
and 5 as the mid-levels dry out and the system becomes influenced by 
increasing westerly and southwesterly vertical wind shear.  The 
official forecast was adjusted to account for the latest intensity 
guidance trends, and lies pretty close to the middle of the guidance 
envelope.

Tropical Storm Keli Discussion Number   8
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Tue Jul 29 2025

Satellite imagery shows that Keli continues to produce organized 
deep convection, and the latest subjective Dvorak numbers from SAB, 
PHFO and JTWC are a consensus 2.5/2.5.  The recent objective 
intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS range from 30 to 40 kt.  The 
advisory intensity estimate is held at 35 kt.  The storm remains 
quite small with only about a 30 n mi extent of 34-kt winds from the 
center.
 
Keli is moving faster, with the motion estimated to be westward, or 
280/18 kt.  This faster westward motion is due to its proximity to 
the east-northeast of Iona, as well as the mid-level ridging 
located well to the north of the cyclone.  The track guidance is in 
good agreement, and the official forecast has been nudged to show a 
slightly faster forward motion.

Although Keli is hanging on as a tropical storm for the moment, it
is not likely to last for more than another day or so.  Increasing 
vertical wind shear from the outflow of Iona is likely to cause
weakening, and Keli's inflow should be soon disrupted by Iona's
low-level circulation.  The official forecast calls for weakening 
and dissipation in 36 hours or so.  The global models indicate 
that dissipation could occur a bit sooner than forecast.
