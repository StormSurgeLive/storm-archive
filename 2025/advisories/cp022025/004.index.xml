      <title>Hurricane Iona Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Hurricane Iona Discussion Number   9
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Mon Jul 28 2025
 
Iona has a very impressive satellite presentation this evening, with 
very cold cloud tops ranging from -70°C to -80°C surrounding the 
well-defined eye.  Subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates 
came in at 5.0/90 knots from PHFO and 5.5/102 knots from SAB.  The 
ADT and AiDT objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS have ranged 
between 97 and 104 knots over the past several hours. Based on a 
blend of these data, the initial intensity for this advisory has 
been increased to 100 knots, making Iona a Category 3 major
hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.
 
Iona is moving due west, or 270 degrees at 11 knots. This general 
motion, along with a gradual increase in forward speed, is expected 
to continue over the next several days as the cyclone moves along 
the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge to the north.  A turn 
toward the west-northwest is anticipated by late in the week as the 
system is influenced by a weakness in the mid-level ridge, created 
by a developing upper-level low west of the International Date Line. 
The official track forecast remains near the center of the guidance 
envelope and is nearly identical to the previous advisory.  
Confidence remains high that Iona will stay well south of the 
Hawaiian Islands.
 
Environmental conditions appear conducive for further 
intensification during the next 12 hours or so, as Iona will remain 
over warm sea surface temperatures near 28C, with sufficient 
mid-level moisture and minimal vertical wind shear.  Given the 
conducive environment, the intensity forecast calls for Iona to 
reach category 4 status later tonight or early Tuesday.  Steady 
weakening is forecast to begin Tuesday night or Wednesday and 
continue into the weekend, as the system moves over slightly cooler 
waters, encounters increasing westerly vertical wind shear, and 
begins to entrain drier mid-level air.  The intensity forecast has 
been adjusted slightly upward from the previous advisory, reflecting 
the latest trends in the intensity guidance.  This aligns well with 
regional hurricane models during the next 24 to 36 hours, and then 
lies near or slightly below the intensity guidance envelope 
thereafter.

Tropical Storm Keli Discussion Number   4
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Mon Jul 28 2025
  
Keli has not changed much this evening, with an area of deep 
convection to the west of the low-level center. The system is 
struggling to become better organized due to vertical wind shear. 
The subjective Dvorak satellite intensity estimates were T2.0 from 
both PHFO and JTWC. Using these estimates and satellite trends, the 
intensity is held at 35 kt for this advisory. Keli is a small 
tropical cyclone and tropical-storm-force winds only extend outward 
about 30 n mi from the center.
  
The storm is moving westward, with an estimated motion of 280/10 kt. 
Keli is forecast to continue moving generally westward for the next 
few days steered by a mid-level ridge north of the system.  The 
official track forecast is similar to the previous, although with a 
slightly faster forward motion.
 
Keli is forecast to remain over warm sea surface temperatures, but 
wind shear is forecast to increase later today, thus the official 
intensity forecast shows little change in intensity during the next 
day or so. As Keli continues to feel the upper-level outflow of 
nearby Hurricane Iona the system should begin to weaken by 36 h, and 
dissipate by Day 3. The official intensity forecast lies near the 
simple and corrected consensus aids. Global models indicate that the 
shear could take its toll on Keli quicker than forecast, and due to 
the small storm size it is possible that the system could dissipate 
into a trough earlier then officially forecast.
