Hurricane Iona Discussion Number   7
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Mon Jul 28 2025
 
After rapidly strengthening overnight, the cloud pattern and
overall structure of Iona has changed little during the past 6
hours.  A fairly symmetric Central Dense Overcast is seen over the
center in geostationary satellite imagery, but there has been no
recent microwave data to examine the inner core structure. The
latest subjective satellite intensity estimates are T4.0/65 kt
from SAB, and T3.5/55 kt from both PHFO and JTWC.  Objective
estimates remain lower, although it is possible that the small size 
of the cyclone is making it difficult for those techniques to 
capture the true intensity.  The initial intensity for this advisory 
will remain 65 kt, in line with the higher subjective estimate from 
SAB.
 
Iona is located within a low-shear environment and over sea surface
temperatures of around 28C.  Those conditions favor strengthening,
however some nearby dry mid-level air may have been entrained in 
the circulation which likely caused the recent pause in
intensification.  Given the favorable upper-air pattern and warm 
sea surface temperatures, additional strengthening appears likely.  
The regional hurricane models are more aggressive this cycle and 
indicate that Iona could be near or at major hurricane strength in 
a day or so.  As a result, the lastest official forecast calls 
for rapid strengthening during the next 24 hours and the peak 
intensity is raised slightly from the previous advisory.  Around 
midweek, slightly lower SSTs and an increase in vertical
wind shear are expected to cause gradual weakening through the
remainder of the forecast period.  The updated NHC intensity 
forecast is close to the regional models through 24 hours, and then 
follows the latest multi-model (IVCN) consensus aid after that time.
 
Iona is moving westward or 270 degrees at 9 kt.  The storm is
forecast to move along the southern portion of a subtropical ridge
that is well established over the central Pacific.  This steering
pattern should take the storm westward during the next day or so,
followed by a faster west-northwestward motion after midweek. The
updated track forecast is once again near the center of the model
envelope, close to the various consensus aids.  Confidence remains
high that Iona will stay well south of the Hawaiian Islands.

Tropical Storm Keli Discussion Number   3
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
500 PM HST Mon Jul 28 2025

Satellite imagery shows that Keli is producing a small area of deep 
convection near and just west of the estimated center position.  
There is little evidence of convective banding features, although 
there are some curved cloud lines noted over the eastern portion 
of the system on visible imagery.  Overall, the cloud pattern is 
rather disorganized with the storm experiencing easterly shear. 
The current intensity estimate is held at 35 kt, which is a 
little above the subjective Dvorak classifications and close to the 
objective AIDT and DRINT estimates from UW-CIMSS.  Keli is a small 
tropical cyclone and tropical-storm-force winds only extend outward 
about 30 n mi from the center.
 
The storm is moving westward, with a motion estimate of around 
280/10 kt. Keli is expected to continue on a generally westward 
track for the next few days while it remains on the south 
side of a narrow mid-level ridge.  Most of the track models have 
shifted north and are faster than in the previous advisory, and the 
official forecast has been adjusted accordingly.

Slight additional strengthening is possible during the next day or 
so while Keli moves over relatively warm waters.  However the 
unfavorable dynamical influence of the low-level circulation and 
upper-level outflow of nearby Hurricane Iona should result in a 
weakening trend in around 36 hours.  The global models show the 
system weakening into a trough in a few days.  Therefore, Keli could 
dissipate sooner than shown in this official forecast.
