HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Raymond can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions within the warning area in 
southwestern Mexico are expected to subside soon. Tropical storm 
conditions are expected on Las Islas Marias through early this 
morning, and in Baja California Sur beginning later this morning.

RAINFALL:  Rainfall totals of 4 to 6 inches with local amounts of 8 
or more inches are expected across Sonora and northern Chihuahua. 
This rainfall will bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in 
areas of higher terrain. Across coastal portions of Michoacan, 
Colima, Jalisco, Nayarit, Sinaloa, and the central to southern 
portions of Baja California Sur, rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches 
are expected.  Moisture from Raymond will also bring the potential 
for additional heavy rainfall over portions of the Southwest U.S. 
Sunday into early next week.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Raymond, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Raymond are affecting the coast of 
southwest and west-central Mexico.  These swells are expected to 
spread to the southern Baja California Sur by early Saturday. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 200 AM MST.

Tropical Storm Raymond Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172025
800 PM MST Fri Oct 10 2025
 
Raymond has generally changed little over the past several hours.
Satellite images show that the convective pattern appears ragged and
lacks banding features.  The low-level center is difficult to see,
but it is estimated to be located near the southeastern edge of the
cloud mass due to strong southeasterly vertical wind shear.  The
initial intensity is held at 45 kt, which is in general agreement
with the latest satellite intensity estimates.  The western edge of
Raymond's convection is getting close to the southern portion of
Baja California Sur, and heavy rains and tropical-storm-force winds
are likely to begin there early Saturday.
 
The storm continues to move swiftly northwestward at about 16 kt 
steered by a strong high pressure area centered over northern 
Mexico.  A trough moving into the western U.S. is expected to erode 
the ridge, which should result in a turn toward the north this 
weekend.  The center of Raymond is expected to reach the southern 
portion of Baja California peninsula on Saturday and then move into 
the Gulf of California late Saturday and Sunday.  The NHC track 
forecast is similar to the previous one and near the middle of the 
guidance envelope.
 
Continued strong shear, intrusions of dry air, and land interaction
with Baja California should cause Raymond to lose strength during
the next day or two.  The official forecast shows Raymond moving
into mainland Mexico in 36 to 48 hours, but it is possible
that Raymond dissipates or degenerates into a remnant low before
then.  Regardless of how long Raymond survives, heavy rainfall is
expected to spread into portions of Mexico and the Southwest U.S.
this weekend and early next week.  See the Key Messages below for
more details.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico through tonight, and along portions
of Baja California Sur on Saturday.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Raymond will impact coastal
sections of southwestern and northwestern Mexico through Sunday,
which could result in flash flooding, particularly in areas of
higher terrain.   Moisture from Raymond will bring the threat of
additional heavy rains to portions of the Southwest U.S. Sunday into
early next week.
