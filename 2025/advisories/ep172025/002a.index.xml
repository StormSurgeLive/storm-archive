BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Priscilla Advisory Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
200 PM MST Thu Oct 09 2025
 
...SIGNIFICANT RISK OF FLASH FLOODING ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST UNITED
STATES THROUGH THE WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM MST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.4N 114.9W
ABOUT 165 MI...265 KM W OF CABO SAN LAZARO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 330 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...996 MB...29.42 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Priscilla was
located near latitude 24.4 North, longitude 114.9 West.  Priscilla 
is moving toward the north-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h).   A turn
toward the north is anticipated later today and tonight.  On the
forecast track, the center of Priscilla is expected to move
parallel to, but offshore of, the coast of Baja California Sur.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast, and Priscilla is expected to become a
post-tropical cyclone by Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
 
RAINFALL:  As Priscilla moves off the west coast of Baja California, 
up to an inch of rain is expected across the Baja California 
peninsula.  For the southwestern United States, 2 to 4 inches of 
rain, with local storm total maxima to 6 inches, are expected across
portions of central and northern Arizona, southern Utah, and 
southwest Colorado through Saturday.  Flash flooding is likely in  
portions of central Arizona, with scattered areas of flash flooding 
expected across the remainder of Arizona, southern Utah, southwest 
Colorado, and far northwest New Mexico.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service 
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf

 
SURF: Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting the Pacific
coast of Baja California Sur as well as portions of coastal
southwestern and west-central Mexico.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, in addition
to some coastal flooding. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM MST.

Tropical Storm Priscilla Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
200 PM MST Thu Oct 09 2025
 
Deep convection associated with Priscilla has made a slight
comeback over the past few hours, with cloud tops to -60C in a few
clusters over the southern semicircle of the circulation.  Data
from a scatterometer overpass from a few hours ago showed highest
winds near 40 kt over the southwestern quadrant of the system.  The
advisory intensity is held at 40 kt based on the scatterometer
data and the slight resurgence in convection.  This is also close 
to the mean of objective and subjective satellite-based intensity 
estimates.
 
The storm continues on a generally north-northwestward track at an
estimated motion of 330/7 kt.  As the cyclone gradually spins down 
and becomes a shallow vortex, a turn toward the north and 
eventually north-northeast within the low-level flow is 
anticipated.  The storm is expected to slow down and dissipate just 
offshore the west coast of Baja California.

Priscilla is moving over SSTs of around 24 deg C and will likely 
traverse a little cooler waters to the west of Baja California Sur 
tonight and Friday.  This, combined with a rather dry low- to 
mid-level air mass, should lead to the system weakening into a 
remnant low before reaching the Baja California peninsula.  The 
official intensity forecast is on the high end of the model 
guidance suite.
 
Remnant moisture associated with Priscilla remains the primary
hazard associated with the system across portions of Southwestern
United States. Heavy rainfall and flash flooding is likely into the
weekend over portions of central Arizona, with scattered areas of
flash flooding expected across the remainder of Arizona, southern
Utah, southwest Colorado, and far northwest New Mexico. Please
follow forecast updates from local National Weather Service
forecast offices in the southwest U.S. at weather.gov and the
Weather Prediction Center at wpc.ncep.gov

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM CST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Raymond was
located near latitude 16.5 North, longitude 102.3 West.  Raymond is
moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this 
general motion is expected to continue through early Friday.  A 
turn toward the northwest is expected by late Friday, followed by a 
northward turn by early Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center 
of the cyclone is expected to move parallel to the southwestern 
coast of Mexico through Friday and then approach the southern Baja 
California Sur over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some strengthening is forecast through Friday, followed by a 
weakening trend over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within the
warning area tonight through Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Outer bands from Raymond will bring heavy rain to portions
of southwestern Mexico through Saturday.  Across coastal portions of
Guerrero and Michoacán, rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches are
expected, with local amounts of 6 inches or more in Michoacán.  This
rainfall will bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas of
higher terrain.  Across coastal portions of Oaxaca, Colima, and
Jalisco, rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are expected.  Moisture
from Raymond will also bring the potential for additional heavy
rainfall over portions of the Southwest U.S. early next week.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with the storm, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the storm are expected to spread
westward along the southwestern coast of Mexico through Friday and
reach southern Baja California Sur on Saturday.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Raymond Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172025
300 PM CST Thu Oct 09 2025
 
Satellite images and a recent partial ASCAT-C scatterometer pass 
were used to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Raymond at the 
intermediate advisory. Since that time, deep convection continues to 
burst mainly along the western and southern side of the circulation 
with cold cloud tops near -80C. Latest subjective and objective 
estimates range from 30 to 43 kt. Unfortunately, there was a 
scatterometer gap over the much of the system, and no recent 
microwave imagery to gain a better idea of the intensity and 
structure of the system. Using the the previous satellite derived 
winds and the intensity estimates, the initial intensity is held at 
40 kt.
 
The initial motion is estimated west-northwestward, or 290/13 kt, 
although this is a little uncertain given the recent formation of 
the center.  A strong mid-level ridge over northern Mexico  will 
steer the system swiftly towards the west-northwest to northwest 
over the next couple of days, with the center paralleling the 
southwestern coast of Mexico. The system will begin to move more 
north-northwestward then northward as it rounds the western 
periphery of the ridge towards the Baja California peninsula. The 
NHC track is near the previous forecast, which lies near the 
consensus aids.
 
Strong easterly shear is expected to displace most of the convection 
over the western semicircle over the next few days, although the 
system will remain over very warm sea surface temperatures near 
29-30C and within a preferable upper-level wind environment. Thus, 
some strengthening is forecast in the short term. In about a day or 
so, drier air and a more stable environment will cause the system to 
start weakening as it approaches Baja California. Global model 
simulated IR imagery shows the system struggling to produce 
organized convection by day 3, with the system becoming 
post-tropical, and ultimately dissipating by day 4.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico through late Friday.  Interests in
southern Baja California Sur should monitor the progress of the
system.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Raymond will impact coastal 
sections of southwestern Mexico through Saturday, which could result 
in flash flooding, particularly in areas of higher terrain.
