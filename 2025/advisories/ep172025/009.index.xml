WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical Storm Warning
for Las Islas Marias.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Baja California Sur from Los Barriles to Santa Fe
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within 12
hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Raymond was 
located near latitude 21.5 North, longitude 109.2 West. Raymond is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h). A turn 
toward the north is expected later today, with this motion then 
continuing through Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Raymond is expected to move over the southern portion of Baja 
California Sur later today.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Additional weakening is forecast during the next day or so, with 
Raymond expected to weaken into a post-tropical remnant low on 
Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Raymond can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in Baja
California Sur in a few hours.
 
RAINFALL:  Rainfall totals of 4 to 6 inches with local amounts of 8
or more inches are expected across northwestern Sinaloa, Sonora and
northern Chihuahua. This rainfall will bring a risk of flash
flooding, especially in areas of higher terrain. Rainfall totals of
1 to 2 inches are expected across central Sinaloa, the southern
portions of Baja California Sur and across the far southeast portion
of Baja California and far northeast Baja California Sur.  Moisture
from Raymond will also bring the potential for additional heavy
rainfall over portions of the Southwest U.S. Sunday into early next
week.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Raymond, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Raymond are affecting the coasts of
southwest and west-central Mexico, and southern Baja California Sur.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1100 AM MST.
Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

Tropical Storm Raymond Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172025
800 AM MST Sat Oct 11 2025
 
Satellite imagery this morning shows that Raymond has continued to 
deteriorate, rather rapidly, with barely any convection near the 
center of the system. The overall circulation has become rather 
ragged, and first-light visible imagery shows that the system was 
further south and east than expected. Satellite intensity estimates 
from TAFB and SAB have come down due to the waning convection, 
ranging between 30 and 35 kt. Given the recent satellite trends, the 
initial intensity is lowered to 35 kt for this advisory.
 
The storm is now moving north-northwest at an estimated motion of 
330/13 kt. A turn towards the north is expected later today as the 
system rounds the western periphery of a mid-level ridge over 
northern Mexico. The track guidance is tightly clustered, and the 
latest NHC forecast track is near the previous one, although 
slightly to the right given the initial position adjustment.
 
Raymond will continue to deal with moderate wind shear, and a drier
more stable airmass throughout the forecast period. The system is
expected to continue to weaken during the next day or so. GFS
simulated IR shows that the center of Raymond may not regain
convection. The latest NHC forecast is for additional weakening, and
for the system to become post-tropical in about a day and
dissipating shortly after, although if latest trends continue this
could occur sooner than forecast.
 
Although the actual system may not survive beyond a day or so,
moisture associated with the larger envelope from Raymond will
support heavy rainfall into portions of northwestern Mexico and
the southwestern United States this weekend through early next
week.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in Baja California Sur
beginning in the next few hours.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Raymond will impact sections of
northwestern Mexico through Sunday, which could result in flash
flooding, particularly in areas of higher terrain. Moisture from
Raymond will bring the threat of additional heavy rains to portions
of the Southwest U.S. Sunday into early next week.
