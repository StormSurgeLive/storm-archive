...PRISCILLA MOVING SLOWLY NORTH OFFSHORE BAJA CALIFORNIA SUR..
...SIGNIFICANT RISK OF FLASH FLOODING ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST UNITED
STATES THROUGH THE WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM PDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...25.9N 115.2W
ABOUT 195 MI...315 KM WNW OF CABO SAN LAZARO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 360 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM PDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Priscilla was
located near latitude 25.9 North, longitude 115.2 West. Priscilla is
moving toward the north near 5 mph (7 km/h) This general motion
will continue today, with a turn toward the north-northeast expected
tonight.  On the forecast track, the center of Priscilla is expected
to remain offshore of the coast of Baja California Sur, and
dissipate by Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Additional weakening is forecast, with Priscilla 
expected to become a post-tropical remnant low later today and 
dissipate by Saturday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  As Priscilla moves off the west coast of Baja California,
up to an inch of rain is expected across the Baja California
peninsula.  For the southwestern United States, 2 to 4 inches of
rain, with local storm total maxima to 6 inches, are expected across
portions of central and northern Arizona, southern Utah, and
southwest Colorado through Saturday.  Flash flooding is likely in
portions of central Arizona and southwest Utah, with scattered areas
of flash flooding expected across the remainder of Arizona, southern
Utah, southwest Colorado, and far northwest New Mexico.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting the Pacific
coast of Baja California Sur.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, in addition to
some coastal flooding.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM PDT.

Tropical Storm Priscilla Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
800 AM PDT Fri Oct 10 2025
 
Satellite imagery shows that the convective structure of Priscilla 
has become more ragged this morning. The degradation is due 
to increasing southwesterly wind shear, and drier air, as seen on 
water vapor imagery, being advected into the system. Satellite 
intensity estimates range from 30 to 45 kt. Using these estimates, 
in combination with the scatterometer data overnight, and recent 
satellite presentation, the intensity is lowered to 40 kt for this 
advisory.
 
Priscilla is moving slowly northward at an estimated motion of 
360/5 kt. This general motion with a slight turn to the 
north-northeast is anticipated today and tonight. The latest NHC 
track forecast is basically an update of the previous.
 
Although Priscilla has been resilient, it seems to be succumbing to 
the unfavorable environment. Moderate to strong southwesterly shear 
of 20 to 30 kt, with drier mid-level air being advected into the 
circulation and cool sea surface temperatures should induce further 
weakening. Convection is already started to dissipate and global 
models show that the system will struggle to produce convection by 
tonight and open into a trough by Saturday. The new NHC intensity 
forecast follows these trends with the system expected to become 
post-tropical in 12h, and then dissipate by 24h.
 
Remnant moisture associated with Priscilla remains the primary
hazard across portions of southwestern United States.  Heavy
rainfall and flash flooding are likely into the weekend over parts
of central Arizona and southwest Utah, with scattered areas of flash
flooding possible across the remainder of Arizona, southern Utah,
southwestern Colorado, and far northwestern New Mexico.  Please
monitor forecasts and updates from local National Weather Service
offices in the southwest U.S. at weather.gov and from the Weather
Prediction Center at wpc.ncep.gov.

Tropical Storm Raymond Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172025
900 AM CST Fri Oct 10 2025
 
Raymond continues to be a convectively asymmetric tropical storm, 
due to moderate to strong easterly wind shear.  A GMI microwave pass 
at 1035 UTC shows that there is limited curved banding structure in 
association with the deep convection with cold cloud tops near -80C 
over the western side of the system. There is a fairly large range 
of subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates from 30 to 
45 kt. Given the scatterometer satellite wind derived data from last 
night, the initial intensity will be held just above those estimates 
at 50 kt.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be northwestward, or 305/13 kt. 
A strong mid-level ridge over northern Mexico will continue to 
steer the system towards the northwest over the next day or so, with 
the center paralleling the southwestern coast of Mexico. The system 
will begin to move more north-northwestward then northward as it 
rounds the western periphery of the ridge towards Baja California 
Sur.  Track guidance is tightly clustered, and the NHC track is near 
the previous forecast, which lies near the consensus aids.
 
The storm will continue to be affected by moderate to strong 
easterly vertical wind shear, limiting strengthening even though the 
system remains over warm sea surface temperatures near 29C. The 
system will begin to move into a drier more stable airmass in about 
24 h, thus a slow weakening trend will begin. The NHC intensity 
forecast is similar to the previous one, near the consensus aids. 
However, there is some uncertainty as to whether the system will 
still be a tropical storm as it approaches Baja California Sur. 
Global simulated IR satellite shows convection waning in about 2 
days, and then models have the system opening into a trough early 
next week. 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico through tonight.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the watch area along portions of Baja
California Sur on Saturday.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Raymond will impact coastal 
sections of southwestern and northwestern Mexico through Sunday, 
which could result in flash flooding, particularly in areas of 
higher terrain. Moisture from Raymond will bring the threat of 
additional heavy rains to portions of the Southwest U.S. Sunday into 
early next week.
