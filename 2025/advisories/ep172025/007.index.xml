WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM PDT (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone 
Priscilla was located near latitude 26.3 North, longitude 115.4 
West. The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the north near 6

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  As Priscilla moves off the west coast of Baja California,
up to an inch of rain is expected across the Baja California
peninsula.  For the southwestern United States, 2 to 4 inches of
rain, with local storm total maxima to 6 inches, are expected across
portions of central and northern Arizona, southern Utah, and
southwest Colorado through Saturday.  Flash flooding is likely in
portions of central Arizona and southwest Utah, with scattered areas
of flash flooding expected across the remainder of Arizona, southern
Utah, southwest Colorado, and far northwest New Mexico.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service

Post-Tropical Cyclone Priscilla Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
200 PM PDT Fri Oct 10 2025
 
Priscilla has lacked organized deep convection for much of the day,
and visible satellite images and ASCAT data show that the low-level
circulation is gradually losing definition.  Since deep convection
is not expected to return, Priscilla is now designated a remnant
low and this is the last NHC advisory.  The initial intensity is 
lowered to 30 kt based on the ASCAT data.
 
The system is moving northward at 5 kt, and that motion should
continue until the system dissipates by early Saturday.
 
Even though Priscilla is no longer a tropical cyclone, its remnant 
moisture is expected to continue to spread across portions of the 
western United States.  Heavy rainfall and flash flooding are likely 
to continue over parts of central Arizona and southwest Utah, with 
scattered areas of flash flooding possible across the remainder of 
Arizona, southern Utah, southwestern Colorado, and far northwestern 
New Mexico.  Please monitor forecasts and updates from local 
National Weather Service offices in the southwest U.S. at 
weather.gov and from the Weather Prediction Center at 
wpc.ncep.noaa.gov.

hours.  These conditions are expected in the warning area in Baja 
California Sur starting Saturday morning.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall totals of 4 to 6 inches with local amounts of 8
or more inches are expected across Sonora and northern Chihuahua.
This rainfall will bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in
areas of higher terrain. Across coastal portions of Michoacan,
Colima, Jalisco, Nayarit, Sinaloa, and the central to southern
portions of Baja California Sur, rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches
are expected.  Moisture from Raymond will also bring the potential
for additional heavy rainfall over portions of the Southwest U.S.
Sunday into early next week.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with the depression, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Raymond are affecting the coast of 
southwest and west-central Mexico.  These swells are expected to 
spread to the southern Baja California Sur by early Saturday. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Raymond Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172025
800 PM MST Fri Oct 10 2025
 
Raymond has generally changed little over the past several hours.
Satellite images show that the convective pattern appears ragged and
lacks banding features.  The low-level center is difficult to see,
but it is estimated to be located near the southeastern edge of the
cloud mass due to strong southeasterly vertical wind shear.  The
initial intensity is held at 45 kt, which is in general agreement
with the latest satellite intensity estimates.  The western edge of
Raymond's convection is getting close to the southern portion of
Baja California Sur, and heavy rains and tropical-storm-force winds
are likely to begin there early Saturday.
 
The storm continues to move swiftly northwestward at about 16 kt 
steered by a strong high pressure area centered over northern 
Mexico.  A trough moving into the western U.S. is expected to erode 
the ridge, which should result in a turn toward the north this 
weekend.  The center of Raymond is expected to reach the southern 
portion of Baja California peninsula on Saturday and then move into 
the Gulf of California late Saturday and Sunday.  The NHC track 
forecast is similar to the previous one and near the middle of the 
guidance envelope.
 
Continued strong shear, intrusions of dry air, and land interaction
with Baja California should cause Raymond to lose strength during
the next day or two.  The official forecast shows Raymond moving
into mainland Mexico in 36 to 48 hours, but it is possible
that Raymond dissipates or degenerates into a remnant low before
then.  Regardless of how long Raymond survives, heavy rainfall is
expected to spread into portions of Mexico and the Southwest U.S.
this weekend and early next week.  See the Key Messages below for
more details.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico through tonight, and along portions
of Baja California Sur on Saturday.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Raymond will impact coastal
sections of southwestern and northwestern Mexico through Sunday,
which could result in flash flooding, particularly in areas of
higher terrain.   Moisture from Raymond will bring the threat of
additional heavy rains to portions of the Southwest U.S. Sunday into
early next week.
