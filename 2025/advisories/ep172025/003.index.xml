Friday night.  On the forecast track, the center of Priscilla is 
expected to remain offshore of the coast of Baja California Sur, and 
dissipate by Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Weakening is forecast, with Priscilla expected to become a 
post-tropical remnant low on Friday and dissipate by Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  As Priscilla moves offshore of the west coast of Baja
California, up to an inch of rain is expected across the Baja
California peninsula.  For the southwestern United States, 2 to 4
inches of rain, with local storm total maxima to 6 inches, are
expected across portions of central and northern Arizona, southern
Utah, and southwest Colorado through Saturday.  Flash flooding is
likely in  portions of central Arizona, with scattered areas of
flash flooding expected across the remainder of Arizona, southern
Utah, southwest Colorado, and far northwest New Mexico.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting the Pacific
coast of Baja California Sur.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, in addition to
some coastal flooding. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM PDT.

Tropical Storm Priscilla Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162025
800 PM PDT Thu Oct 09 2025
 
Priscilla has proven to be a resilient tropical cyclone this 
evening, despite moving over cool waters near 24C.  Since the 
previous advisory, the system has maintained a well-defined curved 
band that wraps more than halfway around the center.  The latest 
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB are 2.5/35 
kt and 3.5/55 kt, respectively.  Based on a blend of these data, 
along with the large area of 40-kt winds noted in a scatterometer 
pass earlier today and some improvement in the cycloneâ€™s structure, 
the initial intensity has been increased to 45 kt.

Priscilla is moving north-northwest, or 345 degrees, at 7 kt.  A 
turn toward the north and a decrease in forward speed are expected 
tonight through Friday as the cyclone moves between a longwave 
trough to its northwest and a mid- to upper-level ridge over Texas 
and northern Mexico.  A turn toward the northeast is forecast after 
24 hours as the system becomes shallower and increasingly steered by 
the low-level flow.  The updated NHC track forecast lies close to a 
blend of the previous advisory and the multi-model consensus aids.

Priscilla will be moving over progressively cooler waters and into a 
drier mid-level environment during the next day or so, while also 
encountering increasing southwesterly vertical wind shear.  These 
factors should result in steady weakening.  Simulated satellite 
imagery from the GFS and ECMWF indicates that Priscilla will lose 
its deep convection within about 12 hours, with both models showing 
the system degenerating into a trough by 48 hours, if not sooner. 
The NHC intensity forecast calls for Priscilla to become a 
post-tropical remnant low within 24 hours, with dissipation expected 
by 48 hours.
 
Remnant moisture associated with Priscilla remains the primary 
hazard across portions of southwestern United States.  Heavy 
rainfall and flash flooding are likely into the weekend over parts 
of central Arizona, with scattered areas of flash flooding possible 
across the remainder of Arizona, southern Utah, southwestern 
Colorado, and far northwestern New Mexico.  Please monitor forecasts 
and updates from local National Weather Service offices in the 
southwest U.S. at weather.gov and from the Weather Prediction Center 
at wpc.ncep.gov.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM CST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Raymond was 
located near latitude 16.7 North, longitude 102.6 West. Raymond is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue through early Friday.  A turn 
toward the northwest is expected Friday evening, followed by a 
northward turn by early Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center 
of the cyclone is expected to move parallel to the southwestern 
coast of Mexico through Friday and then approach southern Baja 
California Sur over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some strengthening is forecast through Friday, followed by a 
weakening trend over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning 
area tonight through Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Outer bands from Raymond will bring heavy rain to portions 
of southwestern Mexico through Saturday.  Across coastal portions 
of Guerrero and MichoacÃ¡n, rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches are 
expected, with local amounts of 6 inches or more in MichoacÃ¡n.  
This rainfall will bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in 
areas of higher terrain.  Across coastal portions of Oaxaca, 
Colima, and Jalisco, rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are 
expected.  Moisture from Raymond will also bring the potential for 
additional heavy rainfall over portions of the Southwest U.S. early 
next week.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with the depression, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the storm are expected to spread
westward along the southwestern coast of Mexico through Friday and
reach southern Baja California Sur on Saturday.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1200 AM CST.
Next complete advisory at 300 AM CST.

Tropical Storm Raymond Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172025
900 PM CST Thu Oct 09 2025
 
A couple of recent microwave overpasses indicate that Raymond's
cloud pattern has changed little during the past several hours.
Images show fragmented curved bands surrounding the elongated (SE
to NW) surface circulation.  The cyclone may be struggling a bit
due to the large deep convective complex (-82C cloud tops) located
to the northwest of the center, which could be disrupting the
cyclone's low-level flow.  The subjective and objective technique
intensity estimates range from 30 to 45 kt, and a recent UW-CIMSS
SATCON analysis estimated the intensity to be 35 kt.  Using a blend
of these data, the initial intensity is held at 40 kt.
 
The statistical-dynamical Decay-SHIPS intensity guidance and the 
global models indicate that Raymond will be battling stiff easterly 
vertical shear during the next couple of days, which should hamper 
significant development.  Subsequently, only modest strengthening is 
forecast through Friday.  Afterward, an increasingly hostile 
thermodynamic environment should result in a weakening trend through 
the period.  Accordingly, Raymond is expected to degenerate to a 
remnant low on Sunday while emerging over the Gulf of California, 
and ultimately opening up into a trough by early next week.  The NHC 
intensity forecast is based on a close agreement of the FSSE, HCCA, 
and IVCN intensity aids.
 
Raymond's center has been difficult to find this evening, and the 
initial motion is an estimated west-northwestward heading, or 290/13 
kt.  A mid-tropospheric high, anchored over northern Mexico, should 
steer Raymond toward the west-northwest to northwest, while 
paralleling and remaining just offshore of the coast of southwestern 
Mexico, through Friday evening.  Afterward, Raymond is forecast to 
turn north-northwestward, then northward in response to an 
amplifying mid-latitude trough moving over the southwestern United 
States.  The various consensus models and the Google DeepMind 
ensemble mean were used as a basis for the official track forecast. 
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico through late Friday.  Interests in
southern Baja California Sur should monitor the progress of the
system.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Raymond will impact coastal 
sections of southwestern Mexico through Saturday, which could result 
in flash flooding, particularly in areas of higher terrain.
