A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Raymond was
located near latitude 20.9 North, longitude 109.2 West. Raymond is
moving toward the northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h).  A turn toward 
the north is expected later today, with this motion then continuing 
through Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Raymond is 
expected to move over the southern portion of Baja California Sur 
later today.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of days, with 
Raymond expected to weaken into a post-tropical remnant low on 
Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Raymond can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Las Islas Marias
for the next few hours, and in Baja California Sur beginning later
this morning.
 
RAINFALL:  Rainfall totals of 4 to 6 inches with local amounts of 8
or more inches are expected across Sonora and northern Chihuahua.
This rainfall will bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in
areas of higher terrain.  Across coastal portions of Michoacan,
Colima, Jalisco, Nayarit, Sinaloa, and the central to southern
portions of Baja California Sur, rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches
are expected.  Moisture from Raymond will also bring the potential
for additional heavy rainfall over portions of the Southwest U.S.
Sunday into early next week.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Raymond, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Raymond are affecting the coasts of
southwest and west-central Mexico and will spread to the coasts of
southern Baja California Sur later this morning.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 500 AM MST.
Next complete advisory at 800 AM MST.

Tropical Storm Raymond Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172025
200 AM MST Sat Oct 11 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Raymond has deteriorated since the 
previous advisory, with the cyclone continuing to be affected by 
moderate easterly shear, analyzed to be around 18 kt by UW-CIMSS. A 
recent scatterometer pass was helpful in identifying the center 
position and indicated a peak wind vector of 35 kt. The latest 
subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were 
3.0/45 kt and 2.0/30 kt, respectively, while the objective estimates 
from UW-CIMSS have ranged from 32 to 39 kt.  Considering these data 
and accounting for potential undersampling in the scatterometer 
winds, the initial intensity is maintained at 40 kt for this 
advisory.

Raymond continues to move quickly northwestward, or 310 degrees at 
14 kt.  A turn toward the north is expected later today as the 
cyclone moves between a longwave trough over the southwestern United 
States and a mid- to upper-level ridge over northern Mexico.  This 
general motion is forecast to continue through the weekend, with 
Raymond dissipating over the higher terrain of northern Mexico by 
late Sunday.  The new NHC track forecast has been nudged slightly 
westward during the next 12 hours to account for a delayed northward 
turn, and it remains very close to the previous prediction 
thereafter.

Raymond will continue to be influenced by moderate east to northeast 
shear and a dry mid-level environment, while also interacting with 
land, including mountainous terrain, during the next couple of days. 
These factors should result in gradual weakening.  The NHC 
intensity forecast calls for Raymond to weaken into a tropical 
depression later today or tonight, and dissipate by late Sunday. 
Regardless of how long Raymond survives, heavy rainfall is expected 
to spread into portions of Mexico and the southwestern United States 
this weekend through early next week. See the Key Messages below 
for more details.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Las Islas Marias
for the next few hours, and in Baja California Sur beginning later
this morning.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall associated with Raymond will impact coastal 
sections of southwestern and northwestern Mexico through Sunday, 
which could result in flash flooding, particularly in areas of 
higher terrain.   Moisture from Raymond will bring the threat of 
additional heavy rains to portions of the Southwest U.S. Sunday into 
early next week.
