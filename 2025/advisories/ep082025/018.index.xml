Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  18
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
500 AM HST Fri Aug 08 2025

Henriette has failed to produce deep convection for about 12 hours 
now. The latest subjective Dvorak estimates are 25 kt from JTWC and 
too weak to classify from SAB and PHFO.  Recent objective intensity 
estimates range from 25 to 40 kt.  An earlier ASCAT pass from 0535 
UTC showed a large area of 30-33 kt vectors on the north side of 
Henriette.  Henriette will be maintained as a 35-kt tropical storm 
for this advisory, but it could degenerate to a post-tropical 
remnant low at any time today.

The cyclone is moving just north of due west at 280/15 kt. A turn to 
the west-northwest is expected soon as the cyclone tracks along the 
southwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge to its northeast. A 
turn toward the northwest is forecast late this weekend into early 
next week as Henriette becomes steered between an amplifying 
longwave trough northwest of Hawaii and the subtropical ridge to its 
northeast.  The NHC track forecast is nearly identical to the 
previous one and is in good agreement with the tightly clustered 
consensus aids.  Confidence remains high that Henriette will remain 
far to the north of Hawaii.

Henriette is over 24C sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) and is 
embedded within a dry airmass.  These cold SSTs are expected to 
persist along the cyclone's track for another 12 to 24 h.  If 
Henriette doesn't generate organized convection soon, it could 
degenerate to a remnant low today, and this is explicitly shown in 
the NHC forecast Beyond 24 h, Henriette (or its remnants) will 
encounter progressively warmer water temperatures over the weekend, 
peaking around 26-27C in about 3 days.  Upper-level temperatures are 
also expected to decrease in a couple of days as the aforementioned 
trough approaches Henriette, which would increase instability. These 
factors, along with relatively low shear, will likely allow 
Henriette to restrengthen later this weekend into early next week, 
as depicted by most of the models.  The NHC intensity forecast is at 
the low end of the guidance envelope through 36 h, and at the high 
end of the guidance at 72-96 h.  Beyond day 4, wind shear from the 
longwave trough and cooling SSTs should lead to steady weakening as 
Henriette moves farther into the mid-latitudes.

Even if Henriette becomes post-tropical today, given the high 
likelihood of regeneration back into a tropical cyclone and 
subsequent restrengthening, NHC plans on maintaining advisories 
during the post-tropical phase.

BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Ivo Advisory Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
800 AM MST Fri Aug 08 2025
 
...IVO PASSING SOUTH OF THE BAJA CALIFORNIA PENINSULA...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM MST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.7N 110.1W
ABOUT 150 MI...245 KM S OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 16 MPH...26 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
Interests in the southern portion of the Baja California peninsula 
should continue to monitor the progress of Ivo.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ivo was
located near latitude 20.7 North, longitude 110.1 West.  Ivo is
moving toward the west-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h).  A westward 
to west-northwestward motion at a slower speed is forecast during 
the next several days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is possible through tonight, but weakening is 
likely to begin on Saturday and continue into early next week.  Ivo 
could become post-tropical by late Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Ivo will continue to affect the
southwestern coast of Mexico during the next day or so, and are
beginning to reach the southern portion of the Baja California
peninsula. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?ripCurrnets
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
800 AM MST Fri Aug 08 2025
 
Ivo's satellite presentation hasn't changed much since the last 
advisory.  The center appears to be embedded beneath the northern 
side of the Central Dense Overcast, with one small convective band 
forming on the northwestern side of the circulation.  The Dvorak 
estimate from TAFB increased to T3.5/55 kt, however the SAB 
estimate and all objective guidance is much lower.  Therefore, the 
current intensity is held at 50 kt.

Ivo is slowing down and now has a west-northwestward initial motion 
at 295/14 kt.  Strong mid-level ridging to the north is expected to 
be the main driver for the entirety of the forecast, keeping Ivo on 
a westward or west-northwestward trajectory but at a slower forward 
speed.  No significant changes were made to the official track 
forecast.

The more complicated part of the forecast is the intensity.  Ivo is 
expected to remain over waters warmer than 26 degrees Celsius and in 
a moist environment with divergence aloft for the next 24 hours or 
so.  Because of that, the NHC intensity forecast continues to show 
some strengthening through tonight.  The forecast no longer 
explicitly shows Ivo becoming a hurricane, but that is still a small 
possibility, especially if Ivo is currently stronger than is being 
estimated.  Beginning in about 36 hours, colder ocean temperatures, 
a more stable environment, and less divergence aloft should cause 
the storm to weaken.  Some of the models differ significantly on 
exactly how quick that weakening will be.  For example, the GFS 
maintains tropical-storm-force winds for at least the next 3 days, 
while the ECWMF degenerates Ivo into a remnant low in about 24 
hours.  As a compromise, the NHC forecast shows Ivo becoming 
post-tropical by 60 hours, with dissipation by day 5, if not sooner.
