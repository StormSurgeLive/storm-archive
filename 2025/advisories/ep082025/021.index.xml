Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
800 PM MST Fri Aug 08 2025
 
After gaining some strength earlier today, Ivo's intensity appears 
to have leveled off again. The compact storm is still producing a 
concentrated area of deep convection, but the cloud tops have been 
warming over the past several hours. In addition, dry air appears to 
be eroding some of the outer bands. The initial intensity is held at 
55 kt, which is in line with the latest satellite intensity 
estimates.

Ivo could strengthen a little later tonight or early Saturday, but a 
weakening trend should begin shortly thereafter as the storm moves 
over progressively cooler waters and into a drier air mass. The 
NHC intensity forecast is a little lower than the previous one, and 
now shows Ivo becoming a post-tropical cyclone in a couple of days 
when it is anticipated to be over cool 23 to 24 C waters.

The storm is moving westward at about 10 kt. The track forecast 
appears straightforward as Ivo should being steered westward to 
west-northwestward on the south side of a low- to mid-level ridge 
during the next few days. This motion should take the system away 
from the Baja California peninsula and over the open eastern 
Pacific. The NHC track forecast follows the various consensus 
models, and is a touch to the north of the previous track.
