Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 AM HST Tue Aug 05 2025
 
This morning's satellite presentation consists of a convective
curved band on the west side of the cyclone and a cluster of strong
thunderstorms with cold cloud tops of -70 Celsius just to the west 
of Henriette's surface circulation center.  The initial intensity is
held at 45 kt for this advisory and is based on a blend of the
TAFB and SAB subjective and CIMSS objective intensity estimates.
 
Little change in strength is expected during the next couple of 
days, although 5-kt fluctuations are possible, while Henriette 
moves  over slightly cooler water and through an increasingly 
inhibiting thermodynamic environment.  Toward the end of the week, 
the thermodynamic environment is expected to become even more
hostile while Henriette moves over the subtropical central
Pacific waters.  Therefore, some weakening of the cyclone is 
forecast through day 5.  The official intensity forecast is based 
on the IVCN intensity consensus model and the Decay-SHIPS 
statistical aid.
 
Henriette's initial motion is estimated to be west-northwestward,
or 295/13 kt, and a west-northwestward or westward motion should 
continue through day 4 while the cyclone is steered by a strong 
mid-level ridge stretching across the subtropical Central Pacific.  
Over the weekend, Henriette is expected to turn gradually 
northwestward in response to an amplifying mid- to 
upper-tropospheric trough approaching the Hawaiian Islands from the
Central North Pacific.  The NHC track forecast is based on the 
various consensus aids and is basically an update of the previous 
advisory.
