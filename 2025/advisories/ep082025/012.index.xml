Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
500 PM HST Wed Aug 06 2025
 
Henriette’s satellite presentation has deteriorated since the 
previous advisory, with the cyclone now nearly devoid of all deep 
convection and the low-level center fully exposed.  The most recent 
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates were 3.0/45 kt from TAFB, 
while SAB deemed the cyclone too weak to classify.  Meanwhile, 
objective estimates from UW-CIMSS have ranged from 37 to 51 kt over 
the past several hours.  An earlier 06/1755Z Metop-C ASCAT pass 
depicted numerous 40 kt wind barbs, with a single 40–45 kt wind barb 
noted north of the low-level center.  Based on these data, the 
initial intensity for this advisory is maintained, at perhaps a 
generous, 45 kt.

The cyclone is moving westward, or 275 degrees, at 14 kt. This 
general motion is expected to persist tonight and Thursday, as 
Henriette continues to be steered by a strengthening subtropical 
ridge to its north.  A gradual turn toward the west-northwest and 
eventually northwest is expected to begin Friday and continue 
through the weekend, as an amplifying longwave trough northwest of 
Hawaii begins to erode the western extent of the subtropical ridge.  
The official track forecast remains closely aligned with the latest 
multi-model consensus aids and is largely unchanged from the 
previous advisory.  There is high confidence that the center of 
Henriette will remain far to the north of the Hawaiian Islands.

Henriette will be moving over gradually cooling sea surface 
temperatures, lowering to near 24C, while mid-level relative 
humidity also falls below 50 percent.  Despite these marginal 
thermodynamic conditions, Henriette’s well-established circulation 
is likely to remain resilient due to the low-shear environment the 
cyclone will be transiting through.  As a result, only slight 
weakening is forecast during the next 12 hours or so, followed by 
little change in strength through 72 hours.  If Henriette can 
survive the passage over the cooler waters, as has been advertised 
by the GFS and ECMWF models for several days now, re-intensification 
appears likely over the weekend and into early next week as sea 
surface temperatures warm to levels conducive for strengthening.  
The official intensity forecast reflects this, bringing Henriette to 
hurricane strength by 120 hours.  The intensity forecast is mostly 
unchanged and remains closely aligned with the dynamical intensity 
guidance aid HCCA and the regional hurricane models.

BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Ivo Advisory Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
900 PM CST Wed Aug 06 2025
 
...IVO BRINGING LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS TO PORTIONS OF THE COAST OF
SOUTHWESTERN MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM CST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.0N 100.9W
ABOUT 145 MI...235 KM SSW OF ACAPULCO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 22 MPH...35 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1008 MB...29.77 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
Interests along the coast of southwestern Mexico should monitor the
progress of Ivo.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM CST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ivo was
located near latitude 15.0 North, longitude 100.9 West. Ivo is
moving toward the west-northwest near 22 mph (35 km/h).  The system 
is forecast to move generally parallel to, but offshore of, the 
coast of Mexico during the next day or two and move away from 
Mexico thereafter.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast, and Ivo is expected to be near hurricane 
strength by the end of the week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Ivo is expected to produce storm total
rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 6 inches,
across portions of the Mexican states of Guerrero, Michoacan and
southwestern Oaxaca through Saturday. This rainfall could lead to
flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Ivo, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ivo will be affecting the southwestern
coast of Mexico during the next couple of days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM CST.

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
900 PM CST Wed Aug 06 2025

Ivo's cloud pattern is gradually becoming better organized but the 
convective banding features are not yet well defined.  Very cold 
cloud tops to -70 deg C or colder are evident, primarily over the 
northern portion of the circulation.  The upper-level outflow 
pattern is fairly well defined over the system, but outflow is 
restricted over the northeastern quadrant.  The current intensity 
estimate is kept at 35 kt for now, in agreement with a subjective 
Dvorak classification from TAFB and most objective estimates from 
UW-CIMSS.

Blending center fixes from SAB and TAFB give a swift 
west-northwestward motion of around 295/19 kt, as in the 
previous advisory.  There is a strong 500 mb high situated to the 
north of Ivo, which is predicted to remain in place for the next 
couple of days.  This should keep the tropical cyclone on a 
west-northwestward track, parallel to, but offshore of, the coast 
of southwestern Mexico.  Beyond 24-36 hours, Ivo should turn a bit 
to the left with decreasing forward speed while moving away from 
Mexico.  The official track forecast is very similar to the 
previous one and close to the dynamical model consensus.

For the next couple of days, Ivo should be in an environment of 
moderate vertical shear, fairly warm waters and high low- to 
mid-level humidity.  Therefore strengthening is likely and the 
system is predicted to become a hurricane by late this week.  Later 
in the forecast period, the system should be traversing cooler 
waters which is likely to reduce the cyclone to a remnant low in 5 
days.  The official intensity forecast is at the high end of the 
model guidance.
 
The tropical-storm-force winds associated with Ivo are expected to
remain offshore of the coast of Mexico, however heavy rain and
rough surf are likely along portions of the southwest coast of
Mexico during the next day or two.
