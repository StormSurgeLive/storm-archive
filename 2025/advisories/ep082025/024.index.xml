Tropical Storm Ivo Advisory Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
800 PM MST Sat Aug 09 2025
 
...IVO EXPECTED TO SLOWLY WEAKEN AND BECOME POST-TROPICAL NEAR
THE END OF THE WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 PM MST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.2N 114.1W
ABOUT 295 MI...470 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 285 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1003 MB...29.62 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM MST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ivo was
located near latitude 21.2 North, longitude 114.1 West. Ivo is
moving toward the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h). A gradual
turn toward the west with a slight increase in forward speed is
expected through early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Slow weakening is anticipated. Ivo is forecast to become
post-tropical near the end of the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Ivo will continue to affect the southern
portion of the Baja California peninsula during the next day or so.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM MST.

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
800 PM MST Sat Aug 09 2025
 
Convection associated with Ivo has continued to slowly decrease
during the past 6 hours, but the cyclone's overall appearance hasn't
changed drastically. The latest TAFB Dvorak Current Intensity
estimate is still 45 kt, which is similar to the most recent
UW-CIMSS SATCON, valid around 2210 UTC (43 kt). Therefore, no change
was made to the 45-kt intensity estimate for this advisory.
 
No noteworthy changes were made to any aspect of the NHC forecast.
Ivo is moving over cooler waters and into a more stable environment
and is therefore forecast to gradually weaken, as shown by all of
the intensity guidance. Simulated satellite imagery from the GFS,
ECMWF and HAFS models indicates Ivo will become post-tropical within
about 36 h. Ivo's motion is now west-northwestward, still at 6 kt.
All models continue to forecast that Ivo will gradually turn due
west in a day or two as it weakens and is steered by the low-level
flow. The model forecast agreement is very good with respect to all
aspects of Ivo's evolution during the next couple of days until it
dissipates early next week.
