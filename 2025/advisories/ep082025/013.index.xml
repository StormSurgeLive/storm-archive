Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 PM HST Wed Aug 06 2025
 
Satellite images indicate that a small burst of deep convection has 
developed just to the northwest of Henriette’s low-level center this 
evening, after several hours with not much more than a shallow cloud 
swirl.  The most recent subjective Dvorak current intensity estimate 
from TAFB was 3.0/45 kt, while the objective estimates from UW-CIMSS 
ranged between 32 to 42 kt over the past several hours.  A timely 
07/0645Z Metop-C ASCAT pass depicted several 40 kt wind barbs, with 
a single 40–45 kt wind barb noted north of the low-level center.  
The initial intensity for this advisory will be held at 45 kt, 
utilizing the ASCAT data while accounting for some undersampling and 
a known low bias at higher speeds. 

The cyclone is moving westward, or 275 degrees, at 14 kt. This 
general motion is expected to persist through Thursday, as Henriette 
continues to be steered by a strengthening subtropical ridge to its 
north.  A gradual turn toward the west-northwest and eventually 
northwest is anticipated Friday and over the weekend, as an 
amplifying longwave trough northwest of Hawaii begins to erode the 
western extent of the subtropical ridge. The northwestward motion is 
expected to continue into early next week.  The official track 
forecast remains closely aligned with the latest multi-model 
consensus aids and is nearly identical to the previous advisory.

Henriette will be moving over gradually cooling sea surface 
temperatures near 24C, while the environmental humidities 
surrounding the cyclone will drop below 50 percent.  Despite these 
hostile thermodynamic conditions, Henriette’s well-established 
circulation is likely to remain resilient due to the low-shear 
environment the cyclone will be transiting through.  As a result, 
only a slight weakening is forecast tonight, followed by little 
change in strength during the next few days.  If Henriette can 
survive the passage over the cool waters, as persistently suggested 
by the GFS and ECMWF models for several days now, re-intensification 
appears likely over the weekend and into early next week as sea 
surface temperatures warm to levels conducive for strengthening.  
The official forecast continues to reflect this, bringing Henriette 
to hurricane strength by 120 hours.  The intensity forecast is 
mostly unchanged and remains aligned best with the dynamical 
intensity consensus aid HCCA and the regional hurricane models.

BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Ivo Advisory Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
300 AM CST Thu Aug 07 2025
 
...IVO RACING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD OFF THE SOUTHWESTERN MEXICAN
COASTLINE...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM CST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.9N 103.0W
ABOUT 215 MI...350 KM WSW OF ACAPULCO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 23 MPH...37 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1008 MB...29.77 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
Interests along the coast of southwestern Mexico should monitor the
progress of Ivo.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM CST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ivo was 
located near latitude 15.9 North, longitude 103.0 West. Ivo is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 23 mph (37 km/h).  The system 
is forecast to move generally parallel to, but offshore of, the 
coast of Mexico during the next day or so and turn westward away 
from Mexico thereafter.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast, and Ivo is expected to be near hurricane
strength by the end of the week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Ivo is expected to produce storm total
rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 6 inches,
across portions of the Mexican states of Guerrero, Michoacan de
Ocampo and Colima through Friday. This would result in an elevated
risk for flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Depression Nine-E, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ivo will be affecting the southwestern
coast of Mexico during the next couple of days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found

NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM CST.

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
300 AM CST Thu Aug 07 2025
 
Ivo's satellite presentation is that of a storm that is steadily 
intensifying.  Deep convection has been continuously forming while 
the central deep overcast has been expanding through the evening.  
However, overnight scatterometer data from 0412 UTC revealed a 
dubious, at best, low-level circulation. The data suggests that 
even though the mid-level rotation appears robust, the low-level 
flow has yet to reflect such organization, likely due to Ivo's rapid 
forward motion.  The intensity is held at 35 kt based on the latest 
satellite-derived wind data.

The motion is estimated to be 295/20 kt.  Ivo is racing along the 
southern side of a strong mid-level ridge centered over the 
southwestern United States.  This motion is expected to continue 
for the next day or so which should keep the tropical cyclone 
moving parallel to, but offshore of, the coast of southwestern 
Mexico.  Around 36 h, Ivo is expected to turn more westward and slow 
down.  The latest NHC track forecast is slightly faster than the 
previous forecast and lies between the various consensus aids.
 
Ivo is still forecast to steadily strengthen over then next day or 
so.  Moderate vertical wind shear, warm sea surface temperatures, 
and a moist environment should provide the necessary conditions for 
the cyclone to reach hurricane status within the next couple of 
days.  Ivo is expected to cross over cooler waters by 72 h, which 
should induce a gradual weakening trend.  Global models predict 
increasing shear will separate the cyclone from deep convection and 
Ivo is now forecast to become post-tropical by 96 h.  The official 
intensity forecast remains at the high end of the model guidance.
 
The tropical-storm-force winds associated with Ivo are expected to
remain offshore of the coast of Mexico, however heavy rain and
rough surf are likely along portions of the southwest coast of
Mexico during the next day or so.  Outer bands of Ivo are expected 
to produce locally heavy rainfall in portions of the Mexican states 
of Guerrero, Michoacan de Ocampo and Colima through Friday. Flash 
flooding is possible.
