Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 AM HST Thu Aug 07 2025
 
Henriette has been producing a smaller area of deep convection than
earlier, as it seems to be struggling a bit with dry air and
sea-surface temperatures near 24 C.  The latest subjective Dvorak
current intensity estimates are 2.5/35 kt from TAFB and 1.5/25 kt
from SAB.  The latest objective estimates from UW-CIMMS range from
about 30 to 40 kt.  A recent 1914 UTC ASCAT-C pass suggests that 
Henriette has likely weakened a bit from earlier.  Based on the 
above data, the initial intensity is lowered to 40 kt for this 
advisory.
 
The motion of 280/14 kt is unchanged from the previous advisory.
This motion will continue through today as Henriette is steered by
mid-level ridging well to its north.  The cyclone will then round
the southwestern periphery of the mid-level ridge as a large
deep-layer trough approaches from the west.  These features will
cause Henriette to gradually turn toward the northwest in a couple
of days.  Very little change has been made to the NHC track
forecast, which lies near the tightly clustered consensus aids.
Confidence in the track forecast is high through the weekend, and
Henriette will not directly impact the Hawaiian Islands.
 
Henriette is expected to continue moving over cool ocean waters near 
24C for another 36 h before it begins to gradually move over 
increasing water temperatures.  The tropical storm will also 
continue moving through a very dry environment.  Most of the 
guidance shows the storm maintaining a 35-40 kt intensity during 
this time. Henriette is also expected to encounter colder than 
normal mid- and upper-level temperatures in a couple of days.  If 
Henriette survives the next 48 h or so, then strengthening would 
appear likely later in the forecast period due to increasing 
sea-surface temperatures, very low vertical wind shear, and 
decreasing mid- to upper-level temperatures as the aforementioned 
deep-layer trough approaches. The official forecast shows some 
slight weakening in the short term, followed by strengthening to a 
hurricane by day 4 well to the north of Hawaii.  The latest NHC 
forecast is near the intensity consensus and close to the higher end 
of the guidance at day 4 and 5.  It should be noted that the HAFS 
models are showing a slightly higher intensity than the NHC 
forecast.

NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
300 PM CST Thu Aug 07 2025
 
...IVO INTENSIFYING AS IT MAKES ITS CLOSEST APPROACH TO MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM CST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.8N 105.8W
ABOUT 410 MI...660 KM WNW OF ACAPULCO MEXICO
ABOUT 385 MI...625 KM SE OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 21 MPH...33 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
Interests along the coast of southwestern Mexico should continue to
monitor the progress of Ivo.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ivo was 
located near latitude 18.8 North, longitude 105.8 West. Ivo is 
moving toward the northwest near 21 mph (33 km/h). On the forecast 
track, Ivo is expected to start moving away from the coast of Mexico 
over the next day or so. The storm is forecast to turn more westward 
by the weekend. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Strengthening is forecast for the next day or so, and Ivo could 
become a hurricane on Friday. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Ivo is expected to produce storm total
rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 6 inches,
across portions of the Mexican states of Guerrero, Michoacan de
Ocampo and Colima through Friday. This would result in an elevated
risk for flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Ivo please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ivo will be affecting the southwestern
coast of Mexico during the next couple of days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM CST.

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
300 PM CST Thu Aug 07 2025
 
Ivo remains a very small tropical cyclone, though an intensifying 
one. Deep central convection continues to burst near the center, 
though the vertical structure of the tropical storm does appear more 
ragged with evidence that the mid-level vortex is tilted to the 
southwest of the low-level center. A helpful Metop-B scatterometer 
pass at 1643 UTC captured the tiny circulation with a max wind 
retrieval of 44 kt. Assuming this instrument undersampled the peak 
winds of the small cyclone, the initial intensity is being raised to 
50 kt for this advisory, also close to the latest objective ADT 
estimate.
 
The tropical storm continues to move quite quickly to the northwest,
with the motion estimated at 305/18 kt. The track forecast reasoning
is similar to earlier, where a strong and extensive mid-level ridge
parked over northern Mexico should keep Ivo moving quickly
west-northwestward to northwestward for the next 24 hours or so. On
this forecast track, Ivo will soon begin pulling away from the
southwestern coast of Mexico. By this weekend, the ridge begins to
weaken some and the guidance also suggests Ivo will start to become
more vertically shallow. A combination of these influences should
result in a westward turn in the track and a slowdown in the forward
motion. The track guidance for this cycle is quite similar to the
prior one, and the NHC track forecast is largely an update from
the previous one, blending the consensus aids HCCA and TVCE.
 
The intensity forecast presents a conundrum this afternoon. Ivo has 
a small inner core wind field, is over warm 29-30 C ocean waters, 
and vertical wind shear as diagnosed by SHIPS guidance is low, only 
5-10 kt. Ordinarily these variables would suggest that Ivo could 
undergo a period of rapid intensification (RI), and EC-SHIPS-RI 
guidance now has a 71 percent chance of a 30-kt increase over the 
next 24 h. However, other RI indices are lower, with DTOPS at only 
12 percent for the same threshold. There is also evidence that Ivo's 
structure is not ideal, with current visible satellite imagery 
suggesting its circulation is tilted southwest with height. This 
vertical tilt also matches the structure seen in the most recent 
HAFS-A/B model grids. This may explain why the regional-hurricane 
models are less aggressive with Ivo's intensification than SHIPS, 
and only HAFS-B briefly makes Ivo a hurricane. Thus the NHC 
intensity forecast is not as aggressive as the latest SHIPS 
guidance, only taking Ivo to a 70 kt hurricane in 24 hours. 
Thereafter, the storm will cross a sharp sea-surface temperature 
gradient, which should lead to weakening after 24 hours. Like the 
previous forecast, Ivo will likely lose its organized deep 
convection west of Baja California in about 72 hours, where the 
latest forecast shows it becoming a post-tropical remnant low. The 
NHC intensity forecast is a little above the reliable HCCA aid, but 
is lower than both SHIPS and LGEM aids.
 
Given the small radius of tropical-storm-force winds associated with
Ivo, these winds are expected to remain offshore as it begins to
move away from Mexico by tonight. However, heavy rain and rough surf
are likely to occur along portions of the southwest coast of Mexico
during the next day or so.  Outer bands of Ivo are expected to
produce locally heavy rainfall in portions of the Mexican states of
Guerrero, Michoacan de Ocampo and Colima through Friday where flash
flooding is possible.
