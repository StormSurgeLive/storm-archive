Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
500 PM HST Thu Aug 07 2025
 
Henriette’s satellite presentation has changed little since the 
previous advisory, with the low-level center remaining mostly 
exposed and only a few small, intermittent bursts of deep convection 
developing near the low-level center. The latest subjective Dvorak 
intensity estimate from TAFB was 2.5/35 kt, while objective 
estimates from UW-CIMSS have ranged from 28 to 41 kt over the past 
several hours. Taking a blend of these data, the initial intensity 
has been reduced to 35 kt for this advisory.

Henriette is moving westward, or 280 degrees at 14 kt. A turn 
toward the west-northwest is expected tonight, with this general 
motion expected to persist over the next couple of days as the 
cyclone tracks along the southwestern periphery of a subtropical 
ridge to its north. A turn toward the northwest is forecast this 
weekend and into early next week as Henriette becomes 
steered between an amplifying longwave trough northwest of Hawaii 
and the subtropical ridge to its northeast. The official track 
forecast remains in close agreement with the latest multi-model 
consensus aids and is essentially unchanged from the previous 
advisory.  Confidence remains high that Henriette will remain far 
to the north of Hawaii.

Henriette will traverse sea surface temperatures near 24C with 
mid-level relative humidity below 50 percent during the next 24 to 
36 hours. Despite these unfavorable thermodynamic conditions, the 
cyclone’s well-defined circulation is expected to remain fairly 
resilient within the prevailing low-shear environment, allowing for 
occasional pulses of deep convection to persist.  As a result, 
little change in intensity is anticipated in the short term.  If 
Henriette can withstand the period over cooler waters, as has been 
consistently indicated by the GFS and ECMWF models for several days 
now, re-intensification will likely occur over the weekend and into 
early next week as sea surface temperatures rise to levels conducive 
for strengthening. The official forecast continues to reflect 
intensification, bringing Henriette to hurricane strength by 96 
hours. The intensity forecast is on the higher end of the guidance 
envelope, and is most closely aligned with the dynamical intensity 
consensus HCCA.

BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Ivo Advisory Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
800 PM MST Thu Aug 07 2025
 
...IVO FORECAST TO STRENGTHEN AS IT PULLS AWAY FROM MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 PM MST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.7N 107.3W
ABOUT 275 MI...445 KM SE OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 22 MPH...35 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
Interests along the coast of southwestern Mexico and the southern 
portion of the Baja California peninsula should continue to monitor 
the progress of Ivo.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM MST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ivo was
located near latitude 19.7 North, longitude 107.3 West. Ivo is
moving toward the northwest near 22 mph (35 km/h). A decrease in 
forward speed and a turn to the west-northwest are expected during 
the next few days. On the forecast track, Ivo is expected to pull 
away from mainland Mexico and pass well south of the Baja 
California peninsula.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Strengthening is forecast for the next day or so, and Ivo 
could become a hurricane on Friday. Weakening should begin over the 
weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Ivo is expected to produce additional 
rainfall of 1 to 2 inches across coastal portions of the Mexican 
states of Michoacán de Ocampo, Colima, and Jalisco through tonight. 
The additional rainfall may result in localized flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Ivo please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ivo will continue to affect the 
southwestern coast of Mexico during the next day or so, and are 
forecast to reach the southern portion of the Baja California 
peninsula on Friday. These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.

NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM MST.

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
800 PM MST Thu Aug 07 2025
 
While Ivo has a compact core with a concentrated area of convection, 
the overall cloud pattern appears disorganized and lacks banding 
features. The initial intensity remains 50 kt, near the high end of 
the latest satellite intensity estimates and in agreement with the 
earlier ASCAT data. Some of the associated thunderstorms are 
brushing the coast of southwestern Mexico, likely bringing areas of 
heavy rain and gusty winds. Ivo's tropical-storm-force winds remain 
offshore near the tiny core, and are estimated to only extend about 
40 n mi from the center.

The storm continues to move quickly to the northwest at 19 kt on the 
south side of a strong mid-level ridge situated over the 
southwestern U.S. This ridge is expected to weaken and shift 
slightly westward during the next few days. As a result, Ivo is 
forecast to turn to the west-northwest and then the west with a 
notable decrease in forward speed. This motion should take Ivo away 
from mainland Mexico and well south of the Baja California 
peninsula. The NHC track forecast is similar to the previous one and 
near the middle of the guidance envelope. 

The large-scale conditions appear quite favorable for strengthening 
during the next day or so with warm SSTs, low vertical wind shear, 
and high mid-level relative humidities. However, it is possible that 
Ivo might not take advantage of those conditions given its current 
ragged structure. There is considerable divergence in the intensity 
models with the dynamical-statistical aids showing significant 
strengthening while the global and HAFS guidance show little to no 
intensification. The NHC intensity forecast follows the previous 
one and leans closer to the high end of the guidance in the short 
term, but this is of low confidence. Regardless of what occurs in 
the next 24 hours, weakening should begin over the weekend when Ivo 
is forecast to move over progressively cooler waters and into an 
air mass of drier air and stronger shear.
