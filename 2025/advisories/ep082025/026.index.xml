Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
800 AM PDT Sun Aug 10 2025
 
Ivo is maintaining a small cluster of deep convection, near and to 
the south of the low-level center.  Dvorak CI numbers of 2.5 from 
TAFB and SAB and objective estimates from UW-CIMSS support holding 
the initial intensity at 35 kt for this advisory.  The cyclone is 
moving over cooler waters and in a more stable environment, 
while also contending with moderate northeasterly shear, and 
weakening is therefore forecast during the next couple of days.  
Ivo should lose all its convection and become a remnant low by 24 
hours, and global models show dissipation into a surface trough in 
60 hours.

The initial motion is a bit faster toward the west-northwest (290/9 
kt).  Low- to mid-level ridging to the north should keep Ivo on a 
westward to west-northwestward trajectory at a fairly steady speed 
during the next couple of days.  The NHC forecast is well within 
the tightly packed guidance envelope, and no significant changes 
were made from the previous forecast.
