      <title>Hurricane Kiko Forecast Discussion Number 15</title>

Hurricane Kiko Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112025
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
1100 AM HST Wed Sep 03 2025

Kiko has strengthened to a category 4 hurricane with recent 
subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates of 5.5 and 6.0 from 
TAFB and SAB respectively.  The structure has continued to improve 
on satellite imagery with the most recent ADT estimate up to 117 
knots, and a raw data T number even higher of 6.4.  The initial 
intensity was thus set at the higher end of the subjective Dvorak 
estimates at 115 knots.
 
Kiko is moving due west, or 270 degrees, at 8 knots.  The forecast 
track reasoning has changed little for this advisory.  A general 
westward motion is expected to continue during the next couple of 
days, as the cyclone is steered by a building subtropical ridge to 
its north and northwest.  A turn toward the west-northwest is 
forecast by day 3 as an upper-level trough north of Hawaii erodes 
the western portion of the subtropical ridge, with this general 
motion then continuing through day 5.  The track guidance this cycle 
remained in good agreement through day 3.  After that time, the 
along- and cross-track spread does increase but is still in fairly 
good agreement through day 5.  The official track forecast remains 
close to the multi-model consensus aids, near the middle of the 
model envelope of solutions.
 
Kiko will remain over warm water and light vertical wind shear for 
at least the next 3 days.  Kiko's intensity will therefore likely be 
governed by inner-core structural changes.  Kiko is currently in the 
middle of a period of rapid intensification which is expected to 
last for at least another 12 hours. Thereafter, it's possible Kiko 
may undergo an eyewall replacement, though the environment could 
also allow the hurricane to develop annular characteristics. Thus, 
the intensity forecast is on the higher end of the guidance suite, 
not that far off the reliable HCCA consensus aid over the first 72 
hours. After that time, cooler SSTs and an increase in southwesterly 
vertical wind shear should lead to a faster rate of weakening.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM MST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lorena was located
near latitude 23.4 North, longitude 113.2 West.  Lorena is moving
toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this motion with a 
decrease in forward speed is expected through early Thursday.  A 
slow northward or north-northeastward motion is expected to begin 
on Thursday and continue into the weekend.  On the forecast track, 
the center of Lorena is expected to move parallel to the west coast 
of the Baja California peninsula through Thursday, approach the 
coast of Baja California Sur Thursday night, and move inland over 
the Baja California peninsula on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Lorena is expected to begin weakening quickly and become a 
tropical storm on Thursday.  Lorena is likely to degenerate into a 
remnant low near or over the Baja California peninsula by early 
Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 981 mb (28.97 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lorena can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Bands of heavy rainfall will continue to impact Baja 
California Sur and move into southwestern Sonora by Thursday, with 
this rainfall potentially persisting through Friday.  Additional 
rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches, with maximum storm total amounts 
of 15 inches, are possible across portions of Baja California Sur, 
far southeast Baja California and southwestern Sonora into Friday. 
This will bring the risk of life-threatening flash floods and 
mudslides, especially in areas of higher terrain.

Farther northeast, 1 to 3 inches of rain, with localized totals up 
to 5 inches, are expected from portions of the Mexican state of 
Sinaloa north and northeast into portions of southeast Arizona and 
southwest New Mexico through Saturday, bringing the potential for 
isolated to scattered flash flooding.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Hurricane Lorena, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area
beginning tonight and will spread northward within the warning
area in Baja California Sur through Thursday and into Friday.
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area south
of Santa Fe for the next few hours, and in the watch area on the 
east coast of the Baja California peninsula late Friday into Friday 
night.
 
STORM SURGE:  Coastal flooding from storm surge is likely along the
coast of Baja California Sur near and to the right of where Lorena
makes landfall.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lorena will continue affecting portions
of the south and west coasts of Baja California Sur through Friday.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1100 PM MST.
Next complete advisory at 200 AM MST.

Hurricane Lorena Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122025
800 PM MST Wed Sep 03 2025
 
Objective satellite intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS (ADT, 
AiDT, and SATCON) have increased by 5 to 10 kt since the Air Force 
Reserve reconnaissance mission into Lorena earlier this afternoon.  
Since the plane's data suggested an intensity of 70 kt at that 
time, the current intensity is estimated to be about 75 kt.  That 
said, Lorena is probably at its peak intensity.  There are already 
signs in conventional and microwave satellite imagery that vertical 
shear is beginning to strengthen, with a sharpening of the southern 
side of the upper-level cloud pattern and some tilt of the 
circulation with height.  The shear is forecast to gradually 
increase over the next couple of days, and Lorena will also be 
moving over waters colder than 26 degrees Celsius in about 6 to 12 
hours.  Therefore, quick weakening is shown in the official 
forecast.

Lorena continues to move toward the northwest, or 310 degrees, but 
at a slightly slower 10 kt.  As the cyclone moves farther into a 
break in the subtropical ridge, it is expected to turn northward 
and slow down further by Thursday evening, and then move only 
slowly north-northeastward into the weekend.  The 18z GFS run is 
finally playing the same tune as much of the other guidance, 
showing Lorena quickly decoupling as the shear removes its deep 
convection and leaving the low-level center drifting toward the 
west coast of Baja California Sur.  Now that there is 
near-unanimous agreement that Lorena is unlikely to move quickly 
as a deep system toward northwestern Mexico, the NHC track forecast 
has been slowed down significantly, blending the previous forecast 
with the most recent HCCA and TVCE consensus aids.  This new 
forecast brings Lorena's center to the west coast of Baja 
California Sur in about 48 hours as a weakening tropical cyclone, 
with the system reaching the east coast of the peninsula as a 
remnant low in about 60 hours.  However, based on the latest GFS- 
and ECMWF-based simulated satellite imagery, the transition to a 
remnant low could occur earlier than that.
 
Even if Lorena weakens and becomes a remnant low earlier than 
previously predicted, abundant moisture will continue to stream 
northeastward away from the cyclone.  Because of that, there is 
still a significant risk of heavy rainfall and flash flooding across 
portions of Baja California Sur, Sonora, and southern Arizona and 
New Mexico.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall associated with Lorena will continue to impact 
Baja California Sur and shift into southwestern Sonora Thursday. 
This will increase the risk of life-threatening flash floods and 
mudslides across northwest Mexico.
 
2. Moisture from Lorena will contribute to heavy rainfall concerns 
across Arizona and southwest New Mexico through Saturday. Isolated 
to scattered instances of flash flooding are possible across Arizona 
into Saturday.
 
3. The center of Lorena is forecast to move parallel to, but
offshore of, the southwest coast of the Baja California Peninsula
through Thursday, and then move closer to the west-central coast of
the peninsula Thursday night and Friday.  Regardless of the exact 
track, tropical storm conditions are likely along portions of the 
coast of Baja California Sur where a Tropical Storm Warning is in 
effect. Tropical storm conditions are also possible late Friday 
along the east coast of the Baja California peninsula, where a 
Tropical Storm Watch is in effect.
 
4. Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions will affect
portions of the southern and western coasts of Baja California Sur
during the next couple of days.
