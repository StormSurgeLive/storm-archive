Hurricane Kiko Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112025
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
500 AM HST Thu Sep 04 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Kiko continues with a weaker depiction 
compared to yesterday evening, but beginning to see some 
stabilization in the core with a little more convective wrap within 
the southern flank of the eyewall. IR satellite and accompanying 
Dvorak imagery indicates a likely eyewall replacement cycle (EWRC) 
occurring over the past 12 hours, leading to the marginal 
degradation of the storms presentation.  The most recent subjective 
Dvorak current intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were each 
6.0/115 kt, while the objective estimates from UW-CIMSS have ranged 
between 108 and 127 kt during the past several hours. Based on the 
latest data from both the subjective and objective analysis, the 
initial intensity has been adjusted to 115 kt for this advisory, 
however Kiko still remains a very powerful category 4 hurricane.

With Kiko's EWRC anticipated to be completed later today, the 
expectation is for Kiko's inner-core to stabilize. Given the 
favorable environment that the cyclone is traversing, the latest 
intensity forecast shows the hurricane re-intensifying after the 
EWRC completes in the short-term. Thereafter, the current 
environment is quite favorable for Kiko to attempt to develop 
annular characteristics, which often allows a hurricane to remain 
stronger and closer to the maximum potential intensity (MPI) than 
what the more marginal thermodynamics would typically allow.  The 
short-term intensity forecast is actually above the vast majority of 
the interpolated intensity aids, which are somewhat influenced by 
the lower initial intensity. However, the latest raw output from 
both HAFS-A/B show Kiko maintaining category 4 intensity for at 
least the next 48 hours, and that is what will be reflected in this 
latest forecast. After 72 hours, Kiko's environment becomes less 
favorable, with increasing southwesterly vertical wind shear, and 
sea-surface temperatures decreasing below 26 C. Thus, more 
pronounced weakening is expected from days 3-5, with the intensity 
forecast falling back in line with the majority of the consensus 
intensity aids. 

Kiko is moving due west, or 270 degrees, at 8 kt. This general 
westward motion is expected to continue through the day due to a 
building subtropical ridge to its north and northwest.  Afterwards, 
this ridge begins to erode on its western side due to an upper-level 
trough digging in to the north of Hawaii. Thus, Kiko should begin to 
gain more latitude after the next 24 hours, and maintain a more 
west-northwestward heading through the remainder of the forecast 
period. The track guidance remains very tightly clustered in the 
short-term, though spread in the various consensus guidance aids 
increases to above climatology by the end of the forecast period. 
Ultimately, the latest NHC track forecast is quite similar to the 
prior one, just a little faster due to the latest guidance updates.

Key Messages:

1. Kiko is forecast to approach the Hawaiian Islands during the 
early to the middle portion of next week. The risk of direct impacts 
from wind and rainfall is increasing.  However, it is too soon to 
determine the exact location or magnitude of these impacts, and 
interests there should continue to monitor the progress of this 
storm.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* West Coast of Baja California Sur from Puerto Cortes to Punta
Eugenia
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests elsewhere on the Baja California peninsula and in
northwestern Mexico should monitor the progress of Lorena.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM MST (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lorena was
located near latitude 24.4 North, longitude 114.5 West. Lorena is
moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h). A turn toward the 
north and a decrease in forward speed is expected tonight. On the 
forecast track, the center of Lorena is expected to move generally 
parallel to the west coast of the Baja California peninsula through 
tonight, and could move closer to the west-central coast of the 
Baja California peninsula while it weakens on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Lorena is expected to quickly weaken for the next 
couple of days, and it is forecast to degenerate into a remnant low 
near or to the west of the Baja California peninsula by Friday 
night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lorena can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Bands of heavy rainfall will continue to impact Baja
California Sur and Sonora Mexico through Friday. Additional rainfall
totals of 4 to 8 inches, with maximum storm total amounts of 15
inches, are possible across portions of Baja California Sur, far
southeast Baja California and southwestern Sonora into Friday. This
will bring the risk of life-threatening flash floods and mudslides,
especially in areas of higher terrain.
 
Elsewhere across Mexico, 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated totals
up to 6 inches, are expected across the remainder of Sonora and
northern Sinaloa. These amounts will lead to isolated to scattered
instances of flash flooding.
 
Across the southwestern United States, 1 to 3 inches of rain, with
isolated totals up to 5 inches, are expected across portions of
Arizona and New Mexico through Saturday, bringing the potential for
isolated to scattered flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Lorena, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions, mainly in gusts, are expected
somewhere within the warning area in Baja California Sur today
through Friday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lorena will continue affecting portions
of the south and west coasts of Baja California Sur through Friday.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Lorena Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122025
800 AM MST Thu Sep 04 2025

Lorena has crossed the 26C sea-surface temperature isotherm and is 
now experiencing about 20 kt of southwesterly wind shear.  Recent 
GMI and AMSR-2 microwave passes indicate that the center is now 
located near or just outside of the convective area, and the 
convection is beginning to get sheared off toward the northeast.  
The latest subjective intensity estimates from SAB and TAFB range 
from 55-77 kt, and the UW-CIMSS objective intensity estimates range 
from 50-62 kt.  The initial intensity is lowered to 60 kt for this 
advisory, making Lorena a tropical storm.  As Lorena continues to 
slowly gain latitude, it will progressively encounter colder water 
temperatures and stronger southwesterly shear.  The latest NHC 
intensity forecast shows fairly quick weakening to a remnant low in 
about 36 h, in agreement with the guidance.  This is a slightly 
faster rate of weakening compared to the previous official 
forecast.  The remnant low should then dissipate completely in 
about 3 days, likely offshore, to the west of Baja California.

The GFS model and all of NHC's consensus guidance (including the 
HCCA, Google DeepMind, and TCVE) have come onboard to the solution 
that the ECMWF, UKMET, and CMC models have been advertising for the 
past couple of days, which shows Lorena slowing down and dissipating 
offshore, to the west of Baja California.  The only models that 
still bring Lorena's center into the Baja California peninsula are 
the HAFS models and the HMON (as a weak low, below tropical storm 
strength).  As Lorena's convection gets stripped off toward the 
northeast, its path will soon be governed by the low-level steering 
currents, which should keep Lorena moving slowly offshore as it 
weakens.  The new NHC forecast represents a large change from the 
previous forecast, and now keeps the center of Lorena offshore.

Although the chance of sustained tropical-storm-force winds on land 
is starting to decrease, the rainfall and flash flooding threat for 
the Baja California peninsula is still significant.  Abundant 
moisture will continue to stream northeastward away from the 
cyclone.  Because of that, there is still a significant risk of 
heavy rainfall and flash flooding across portions of Baja California 
Sur, Sonora, southern Arizona and New Mexico.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall associated with Lorena will continue to impact 
Baja California Sur and Sonora Mexico through Friday. This will 
increase the risk of life-threatening flash floods and mudslides 
across northwest Mexico.
 
2. Moisture from Lorena will contribute to heavy rainfall concerns 
across Arizona and New Mexico through Saturday. Isolated to 
scattered instances of flash flooding are possible across Arizona 
into Saturday.
 
3. The center of Lorena is forecast to move parallel to, but
offshore of, the southwest coast of the Baja California Peninsula
through tonight, and then could move closer to the west-central 
coast of the peninsula while it weakens on Friday. Tropical storm 
conditions, mainly in gusts, are likely along portions of the coast 
of Baja California Sur today through Friday, where a Tropical Storm 
Warning is in effect.

4. Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions will affect
portions of the southern and western coasts of Baja California Sur
during the next couple of days.
