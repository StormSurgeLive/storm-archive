      <title>Hurricane Kiko Forecast Discussion Number 19</title>

Hurricane Kiko Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112025
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
1100 AM HST Thu Sep 04 2025

Recent IR satellite imagery indicates Kiko's presentation is 
improving as the previous eyewall replacement cycle (EWRC) process 
is likely in its final stages of concluding, with the eye beginning 
to clear out. Latest Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB remain at 
T6.0/115 kt, with objective intensity estimates only starting to 
increase again. Thus, the initial intensity for now will remain 115 
knots. 

Now that Kiko is completing its EWRC, some reintensification is 
possible. The overall environment remains favorable, with 
sea-surface temperatures (SST) remaining between 27-28 C with modest 
northeasterly shear. Previous forecasts from the interpolated 
intensity aids were below the official NHC forecast.  However, this 
area of the Pacific has historically had a low bias when it comes to 
the intensity forecasts when tropical cyclones develop a more 
annular structure, which the current environment is favorable for.  
As a result, the previous forecast was generally maintained over the 
first 72 hours, above the majority of the guidance. Beyond 72 hours, 
southwesterly shear increases quickly, and the hurricane will move 
over sub-26 C SSTs. This should hasten weakening towards the end of 
the forecast, which falls back in line with the intensity consensus 
aids.

Kiko will ride the southern periphery of a broad upper ridge 
situated over the northern Pacific leading to a continued west to 
west-northwest heading through the end of the week and weekend with 
a forward propagation likely to settle between 8-12 kts over this 
time frame. By early next week, the forward speed will increase to 
10-15 kts, with the hurricane moving a bit more poleward as it 
approaches the Hawaiian Islands, as an upper trough to the northwest 
of the islands erodes the western flank of the ridge.  This forecast 
remains close to the consensus guidance and just a little faster 
than the previous NHC forecast.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Kiko is forecast to approach the Hawaiian Islands during the
early to the middle portion of next week. The risk of direct impacts
from wind and rainfall is increasing.  However, it is too soon to
determine the exact location or magnitude of these impacts, and
interests there should continue to monitor the progress of this
storm.

SUMMARY OF 800 PM PDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.6N 115.1W
ABOUT 175 MI...285 KM W OF CABO SAN LAZARO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...998 MB...29.47 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Baja California Sur and Sonora, Mexico, should
continue to monitor the risk of heavy rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Lorena.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM PDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lorena was
located near latitude 24.6 North, longitude 115.1 West.  Lorena is
moving toward the northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h).  A slow 
north-northwestward to northwestward motion is expected through 
early Saturday, followed by a turn toward the west-northwest over 
the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast, and Lorena is 
expected to become a remnant low by Friday morning.  The remnant 
low is likely to dissipate by late Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
to the northwest of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lorena can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Bands of heavy rainfall will continue to impact Baja
California Sur and Sonora Mexico through Friday. Additional rainfall
totals of 4 to 8 inches, with maximum storm total amounts of 15
inches, are possible across portions of Baja California Sur, far
southeast Baja California and southwestern Sonora into Friday. This
will bring the risk of life-threatening flash floods and mudslides,
especially in areas of higher terrain.
 
Elsewhere across Mexico, 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated totals
up to 6 inches, are expected across the remainder of Sonora and
northern Sinaloa. These amounts will lead to isolated to scattered
instances of flash flooding.
 
Across the southwestern United States, 1 to 2 inches of rain, with
isolated totals up to 4 inches, are expected across portions of
Arizona and New Mexico through Saturday, bringing the potential for
isolated to scattered flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Lorena, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lorena will continue affecting portions
of the west coast of Baja California Sur through Friday.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Lorena Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122025
800 PM PDT Thu Sep 04 2025
 
Lorena has not produced deep convection near its center since about 
8 AM this morning.  Waves of heavy showers and thunderstorms 
continue to stream northeastward across Baja California Sur, Sonora, 
and northern Sinaloa, but this activity cannot be directly linked 
to Lorena's circulation.  Weakening is assumed to have occurred 
since the earlier aircraft and ASCAT data, and the intensity is set 
at 40 kt based on a blend of Dvorak CI numbers and objective 
numbers (which are between 30 and 45 kt).  With Lorena over cool 
waters and southwesterly shear only expected to increase, deep 
convection is not forecast to redevelop, and Lorena is likely to 
become post-tropical Friday morning.  Winds will continue to 
steadily decrease, with the remnant low likely to dissipate by late 
Sunday.

Lorena has been moving west of the dynamical model guidance over 
the past 6 to 12 hours, and the best-performing track models since 
this morning have been the simple shallow Trajectory and Beta 
Advection (TABS) models.  Given that the circulation will remain 
shallow, the new NHC track forecast blends the TABS models with the 
latest GFS-ECWMF mean and HCCA consensus aid.  This puts the new 
forecast west of the previous prediction by a somewhat noticeable 
degree, showing more of a slow northwestward motion instead of 
northward trajectory.
 
Abundant moisture will continue to stream northeastward away from 
Lorena even though it is weakening.  Significant rainfall and flash 
flooding has already occurred over portions of Baja California Sur, 
and the risk of life-threatening flash flooding will continue across 
portions of Baja California Sur and Sonora through Friday, 
and southern Arizona and New Mexico through Saturday.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall associated with Lorena will continue to impact 
Baja California Sur and Sonora Mexico through Friday. This will 
increase the risk of life-threatening flash floods and mudslides 
across northwest Mexico.
 
2. Moisture from Lorena will contribute to heavy rainfall concerns 
across Arizona and New Mexico through Saturday. Isolated to 
scattered instances of flash flooding are possible across Arizona 
into Saturday.
 
3. Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions will affect
portions of the western coast of Baja California Sur through Friday.
