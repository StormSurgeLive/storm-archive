Hurricane Kiko Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112025
1100 PM HST Wed Sep 03 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Kiko has degraded some since the 
previous advisory, with the eye now mostly obscured by a central 
dense overcast with cloud top temperatures of -70 to -80C.  Given 
the favorable environment that the cyclone is traversing, it is 
likely that Kiko is undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle at the 
moment.  The most recent subjective Dvorak current intensity 
estimates from TAFB and SAB were 6.0/115 kt and 6.5/127 kt 
respectively, while the objective estimates from UW-CIMSS have 
ranged between 111 and 132 kt during the past several hours.  Based 
on a blend of these data, the initial intensity has been held at 125 
kt for this advisory, and Kiko remains a very powerful category 4 
hurricane.

Kiko is moving just south of due west, or 265 degrees, at 7 kt.  
This general westward motion is expected to continue through 
Thursday, as the cyclone is steered by a building subtropical ridge 
to its north and northwest.  A turn toward the west-northwest is 
forecast by Friday as an upper-level trough north of Hawaii begins 
to erode the western portion of the subtropical ridge, with this 
general motion then continuing over the weekend and into early next 
week, along with a gradual increase in forward speed.  There remains 
some along-track and cross track spread among the global models, 
although the spread has decreased considerably during the past 24 
hours.  A very slight northward adjustment has been made to the 
official track forecast, which remains in good agreement with a 
blend of the latest multi-model consensus aids. 

Kiko will remain over warm waters of 27–28C and influenced by mostly 
light vertical wind shear through around 60 hours.  The surrounding 
environmental mid-level moisture will remain drier than optimal, 
hovering between 50 and 60 percent during the next couple of days, 
before dropping below 50 percent by 60 hours.  Despite the somewhat 
dry mid-level airmass, the light vertical wind shear and warm sea 
surface temperatures should maintain Kiko as a major hurricane 
through day 3.  There will likely be some fluctuations in strength 
during the next several days with the potential for eyewall 
replacement cycles during this time.  By days 4 and 5, the cyclone 
will begin moving over cooler water with gradually increasing 
westerly vertical wind shear, and mid-level moisture plummeting 
below 40 percent.  These factors should lead to steady and 
eventually rapid weakening of Kiko as the cyclone approaches the 
Hawaiian Islands from the east-southeast.  Kiko will be influenced 
by environmental factors that can lead to the development of annular 
characteristics during the next few days along its approach, which 
can slow the rate of weakening.  As a result, the official intensity 
forecast remains on the higher end or slightly above the intensity 
aids through day 5, and is very similar to the previous advisory.

--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical Storm Watch 
along the east coast of the Baja California peninsula from Santa 
Rosalia to Bahia de los Angeles.

The government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical Storm 
Warning along the west coast of the Baja California peninsula south 
of Puerto Cortes.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* West Coast of Baja California Sur from Puerto Cortes to Punta 
Eugenia
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests elsewhere on the Baja California peninsula and in
northwestern Mexico should monitor the progress of Lorena.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lorena was
located near latitude 24.2 North, longitude 114.2 West. Lorena is
moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A turn toward the 
north and a decrease in forward speed is expected tonight. On the 
forecast track, the center of Lorena is expected to move generally 
parallel to the west coast of the Baja California peninsula through 
tonight, and could move closer to the west-central coast of the 
Baja California peninsula while it weakens on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Lorena is expected to quickly weaken for the next couple of
days, and it is forecast to degenerate into a remnant low near or 
to the west of the Baja California peninsula by Friday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.27 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lorena can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Bands of heavy rainfall will continue to impact Baja 
California Sur and Sonora Mexico through Friday. Additional rainfall 
totals of 4 to 8 inches, with maximum storm total amounts of 15 
inches, are possible across portions of Baja California Sur, far 
southeast Baja California and southwestern Sonora into Friday. This 
will bring the risk of life-threatening flash floods and mudslides, 
especially in areas of higher terrain.

Elsewhere across Mexico, 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated totals 
up to 6 inches, are expected across the remainder of Sonora and 
northern Sinaloa. These amounts will lead to isolated to scattered 
instances of flash flooding.

Across the southwestern United States, 1 to 3 inches of rain, with 
isolated totals up to 5 inches, are expected across portions of 
Arizona and New Mexico through Saturday, bringing the potential for 
isolated to scattered flash flooding.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Hurricane Lorena, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions, mainly in gusts, are expected 
somewhere within the warning area in Baja California Sur today 
through Friday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lorena will continue affecting portions 
of the south and west coasts of Baja California Sur through Friday. 
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather 
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1100 AM MST.
Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

Tropical Storm Lorena Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122025
800 AM MST Thu Sep 04 2025

Lorena has crossed the 26C sea-surface temperature isotherm and is 
now experiencing about 20 kt of southwesterly wind shear.  Recent 
GMI and AMSR-2 microwave passes indicate that the center is now 
located near or just outside of the convective area, and the 
convection is beginning to get sheared off toward the northeast.  
The latest subjective intensity estimates from SAB and TAFB range 
from 55-77 kt, and the UW-CIMSS objective intensity estimates range 
from 50-62 kt.  The initial intensity is lowered to 60 kt for this 
advisory, making Lorena a tropical storm.  As Lorena continues to 
slowly gain latitude, it will progressively encounter colder water 
temperatures and stronger southwesterly shear.  The latest NHC 
intensity forecast shows fairly quick weakening to a remnant low in 
about 36 h, in agreement with the guidance.  This is a slightly 
faster rate of weakening compared to the previous official 
forecast.  The remnant low should then dissipate completely in 
about 3 days, likely offshore, to the west of Baja California.

The GFS model and all of NHC's consensus guidance (including the 
HCCA, Google DeepMind, and TCVE) have come onboard to the solution 
that the ECMWF, UKMET, and CMC models have been advertising for the 
past couple of days, which shows Lorena slowing down and dissipating 
offshore, to the west of Baja California.  The only models that 
still bring Lorena's center into the Baja California peninsula are 
the HAFS models and the HMON (as a weak low, below tropical storm 
strength).  As Lorena's convection gets stripped off toward the 
northeast, its path will soon be governed by the low-level steering 
currents, which should keep Lorena moving slowly offshore as it 
weakens.  The new NHC forecast represents a large change from the 
previous forecast, and now keeps the center of Lorena offshore.

Although the chance of sustained tropical-storm-force winds on land 
is starting to decrease, the rainfall and flash flooding threat for 
the Baja California peninsula is still significant.  Abundant 
moisture will continue to stream northeastward away from the 
cyclone.  Because of that, there is still a significant risk of 
heavy rainfall and flash flooding across portions of Baja California 
Sur, Sonora, southern Arizona and New Mexico.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall associated with Lorena will continue to impact 
Baja California Sur and Sonora Mexico through Friday. This will 
increase the risk of life-threatening flash floods and mudslides 
across northwest Mexico.
 
2. Moisture from Lorena will contribute to heavy rainfall concerns 
across Arizona and New Mexico through Saturday. Isolated to 
scattered instances of flash flooding are possible across Arizona 
into Saturday.
 
3. The center of Lorena is forecast to move parallel to, but
offshore of, the southwest coast of the Baja California Peninsula
through tonight, and then could move closer to the west-central 
coast of the peninsula while it weakens on Friday. Tropical storm 
conditions, mainly in gusts, are likely along portions of the coast 
of Baja California Sur today through Friday, where a Tropical Storm 
Warning is in effect.

4. Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions will affect
portions of the southern and western coasts of Baja California Sur
during the next couple of days.
