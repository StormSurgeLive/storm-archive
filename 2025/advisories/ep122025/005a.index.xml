      <title>Hurricane Kiko Forecast Discussion Number 12</title>

Hurricane Kiko Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112025
500 PM HST Tue Sep 02 2025
 
Recent satellite images show that the low-level center of Kiko is
now obscured by a large central dense overcast, possibly due to an
increase in northeasterly vertical wind shear, with the outflow now
somewhat restricted in the eastern semi-circle.  A 02/2155Z AMRS2
microwave pass indicated that the cyclone continues to have a
well-defined inner-core, with a break in the eyewall evident in the
northwest quadrant at that time.  The most recent subjective Dvorak
current intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were both 5.0/90 kt,
while the objective estimates from UW-CIMSS have ranged between 72
and 92 kt during the past several hours.  Taking a blend of these
data, the initial intensity for this advisory has been raised to 90
kt.
 
Kiko is moving due west, or 270 degrees, at 6 kt.  This general
motion is expected to continue during the next 60 hours or so, as
the cyclone is steered by a building subtropical ridge to its north
and northwest.  A turn toward the west-northwest is forecast by day
3 as an upper-level trough north of Hawaii begins to erode the
western portion of the subtropical ridge, with this general motion
then continuing through day 5.  There remains considerable
along-track spread among the global models, with the GFS and ECMWF
still showing a 240 n mi difference in position on day 5.  The
official track forecast remains in good agreement with a blend of
the latest multi-model consensus aids and is nearly on top of the
previous advisory, but with a slightly faster forward speed.
 
Kiko will remain over warm waters of 27–28C and influenced by most
light vertical wind shear through day 3.  The surrounding
environmental mid-level moisture will remain drier than optimal,
hovering between 50 and 60 percent through day 3, then trending
below 50 percent by days 4 and 5.  Despite the drier mid-level
airmass, the light vertical wind shear and warm sea surface
temperatures should maintain Kiko as a robust hurricane through day
3, with it likely being a major hurricane for much of that time.  By
days 4 and 5, the cyclone will begin moving over cooler water with
gradually increasing westerly vertical wind shear.  This should lead
to a steady weakening trend, but Kiko is still forecast to be a
hurricane at day 5.  The official forecast is on the higher end of
the intensity guidance suite, and is most closely aligned with the
HCCA and regional hurricane model intensity aids.

* West Coast of Baja California Sur from Cabo San Lucas northward
to Cabo San Lazaro
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere on the Baja California peninsula and in
southwestern Mexico should monitor the progress of Lorena.
Additional watches or warnings may be required on Wednesday.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM MST (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lorena was
located near latitude 20.7 North, longitude 110.0 West. Lorena is
moving toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h), and this motion 
with a decrease in forward speed is expected through early Thursday. 
A generally slow northward motion is expected to begin by late 
Thursday and continue into late Friday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Lorena is expected to move parallel to the west coast of 
the Baja California peninsula on Wednesday and Thursday and then 
could approach the coast on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Rapid strengthening is forecast during the next 
day or so, and Lorena is likely to become a hurricane during the 
next several hours. Fast weakening is expected to begin on 
Thursday, and Lorena could be back to tropical storm status by 
early Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lorena can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Bands of heavy rainfall are expected to begin impacting
Baja California Sur by Wednesday and southwestern Sonora by
Thursday, with this rainfall potentially persisting through Friday.
Rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches, with maximum amounts of 15
inches, are possible across portions of Baja California Sur through
Friday.  Significant flash flooding is a possibility.
 
Within the moisture surge ahead of Lorena, 1 to 2 inches of rain,
with localized totals to 4 inches, are expected from the northwest
Mexico states of Colima to Sinaloa northward into Arizona through
Friday, bringing the potential for isolated to scattered pockets of
flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Lorena, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
on Wednesday and Thursday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lorena will affect portions of the west
coast of Baja California Sur beginning tonight and continuing
through Friday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM MST.

Tropical Storm Lorena Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122025
800 PM MST Tue Sep 02 2025
 
A pair of AMSR2 and GMI microwave passes from several hours ago 
revealed that Lorena's structure has improved significantly through 
the day, with the 37-GHZ channel in particular showing a 
well-defined cyan ring.  The center is embedded beneath a Central 
Dense Overcast, and Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB 
are a consensus T3.5/55 kt.  This is also supported by some of the 
UW-CIMSS objective numbers, and the initial intensity is therefore 
set--possibly conservatively given the structure--at 55 kt.

Lorena has a low-level structure and small size that would make it 
a prime suspect for rapid intensification, especially since it will 
be in an environment of low shear and over warm ocean temperatures 
for the next 36 hours.  In fact, the SHIPS Rapid Intensification 
(RI) index now shows a 3 in 4 chance of a 30-kt increase in 
Lorena's winds over the next 24 hours.  The NHC intensity forecast 
therefore explicitly shows RI during the next day or so and most 
closely follows the SHIPS and LGEM models, which are the highest 
guidance, during that time.  After 36 hours, increasing shear and 
colder water temperatures are expected lead to weakening, which 
itself could be rapid due to Lorena's small size.  Although there 
is significant uncertainty on where Lorena will end up in 4-5 days 
(see discussion below), the cyclone will likely not exist anymore 
by day 5, and that is when dissipation is shown in the forecast.

Lorena continues to move northwestward, or 315/12 kt.  The first 36 
hours or so of the track forecast are fairly straightforward, with 
a slower northwestward motion expected while the cyclone moves 
around the western periphery of a mid-level high centered over 
Mexico.  Things are trickier after 36 hours.  Lorena will be moving 
through a weakness in the subtropical ridge, but how much northward 
progress it makes will depend on how long it remains strong.  A 
minority of models, particularly the GFS, keep a stronger Lorena 
moving northeastward across the Baja California peninsula toward 
Sonora.  However, moderate to strong southwesterly shear is likely 
to set in over Lorena in 48-72 hours, and a good chunk of the other 
models, including many of the GEFS ensemble members, keep a 
weakening Lorena offshore the west coast of the Baja California 
peninsula with landfall never occurring.  This new NHC forecast 
blends the previous official forecast with the latest HCCA, Florida 
State Superensemble, and GEFS ensemble mean, showing a slower 
motion on day 4 and 5, and introducing the possibility that Lorena 
doesn't reach mainland Mexico as a tropical cyclone.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Heavy rainfall associated with Tropical Storm Lorena will begin 
to affect Baja California Sur on Wednesday, southwestern Sonora by 
Thursday, and contribute to heavy rainfall concerns across Arizona 
late Wednesday through Friday. This will increase the risk of 
life-threatening flash floods and mudslides across Mexico, 
especially in areas of higher terrain. Isolated to scattered 
instances of flash flooding are possible across Arizona through 
Friday.
 
2. Although rapid intensification is possible through Wednesday 
while Lorena is offshore, the storm is expected to weaken while it 
approaches the Baja California peninsula on Thursday and Friday.  
Regardless, tropical storm conditions are possible through Thursday 
along portions of the west coast of Baja California Sur.  
Interests in Baja California Sur should closely monitor the latest 
forecast updates.
