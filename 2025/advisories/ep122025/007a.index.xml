      <title>Hurricane Kiko Forecast Discussion Number 14</title>

Hurricane Kiko Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112025
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
500 AM HST Wed Sep 03 2025
 
 
Kiko is getting better organized on satellite with an eye clearing
out over the past 6 to 12 hours with recent satellite images showing
the eye being surrounded by a ring of deep convection.  The most
recent subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates from TAFB and
SAB were both 5.0/90 kt at 12Z but since that time the structure
has improved on satellite while the objective ADT estimate was 99
knots.  The initial intensity has been set at 95 kt as a compromise
between these estimates.
 
Kiko is moving due west, or 270 degrees, at 7 kt.  This general
motion is expected to continue during the next couple of days, as
the cyclone is steered by a building subtropical ridge to its north
and northwest.  A turn toward the west-northwest is forecast by day
3 as an upper-level trough north of Hawaii erodes the western 
portion of the subtropical ridge, with this general motion then 
continuing through day 5.  The track guidance this cycle was tightly 
clustered through day 3.  After that time, the European ensemble 
shows a significant increase in spread in both the along- and 
cross-track directions.  The official track forecast remains close 
to the HCCA and GDMI model solutions and is on the southern side 
of the overall model envelope of solutions.
 
Kiko will remain over warm water and light vertical wind shear for
at least the next 3 days.  Kiko's intensity will therefore likely
be governed by inner-core structural changes.  Given its current
single eye-wall structure seen on earlier AMSR-2 microwave imagery,
Kiko appears poised to intensify more in the short term and the
latest intensity forecast shows more intensification than the
previous advisory.  This intensity forecast is on the higher end of
the guidance suite closest to the HAFS-A and HAFS-B forecast over
the next 2 to 3 days. After that time, cooler SSTs and an increase
in southwesterly vertical wind shear should lead to gradual
weakening.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM MST (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lorena was
located near latitude 22.5 North, longitude 112.1 West. Lorena is 
moving toward the northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h), and this motion 
with a decrease in forward speed is expected through early Thursday. 
A generally slow northward motion is expected late Thursday and 
early Friday, with a gradual turn toward the northeast by late 
Friday. On the forecast track, the center of Lorena is expected to 
move parallel to the west coast of the Baja California peninsula 
through tonight and then approach the coast late Thursday through 
Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Rapid strengthening is forecast to continue through this 
evening.  Fast weakening is expected to begin on Thursday, and 
Lorena could weaken back to a tropical storm by Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70
miles (110 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure based on Air Force Reserve 
reconnaissance aircraft data is 985 mb (29.09 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lorena can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Bands of heavy rainfall will continue to impact Baja
California Sur and move into southeastern Baja California and
southwestern Sonora by Thursday, with this rainfall potentially
persisting through Friday.  Rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches, with
maximum amounts of 15 inches, are possible across portions of Baja
California Sur, far southeast Baja California and southwestern
Sonora through Friday. This will bring the risk of life-threatening
flash floods and mudslides, especially in areas of higher terrain.
 
Within the moisture surge ahead of Lorena, 1 to 3 inches of rain,
with localized totals up to 4 inches, are expected from the Mexico
states of Sinaloa northward into Arizona through Friday, bringing
the potential for isolated to scattered flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Lorena, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area
beginning tonight, and spreading northward within the warning area
in Baja California Sur through Thursday and into Friday. Tropical
storm conditions are possible within the watch area south of Santa
Fe through tonight, and in the watch area north of Punta Abreojos
Thursday night and early Friday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lorena will continue affecting portions
of the south and west coasts of Baja California Sur through Friday.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Lorena Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122025
800 AM MST Wed Sep 03 2025
 
Satellite imagery and radar data from the Los Cabos radar in Mexico
indicate that Lorena continues to become better organized. Radar
imagery shows Lorena's eye becoming better defined, with a
completely closed and circular eyewall.  Dvorak estimates from TAFB
and SAB were both T-4.0/65 kt, with the UW-CIMSS numbers ranging
from 55-68 kt.  However, the improvement over the last few hours
seen in radar images and GOES West satellite images suggest that
Lorena is likely stronger now.  The initial intensity is estimated
at 70 kt, and it is possible this may be a bit conservative.  An Air
Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft is currently enroute to
Lorena, which should provide a better estimate of the intensity
in a couple of hours from now.
 
Lorena has rapidly intensified over the past 24 hours.  Continued
rapid strengthening is likely for another 12 to 18 hours as Lorena
remains over warm water and in low wind shear conditions, and the
peak intensity forecast of 85 kt is maintained.  By 24 hours, the
hurricane is expected to cross the 26C sea-surface temperature
isotherm while southwesterly wind shear also begins to significantly
increase.  These conditions are expected to lead to rapid weakening
beginning by Thursday afternoon.  The official forecast is above
most of the intensity guidance for the first 24 hours, but is closer
to the consensus aids thereafter.
 
The initial motion is faster now toward the northwest, or 320/14 kt. 
Not much has changed with the track forecast reasoning.  There are 
still two camps of models.  The majority of the guidance, including 
the GFS, shows Lorena progressing faster and farther east, with 
landfall in Baja California Sur followed by a turn toward the 
northeast.  But a significant minority of models, including the 
ECMWF, CMC, and UKMET, slow down Lorena immediately, with a track 
farther west, and then dissipate the system over water without 
making landfall.  The steering is such that a stronger cyclone would 
be more likely to be in the faster and farther east camp of models. 
However, if the hurricane rapidly weakens by Thursday night and 
starts to decouple due to the aforementioned increasing 
southwesterly shear, then the low-level circulation could 
potentially get left behind.  The new NHC forecast shows a faster 
forward motion over the next 36 hours with a track slightly to the 
right of the previous NHC track.  Due to the rightward shift, the 
chance of tropical storm force winds impacting portions of Baja 
California Sur is increasing.  Additionally, there is very high 
confidence that heavy rainfall amounts leading to significant 
flooding will occur in Baja California Sur, especially since the 
southwesterly upper-level winds favor deep convection to the right 
side of Lorena by late Thursday.  At 48 h and beyond, the new NHC 
forecast is similar to, but slightly to the left of, the previous 
NHC forecast track.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Heavy rainfall associated with Tropical Storm Lorena will 
continue to impact Baja California Sur, moving into southeastern 
Baja California and southwestern Sonora by Thursday, and 
contributing to heavy rainfall concerns across Arizona from late 
Wednesday through Friday. This will increase the risk of 
life-threatening flash floods and mudslides across Mexico, 
especially in areas of higher terrain. Isolated to scattered 
instances of flash flooding are possible across Arizona through 
Friday.
 
2. The center of Lorena is forecast to move parallel to, but
offshore of, the southwest coast of the Baja Peninsula today, and
then move closer to the west-central coast of the peninsula on
Thursday.  Regardless of the exact track, tropical storm conditions
are likely along portions of the coast of Baja California Sur where
a Tropical Storm Warning has been issued.  Tropical Storm conditions
are also possible through tonight along the southwestern coast of
Baja California Sur where a Tropical Storm Watch is in effect.
Interests elsewhere in Baja California Sur should closely monitor
the latest forecast updates.
 
3. Life-threatening surf and rip current conditions will affect
portions of the southern and western coasts of Baja California Sur
during the next couple of days.
