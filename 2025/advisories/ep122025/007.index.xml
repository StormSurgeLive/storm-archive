      <title>Hurricane Kiko Forecast Discussion Number 14</title>

Hurricane Kiko Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112025
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
500 AM HST Wed Sep 03 2025
 
 
Kiko is getting better organized on satellite with an eye clearing
out over the past 6 to 12 hours with recent satellite images showing
the eye being surrounded by a ring of deep convection.  The most
recent subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates from TAFB and
SAB were both 5.0/90 kt at 12Z but since that time the structure
has improved on satellite while the objective ADT estimate was 99
knots.  The initial intensity has been set at 95 kt as a compromise
between these estimates.
 
Kiko is moving due west, or 270 degrees, at 7 kt.  This general
motion is expected to continue during the next couple of days, as
the cyclone is steered by a building subtropical ridge to its north
and northwest.  A turn toward the west-northwest is forecast by day
3 as an upper-level trough north of Hawaii erodes the western 
portion of the subtropical ridge, with this general motion then 
continuing through day 5.  The track guidance this cycle was tightly 
clustered through day 3.  After that time, the European ensemble 
shows a significant increase in spread in both the along- and 
cross-track directions.  The official track forecast remains close 
to the HCCA and GDMI model solutions and is on the southern side 
of the overall model envelope of solutions.
 
Kiko will remain over warm water and light vertical wind shear for
at least the next 3 days.  Kiko's intensity will therefore likely
be governed by inner-core structural changes.  Given its current
single eye-wall structure seen on earlier AMSR-2 microwave imagery,
Kiko appears poised to intensify more in the short term and the
latest intensity forecast shows more intensification than the
previous advisory.  This intensity forecast is on the higher end of
the guidance suite closest to the HAFS-A and HAFS-B forecast over
the next 2 to 3 days. After that time, cooler SSTs and an increase
in southwesterly vertical wind shear should lead to gradual
weakening.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lorena was located
near latitude 22.3 North, longitude 111.6 West. Lorena is moving
toward the northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h), and this motion with a
decrease in forward speed is expected through early Thursday. A
generally slow northward motion is expected late Thursday and early
Friday, with a gradual turn toward the northeast by late Friday. On
the forecast track, the center of Lorena is expected to move
parallel to the west coast of the Baja California peninsula through
tonight and then approach the coast late Thursday through Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Rapid strengthening is forecast to continue through this 
evening.  Fast weakening is expected to begin on Thursday, and 
Lorena could weaken back to a tropical storm by Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles
(110 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 988 mb (29.18 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lorena can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Bands of heavy rainfall will continue to impact Baja
California Sur and move into southeastern Baja California and
southwestern Sonora by Thursday, with this rainfall potentially
persisting through Friday.  Rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches, with
maximum amounts of 15 inches, are possible across portions of Baja
California Sur, far southeast Baja California and southwestern
Sonora through Friday. This will bring the risk of life-threatening
flash floods and mudslides, especially in areas of higher terrain.
 
Within the moisture surge ahead of Lorena, 1 to 3 inches of rain,
with localized totals up to 4 inches, are expected from the Mexico
states of Sinaloa northward into Arizona through Friday, bringing
the potential for isolated to scattered flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Lorena, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area
beginning tonight, and spreading northward within the warning area
in Baja California Sur through Thursday and into Friday. Tropical
storm conditions are possible within the watch area south of Santa
Fe through tonight, and in the watch area north of Punta Abreojos
Thursday night and early Friday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lorena will continue affecting portions
of the south and west coasts of Baja California Sur through Friday.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next intermediate advisory at 1100 AM MST.
Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

Hurricane Lorena Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122025
200 AM MST Wed Sep 03 2025
 
Satellite imagery and data from the Mexican radar at Cabo San Lucas
indicate that Lorena continues to become better organized, with the
radar imagery showing an eyewall wrapped 50-70 percent of the way
around the center. Satellite intensity estimates are now in the
55-65 kt range, with subjective estimates from TAFB and SAB being
65 kt. Based on these data, the initial intensity is increased to
65 kt and Lorena is upgraded to a hurricane.
 
Steady to rapid intensification is likely during the next 24 h,
and while the forecast peak intensity of 85 kt is above the upper
edge of the intensity guidance it might be conservative.  After
that time, Lorena is forecast to move over cooler sea surface
temperatures and into an area of southwesterly vertical shear.
This should cause significant weakening, and Lorena is expected to
weaken back to a tropical storm by 60 h. There is significant
uncertainty as to whether Lorena will make landfall in Baja
California Sur (see discussion below). If it does, the system
should continue weakening and dissipate over northwestern Mexico by
120 h. If it doesn't, the cyclone should continue to weaken over
cold water, with dissipation likely west of Baja California Sur
by 120 h.
 
The initial motion is now 320/12 kt. The first 24 h or so of
the track forecast remain fairly straightforward, with a slower
northwestward motion expected while the cyclone moves around the
western periphery of a mid-level high centered over Mexico.  After
that time, Lorena will be moving into a weakness in the subtropical
ridge as it starts to encounter the less favorable environment.
The GFS model maintains a stronger and deeper Lorena and breaks open
the weakness in about 36 h, allowing the cyclone to recurve
north-northeastward into northwestern Mexico. The ECMWF and
Canadian models have a weaker Lorena and take about 12 h longer to
break open the ridge. This results in Lorena shearing apart with
the low-level center turning westward over the Pacific west of Baja
California Sur. Based on current intensity trends, the track
forecast leans toward the GFS solution and shows Lorena crossing
Baja California Sur in 60-72 h. However, there is still the
possibility that the cyclone does not reach the coast of Mexico. The
new forecast track is similar to the previous track and lies along
the east side of the consensus models.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Heavy rainfall associated with Tropical Storm Lorena will
continue to impact Baja California Sur, moving into southeastern
Baja California and southwestern Sonora by Thursday, and contribute
to heavy rainfall concerns across Arizona late Wednesday through
Friday. This will increase the risk of life-threatening flash floods
and mudslides across Mexico, especially in areas of higher terrain.
Isolated to scattered instances of flash flooding are possible
across Arizona through Friday.
 
2. Although rapid intensification is possible through tonight while
Lorena is offshore, the storm is expected to weaken while it
approaches the Baja California peninsula on Thursday and Thursday
night. Regardless, tropical storm conditions are likely along
portions of the coast of Baja California Sur where a Tropical Storm
Warning has been issued.  Tropical Storm conditions are also
possible through Friday along other portions of the west coast of
Baja California Sur where a Tropical Storm Watch is in effect.
Interests in Baja California Sur should closely monitor the latest
forecast updates.
