Hurricane Kiko Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112025
1100 AM HST Tue Sep 02 2025
 
The eye of Kiko continues to gradually become better defined on 
visible and infrared GOES-18 imagery.  While the TAFB and SAB Dvorak 
estimates of 4.5 (77 kt) and 5.0 (90 kt) are unchanged from 6 h ago, 
the objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS have increased, and 
now range from 70-85 kt.  The latest SATCON and AiDT measurements 
are both 83 kt, and the eye has continued to warm and become better 
defined over the past couple of hours.  The initial intensity is 
increased to 85 kt for this advisory.
 
Kiko continues moving slowly westward, or 270 degrees at 5 kt.  The
main steering feature continues to be the subtropical ridge located
to the north of Kiko.  A slow westward motion should continue for
the next couple of days.  A turn toward the west-northwest is
forecast by days 3 and 4 as an upper-level trough north of Hawaii
begins to erode the western portion of the subtropical ridge.  There
remains above normal along-track spread in the model suite.  The
latest NHC track forecast was sped up a bit from the previous
official forecast, and is relatively close to, but slightly slower
than, the latest TVCE consensus and GFEX.
 
Through the next 48 h, Kiko should remain over sea-surface
temperatures of 27-28C, with light to moderate easterly wind shear,
but the relatively dry and stable environment is making the
intensity forecast tricky.  There is larger than normal spread among
the various intensity models.  Between days 3 and 4, water
temperatures along Kiko's path will begin to decrease while it also
moves into a progressively drier air mass.  The NHC intensity
forecast continues to lie at the high end of the guidance suite
through day 3, but is now close to the middle of guidance envelope
at days 4 and 5.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has issued a Tropical Storm Watch from Cabo 
San Lucas northward to Cabo San Lazaro on the western coast of Baja 
California Sur.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Cabo San Lucas northward to Cabo San Lazaro on the western coast
of Baja California Sur in Mexico.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in southwestern Mexico and the Baja California 
peninsula should monitor the progress of this system.  Additional 
watches may be required later tonight or on Wednesday.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lorena was
located near latitude 19.4 North, longitude 109.0 West. Lorena is
moving toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this motion 
is expected to continue for the next day or so before slowing and
turning northward by Thursday into Friday and northeastward toward 
the Baja California peninsula and into Sonora by the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h)
with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast during the
next 24 hours, and Lorena is expected to become a hurricane on
Wednesday.  Gradual weakening is forecast to begin on Thursday into
the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lorena can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Areas of heavy rainfall well east and northeast of Lorena 
will continue to impact portions of northwestern Mexico from the 
states of Colima to Sinaloa today, with isolated flash flooding 
possible in areas of mountainous terrain.
 
Bands of heavy rainfall are expected to begin impacting Baja
California Sur by Wednesday and southwestern Sonora by Thursday,
with this rainfall potentially persisting through Friday.  Rainfall
totals of 4 to 8 inches, with maximum amounts of 12 inches possible
across portions of Baja California Sur and southwestern Sonora
through Friday.  Uncertainty remains with these totals, and locally
higher or lower amounts are possible depending on the track and
strength of the system. Potentially significant flash flooding is a
possibility.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area by late Wednesday into Thursday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 500 PM MST.
Next complete advisory at 800 PM MST.

Tropical Storm Lorena Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122025
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
200 PM MST Tue Sep 02 2025
 
A 1548z METOP-B ASCAT pass provided solid coverage of Lorena's 
overall wind field with also resulted in a northward adjustment to 
the initial position.  Since the ASCAT pass, GOES-East visible 
imagery continues to show improving overall organization within an 
ideal environment for further strengthening.  Symmetric banding 
features support Dvorak DT numbers of 3.0 and 3.5 from TAFB and SAB, 
respectively. The recent inner core convection bursting with cloud 
tops below -80C further suggest a strengthening trend, even without 
recent microwave imagery to analyze its inner core structure.  The 
initial intensity is set at 45 kt, as a blend of the two operational 
Dvorak estimates, along with other objective intensity estimates.
 
Since the prior advisory, Lorena is moving a bit faster at 13 kt to 
the northwest as its being steered by the southwestern periphery of 
the larger scale mid-level ridge.  With the small northward 
readjustment of position, the northwestward track will continue 
through the next 48 hours, but this brings the center and wind field 
closer to Baja California compared to the prior track forecast.  As 
such, the overall forecast track is a bit faster and shifted north 
and east relative to prior forecast, following trends in the latest 
track guidance.  Due to the uncertainty that Tropical Storm force 
winds may affect areas along the southwestern coasts of Baja 
California Sur, the Government of Mexico has issued Tropical Storm 
Watches from Cabo San Lucas northward to Cabo San Lazaro.  Any 
further deviations north and/or eastward may result in further 
expansion of watches and/or warning conditions over the next 24 to 
48 hours. Deep layer vertical shear and overall decaying
sea-surface environment will slow the forward speed, with slow
recurvature expected after 48 hours west of Baja California Sur.
The shear results in an expanding track forecast suite, though will
continue to prior trends and overall means recurving the cyclone
toward the central Baja California with initial landfall forecast
after 72 hours.  What remains of the circulation will cross the
Peninsula tracking northeast with a second landfall along coastal
Sonora towards the end of the forecast period. 
 
Lorena is expected to remain fairly small inner core, though with 
ample moisture and warm sea-surface temperatures for the next 24 to 
36 h, forecasts are for steady intensification toward hurricane 
status by Wednesday. There is some potential that Lorena may rapidly 
intensify in the short term given its structure and favorable 
environment. As Lorena crosses the 26 C isotherm in 2-3 days, 
vertical wind shear will also increase and the overall intensity 
should start to weaken by late in the week.  As the cyclone turns 
northeastward, slow weakening is expected with eventual dissipation 
over Sonora by Saturday. The intensity forecast is on the higher 
end of the guidance envelope. 
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Heavy rainfall associated with Tropical Storm Lorena will begin
to affect Baja California Sur on Wednesday, and southwestern Sonora
by Thursday. This will increase the risk of life-threatening flash
floods and mudslides, especially in areas of higher terrain.
 
2. Lorena is forecast to approach the Baja California peninsula 
later this week. Due to the uncertainty that Tropical Storm force 
winds may affect areas along the southwestern coasts of Baja 
California Sur, the Government of Mexico has issued Tropical Storm 
Watches from Cabo San Lucas northward to Cabo San Lazaro. Residents 
should closely monitor the latest forecast updates and ensure that 
they have their preparedness plan in place.
