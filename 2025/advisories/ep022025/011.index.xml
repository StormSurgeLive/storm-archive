Tropical Storm Barbara Advisory Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
200 PM MST Tue Jun 10 2025
 
...BARBARA EXPECTED TO BECOME A REMNANT LOW SOON...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM MST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.9N 108.1W
ABOUT 160 MI...255 KM WNW OF CABO CORRIENTES MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 10 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1004 MB...29.65 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Barbara was 
located near latitude 20.9 North, longitude 108.1 West.  Barbara is 
moving toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue through tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Continued weakening is forecast, and Barbara is 
expected to become a remnant low tonight and dissipate on
Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Barbara will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as the southernmost
portions of Baja California Sur through today. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 800 PM MST.

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
800 AM MST Tue Jun 10 2025
 
Conventional satellite imagery and a recent microwave overpass
indicate that Barbara's surface circulation has become exposed to
the north of the convective mass.  Subsequently, northerly shear
appears to be undercutting the outflow aloft.  A burst of cold
cloud tops of -76 C developed just south of the center overnight.
Recent images, however, show the cloud tops have warmed
significantly while the cyclone traverses over a sharp temperature
gradient of SSTs less than 24 C.  The subjective and objective
satellite intensity estimates range from 40 to 65 kt, and as a
compromise, the initial intensity is lowered to 45 kt for this
advisory.
 
Further weakening is expected through the period as the system
continues to move over cooler water and into a more stable and dry
surrounding environment. The official intensity forecast shows
Barbara degenerating to a remnant low in 24 hr and dissipating by
Wednesday night. The NHC intensity forecast is based on the global
models and the IVCN intensity consensus model, and is essentially
an update of the previous forecast.
 
Based on the aforementioned microwave pass, Barbara has been moving
a little to the right and a bit faster than the previous forecast,
and is now moving northwestward, or 315/8 kt.  Barbara should
continue moving toward the northwest through dissipation on
Wednesday. The official track forecast lies between the skilled HCCA
and TVCE consensus aids.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM PDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Cosme was
located near latitude 15.8 North, longitude 115.1 West.  Cosme is
moving toward the north-northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A turn 
toward the north and northeast with an increase in forward speed is 
expected through Wednesday, followed by a turn back to the 
north-northwest on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast, and Cosme is 
expected to degenerate into a remnant low on Wednesday.  The 
remnant low is forecast to dissipate by late Thursday or Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.

      <title>Tropical Storm Cosme Forecast Discussion Number 10</title>

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 PM PDT Tue Jun 10 2025
 
Although Cosme's low-level center is obscured by high-level cirrus, 
it does appear to be displaced a bit to the northeast of the 
remaining deep convection.  Satellite intensity estimates have 
continued to decrease, with objective numbers ranging between 35-45 
kt, and subjective Dvorak CI numbers between 45-55 kt.  The advisory 
intensity is set at 45 kt based on a blend of these numbers.  An 
earlier ASCAT pass showed winds just over 40 kt in the southwestern 
quadrant, but the southeastern quadrant, where there could be 
stronger winds, was not sampled.

ASCAT and recent visible imagery suggest Cosme's center is a little 
west of where it was placed this morning.  Still, the storm has 
turned north-northwestward with an initial motion of 330/3 kt.  
Cosme is expected to turn northward and then northeastward and 
speed up a bit through Wednesday, before turning back to the 
north-northwest on Thursday.  This track will take Cosme over 
progressively cooler waters and into a drier, more stable 
environment.  Combined with moderate-to-strong northeasterly shear, 
these conditions should cause quick weakening, and GFS- and 
ECWMF-based simulated satellite images suggest that Cosme will lose 
its deep convection overnight.  As a result, the NHC official 
forecast shows Cosme becoming a remnant low within 24 hours, with 
dissipation now expected by 60 hours.
