WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Barbara was
located near latitude 16.9 North, longitude 106.0 West. Barbara is
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this
general motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Barbara is forecast to become a hurricane later today. 
Weakening should begin by Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Outer bands of Barbara may bring total rainfall
amounts of 2 to 4 inches to coastal portions of the Mexican states
of Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco through today. This
rainfall may lead to localized areas of flooding and mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Barbara, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Barbara will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND: Gusty winds are likely along coastal areas of southwestern
Mexico during the next day or so.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM MST.

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
900 PM CST Sun Jun 08 2025

After a marked decrease in deep convection a few hours ago, 
thunderstorm activity is now increasing near the center of the 
storm, with a comma-shaped pattern evolving.  A recent GPM 
microwave overpass suggested that the inner core structure is 
becoming a little better defined.  Subjective Dvorak intensity 
estimates are 55 kt from both TAFB and SAB, and this is used for 
the advisory intensity.  This is also in agreement with a blend of 
the various objective intensity estimates based on both 
geostationary and limited microwave imagery.

Although there is some scatter in the center fixes, the overall 
motion appears to be west-northwestward at around 300/9 kt.  
Though some of the track guidance suggests a more northwestward 
motion during the next few days, there should be enough of a ridge 
to the north of Barbara to prevent a significant northward turn 
during the next 48-72 hours.  In fact the GFS model, which appears 
to have the most realistic and about the strongest initialization 
for the system, is on the left side of the guidance envelope.  The 
official forecast has been shifted to the right of the previous one 
based on the model consensus, but leans toward the GFS solution.  By 
72-96 hours, Barbara should be reduced to a remnant low and move 
generally westward following the low-level flow.

Barbara is currently over warm waters within an environment of 
low vertical wind shear and high atmospheric moisture.  These 
factors should result in the cyclone strengthening into a hurricane 
very soon, and the NHC prediction is above almost all of the 
guidance.  In a day or so, cooler SSTs are expected to cause a 
weakening trend to begin.  The model guidance is in good agreement 
on Barbara weakening into a tropical depression in 60-72 hours, and 
this is also shown in the official forecast.

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
800 PM MST Sun Jun 08 2025

Cosme is gradually improving in organization with deep convection 
pulsing, albeit with the center on the northern edge of the 
convection.  A recent microwave pass did show a prominent curved 
band especially in the southern semicircle of the storm.  The 
initial wind speed will stay at 40 kt for this advisory, between 
the lower subjective Dvorak estimates and higher objective values.  

Conditions look conducive for strengthening for about the next 24 
hours while Cosme moves within a fairly low shear and warm SST 
environment.  Thereafter, some increase in easterly shear is 
possible, and the storm should move over a tight SST gradient into a 
drier airmass.  Cosme is forecast to respond to these conditions by 
weakening quickly by midweek.  The only change to the previous 
forecast is a small reduction in the intensity forecast at 60 and 72 
h, consistent with the latest model consensus.  It would not be 
surprising to see Cosme become a remnant low faster than shown 
below.

The storm continues moving northwestward at 8 kt, and a 
west-northwest to northwest motion is anticipated during the next 
day or so.  After that time, Tropical Storm Barbara causes a
mid-level ridge to erode, and Cosme should respond by taking a 
sharp turn to the northeast around Barbara.  Model guidance has 
shifted notably to the left this evening, suggesting a 
little more separation of the tropical cyclones before they 
interact.  While the new forecast is adjusted to the west, this is 
not a particularly confident longer-range forecast due to 
the complexity of the interaction.
