Tropical Storm Barbara Advisory Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
200 AM MST Tue Jun 10 2025
 
...BARBARA CONTINUES TO WEAKEN OFFSHORE OF WEST-CENTRAL MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM MST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.1N 108.1W
ABOUT 180 MI...290 KM WSW OF CABO CORRIENTES MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Barbara was
located near latitude 19.1 North, longitude 108.1 West. Barbara is
moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h) and this general 
motion is expected to continue for the next day or so.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Continued weakening is forecast, and Barbara is 
expected to dissipate by Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Barbara will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as the southernmost
portions of Baja California through today. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM MST.

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
200 AM MST Tue Jun 10 2025

Barbara has lost a significant portion of its convection over the 
past 12 hours or so.  The latest current intensity estimates from 
TAFB and SAB are still in the 55-65 kt range, but the latest 
objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS are in the 45-55 kt 
range.  Based on the degraded convective appearance on geostationary 
satellite imagery and the latest intensity estimates, the initial 
intensity is set to 50 kt.

Barbara has been moving toward the northwest a little slower than 
before, or 310/7 kt.  Barbara is forecast to continue moving 
generally toward the northwest as it is steered by weak ridging to 
its north and Tropical Storm Cosme, located to its southwest.  Only 
very minor adjustments have been made to the previous NHC track 
forecast, which lies near the various consensus models.

The storm already has crossed the 26C isotherm and will continue 
moving over progressively colder water over the next day.  The cold 
water will cause Barbara to continue weakening.  The NHC intensity 
forecast shows a slightly faster rate of weakening than the previous 
official forecast, and is near the latest intensity model consensus. 
 The GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite products both show the 
cyclone losing its convection entirely by about 24 hours, with 
dissipation in 36 hours.  The NHC forecast follows the scenario 
depicted by those models.

...COSME COULD STILL BECOME A HURRICANE OVERNIGHT BEFORE WEAKENING 
BEGINS LATER ON TUESDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 PM MST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.2N 114.2W
ABOUT 600 MI...965 KM SSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...70 MPH...110 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 315 DEGREES AT 3 MPH...6 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...992 MB...29.30 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM MST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Cosme was
located near latitude 15.2 North, longitude 114.2 West. Cosme is
moving toward the northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A turn toward the 
north is expected by early Tuesday, followed by a faster 
north-northeast motion late Tuesday through Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Cosme could still become a hurricane overnight before 
weakening begins later on Tuesday.  Cosme is forecast to become a 
post-tropical remnant low in a couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

      <title>Tropical Storm Cosme Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
800 PM MST Mon Jun 09 2025

Cosme remains at the threshold of hurricane strength.  Convection 
continues to be potent south and east of the center, though it is 
weak on the northwestern side.  Unfortunately there haven't been any 
recent microwave passes to assess the inner-core structure.  Since 
the latest blend of objective and subjective satellite intensity 
estimates remains near 60 kt, that value will be kept as the 
initial wind speed.  

Cosme is moving along a thermal ridge in the SSTs, and it still 
could become a hurricane overnight before reaching less favorable 
conditions tomorrow morning.  Steady or rapid weakening is probable 
by late Tuesday due to a combination of decreasing SSTs and 
intrusions of dry/stable air.  The tropical cyclone should lose all 
convection early on Wednesday and become a remnant low between 36 
and 48 h.  No significant changes were made on this advisory to the 
intensity forecast.
 
The storm has slowed down, only moving northwestward at 3 kt, and 
this general motion should continue through tonight. After that 
time, a turn to the north-northeast is expected as Cosme moves 
toward a weakness left behind by Hurricane Barbara to its northeast. 
 The NHC track forecast is basically an update of the previous one, 
near or a smidge left of the consensus aids.
