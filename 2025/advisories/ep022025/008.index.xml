...BARBARA NOW A TROPICAL STORM...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 PM MST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.7N 107.8W
ABOUT 230 MI...370 KM W OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...70 MPH...110 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...993 MB...29.33 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM MST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Barbara was
located near latitude 18.7 North, longitude 107.8 West.  Barbara is
moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected during the next day or so followed by a gradual 
westward turn.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Continued weakening is forecast, and the 
system is forecast to become a remnant low by Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 993 mb (29.33 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Barbara will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico during the next day or so.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM MST.

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
800 PM MST Mon Jun 09 2025
 
Barbara has been gradually decreasing in organization since earlier 
today.  Deep convection is rather fragmented with limited banding 
features.  Although thunderstorm activity could temporarily 
increase tonight after the diurnal minimum, overall the system 
appears to be on a weakening trend.  All of the objective intensity 
estimates are now below hurricane strength.  A blend of subjective 
Dvorak T- and C.I. numbers from TAFB gives about a 60-kt intensity 
estimate, which is used for this advisory.

The cyclone continues on a northwestward track with a motion of 
around 310/10 kt.  A weak mid-level ridge to the north of Barbara 
should maintain this northwestward motion for a while, albeit with 
some decrease in forward speed.  In 36-48 hours, the system should 
become a remnant low and turn westward following the shallow-layer 
flow.  The official track forecast is roughly in the middle of the 
divergent track guidance and a little to the left of the previous 
NHC track.  This is between the GFS and ECMWF solutions.

The storm is crossing a gradient of sea surface temperatures and 
headed for cooler waters and a drier, more stable environment.  
Therefore continued weakening is likely, and Barbara is expected to 
become a remnant low in 36 hours.  The official forecast 
is below the LGEM guidance but above the dynamical models, which 
suggest that the system will dissipate sooner than indicated here.

located near latitude 15.2 North, longitude 114.2 West. Cosme is
moving toward the northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A turn toward the 
north is expected by early Tuesday, followed by a faster 
north-northeast motion late Tuesday through Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Cosme could still become a hurricane overnight before 
weakening begins later on Tuesday.  Cosme is forecast to become a 
post-tropical remnant low in a couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM MST.

      <title>Tropical Storm Cosme Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
800 PM MST Mon Jun 09 2025

Cosme remains at the threshold of hurricane strength.  Convection 
continues to be potent south and east of the center, though it is 
weak on the northwestern side.  Unfortunately there haven't been any 
recent microwave passes to assess the inner-core structure.  Since 
the latest blend of objective and subjective satellite intensity 
estimates remains near 60 kt, that value will be kept as the 
initial wind speed.  

Cosme is moving along a thermal ridge in the SSTs, and it still 
could become a hurricane overnight before reaching less favorable 
conditions tomorrow morning.  Steady or rapid weakening is probable 
by late Tuesday due to a combination of decreasing SSTs and 
intrusions of dry/stable air.  The tropical cyclone should lose all 
convection early on Wednesday and become a remnant low between 36 
and 48 h.  No significant changes were made on this advisory to the 
intensity forecast.
 
The storm has slowed down, only moving northwestward at 3 kt, and 
this general motion should continue through tonight. After that 
time, a turn to the north-northeast is expected as Cosme moves 
toward a weakness left behind by Hurricane Barbara to its northeast. 
 The NHC track forecast is basically an update of the previous one, 
near or a smidge left of the consensus aids.
