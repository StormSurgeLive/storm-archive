Tropical Storm Barbara Advisory Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
300 PM CST Sun Jun 08 2025
 
...BARBARA MOVING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM CST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.0N 104.1W
ABOUT 205 MI...325 KM SW OF ZIHUATANEJO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...996 MB...29.42 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Barbara was
located near latitude 16.0 North, longitude 104.1 West. Barbara is
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this
motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days. A turn
toward the west at a slower forward speed is anticipated on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Strengthening is expected during the next day or so, and Barbara is 
forecast to become a hurricane overnight.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: RAINFALL: Outer bands of Barbara may bring total rainfall
amounts of 2 to 4 inches to coastal portions of the Mexican states
of Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco through Monday. This
rainfall may lead to localized areas of flooding and mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Barbara, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Barbara will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND: Gusty winds are likely along coastal areas of southwestern
Mexico.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM CST.

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
900 AM CST Sun Jun 08 2025
 
Barbara continues to become better organized this morning with deep 
convection bursting near the low-level center. Earlier AMSR2 
microwave imagery depicts improved curved banding with an inner core 
in the formative stage.  This structure has led to an improved 
satellite depiction and intensification. Subjective and objective 
intensity estimates have continued to increase this morning, using a 
blend of these estimates the intensity is set to 50 kt for this 
advisory.

The system is currently within a favorable environment with warm sea 
surface temperatures and low vertical wind shear. Further 
strengthening is forecast over the next day or so, and this could 
occur rather quickly given the small inner core of Barbara. The 
latest NHC intensity forecast has increased slightly form the 
previous one and shows Barbara becoming a hurricane in 12 hrs. 
However, there are some intensity aids that are a little higher than 
the NHC forecast, including some explicitly forecasting Rapid 
Intensification (RI). RI is possible, and this is something we will 
have to monitor over the succeeding forecasts. After 24-36 hrs, the 
system will be moving over cooler waters and into a drier mid-level 
environment. These factors will cause the system to weaken and 
eventually struggle to produce convection. Global model infrared 
simulated satellite images depicts the system losing convection by 
72 h. By day 4, the system should degenerate into a remnant low, and 
dissipate by day 5 as it interacts with the circulation of TD 
Three-E.

Barbara is moving west-northwestward (295/10 kt) on the south side 
of a mid-level ridge, and this motion should continue over the next 
couple of days. The NHC forecast is near the previous one and 
lies close to the simple and corrected consensus aids. Given the 
forecast track and wind radii, tropical-storm-force winds are not 
expected to affect the southwestern coast of Mexico. By Tuesday, the 
track forecast becomes more complicated given the potential for 
binary interaction between Barbara and TD Three-E. Because of this, 
the long-range track forecast could be subject to large future 
adjustments depending on the evolution of TD Three-E.

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 PM MST Sun Jun 08 2025
 
Deep convection has been increasing near the center and in curved
bands on the western side of the circulation during the past
several hours. An ASCAT-C pass from a few hours ago showed peak
winds in the 35-40 kt range, and based on that data, the depression
has been upgraded to Tropical Storm Cosme with the initial
intensity set at 40 kt.
 
Cosme will likely continue to strengthen for the next day or two as
it remains in an environment of low to moderate wind shear, abundant
moisture, and over warm SSTs. The NHC intensity forecast shows a
peak of 60 kt at 24 and 36 hours, and it wouldn't be surprising if
Cosme becomes a hurricane during that time frame. By mid-week,
however, the storm is expected to move over progressively cooler
waters and into a drier airmass, which should cause the system to
begin weakening. Cosme is now forecast to become a remnant low in 3
days and dissipate in 4 days.

The storm is moving northwestward at 7 kt, and that general motion 
is expected to continue during the next couple of days.  After that 
time, the interaction with Barbara will likely result in an initial 
slow down and then turn to the northeast. There is a fair amount of 
spread in the guidance due to the complexity of this interaction.  
The NHC track forecast has been adjusted a little to the right of 
the previous one to account for the initial motion/position and to 
be in better agreement with the latest consensus aids.
