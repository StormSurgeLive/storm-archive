...BARBARA STRENGTHENING...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM CST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.7N 103.1W
ABOUT 170 MI...275 KM SW OF ZIHUATANEJO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...996 MB...29.42 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM CST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Barbara was 
located near latitude 15.7 North, longitude 103.1 West. Barbara is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this 
motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days. A turn 
toward the west at a slower forward speed is anticipated on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Additional strengthening is expected during the next 
day or so, and Barbara is forecast to become a hurricane later 
tonight.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches, with localized amounts
up to 6 inches, are possible across portions of the Mexican states
of Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima, and Jalisco through Monday. This
rainfall may lead to areas of flooding and mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Barbara, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Barbara will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND: Gusty winds are likely along coastal areas of southwestern
Mexico.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM CST.

Tropical Depression Three-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
800 AM MST Sun Jun 08 2025

Showers and thunderstorms associated with the area of low pressure 
well southwest of the coast of southwestern Mexico have shown 
considerable improvement this morning. Well-organized curved bands 
have been present during the last 6-12 hours with deep convection 
building near the low-level center. The latest subjective Dvorak 
intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB came in at 1.5/25 kt and 
2.0/30 kt, respectively. Additionally, overnight satellite-derived 
wind data showed 30 kt winds in the northwest quadrant of the low 
pressure area. Given the improved convective organization and data 
suggesting maximum sustained winds of 30 kt, Tropical Depression 
Three-E has now formed with the initial intensity set at 30 kt. 

The initial motion of Tropical Depression Three-E is set at 310/07 
kt. This general motion is expected to continue today and tonight, 
followed by a much more uncertain motion Monday through mid-week due 
to the expected interaction with Tropical Storm Barbara. This 
interaction will likely result in a decrease in forward speed and a 
more northward to northeastward motion on Monday, followed by an 
increase in forward speed and a shift back to the northwest by 
Tuesday. The track forecast generally follows the consensus 
guidance, which is in between the two extremes of the GFS and ECMWF 
models.

Tropical Depression Three-E is forecast to remain in a low to 
moderate vertical wind shear environment with warm sea surface 
temperatures of 27 to 28C and abundant deep layer moisture during 
the next couple days. This should allow for steady strengthening, 
and the system will likely become a tropical storm later today. By 
Monday night, the tropical cyclone will begin to move over much 
cooler water below 26C, and this in combination with the interaction 
with Barbara should result in rather rapid weakening, with the 
system becoming a post-tropical remnant low by Thursday morning. The 
intensity forecast is roughly a split of the statistical and 
dynamical consensus guidance.
