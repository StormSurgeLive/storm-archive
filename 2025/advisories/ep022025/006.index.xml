...BARBARA BECOMES THE FIRST HURRICANE OF THE EAST PACIFIC
HURRICANE SEASON...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM MST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.6N 106.1W
ABOUT 155 MI...245 KM SW OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...991 MB...29.27 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Barbara was
located near latitude 17.6 North, longitude 106.1 West. Barbara is
moving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h) and this general
motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some slight additional strengthening is possible today, but
a weakening trend is forecast to begin on Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.27 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Barbara will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND: Gusty winds are likely along coastal areas of southwestern
Mexico during the next day or so.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

Hurricane Barbara Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
800 AM MST Mon Jun 09 2025
 
Barbara has become better organized as depicted in an earlier AMSR2 
microwave pass, which shows the low-level center tucked under a 
large central dense overcast. The microwave imagery also indicates 
that a partial eyewall has formed, although it was open on the 
northern side. The latest subjective Dvorak estimate from TAFB was 
T4.0/65 kt, and the objective satellite intensity aids from UW-CIMSS 
range from 55-65 kt. Using a blend of these estimates, the initial 
intensity is increased to 65 kt for this advisory. This makes 
Barbara the first hurricane of the 2025 east Pacific hurricane 
season.
 
The storm is estimated to be moving more northwestward at 310/9 kt. 
Barbara continues to be steered by a mid-level ridge located over 
Mexico and it should continue to move northwestward over the next 
few days. The GFS and ECMWF models continue to be on opposite sides 
of the guidance envelope, and this is mainly due to differences in 
when Barbara weakens and becomes steered by the low-level wind flow. 
The latest NHC track forecast was shifted slightly to the right, 
closer to the simple and corrected consensus.
 
Barbara is likely near its peak intensity, as it only has about 6-12 
more hours of a favorable environment. Along the forecast track, the 
system will be crossing over increasingly cooler sea surface 
temperatures overnight. Around the same time, the mid-level relative 
humidity values will begin to drop. This will cause the system to 
steadily weaken and lose convective organization. The storm is now 
forecast to become post-tropical in 36 h, and dissipate into an open 
trough by 60 h.

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
800 AM MST Mon Jun 09 2025
 
Cosme continues to become better organized this morning, with a 
recent 0936Z/GPM pass indicating a partially closed eyewall 
structure. The most recent subjective Dvorak intensity estimates 
from TAFB and SAB were both T3.5/55 kt. Meanwhile, the objective 
satellite estimates range from 48 to 61 knots. Given the improved 
structure noted in microwave imagery, along with a blend of the 
objective and subjective intensity estimates, the initial intensity 
for this advisory has been increased to 55 kt.

Cosme is moving toward the west-northwest at 6 kt, and this general 
motion is expected to continue today. A turn toward the north and a 
slowing in forward speed is expected tonight, as Barbara erodes the 
mid-level ridge to the north of Cosme. A turn toward the 
north-northeast with an increase in forward speed is forecast 
Tuesday through Wednesday as Cosme is swept northward into the break 
in the mid-level ridge created by Barbara. The latest track forecast 
is very close to that of the previous advisory and is generally a 
blend of the consensus guidance.

Environmental conditions appear conducive for strengthening 
during the next 12 hours or so. Vertical wind shear is forecast to 
decrease, while water temperatures hold around 27/28C, and deep 
layer atmospheric moisture remains high. As a result, the official 
forecast calls for Cosme to become a hurricane later today. Little 
change in strength is then forecast tonight and Tuesday despite 
Cosme remaining over warm water, as increasing vertical wind shear 
and gradually decreasing deep-layer moisture should inhibit further 
intensification. Beginning Tuesday night and Wednesday, a more rapid 
weakening is forecast as the system moves over much cooler water, 
with Cosme expected to dissipate by 96 hours.
