DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Two was
located near latitude 19.7 North, longitude 95.1 West. The
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h) 
and this general motion is expected to continue for the next day or 
two. On the forecast track, the depression is expected to make 
landfall along the Mexico coast Sunday night and move further 
inland on Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some intensification is expected over the next day or so, and
the depression is forecast to become a tropical storm before
reaching the coast of Mexico.  Weakening is expected after 
landfall, and the system is forecast to dissipate over eastern 
Mexico on Monday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1011 mb (29.86 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Two can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO
header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Two is expected to produce rainfall 
totals of 3 to 6 inches, with maximum totals of 10 inches possible 
across the Mexican states of Veracruz, San Luis Potosi, and 
Tamaulipas.  This rainfall may produce life-threatening flooding and 
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Potential Tropical Cyclone Two, please see the 
National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical Storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm
warning area beginning Sunday afternoon.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 AM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

Tropical Depression Two Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022025
1000 PM CDT Sat Jun 28 2025

Tropical Depression Two is poorly organized at this time. During 
the latter part of the Hurricane Hunter Mission this afternoon, the 
aircraft was unable to close off the circulation. Since that time, 
conventional satellite imagery and 2235 UTC SSM/IS overpass show 
little change in organization, although surface observations 
suggest the circulation is still closed. The initial intensity is 
held at 25 kt in agreement with current satellite intensity 
estimates.

The initial motion is a somewhat uncertain 295/7. The subtropical 
ridge to the east and northeast of the cyclone should steer the 
system generally west-northwestward for the next couple of days, 
bringing the center to the eastern coast of Mexico near the 24 h 
point.  There is little change in either the track guidance or the 
track forecast since the last advisory.  It should be noted that 
some erratic motion could occur as the circulation interacts with 
the coast of Mexico. 

The cyclone is experiencing 20-25 kt of southwesterly vertical 
shear. However, the upper-level winds are divergent, which should 
allow the system to produce significant convection.  It is expected 
that this convection will lead to a little strengthening despite 
the shear, and based on this the depression is forecast to become a 
tropical storm near the time of landfall.  After landfall, the 
cyclone is expected to rapidly weaken over eastern Mexico.
 
Given the forecast for the depression to become a tropical storm
before landfall, a Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for a 
portion of their eastern Gulf coastline of Mexico.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected on Sunday for portions of
the Gulf coast of Mexico where a Tropical Storm Warning is in
effect.
 
2. Tropical Depression Two will produce heavy rainfall across 
portions of northeastern Mexico. Life-threatening flooding and 
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain, are possible.
