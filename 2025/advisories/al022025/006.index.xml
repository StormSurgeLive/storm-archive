WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warning from Boca de Catan southward to Tecolutla.
 
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Barry
was located just inland near latitude 22.0 North, longitude 97.8 
West.  The depression is moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 
km/h) and this general motion is expected to continue through 
tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Continued weakening is forecast, and Barry 
should dissipate over eastern Mexico on Monday.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Barry can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO
header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Barry or its remnant is expected to produce rainfall 
totals of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 10 inches, 
across portions of the Mexican states of Veracruz, San Luis Potosi, 
and Tamaulipas through Monday.  This rainfall may produce 
life-threatening flooding and mudslides, especially in areas of 
steep terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Barry, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at

Tropical Depression Barry Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022025
1000 PM CDT Sun Jun 29 2025

Satellite and radar imagery show that Barry became less defined 
over the past several hours, and this has made the center 
difficult to locate.  It is estimated that the system made 
landfall an hour or two ago, to the south of Tampico Mexico.  Deep 
convection associated with the cyclone has diminished since earlier 
today.  Strong westerly shear has apparently caused the system to 
weaken to a depression by the time it reached the coast.  The 
current intensity estimate is set to 30 kt, which is in agreement 
with a Dvorak T-number from TAFB. 

Barry's initial motion estimate is still northwestward, or 320/8 
kt, while being steered by the flow to the west of a high pressure 
system over the central Gulf. This general motion is likely to 
continue for the next 12-24 hours, taking the system farther 
inland.  Barry should dissipate over the mountainous terrain of 
Mexico on Monday.
 
The primary impact with Barry remains heavy rainfall and flash
flooding for the upslope areas of eastern Mexico. Please see the
latest forecast rainfall graphic from the Weather Prediction Center
International Desk for more information.
 
Key Message:
 
1. Barry or its remnants will produce heavy rainfall across 
portions of northeastern Mexico through Monday. Life-threatening 
flooding and mudslides are possible, particularly in areas of steep 
terrain.
