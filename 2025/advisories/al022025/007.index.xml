WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the remnants of Barry were located near
latitude 23.0 North, longitude 99.2 West. The remnants are moving
toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

RAINFALL: The remnants of Barry are expected to produce additional 
rainfall totals of 3 to 5 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 8 
inches, across portions of the Mexican states of San Luis Potosi and 
Tamaulipas through today. This rainfall may produce life-threatening 
flooding and mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain.

Remnants Of Barry Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022025
400 AM CDT Mon Jun 30 2025
 
Barry made landfall around 0100 UTC just south of Tampico, Mexico.
The intensity at landfall is uncertain, but it was likely around 30
or 35 kt when the center reached the coast. Since moving inland,
satellite images and surface observations indicate that the
low-level circulation has dissipated over the rugged terrain of
eastern Mexico. Therefore, Barry is no longer a tropical cyclone and
this is the last NHC advisory.
 
Although the associated deep convection has decreased, there are
still some small clusters of heavy rain. In fact, radar images show
a mesoscale convective vortex over eastern Mexico associated with
Barry's remaining mid-level circulation. The remnants of Barry will
likely continue to produce heavy rainfall over portions of
northeastern Mexico throughout the day, potentially causing flooding
and mudslides.
