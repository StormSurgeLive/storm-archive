DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Barry was 
located by aircraft near latitude 20.4 North, longitude 96.2 West. 
Barry is moving toward the northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this 
motion is expected to continue today. On the forecast track, the 
storm is expected to make landfall and then move inland over eastern 
Mexico later today or tonight.
 
Air Force Reconnaissance data indicates that maximum sustained
winds have increase to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. A
little more intensification is forecast before the system reaches
the coast of eastern Mexico. Rapid weakening is expected after the
system moves inland.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Reserve
Reconnaissance dropsonde data is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Barry can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO
header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Barry is expected to produce rainfall
totals of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 10 inches,
across the Mexican states of Veracruz, San Luis Potosi, and
Tamaulipas through Monday. This rainfall may produce
life-threatening flooding and mudslides, especially in areas of
steep terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Tropical Storm Barry, please see the National
Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions, especially in gusts, are expected
in the tropical storm warning area beginning this afternoon.

Tropical Depression Two Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022025
400 AM CDT Sun Jun 29 2025
 
The Air Force Hurricane Hunters have been investigating the
depression over the Bay of Campeche this morning and found that the
system is quite disorganized.  In fact, the depression may not even
have a well-defined circulation.  Even though the structure of the
system is poorly organized, the aircraft data and ship observations
indicate that the winds have increased some.  Based on that
information, the initial intensity is nudged upward to 30 kt.
 
The depression has been moving a little to the south of the previous
forecast, and the latest initial motion estimate is 290/8 kt.  The
system is expected to turn northwestward later today as it tracks
along the western periphery of a low- to mid-level ridge.  This
motion should take the cyclone inland over eastern Mexico late today
or tonight.  Most of the strong winds are expected to occur to the
north of the center along the coast within the tropical storm
warning area this afternoon through early Monday.
 
Some slight additional strengthening is possible before the system
moves inland.  However, none of the models show much intensification
and given the poor initial structure and limited time over water,
significant strengthening seems highly unlikely.  The system is
expected to dissipate over the rugged terrain of eastern Mexico on
Monday.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical Depression Two will produce heavy rainfall across
portions of northeastern Mexico.  Life-threatening flooding and
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain, are possible.

2. Tropical storm conditions, especially in gusts, are expected
later today and tonight over portions of eastern Mexico in the
tropical storm warning area.
