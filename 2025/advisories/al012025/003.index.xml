DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone 
Andrea was located near latitude 38.7 North, longitude 45.2 West. 
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east-northeast near 
20 mph (31 km/h) and this motion is expected to continue until the

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) with
higher gusts. Additional weakening is expected and the remnant low
is expected to degenerate into a trough l.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1015 mb (29.98 inches).

Post-Tropical Cyclone Andrea Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL012025
1100 PM AST Tue Jun 24 2025
 
Andrea is now a remnant low. The system has lacked deep convection
since earlier this morning and is unlikely to redevelop any while
traversing increasingly cold sea-surface temperatures, strong
northeasterly vertical wind shear, and very dry mid-level air.
Therefore, this will be the final advisory on Andrea. Scatterometer
data received after the last advisory also indicates winds have
decreased to about 30 kt. The remnant low should continue to spin
down, with the various global and regional model guidance showing
the circulation opening up into a surface trough in about 24 hours.
 
The initial motion is 060/17 kt. This motion is expected to continue
until the remnant low dissipates. Additional information on this
system can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National
Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01
KWBC, and online at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
