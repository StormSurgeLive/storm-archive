DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jerry was
located near latitude 12.2 North, longitude 47.5 West. Jerry is
moving toward the west near 23 mph (37 km/h). A decrease in forward 
speed and a turn to the west-northwest is expected during the next 
couple of days.  On the forecast track, the core of the system is 
expected to be near or to the north of the northern Leeward Islands 
late Thursday and Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts. Steady strengthening is forecast, and Jerry is expected to 
become a hurricane in a day or so.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Jerry can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header
WTNT45 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible in portions of the
northern Leeward Islands late Thursday and Friday, where Tropical
Storm Watches have been issued.
 
RAINFALL: On Thursday, 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected across the
Leeward Islands due to Jerry. This rainfall brings a risk of flash
flooding, especially in areas of higher terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Priscilla, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_al5.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Jerry are expected to reach the Leeward
Islands on Thursday.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found

Tropical Storm Jerry Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102025
500 PM AST Tue Oct 07 2025
 
Jerry continues to produce bands of deep convection around the
center, with the strongest winds likely still occurring on the north
and east sides of the circulation.  The storm remain far from land,
roughly 900 miles east of the Windward Islands.  All of the
satellite intensity estimates have increased, and most of them are
around 45 kt.  Based on that data, the initial intensity is
increased to that value.  Both the NOAA and Air Force Hurricane
Hunters are scheduled to investigate Jerry tomorrow.
 
Jerry continues to move quickly westward at about 20 kt on the
south-southwest side of a strong subtropical ridge.  The models
insist that a turn to the west-northwest should occur soon with a
gradual reduction in forward speed expected over the next couple of
days as the storm nears the southwestern side of the ridge.  This
motion should take the core of Jerry near or to the north of the
northern Leeward Islands late Thursday and Friday.  The
best-performing models show the core of Jerry missing the northern
Leeward Islands, however, there are some GFS, ECMWF, and Google Deep
Mind ensemble members that pass very near or over the islands.
Therefore, interests there and in the Virgin Islands should monitor
the system's progress as details in the forward speed of the storm
and strength of the ridge will be the main factors determining how
close Jerry gets to the islands. By the weekend, a turn to the
north is forecast as the ridge weakens and shifts eastward due to a
large-scale trough amplifying over the western Atlantic. The NHC
track forecast remains on the fast side of the guidance through 72
hours, as models often have a slow bias in the tropical Atlantic.
This prediction is slightly left of the previous one, and in best
agreement with HCCA model.
 
The storm is forecast to continue to strengthen during the next
couple of days as it remains in conducive environmental conditions
of light winds aloft, abundant moisture, and over warm waters. Given
the favorable conditions, the GFS- and ECMWF-based SHIPS model show
that there is about 20 percent chance of rapid intensification
occurring during the next day or two. The NHC intensity forecast
continues to show Jerry becoming a hurricane in a day or so, with
additional intensification expected after that.  After the system
passes by the islands, most of the models show some increase in
shear, which should end the strengthening trend.  The NHC intensity
forecast is slightly higher than the previous one and in general
agreement with HCCA and IVCN.
 
Based on the forecast and the uncertainties, Tropical Storm
Watches have been issued for portions of the northern Leeward
Islands.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Jerry is forecast to strengthen and could bring tropical storm
conditions to portions of the northern Leeward Islands, where
Tropical Storm Watches have been issued.
 
2. Heavy rainfall will impact portions of the Leeward Islands on 
Thursday, which could result in flash flooding, particularly in 
areas of higher terrain.
