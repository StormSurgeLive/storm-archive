DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jerry was
located near latitude 14.3 North, longitude 53.7 West.  Jerry is
moving toward the west-northwest near 23 mph (37 km/h), and this
general motion is expected to continue through early Thursday.  A
turn toward the northwest and then north at a slower forward speed
is expected late Thursday into Saturday.  On the forecast track,
the center of Jerry is expected to pass near or to the northeast of
the northern Leeward Islands late Thursday and Thursday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual strengthening is forecast during the next few days, 
and Jerry could become a hurricane by the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.  Jerry's center passed just to the south of NOAA 
buoy 41040, which measured a sustained wind of 47 mph (76 km/h) and 
a gust to 54 mph (86 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on data from NOAA 
buoy 41010 is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Jerry can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header
WTNT45 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible in portions of the
northern Leeward Islands within the watch area late Thursday into
Friday.
 
RAINFALL: On Thursday into early Friday, 2 to 4 inches of rain with
local storm total maxima to 6 inches are expected across the Leeward
Islands, British Virgin Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands from
Thursday into Saturday morning due to Jerry. This rainfall brings a
risk of flash flooding, especially in areas of steep terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Jerry, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Jerry are expected to reach the Leeward
and Windward Islands on Thursday, then spread westward toward the
Greater Antilles on Friday. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States, including
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, can be found at:

Tropical Storm Jerry Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102025
1100 AM AST Wed Oct 08 2025
 
Jerry is a sheared tropical cyclone this morning, with the low-level
center racing out ahead of the associated deep convection.  Despite
this structure, a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft measured a peak
700-mb wind of 56 kt, and Tail-Doppler radar data showed winds of
around 75 kt at 500 meters above the surface.  Even using a
conservative reduction factor for this data of 70 percent yields 
surface winds of about 50 kt.  Recent ASCAT data also confirm that 
the initial intensity is about 50 kt.
 
Jerry remains on a quick west-northwestward trajectory (285/20 kt),
steered by a low- to mid-level ridge to the north.  The ridge only
extends as far west as the longitude of the Lesser Antilles, and
the weakness to the west is expected to cause Jerry to turn
northwestward by 36 hours, with the center potentially passing only
60-70 n mi northeast of the northern Leeward Islands.  The NHC track
forecast is along the western side of the guidance envelope during
the first 36 hours of the forecast.  After 36 hours, the track
guidance has trended a bit to the east, showing a sharper
recurvature over the central Atlantic resulting from a large
extratropical cyclone that is expected to develop near the U.S.
east coast over the weekend.
 
Jerry is moving directly against the analyzed shear vector, and
vertical model soundings suggest this orientation may not change
any time soon.  It's becoming more likely that Jerry may remain a
sheared tropical storm for the next few days, and the intensity
guidance has responded accordingly.  The updated NHC forecast still
shows the possibility of gradual strengthening through 60-72 hours,
however the peak has been lowered by about 10 kt.  It's worth
noting that only two of the reliable models, the HWRF and
COAMPS-TC, are still higher than the official forecast, and the
IVCN and HCCA consensus aids suggest additional decreases in the
forecast intensity could be possible in future advisories.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Jerry could bring tropical storm conditions to portions of the
northern Leeward Islands late Thursday and Thursday night.
 
2. Heavy rainfall will impact portions of the Leeward Islands,
British Virgin Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands from Thursday into
Saturday morning, which could result in flash flooding, particularly
in areas of steep terrain.
