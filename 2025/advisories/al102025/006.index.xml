DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jerry was 
located near latitude 14.8 North, longitude 54.7 West.  Jerry is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 23 mph (37 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue through Thursday.  A 
northwestward motion at a slower forward speed should begin Thursday 
night, followed by a northward motion Friday night and Saturday.   
On the forecast track, the center of Jerry is expected to pass near 
or to the northeast of the northern Leeward Islands late Thursday 
and Thursday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is forecast during the next few days, and 
Jerry could become a hurricane late this week or this weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Jerry can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header
WTNT45 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible in portions of the
northern Leeward Islands within the watch area late Thursday into
Friday.
 
RAINFALL: On Thursday into early Friday, 2 to 4 inches of rain with 
local storm total maxima to 6 inches are expected across the Leeward 
Islands, British Virgin Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands from 
Thursday into Saturday morning due to Jerry. This rainfall brings a 
risk of flash flooding, especially in areas of steep terrain.  

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Jerry, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Jerry are expected to reach the Leeward
and Windward Islands on Thursday, then spread westward toward the
Greater Antilles on Friday. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States, including
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, can be found at:
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

      <title>Tropical Storm Jerry Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Jerry Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102025
500 PM AST Wed Oct 08 2025
 
Despite Jerry's significantly sheared structure, the storm's 
maximum winds are solidly at 50 kt.  An Air Force Reserve Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft measured a maximum 5000 ft flight-level wind of 63 
kt, which reduces to an intensity of 50 kt.  In addition, Jerry's 
center passed just south of NOAA buoy 41010, which measured a 
1-minute sustained wind of 47 kt a few hours ago.  The buoy's 
pressure and wind data suggest that Jerry's central pressure is down 
to about 1000 mb.

Jerry is still moving quickly west-northwestward at 20 kt, but the 
heading has turned slightly to 290 degrees.  There's not much 
change to the forecast track thinking compared to this morning.  
Jerry should move around the southwestern and western periphery of 
an eastern/central Atlantic ridge over the next few days, with the 
storm turning northwestward by Thursday night and then northward by 
Friday night.  The bulk of the track models agree on Jerry's center 
passing between 60-120 n mi northeast of the northern Leeward 
Islands late Thursday.  The HMON and HAFS hurricane models bring 
the center a bit closer than that, but at this time those are not 
considered the most likely scenario.  Later in the weekend and 
early next week, Jerry is forecast to turn north-northeastward and 
then northeastward, and the bulk of the guidance also moves the 
storm safely to the southeast of Bermuda in about 4 days.  As 
always, it's a good idea to continue monitoring future forecasts 
since model scenarios can change, and NHC track forecasts at day 4 
typically have an average error of 130 n mi.
 
Moderate to strong northwesterly shear appears likely to continue 
for the next few days.  At the same time, Jerry's winds are higher 
than the satellite appearance would suggest, and warm waters and a 
moist, unstable environment could still allow for gradual 
strengthening.  The NHC intensity forecast is not too different 
from this morning, bringing Jerry to hurricane strength by Friday 
when there could be a slight decrease in shear magnitude.  That 
said, there is quite a bit of spread in the intensity guidance, and 
the NHC forecast is generally between the IVCN and HCCA consensus 
aids.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Jerry could bring tropical storm conditions to portions of the
northern Leeward Islands late Thursday and Thursday night.
 
2. Heavy rainfall will impact portions of the Leeward Islands, 
British Virgin Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands from Thursday into 
Saturday morning, which could result in flash flooding, particularly 
in areas of steep terrain.
