* Antigua, Anguilla, St. Kitts, Nevis, and Montserrat
* St. Barthelemy and St. Martin
* Sint Maarten
* Saba and St. Eustatius
* Guadeloupe and the adjacent islands
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within 12
hours.

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the northern Leeward Islands and the
British and U.S. Virgin Islands should monitor the progress of
Jerry.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jerry was 
located near latitude 15.9 North, longitude 59.1 West. Jerry is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 18 mph (30 km/h). A turn 
toward the northwest is expected late today, followed by a slightly 
slower northward motion on Friday and Saturday. On the forecast 
track, the center of Jerry is expected to pass near or to the 
northeast of the northern Leeward Islands later today and tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual strengthening is forecast during the next few days,
and Jerry could become a hurricane by late Friday or Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Jerry can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header
WTNT45 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in Barbuda
later today and tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are possible
in portions of the northern Leeward Islands within the watch area
later today into Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Through Friday, 2 to 4 inches of rain with local storm
total maxima to 6 inches are expected across the Leeward and Virgin
Islands. This rainfall brings a risk of flash flooding, especially
in urban areas and in steep terrain. For portions of Puerto Rico,
moisture associated with Jerry combined with local orographic
effects may result in up to 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated 6
inches possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Jerry, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Jerry are beginning to reach the Leeward
and Windward Islands. These swells will spread westward toward the
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico tonight, then toward the rest of the
Greater Antilles over the next couple of days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States, including
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, can be found at:
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

      <title>Tropical Storm Jerry Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Tropical Storm Jerry Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102025
1100 AM AST Thu Oct 09 2025
 
The NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunters have been investigating 
Jerry this morning, and the radar and flight-level wind data show 
that the storm remains lopsided with nearly all of the strong winds 
and convection on the system's east side.  The center itself has 
been difficult to fix, but the data generally support a position 
that is located south-southeast of the previous track.  The initial 
intensity is held at 55 kt based on a combination of the aircraft 
data and satellite estimates.
 
The initial motion of Jerry is somewhat uncertain given its poor 
low-level structure, but our best guess is west-northwestward at 16 
kt.  A west-northwest to northwest motion should occur today, 
bringing the center of the storm just east of the northern Leeward 
Islands later today and tonight.  Tropical-storm-force winds are 
expected in Barbuda and possible on some of the other islands, 
however, given Jerry's asymmetric structure, the strongest winds 
should pass to the east of the island chain.  A turn to the north is 
expected to occur tomorrow, and that motion should continue through 
most of the weekend as the storm moves in the flow on the western 
side of a subtropical ridge.  Early next week, a faster eastward or 
east-northeastward motion is forecast in the mid-latitude 
westerlies.  All of the models show Jerry passing east of Bermuda in 
3 or 4 days, and given its expected eastward asymmetry, significant 
impacts appear unlikely there. The new track forecast is a little to 
the left of the previous one in the short term, due to the initial 
position adjustment, but ends up near the previous track from 48 to 
120 h.  This prediction is in good agreement with the HCCA and 
Google Deep Mind ensemble mean.
 
Significant strengthening seems unlikely given Jerry's elongated
low-level structure.  However, the shear is expected to let up some
while Jerry remains over warm water and in a moist air mass.
Therefore, slow strengthening is predicted during the next few
days.  Slow weakening seems like a good bet beyond a few days when
Jerry is forecast to be moving over slightly cooler SSTs and into
stronger shear.  The NHC intensity forecast is quite similar to the
previous one and is in best agreement with the HCCA model.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Jerry is expected to bring tropical storm conditions to Barbuda 
later today and tonight, and could bring tropical storm conditions 
to other portions of the northern Leeward Islands by tonight.
 
2. Heavy rainfall will impact portions of the Leeward Islands, 
British Virgin Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico through 
Friday, which could result in flash flooding, particularly in urban 
areas and in steep terrain.
