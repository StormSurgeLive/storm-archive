Post-Tropical Cyclone Karen Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112025
900 PM GMT Fri Oct 10 2025
 
Convection associated with Karen has dissipated this evening, 
leaving the system a swirl of low- to mid-level clouds.  The cyclone 
will be moving over even colder waters of the North Atlantic during 
the next 12 to 24 hours, and organized convection is not expected to 
return. Therefore, Karen has lost its designation as a subtropical 
cyclone, and this will be the last NHC advisory.  The initial 
intensity remains 40 kt, based on earlier ASCAT data. The low should 
gradually weaken during the next 12 to 24 hours, and it is expected 
to open up into a trough and be absorbed by an approaching frontal 
system in 24 to 36 hours.

The low is moving north-northeastward or 025 degrees at 14 kt. The 
system should continue to accelerate north-northeastward ahead of 
an approaching deep-layer trough through Saturday.  The updated NHC 
track forecast is once again similar to the previous forecast and 
near the center of the guidance envelope. 

This is the last NHC advisory on Karen.  Additional information on 
this system can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by Meteo 
France under WMO header FQNT50 LFPW and available on the web at
https://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/raw/fq/fqnt50.lfpw..txt

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Jerry can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header
WTNT45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Through tonight, 2 to 4 inches of additional rain are 
expected across the northern Leeward and Virgin Islands. The 
additional heavy rainfall will maintain a risk of flash flooding, 
especially in urban areas and in steep terrain. Moisture associated 
with Jerry combined with local orographic effects may result in an 
additional 2 to 4 inches of rain as well across eastern Puerto Rico.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding 
associated with Jerry, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Jerry are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Windward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican
Republic and are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  These swells are expected to spread toward the
Turks and Caicos Islands and Bahamas tonight and on Saturday.
Please consult products from your local weather office for more
information.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands can be found at:

Tropical Storm Jerry Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102025
500 PM AST Fri Oct 10 2025
 
Jerry's center remains somewhat ill defined and embedded along the
eastern end of a southeast-to-northwest oriented surface trough.
Strong shear out of the north-northwest is displacing much of the
associated deep convection south-southeast of the center, with
trailing bands still producing heavy rains over portions of the
Leeward Islands.  Based on ASCAT data from this morning, the
maximum winds are still estimated to be 45 kt, with
tropical-storm-force winds limited to the eastern side of the
circulation.
 
The initial motion is now north-northwestward, or 340/13 kt.  Jerry
is expected to turn northward by tonight as it moves around the
western periphery of the subtropical ridge, with that motion
continuing through Saturday night.  A northeastward to eastward
motion is expected Sunday through Tuesday as Jerry becomes embedded
within mid-latitude westerly flow.  The new NHC track forecast is
not too different than the previous prediction since there have not
been any significant model changes from 6 hours ago.
 
Jerry is likely to continue battling moderate to strong shear
during the next couple of days, and global model fields (with the
exception of the GFS) suggest that the storm will maintain an
elongated circulation through this period.  Although the shear
might decrease a bit after 48 hours, at that point Jerry will be
moving over more marginal sea surface temperatures and into a more
stable environment.  The NHC forecast now shows little to no change
in Jerry's intensity through day 3, which is close to that shown by
the Google DeepMind ensemble mean.  The same global model fields
also show Jerry possibly interacting with a front in 48-72 hours,
and the updated NHC forecast now shows extratropical transition by
day 4 with dissipation along the front by day 5.  The GFS maintains
Jerry as a tropical cyclone through day 5, but that solution is
considered an outlier.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall will impact portions of the Leeward Islands,
British Virgin Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico through
tonight, which could result in flash flooding, particularly in urban
areas and in steep terrain.
 
2. Swells generated by Jerry are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Windward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the
Dominican Republic and are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. These swells are expected to spread toward
the Turks and Caicos Islands and Bahamas tonight and on Saturday.
