Subtropical Storm Karen Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112025
900 AM GMT Fri Oct 10 2025
 
Karen remains embedded within a large upper-level low pressure
system over the north Atlantic. Satellite images show the compact
storm is still producing some moderate convection around its center,
primarily over the eastern part of the circulation. Based on the
ST2.5/35-40 kt classification from TAFB and earlier scatterometer
data, the initial intensity is held at 40 kt.
 
The storm is moving northeastward (045/8 kt), and it is expected to
accelerate northeastward during the next 12-24 h within the flow
ahead of an advancing deep-layer trough from the west. The updated
NHC track forecast is very similar to the previous one. Despite
being located over sub-20 deg C SSTs, very cold air aloft may
continue to provide enough instability for Karen to maintain some
organized convection today. However, environmental and oceanic
conditions will become increasingly hostile going forward, and the
GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite imagery show the system devoid of
convection by early Saturday. Shortly thereafter, Karen is forecast
to open up into a trough and become absorbed by an approaching
frontal system.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
All Tropical Storm Warnings have been discontinued.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jerry was
located near latitude 20.2 North, longitude 63.4 West.  Jerry is
moving toward the northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h).  A turn toward 
the north is expected by this evening, with that motion continuing 
through Sunday.  A turn toward the northeast and east-northeast is 
forecast Sunday night and Monday.
 
Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter and satellite-derived wind data 
indicate that maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is expected during 
the next few days. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
to the east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Jerry can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header
WTNT45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Through today, 4 to 6 inches of rain are expected across
the island of Barbuda. Elsewhere across the Leeward and Virgin
Islands, 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected. This rainfall brings a
risk of flash flooding, especially in urban areas and in steep
terrain. For portions of Puerto Rico, moisture associated with Jerry
may result in up to 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated 6 inches 
possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Jerry, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Jerry are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Windward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, and are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
These swells are expected to spread toward the rest of the Greater
Antilles today and tonight. Please consult products from your local
weather office for more information.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States, including
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, can be found at:

Tropical Storm Jerry Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102025
500 AM AST Fri Oct 10 2025
 
Jerry is still a disorganized tropical storm. The cloud pattern 
remains sheared, with deep convection displaced to the south and 
east of the low-level center. Earlier aircraft fixes and recent 
satellite images suggest the center could be becoming elongated, and 
dropsonde data indicated the central pressure was gradually rising 
during the previous mission. The storm has not become any better 
organized since that time, and the initial intensity is set at 45 kt 
based on a blend of the earlier aircraft wind data and more recent 
satellite intensity estimates. Although the center of Jerry is 
passing north of the Leeward Islands, radar data show that heavy 
rainfall continues across much of the region, leading to an 
increased threat of flash flooding. Another Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft is en route to investigate Jerry.

The storm is moving toward the northwest (315/15 kt), but a 
northward turn is expected by tonight as Jerry moves along the 
western extent of a subtropical ridge and pulls away from the 
islands. This northward motion should continue through the weekend, 
keeping the center of Jerry well to the southeast of Bermuda on 
Sunday. The latest track guidance is in fairly good agreement on 
this part of the forecast, and little change was made to the NHC 
prediction, which lies near HCCA and the Google DeepMind mean. By 
early next week, Jerry is forecast to turn northeastward and 
eastward within the mid-latitude westerlies. This part of the track 
forecast is more uncertain, as greater spread is noted in the models 
regarding how quickly Jerry becomes captured within this flow. 
During this period, the updated NHC forecast is slower and slightly 
south of the previous one, following the latest multi-model 
consensus trends.

Jerry has been unable to develop a more coherent structure over the 
past couple of days within a moderate to strong northwesterly shear 
environment. Given its current appearance and the continued shear, 
little strengthening is expected in the near term. In fact, the 
latest intensity guidance has trended downward, and some models 
suggest Jerry may not strengthen at all going forward. Since there 
are indications in the GFS and ECMWF SHIPS that the shear 
could lessen a bit over the weekend, the updated NHC forecast shows 
some modest strengthening, but Jerry is no longer predicted to 
become a hurricane. This forecast still lies on the high end of the 
guidance, so future downward adjustments could be necessary if 
Jerry continues to struggle.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall will impact portions of the Leeward Islands, 
British Virgin Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico through 
today, which could result in flash flooding, particularly in urban 
areas and in steep terrain.

2. Tropical storm conditions, mainly in gusts, could still affect 
portions of the northern Leeward Islands this morning. These 
conditions are expected to subside later today as Jerry moves away 
from the area.
