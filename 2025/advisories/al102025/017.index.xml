BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Jerry Advisory Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102025
1100 AM AST Sat Oct 11 2025
 
...DISHEVELED JERRY MAY NOT LAST MUCH LONGER AS A TROPICAL
CYCLONE...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...25.8N 63.2W
ABOUT 460 MI...740 KM SSE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 5 DEGREES AT 16 MPH...26 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1005 MB...29.68 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jerry was
located near latitude 25.8 North, longitude 63.2 West.  Jerry is
moving toward the north near 16 mph (26 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue today.  A turn toward the northeast 
is forecast on Sunday, followed by an eastward motion on Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast during the next few days, and Jerry could 
degenerate into a trough of low pressure at any time.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
to the east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Jerry are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, the Turks and
Caicos Islands, and the Bahamas.  These swells will likely
causing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office for more
information.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands can be found at:

NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

      <title>Tropical Storm Jerry Forecast Discussion Number 17</title>

Tropical Storm Jerry Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102025
1100 AM AST Sat Oct 11 2025
 
There are strong indications this morning that Jerry may no longer 
have a well-defined center of circulation.  Although there is 
obvious mid-level rotation in a small area of deep convection, low 
cloud lines in visible satellite imagery suggest the system may 
have degenerated into a surface trough of low pressure, which is 
echoed by global model fields.  We will continue advisories at the 
moment, pending some ASCAT data which should provide some additional 
clarity on the system's structure.  Advisories could be discontinued 
at any time if new data shows that Jerry has opened up into a 
trough.

Satellite intensity estimates are no higher than about 45 kt, so 
the current intensity is reduced to that value.  The European, 
UKMET, and Canadian models show Jerry's circulation remaining 
stretched out and weakening while beginning to merge with a 
frontal boundary located to its north near 30N in about 24 hours.  
Even the GFS, which keeps Jerry separate from the frontal boundary, 
shows the peak winds decreasing.  The new NHC forecast now shows 
Jerry becoming post-tropical by 48 hours and dissipating 72 hours, 
but both of these transitions could occur much earlier.  
 
Although the center is not well defined, the entire system is 
moving northward (005 degrees) at 14 kt.  A turn toward the 
northeast is expected on Sunday, followed by an eastward motion on 
Monday as Jerry merges with a front and becomes embedded in 
mid-latitude westerly flow.  The new track forecast is generally 
just an update of the previous prediction.
