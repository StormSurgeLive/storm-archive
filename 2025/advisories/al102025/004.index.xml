DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jerry was 
located near latitude 13.3 North, longitude 50.7 West. Jerry is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 23 mph (37 km/h). This general 
motion is expected to continue with a decrease in forward speed 
during the next couple of days, followed by a turn toward the 
north-northwest and north beginning on Friday. On the forecast 
track, the core of the system is expected to be near or to the north 
of the northern Leeward Islands late Thursday and Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is expected during the next few days, and Jerry is 
forecast to become a hurricane on Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Jerry can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header
WTNT45 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible in portions of the
northern Leeward Islands within the watch area late Thursday into
Friday.
 
RAINFALL: On Thursday into early Friday, 2 to 4 inches of rain are 
expected across the Leeward Islands due to Jerry. This rainfall 
brings a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas of higher 
terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Jerry, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Jerry are expected to reach the Leeward
and Windward Islands on Thursday, then spread westward toward the
Greater Antilles on Friday. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Tropical Storm Jerry Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102025
500 AM AST Wed Oct 08 2025
 
Jerry remains poorly organized this morning. Proxy-visible satellite 
images indicate the low-level center of the storm is still partially 
exposed and elongated, with deep convection displaced well to the 
south and east of the center. With no signs of improved convective 
organization, the initial intensity of Jerry is held at 45 kt, which 
is supported by a 3.0/45 kt Dvorak classification from TAFB and 
earlier scatterometer data. NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft are scheduled to investigate Jerry today.

The storm is racing west-northwestward (285/20 kt) to the south of a 
strong low-level ridge extending across the central Atlantic. A 
continued west-northwestward motion with some decrease in forward 
speed is expected over the next couple of days. This should bring 
the center of the system near or to the north of the northern 
Leeward Islands late Thursday into Friday. This part of the NHC 
track forecast remains near the center of the guidance envelope, 
between the simple and corrected consensus aids. Jerry is forecast 
to turn northward by Friday as a deep-layer trough over the western 
Atlantic weakens the ridge to the north of the system. Then, Jerry 
should accelerate northeastward within the flow ahead of this trough 
through early next week. Overall, no noteworthy track changes were 
made with this update.

Only modest near-term strengthening is expected due to the sheared 
structure of Jerry and its fast forward motion. As the storm begins 
to slow down, Jerry should be able to become more vertically aligned 
and establish an inner core over very warm waters within generally 
favorable environmental conditions. The NHC intensity forecast shows 
a slower rate of strengthening through 24 h, but Jerry is still 
forecast to become a hurricane on Thursday. Additional strengthening 
is anticipated thereafter, and the NHC prediction trends on the 
higher side of the intensity guidance later in the forecast period, 
closer to HCCA and some of the regional hurricane models.

A Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect for many of the northern 
Leeward Islands. Interests elsewhere in the Leeward Islands, the 
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico should monitor the latest updates.

KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Jerry is forecast to strengthen and could bring tropical storm
conditions to portions of the northern Leeward Islands, where
Tropical Storm Watches have been issued.
 
2. Heavy rainfall will impact portions of the Leeward Islands on 
Thursday into early Friday, which could result in flash flooding, 
particularly in areas of higher terrain.
