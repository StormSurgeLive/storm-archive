products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jerry was 
located near latitude 15.7 North, longitude 57.7 West. Jerry is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 20 mph (31 km/h). A turn 
toward the northwest is expected later today, followed by a 
slightly slower northward motion on Friday and Saturday. On the 
forecast track, the center of Jerry is expected to pass near or to 
the northeast of the northern Leeward Islands later today and 
tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Gradual strengthening is forecast during the next few days, 
and Jerry could become a hurricane by late Friday or Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km) 
mainly to the east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Jerry can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header
WTNT45 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible in portions of the
northern Leeward Islands within the watch area later today into
Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Through Friday, 2 to 4 inches of rain with local storm
total maxima to 6 inches are expected across the Leeward and Virgin
Islands. This rainfall brings a risk of flash flooding, especially
in urban areas and in steep terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Jerry, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Jerry are beginning to reach the Leeward
and Windward Islands. These swells will spread westward toward the
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico tonight, then toward the rest of the
Greater Antilles over the next couple of days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States, including
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, can be found at:

      <title>Tropical Storm Jerry Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>
      <description>Issued at 1100 PM AST Wed Oct 08 2025 <![CDATA[<pre>846

Tropical Storm Jerry Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102025
1100 PM AST Wed Oct 08 2025

A very large and cold convective burst has formed near and to the 
east of Jerry this evening, with cloud top temperatures below -80 C 
and plenty of ongoing lightning near the overshooting tops. During 
this period, an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance mission has been 
sampling the storm, and found a peak 850 mb flight level wind of 66 
kt on their northeast outbound leg of the storm. In addition, there 
was a dropsonde launched in the inner max wind band near the center, 
which had a 500 m mean boundary layer wind of 71 kt and a surface 
wind gust of 55 kt. Using a 0.8 reduction factor to the layer mean 
wind supports the current intensity of 55 kt, which also matched the 
T3.5/55 kt Dvorak estimate provided by TAFB. 

Jerry continues to move quickly to the west-northwest, although the 
convective burst may have slowed down its motion a tad, estimated at 
290/18 kt. The forecast track reasoning remains the same this 
evening, with a subtropical ridge well-established to the northeast 
of the storm, and Jerry will likely be steered around this feature, 
turning to the northwest in 24 hours, and then north by 48 hours. On 
the forecast track, this takes Jerry about 80-100 n mi to the 
northeast of the northern Leeward islands by late tomorrow. There 
remain a few hurricane-regional model outliers to the west (HMON, 
HAFS-A), but these models appear to be struggling to depict the 
cyclone within their inner-nests. The overall track guidance 
envelope has remained pretty steady state this evening, and the NHC 
forecast track is very close to the prior advisory, blending the 
reliable HCCA and GDMI aids. By early next week, the track guidance 
has made a more notable shift south as Jerry recurves around the 
subtropical ridge, and the track forecast was nudged further south 
and east in the 120 h period.  While this track puts Jerry safely 
southeast of Bermuda, it's a good idea to continue monitoring future 
forecasts since model scenarios can change, and NHC track forecasts 
at day 4 have an average error of 130 n mi.

Despite the large convective burst, Jerry still remains under 
moderate to strong northwesterly shear, currently estimated at 
around 25 kt per GFS and ECMWF-based SHIPS. However, Jerry has been 
putting up a good fight thus far and its wind field has intensified 
despite the continued unfavorable conditions, likely because of 
other more favorable factors like sea-surface temperatures and an 
unstable environment. The intensity guidance this evening presents a 
challenge. The 18 UTC GFS, and the hurricane-regional models based 
on the GFS, all show very little change in strength and even 
dissipate Jerry in the 72-96 h time frame. However, a glance at the 
short-term model forecast shows the GFS is struggling to correctly 
depict the convective structure of Jerry. To make matters more 
confusing, the last several ECMWF runs now show a much stronger 
Jerry in the 48-96 h time frame, with the 18 UTC run showing a 
strengthening hurricane with pressure below 960 mb. Ultimately, I'm 
going to split the difference between these two extreme solutions, 
showing Jerry slowly intensifying over the next 24-36 h, then 
showing a little more intensification after as the shear decreases 
to 15-20 kt in 36 h after the tropical cyclone passes north of the 
Leeward Islands. Needless to say this is a low confidence intensity 
forecast, and overall the NHC forecast is on the high side of 
the guidance envelope.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Jerry could bring tropical storm conditions to portions of the
northern Leeward Islands late Thursday and Thursday night.
 
2. Heavy rainfall will impact portions of the Leeward Islands,
British Virgin Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands from Thursday into
Saturday morning, which could result in flash flooding, particularly
in areas of steep terrain.
