DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jerry was
located near latitude 15.7 North, longitude 58.4 West. Jerry is
moving toward the west-northwest near 20 mph (31 km/h). A turn 
toward the northwest is expected later today, followed by a 
slightly slower northward motion on Friday and Saturday. On the 
forecast track, the center of Jerry is expected to pass near or to 
the northeast of the northern Leeward Islands later today and 
tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual strengthening is forecast during the next few days, 
and Jerry could become a hurricane by late Friday or Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Jerry can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header
WTNT45 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible in portions of the
northern Leeward Islands within the watch area later today into
Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Through Friday, 2 to 4 inches of rain with local storm
total maxima to 6 inches are expected across the Leeward and Virgin
Islands. This rainfall brings a risk of flash flooding, especially
in urban areas and in steep terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Jerry, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Jerry are beginning to reach the Leeward
and Windward Islands. These swells will spread westward toward the
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico tonight, then toward the rest of the
Greater Antilles over the next couple of days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States, including
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, can be found at:
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents

Tropical Storm Jerry Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102025
500 AM AST Thu Oct 09 2025
 
Jerry still has the appearance of a sheared tropical storm. 
Proxy-visible satellite images show the low-level center lies near 
the northwestern edge of the convective cloud mass. Deep convection 
is mostly confined to the eastern and southeastern portions of the 
circulation. Based on the prior aircraft data and a recent T3.5/55 
kt Dvorak classification from TAFB, the initial intensity is held at 
55 kt. An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is en route to 
investigate Jerry this morning.

The storm is moving west-northwestward (290/17 kt), but is expected 
to turn toward the northwest later today as Jerry moves around 
the southwestern extent of a subtropical ridge. The center of Jerry 
should pass just to the northeast of the northern Leeward Islands 
later today and tonight. Based on the earlier aircraft fixes and the 
latest track guidance, the updated NHC forecast brings Jerry 
marginally closer to the northern Leeward Islands during this time. 
However, the risk of sustained tropical-storm-force winds impacting 
these islands remains low since the strongest winds are occurring 
to the east of the center, with much weaker winds found on the west 
side of the storm. By Friday night, Jerry should turn northward 
within the flow between the central Atlantic subtropical ridge and 
an upper-level trough over the western Atlantic. This motion is 
forecast through the weekend, followed by a sharp turn toward the 
east as the storm becomes caught in mid-latitude westerly flow. The 
updated NHC forecast track still keeps Jerry well to the southeast 
of Bermuda at 72-96 h, and no notable changes were made to the 
latter half of the track forecast.

Only modest strengthening is forecast during the next 12-24 h given 
the current sheared structure of Jerry. While the storm remains in a 
moderate to strong shear environment, there are signs that the 
northwesterly shear could lessen on Friday and Saturday, and the NHC 
forecast shows Jerry becoming a hurricane during that time. Overall, 
there remains a significant amount of spread and a lack of 
consistency in the long-range intensity guidance for Jerry. While 
the HAFS hurricane models now show significant strengthening to 
major hurricane intensity, other guidance like the GFS and Google 
DeepMind show little net intensity change during the next several 
days. The NHC intensity forecast remains in between the extreme 
solutions, showing gradual strengthening as Jerry moves northward 
away from the Leeward Islands, followed by gradual weakening later 
in the period as Jerry encounters stronger shear and cooler waters.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Jerry could bring tropical storm conditions to portions of the
northern Leeward Islands later today and tonight.
 
2. Heavy rainfall will impact portions of the Leeward Islands, 
British Virgin Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands through Friday, 
which could result in flash flooding, particularly in urban areas 
and in steep terrain.
