Tropical Storm Jerry Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102025
1100 PM AST Fri Oct 10 2025
 
Jerry's low-level circulation remains rather ill-defined especially 
on the northwest side of the cyclone, where a surface trough extends 
northwestward from Jerry.  The SHIPS guidance is showing about 15-20 
kt of northwesterly deep-layer vertical wind shear in Jerry's 
environment, which is displacing convection to the southeast of the 
center.  Scattered moderate to heavy showers and thunderstorms are 
still occurring over the Virgin Islands, but the rainband that was 
producing the persistent heavy rain over the northeastern Caribbean 
Islands has weakened from earlier and is starting to move away.  A 
recent ASCAT pass shows maximum winds around 50 kt, so the intensity 
has been raised to 50 kt for this advisory, which is slightly higher 
than the latest TAFB Dvorak estimate.  The tropical-storm-force 
winds are limited to the eastern semicircle of Jerry.
 
The initial motion estimate is northward, or 350 degrees at 13 kt.
This general motion should continue through Saturday night because a
north-south-oriented mid-level ridge is currently located to the
east of the cyclone.  By Sunday night, Jerry should turn eastward as
it becomes embedded in the mid-latitude westerlies.  Only minor
adjustments have been made to the previous NHC track forecast, which
generally lies in between the simple and corrected consensus models.
 
Jerry is likely to continue battling moderate to strong shear during
the next couple of days, and global model fields (with the exception
of the GFS) suggest that the storm will maintain an elongated
circulation through this period.  Although the shear might decrease
a bit after 48 hours, at that point Jerry will be moving over more
marginal sea surface temperatures and into a more stable
environment.  No changes were made to the previous NHC intensity
forecast, which is near, or slightly below the middle of the
guidance envelope.  The global model fields (with the exception of
the GFS) show Jerry interacting with a front by Sunday night, and
the NHC forecast shows Jerry becoming post-tropical by Monday
evening, with dissipation along the front a day or two later.  The
GFS maintains Jerry as a tropical cyclone through day 5, but that
solution is considered an outlier.
 
It should be noted that the circulation of Jerry is quite 
ill-defined on the northwest side.  Therefore, it is possible that 
Jerry could dissipate at any time this weekend.  However, given that 
most of the global and regional models hold on to the circulation 
into Sunday, the most likely scenario seems to be that Jerry will 
stick around for at least another 2 days or so until it begins 
interacting with the front.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Jerry will lift north of the Leeward Islands,
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico overnight. As a result, the risk for
flash flooding will diminish.
 
2. Swells generated by Jerry are affecting the Leeward Islands,
Windward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Dominican
Republic, and the Turks and Caicos Islands and are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. These swells are
expected to spread toward the Bahamas by Saturday.
