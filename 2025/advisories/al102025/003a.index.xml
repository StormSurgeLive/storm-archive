DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jerry was 
located near latitude 13.1 North, longitude 49.8 West. Jerry is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 23 mph (37 km/h). This general 
motion is expected to continue with a decrease in forward speed 
during the next couple of days, followed by a turn toward the 
north-northwest and north on Friday. On the forecast track, the core 
of the system is expected to be near or to the north of the northern 
Leeward Islands late Thursday and Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Strengthening is forecast during the next few days, and Jerry is 
expected to become a hurricane by late tonight or Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Jerry can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header
WTNT45 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible in portions of the
northern Leeward Islands within the watch area late Thursday and 
Friday.
 
RAINFALL: On Thursday, 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected across the
Leeward Islands due to Jerry. This rainfall brings a risk of flash
flooding, especially in areas of higher terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Jerry, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Jerry are expected to reach the Leeward 
and Windward Islands on Thursday, then spread westward toward the 
Greater Antilles on Friday. These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?ripCurrents
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

      <title>Tropical Storm Jerry Forecast Discussion Number 3</title>

Tropical Storm Jerry Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102025
1100 PM AST Tue Oct 07 2025

Satellite imagery and scatterometer data indicate that Jerry is 
somewhat disorganized this evening. Satellite imagery has been 
showing an exposed swirl of low-level clouds to the northwest and 
west of the convective mass, with scatterometer data suggesting this 
was the western end of an elongated surface circulation. The maximum 
scatterometer winds were in the 40-45 kt range, so the initial 
intensity remains 45 kt. NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft are scheduled to investigate Jerry tomorrow.

The initial motion is now west-northwestward or 285/20 kt.  Jerry 
is currently on the south side of a strong low-level ridge, and 
this features should steer the storm west-northwestward for the 
next couple of days with some decrease in forward speed. This
motion should take the core of Jerry near or to the north of the
northern Leeward Islands late Thursday and Friday. This part of the 
forecast track is close to the various consensus models. However, 
the global model forecasts lie to the right of the consensus models, 
while the HAFS/HWRF models and the Google DeepMind ensemble mean are 
to the left of them.  After the cyclone passes the Leeward Islands, 
it is expected to turn northward and eventually northeastward due to 
the development of a deep-layer trough over the eastern United 
States and the western Atlantic.  Overall, the new forecast track 
is nudged just a little to the left of the previous track through 
96 h.

The latest satellite imagery and model analyses suggest that the 
environment Jerry is in is not quite as conducive for strengthening 
as thought earlier, with the cyclone likely to remain in moderate 
westerly shear for the next two to three days. In addition, the 
current structure favors a slower development rate. The latest 
intensity guidance has responded to these developments by being 
less bullish on developing the storm. While the new intensity 
forecast calls for the same 85 kt peak intensity as the previous 
forecast, it shows a slower rate of development, and the new 
forecast lies above the intensity consensus models.
 
Based on the forecast and the uncertainties, Tropical Storm
Watches have been issued for portions of the northern Leeward
Islands.  Interests elsewhere in the Leeward Islands, the Virgin 
Islands, and Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of Jerry.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Jerry is forecast to strengthen and could bring tropical storm
conditions to portions of the northern Leeward Islands, where
Tropical Storm Watches have been issued.
 
2. Heavy rainfall will impact portions of the Leeward Islands on 
Thursday, which could result in flash flooding, particularly in 
areas of higher terrain.
