After Melissa becomes post-tropical, a brief period of heavy rain 
and gusty winds is possible over the southern Avalon Peninsula of 
Newfoundland Friday night.  For more information on impacts in 
Canada, see the Canadian Hurricane Center website at 
https://weather.gc.ca/hurricane/index_e.html
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products 
issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Melissa was 
located near latitude 29.0 North, longitude 70.9 West. Melissa is 
moving toward the northeast near 30 mph (48 km/h), and this motion 
is expected to continue during the next couple of days.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Melissa is expected to pass to the 
northwest of Bermuda later today and tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected today, and a weakening 
trend is likely to begin on Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 75 miles (120 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 255
miles (405 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 964 mb (28.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions will begin on Bermuda late this
afternoon or early this evening, with hurricane conditions expected 
there tonight. Gusty winds are possible over the southern Avalon 
Peninsula of Newfoundland Friday night.

RAINFALL: An additional 1 to 2 inches is possible today over
portions of Hispaniola.

For Bermuda, outer bands of Melissa may bring an inch of rain
through tonight.

A brief period of heavy rain is possible over the southern Avalon 
Peninsula of Newfoundland Friday night.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Coastal flooding from storm surge is possible in areas
of onshore winds for Bermuda.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa will continue to affect portions
of Hispaniola, Cuba, the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands
during the next couple of days, and will spread toward Bermuda later
today. Swells generated by Melissa are also likely to reach the
coast of the Northeastern United States and Atlantic Canada Friday
and persist into the weekend. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Melissa Discussion Number  37
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
1100 AM EDT Thu Oct 30 2025
 
Air Force Reserve Reconnaissance recently investigated Melissa and
found winds in the southeast quadrant that supported a 90-kt
intensity.  The central pressure is about 965 mb, based on dropsonde
data.  The wind radii have changed only slightly during the past 12
hours.  The satellite presentation remains fairly impressive, with
an eye feature emerging on GOES 19 imagery over the past couple of
hours.  Some slight additional strengthening is possible for another
few hours while Melissa remains over marginally warm sea-surface
temperatures, but the water temperatures will rapidly decrease
tonight while wind shear rapidly increases.  As a result, Melissa is
expected to quickly lose tropical characteristics once it passes
Bermuda, and it is forecast to become a strong post-tropical cyclone
over the North Atlantic by Friday night.  The latest NHC intensity
forecast remains towards the higher end of the guidance envelope,
and more closely follows the global models during the extratropical
phase.
 
Melissa is accelerating toward the north-northeast, now moving 30
degrees at 21 kt. A faster motion is expected during the next
couple of days as Melissa moves within the flow between a
mid-level trough over the eastern U.S. and a subtropical ridge
over the central Atlantic.  The guidance is in excellent agreement
through the next 48 hours, until after the system makes its closest
approach to Atlantic Canada.  A Hurricane Warning remains in effect
for Bermuda, and Melissa is likely to pass to the west and
northwest of the island tonight.  Melissa should then pass near the
southeastern tip of Newfoundland as a strong extratropical cyclone
on Friday night before turning more towards the east-northeast, and
moving across the North Atlantic this weekend.  No significant
changes were made to the NHC track forecast through 48 hours, but
the track was shifted a bit to the northeast of the previous
forecast from day 3 onward.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Bermuda: Hurricane conditions are expected in Bermuda tonight,
with tropical storm conditions beginning late this afternoon.
Preparations should be rushed to completion.
 
2. Post-storm safety:  Follow advice of local officials as you may
need to remain sheltered after the storm due to downed power lines
and flooding. Any flooding across the Bahamas is expected to subside
today. Flooding across Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola could persist
for another few days. Ensure generators are properly ventilated and
placed outside at least 20 feet away from dwellings and garages to
avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. During clean up, be careful when
using chainsaws and power tools. Drink plenty of water to avoid heat
exhaustion.
