...MELISSA MOVING VERY SLOWLY IN THE CENTRAL CARIBBEAN...
...HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLOODING EXPECTED OVER PORTIONS OF HISPANIOLA
AND JAMAICA INTO THE WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 PM EDT...0000 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.3N 74.5W
ABOUT 330 MI...530 KM SSW OF PORT AU PRINCE HAITI
ABOUT 300 MI...480 KM SSE OF KINGSTON JAMAICA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 270 DEGREES AT 1 MPH...2 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1002 MB...29.59 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the
Dominican Republic to Port-Au-Prince
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Jamaica
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba
should monitor the progress of Melissa.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was
located by an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft near latitude 14.3 
North, longitude 74.5 West.  Melissa is drifting toward the west 
near 1 mph (2 km/h).  A slow forward speed and a gradual turn to 
the northwest or north-northwest is forecast during the next couple 
of days, followed by a westward turn by this weekend.  On the 
forecast track,  Melissa is expected to be nearer to Jamaica and 
the southwestern portion of Haiti later this week.

Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some slow strengthening is forecast during the next few 
days, and Melissa could become a hurricane by Friday, with more 
substantial intensification forecast by this weekend. 

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti beginning on Friday.  Tropical storm conditions could begin in
Jamaica late on Thursday or on Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring 5 to 10 inches of rain to the
southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica
through Saturday, with locally higher amounts possible.  Additional
heavy rainfall is possible beyond Saturday.  However, uncertainty
in Melissaâ€™s track and forward speed reduces confidence in exact
totals.  Significant, life-threatening flash flooding and numerous
landslides are possible.
 
Across Puerto Rico, northern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and
western Jamaica, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected through Saturday.
Flash and urban flooding will be possible through at least Saturday.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Melissa are expected to spread to
Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next couple of
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Melissa Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
500 PM EDT Wed Oct 22 2025

Like yesterday, Melissa's structure has come unglued this 
afternoon, with the low-level circulation becoming exposed to 
the west of the bursting deep convection. While that convection 
continues to have very cold cloud tops, it lacks much organization, 
remaining parked down-shear of the storm with 20-30 kt of 
west-northwesterly shear undercutting the outflow layer. This 
disjointed structure is nicely exhibited on an 1825 UTC AMSR2 pass. 
While the objective intensity estimates in general are a little 
higher than this morning, the subjective Dvorak estimates are lower, 
and given the disjointed structure of Melissa, it favors holding the 
intensity at 45 kt this advisory. Another Air Force Reserve and the 
first NOAA Hurricane Hunter mission will be in the storm this 
evening to provide more structural information. 

Melissa has taken a short-term jog westward as it became exposed, 
but now appears to be resuming a very slow west-northwestward motion 
at 290/2 kt. The track reasoning remains similar to the previous 
forecast over the next 2-3 days, with the forecast storm structure 
likely to have a significant role in the future track. Dynamical 
models that show the storm becoming more vertically aligned and deep 
(GFS, HWRF) show Melissa turning north or northeastward due to 
westerly deep-layer steering into a weakness induced by a broad 
upper-level trough located over the Bahamas. However, models that 
show Melissa remaining more shallow and misaligned (ECMWF, HAFS-A/B) 
maintain a northwestward or north-northwestward component of 
motion. Compared to this morning, the track guidance has shifted 
slower and farther west, possibly due to the farther west initial 
position. The NHC track has been shifted westward and is also a 
little southward after 60 h, but remains farther north and east of 
the ECMWF and HAFS models this cycle, and is roughly in between the 
HFIP consensus approach (HCCA) and Google DeepMind ensemble mean 
(GDMI). This track forecast favors the models that keep Melissa weak 
and less prone to the deep-layer steering over the next 24-48 hours. 
However, this remains a low confidence track forecast other than 
Melissa maintaining a slow motion for the majority of the period. 

The current vortex misalignment of Melissa is a significant 
impediment to short-term intensification, and the vertical wind 
shear is expected to maintain this tilted structure over the next 
24-36 hours, although I can't preclude any center reformations 
down-shear, like what occurred last night. After this period, the 
ECWMF-SHIPS guidance now indicates the ongoing westerly shear will 
decrease to 10-15 knots, and the storm remains over very warm 
sea-surface temperatures and high oceanic heat content. The 
hurricane-regional models have all responded by showing significant 
intensification after the vortex becomes vertically aligned, 
sometime in the 60-96 h period, though timing when this may occur is 
challenging. The intensity guidance is once again higher than the 
previous cycle, and the NHC intensity forecast was raised once 
again, showing Melissa becoming a hurricane in 72 h, rapidly 
intensifying into a major hurricane by 96 h, with additional 
intensification likely thereafter. This forecast is in the best 
agreement with the HCCA intensity aid, but it is worth noting it's 
under the latest HAFS-A/B and HMON forecasts. Unfortunately, it is 
becoming increasingly likely that Melissa will become a large and 
dangerous hurricane by the end of the forecast period. 


Key Messages:
 
1. Melissa is forecast to meander over the central Caribbean Sea and 
could potentially become a major hurricane by early next week. 
Interests in Jamaica, Haiti, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic are 
urged to continue monitoring the latest forecasts.

2. Due to Melissaâ€™s slow motion, the risk of a prolonged period of 
strong winds, possibly lasting for a day or more, is increasing for 
Jamaica and the Tiburon peninsula of Haiti.  Preparations to protect 
life and property should be rushed to completion, since strong 
winds could begin in these areas as early as late Thursday or 
Friday and continue increasing over the weekend.

3. Melissa is expected to produce heavy rainfall across portions of 
the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica through this weekend, 
bringing a risk of significant, life-threatening flash flooding and 
numerous landslides.
