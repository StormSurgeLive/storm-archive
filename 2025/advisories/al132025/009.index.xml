A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the
Dominican Republic to Port-Au-Prince
* Jamaica
 
A Tropical Storm Warning in effect for...
* Jamaica
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours before 
the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds, 
conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba
should monitor the progress of Melissa.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was 
located near latitude 15.4 North, longitude 74.9 West. Melissa is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 2 mph (4 km/h). A slow 
northward motion is forecast during the next day or two, followed by 
a westward turn over the weekend.  On the forecast track,  Melissa 
is expected to move closer to Jamaica and the southwestern portion 
of Haiti during the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Gradually strengthening is forecast over the next day or so, 
followed by more rapid intensification this weekend.  Melissa is 
forecast to become a hurricane in a couple of days and a major 
hurricane by the end of the weekend.  
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in 
Haiti and Jamaica beginning on late Friday or Saturday.  Tropical 
storm conditions are expected to begin in Jamaica earlier on Friday.

RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring 6 to 12 inches of rain to the 
southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica 
through Sunday, with locally higher amounts possible. Additional 
heavy rainfall is likely beyond Sunday. However, uncertainty in 
Melissa’s track and forward speed reduces confidence in the exact 
totals. Regardless, significant, life-threatening flash flooding 
and numerous landslides are expected.

Across northern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and western 
Jamaica, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected through Sunday. Flash and 
urban flooding will be possible through Sunday. Flooding impacts may 
increase across western Jamaica next week.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total 
Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions
of Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next several
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Melissa Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
500 AM EDT Thu Oct 23 2025
 
Melissa continues to struggle in strong westerly vertical wind
shear.  Surface observations and Air Force aircraft data show that
the system is vertically tilted with the low-level center partially
exposed and located nearly 100 miles west of the mid-level center
that is apparent in satellite images.  The wind field of the storm
also remains lopsided, with most of the strong winds confined to the
eastern half of the circulation.  The initial intensity is held at
45 kt, but this is probably generous based on the aircraft data and
an ASCAT pass from last evening.
 
The storm has been crawling and moving erratically.  In general,
Melissa is likely to inch northward during the next 36 to 48 hours
as the storm is influenced by a weakness in the subtropical ridge.
By late Friday, a mid-level ridge is forecast to build eastward to
the north of the storm, and that pattern change should induce a slow
westward or west-northwestward motion over the weekend.  By early
next week, that ridge is expected to move away as a large-scale
trough amplifies over the eastern U.S.  This change in the steering
flow should cause Melissa to begin to gain more latitude again by
the end of the forecast period.  Given the complex steering pattern
and continued model differences in the predicted vertical depth of
Melissa, there remains a significant spread in the deterministic
guidance and the ensemble solutions. One thing we feel confident
about is that Melissa is likely to move slowly and remain in the
vicinity of Haiti, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba for several days. The
NHC track forecast is shifted a little to the right of the previous
one, trending toward a blend of the latest Google DeepMind ensemble
mean and HCCA solution.
 
The current westerly vertical wind shear over Melissa is expected to
linger for about another day, and that should keep the storm at
around the same intensity during that time.  However, after that,
the upper-level wind pattern will gradually become more conducive
while the system remains over the very warm waters of the central
and northwestern Caribbean Sea.  These conditions should allow
Melissa to become vertically aligned and strengthen significantly.
In fact, rapid intensification appears likely this weekend and
early next week. The NHC intensity forecast lies near the middle of
the guidance envelope from 12 to 72 hours, but leans toward the
upper end of the guidance at days 4 and 5.  As Melissa intensifies,
its wind field is expected to grow and become more symmetric.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Melissa is expected to meander over the central Caribbean Sea for
several days and is forecast to become a major hurricane by late
this weekend or early next week.  Interests in Jamaica, Haiti, Cuba,
and the Dominican Republic are urged to continue monitoring the
latest forecasts.
 
2. Due to Melissa’s slow motion, the risk of a prolonged period of
strong winds, possibly lasting for a day or more, is increasing for
Jamaica and the Tiburon peninsula of Haiti.  Preparations to protect
life and property should be rushed to completion, since strong winds
could begin in these areas on Friday and continue increasing over
the weekend.
 
3. Melissa is expected to produce heavy rainfall across portions of
the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica through the weekend,
bringing a risk of significant, life-threatening flash flooding and
numerous landslides.
