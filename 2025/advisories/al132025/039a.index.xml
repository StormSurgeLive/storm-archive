DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Melissa was 
located near latitude 34.4 North, longitude 65.5 West. Melissa is 
moving toward the northeast near 40 mph (65 km/h). An even faster 
northeastward motion is expected into Saturday. A gradual turn 
toward the east-northeast is forecast on Sunday. On the forecast 
track, the center of Melissa is expected to move away from Bermuda 
this morning and pass south of the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland 
as a post-tropical cyclone tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Gradual weakening is expected during the next couple of days, 
and Melissa is expected to become a post-tropical low by tonight.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 255
miles (405 km). The L.F. Wade International Airport on Bermuda 
recently reported sustained winds of 43 mph (69 km/h) and a gust of 
61 mph (98 km/h). An elevated station at the National Museum of 
Bermuda recently reported a wind gust of 76 mph (122 km/h), with a 
peak gust of 98 mph (158 km/h) during the past couple of hours.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 973 mb (28.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions, primarily in gusts, are occurring on 
Bermuda. Gusty winds are possible over the southern Avalon 
Peninsula of Newfoundland tonight.
 
RAINFALL: For Bermuda, outer bands of Melissa may bring 1 to 2
inches of rain through early this morning.
 
A brief period of heavy rain is possible over the southern Avalon
Peninsula of Newfoundland tonight.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Coastal flooding from storm surge is possible in areas 
of onshore winds for Bermuda.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa will continue to affect portions 
of Hispaniola, Cuba, the Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and 
Bermuda during the next couple of days. These swells are expected to 
reach the coast of the Northeastern United States and Atlantic 
Canada today and persist into the weekend. These swells are likely 
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Melissa Discussion Number  39
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
1100 PM AST Thu Oct 30 2025

Satellite imagery suggests that Melissa is starting the 
extratropical transition process, with cold air clouds beginning to 
enter the southwestern side of the circulation and the remaining 
convection now confined to the northeastern quadrant. Reports from 
the last Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter mission into the storm 
included a central pressure near 971 mb and 700-mb flight-level 
winds of 111 kt well to the southeast of the center. Since there is 
no convection in this area to mix these winds to the surface, it is 
difficult to tell just how strong the surface winds may be. However, 
based on the observed structural decay and the trends in satellite 
intensity estimates, the initial intensity is reduced to a possibly 
generous 85 kt.

Melissa continues to accelerate to the northeast with the initial 
motion now 040/33 kt.  An even faster motion toward the northeast is 
expected during the next 48 h as the cyclone becomes embedded in 
strong southwesterly flow associated with a mid-latitude cyclone to 
the northwest. This track should bring the center to the northwest 
of Bermuda during the next 6 h or so, and just south of the Avalon 
Peninsula of Newfoundland between 24-36 h.  After 48 h, an 
east-northeastward motion with some decrease in forward speed is 
expected as Melissa becomes part of an elongated area of low 
pressure over the northeastern Atlantic. The new forecast track is 
faster than the previous one, but has little difference in direction 
of motion from the previous track through 96 h. An eastward 
adjustment was made at 120 h. Overall, the new forecast track is 
close to the consensus models in a tightly-packed guidance suite.

Melissa is now moving over decreasing sea surface temperatures, and 
this should aid the ongoing extratropical transition.  The cyclone 
is expected to become post-tropical by 24 h, then continue as a 
gradually weakening extratropical low as it crosses the north 
Atlantic. The forecast intensities during the extratropical stage 
are based on a blend of the GFS and ECMWF forecast intensities. 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Bermuda: Hurricane conditions are expected in Bermuda tonight,
with tropical storm conditions now occurring on the island.
 
2. Post-storm safety:  Follow advice of local officials as you may
need to remain sheltered after the storm due to downed power lines
and flooding. Any flooding across the Bahamas is expected to subside
today. Flooding across Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola could persist
for another few days. Ensure generators are properly ventilated and
placed outside at least 20 feet away from dwellings and garages to
avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. During clean up, be careful when
using chainsaws and power tools. Drink plenty of water to avoid heat
exhaustion.
