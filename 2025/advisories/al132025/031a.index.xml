DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Melissa was 
located near latitude 19.7 North, longitude 76.4 West. Melissa is 
moving toward the northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h). A faster 
northeastward motion is expected during the next few days. On the 
forecast track, the core of Melissa is expected to move over eastern 
Cuba through this morning, move across the southeastern or central 
Bahamas later today, and approach Bermuda Thursday and Thursday 
night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Melissa is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Melissa is expected to remain a powerful 
hurricane when it moves across Cuba and the Bahamas and passes near 
Bermuda.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the 
center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 
miles (315 km). Leeward Point Field in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, 
recently reported a sustained wind of 38 mph (61 km/h) and a gust of 
69 mph (111 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on Air Force Hurricane 
Hunter dropsonde data is 952 mb (28.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Damaging winds are expected to gradually subside across 
Jamaica, but residents are advised to remain in a safe shelter until 
sunrise.
 
Hurricane conditions are spreading across the warning area in Cuba 
and will continue through this morning. Tropical storm conditions 
are expected in Haiti through today.

Hurricane conditions are expected in the southeastern and central 
Bahamas today. Tropical storm conditions are expected and hurricane 
conditions are possible in the Turks and Caicos Islands today.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible on Bermuda late Thursday and 
Thursday night.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring an additional 4 to 8 inches 
across Jamaica, where storm total amounts will be between 12 to 24 
inches. Isolated areas near 30 inches will be possible over 
mountainous terrain. Ongoing catastrophic flash flooding and 
numerous landslides will continue through this morning.
 
For eastern Cuba, storm total rainfall of 10 to 20 inches are
expected through today, with local amounts to 25 inches expected
over mountainous terrain. This will cause life-threatening and
potentially catastrophic flash flooding with numerous landslides.
 
Over the Southeast Bahamas, storm total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches
are expected through today, which will result in areas of flash
flooding. For the Turks and Caicos, rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches
are expected. Heavy rain may begin to affect Bermuda Thursday night.
 
Over southern Hispaniola, additional rainfall of 2 to 6 inches are 
expected through today, with storm total local maxima of 40 inches 
possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total 
Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: There is a potential for significant storm surge along 
the southeast coast of Cuba early today. Peak storm surge heights 
could reach 8 to 12 feet above normal tide levels, near and to the 
east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall. This storm surge 
will be accompanied by large and destructive waves. Minor coastal 
flooding is possible in bays and inlets along the north coast of 
eastern Cuba.
 
Storm surge of 5 to 8 ft above normally dry ground is possible in 
the southeastern Bahamas today, and 2 to 4 ft above normally dry 
ground is possible in the Turks and Caicos Islands today.
 
Minor coastal flooding is expected along the coast of Haiti.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa will continue to affect portions 
of Hispaniola, Jamaica, eastern Cuba, and the Cayman Islands during 
the next day or so, causing life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions. These swells will reach the Bahamas and the Turks and 
Caicos Islands early this morning, and Bermuda later this week. 
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Melissa Discussion Number  31
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
1100 PM EDT Tue Oct 28 2025
 
Melissa's passage over Jamaica this afternoon and evening caused a
significant amount of weakening.  The pressure rose nearly 60 mb,
and the maximum winds decreased by about 50 kt based on data
collected by the NOAA Hurricane Hunters earlier this evening.
However, now that the core is pulling away from Jamaica, satellite
images and radar data from Cuba show that the eye is becoming better
defined again and the eyewall is gaining symmetry.  Melissa appears
to be on a strengthening trend, and based on a combination of the
earlier aircraft data and the latest satellite intensity estimates,
the initial wind speed is set at 115 kt.  The inner core appears
larger than it was earlier today.
 
The hurricane has turned to the northeast and is currently moving at
040/8 kt. A trough is expected to amplify and shift eastward across
the southeast U.S. during the next few days.  This feature combined
with a subtropical ridge over the central Atlantic should cause
Melissa to accelerate northeastward through the end of the week.
This motion should take the core of Melissa over eastern Cuba
overnight, and then across portions of the southeast and central
Bahamas on Wednesday.  Melissa will likely be in the vicinity of
Bermuda late Thursday.  The models are in good agreement, but there
is some along-track (timing) spread.  The NHC track forecast is
similar to the previous one and near a blend of the HCCA and Google
DeepMind ensemble mean.
 
Melissa is expected to continue to strengthen until it reaches Cuba
in a few hours, and it is expected to make landfall there as a very
dangerous major hurricane. After Melissa moves inland, the passage
over the rugged island combined with a gradual increase in vertical
wind shear and intrusions of dry air should cause the hurricane to
gradually weaken through the period.  That being said, Melissa is
still expected to be a powerful hurricane when it moves through the
Bahamas and near Bermuda.  The models suggest that Melissa should
complete extratropical transition by 72 hours when it is forecast to
have crossed the north wall of the Gulf Stream current. The NHC
intensity forecast is above the guidance in the short term, based on
recent data trends, but generally near the middle of the guidance
envelope from 36 to 120 h.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Jamaica: Although Melissa is pulling away from the island,
deadly hazards remain including downed power lines and flooded
areas.  Ensure generators are properly ventilated and placed outside
at least 20 feet away from doors, windows, and garages to avoid
carbon monoxide poisoning. If you are cleaning up storm damage, be
careful when using chainsaws and power tools, and drink plenty of
water to avoid heat exhaustion.
 
2. Haiti and the Dominican Republic: Catastrophic flash flooding and
landslides are expected across southwestern Haiti and southern
portions of the Dominican Republic during the next day or so. In
Haiti, extensive damage and isolation of communities is likely.
Tropical storm conditions are expected into Wednesday.
 
3. Eastern Cuba: Life-threatening storm surge, flash flooding and
landslides, and extremely damaging hurricane winds are likely
through Wednesday morning. Seek safe shelter now.
 
4. Southeastern and Central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos:
Hurricane conditions, life-threatening storm surge, and heavy
rainfall are expected across portions of the southeastern and
central Bahamas on Wednesday. Complete preparations by tonight and
follow local official guidance. Tropical storm conditions, heavy
rains, and significant storm surge are expected in the Turks and
Caicos Islands on Wednesday.
 
5. Bermuda: Hurricane conditions and heavy rainfall are possible in
Bermuda beginning Thursday or Thursday night, where a Hurricane
Watch is in effect.
