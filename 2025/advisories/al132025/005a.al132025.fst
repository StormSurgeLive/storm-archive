DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was 
located by Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft near latitude 
14.3 North, longitude 74.0 West. Melissa is moving slowly toward the 
west near 2 mph (4 km/h). A slow forward speed and a gradual turn to 
the northwest and north is forecast during the next couple of days, 
followed by a turn back westward by this weekend.  On the forecast 
track, Melissa is expected to approach Jamaica and the southwestern 
portion of Haiti later this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Some gradual strengthening is anticipated during the next few 
days, and Melissa could become a hurricane by Friday. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti beginning late on Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions could
begin in Jamaica late on Thursday or Friday.
 
RAINFALL:  Melissa is expected to bring 5 to 10 inches of rain to
the southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica
through Saturday, with locally higher amounts possible. Additional
heavy rainfall is possible beyond Saturday; however, uncertainty in
Melissaâ€™s track and forward speed reduces confidence in exact
totals. Significant flash flooding and landslides are possible.
 
Across Puerto Rico, northern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and
western Jamaica, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected through Saturday.
Flash and urban flooding will be possible through at least Saturday.
