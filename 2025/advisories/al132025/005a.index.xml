...MELISSA REMAINS DISORGANIZED AND JOGGING SLOWLY WESTWARD...
...HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLOODING EXPECTED OVER PORTIONS OF HISPANIOLA
AND JAMAICA OVER THE REMAINDER OF THIS WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM EDT...1800 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.3N 74.0W
ABOUT 320 MI...510 KM SSW OF PORT AU PRINCE HAITI
ABOUT 315 MI...510 KM SE OF KINGSTON JAMAICA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 280 DEGREES AT 2 MPH...4 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the
Dominican Republic to Port-Au-Prince
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Jamaica
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba
should monitor the progress of Melissa.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was 
located by Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft near latitude 
14.3 North, longitude 74.0 West. Melissa is moving slowly toward the 
west near 2 mph (4 km/h). A slow forward speed and a gradual turn to 
the northwest and north is forecast during the next couple of days, 
followed by a turn back westward by this weekend.  On the forecast 
track, Melissa is expected to approach Jamaica and the southwestern 
portion of Haiti later this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Some gradual strengthening is anticipated during the next few 
days, and Melissa could become a hurricane by Friday. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti beginning late on Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions could
begin in Jamaica late on Thursday or Friday.
 
RAINFALL:  Melissa is expected to bring 5 to 10 inches of rain to
the southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica
through Saturday, with locally higher amounts possible. Additional
heavy rainfall is possible beyond Saturday; however, uncertainty in
Melissaâ€™s track and forward speed reduces confidence in exact
totals. Significant flash flooding and landslides are possible.
 
Across Puerto Rico, northern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and
western Jamaica, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected through Saturday.
Flash and urban flooding will be possible through at least Saturday.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Melissa are expected to spread to
Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next couple of
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Melissa Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
1100 AM EDT Wed Oct 22 2025
 
While Melissa continues to produce bursting convection on satellite 
imagery, with very cold cloud tops down to -95C, there is little 
evidence these convective bands are wrapping around the center. 
West-northwesterly shear of 20 to 25 kt is currently preventing the 
low-level and mid-level circulation centers from aligning. This 
downshear tilt with height has also been observed by the latest Air 
Force Reconnaissance mission, which reported significant winds at 
the surface in their most recent 850 mb center drop. The initial 
intensity for this advisory is held at 45 kt, taking a blend of 
recon observations which had a peak wind of 52 kt at 850 mb, and 
satellite intensity estimates from TAFB, ADT, and D-MINT. The wind 
field of Melissa also remains very asymmetric, as evidence of a 
recent 1040z RCM-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar pass showing the bulk of 
tropical-storm-force winds east of the center. 
 
The tropical storm has slowed down to a crawl this morning, with the 
estimated motion at 300/2 kt. The track forecast remains challenging 
today, and strongly related to the storm's structure in the 
short-term. For the next 12-24 hours, Melissa is forecast to move 
very slowly to the northwest as it attempts to move into a weakness 
produced by an broad upper-level trough centered over the Bahamas. 
Whether or not it turns more rightward into this weakness is related 
to the vertical depth the various model guidance is depicting. The 
06z GFS run, which is the model that has been on the right side of 
the guidance envelope for days, shows a more vertically coherent 
system over the next 24-48 hours, and causes Melissa to abruptly 
turn northeastward over the next 48 hours. While this appears to be 
an outlier solution, the Google DeepMind ensemble mean (GDMI) also 
shows this northeastward motion, and a significant fraction of its 
ensemble members show the Melissa making landfall on the Island of 
Hispaniola. However, the remainder of the track guidance, including 
the ECMWF and its ensemble mean, suggest that Melissa will remain 
misaligned and move more slowly north-northwest over the next couple 
of days. The NHC track solution slightly favors the latter 
scenarios, lying just east of the ECMWF mean, out of respect of the 
reliable GDMI aid. After about 60 h, mid-level ridging begins to 
build back in to the north, and most of the guidance responds by 
showing a sharp turn westward, albeit still at a snail's pace. The 
overall track guidance, GFS and GDMI excluded, has shifted left this 
cycle beyond 72 h, and the NHC track was shifted in that direction, 
but not as far south and west as the HAFS-A/B regional models. It 
goes without saying, this is a very challenging track forecast. 
 
The intensity forecast has its own share of challenges. At least in 
the short-term, vertical wind shear is expected to persist between 
20 to 30 kt, and will likely prevent Melissa from becoming fully 
aligned and taking advantage over the very warm 30-31C sea surface 
temperatures. After about 48 hours, the GFS and ECMWF-based SHIPS 
guidance shows the shear decreasing gradually, but the timing on 
when the system becomes more vertically coherent varies among both 
the global and hurricane-regional model guidance. Most of the 
guidance shows significant or even rapid intensification in days 
3-5, and the NHC intensity forecast was raised once again during 
this time frame, but not as high as the HCCA or hurricane-regional 
models due to continuity constraints to the previous forecast. The 
day 5 forecast now shows Melissa becoming a major hurricane, and 
further upward adjustments may be necessary in subsequent cycles. 
The intensity forecast is also more uncertain than usual, in large 
part related to the track uncertainty.

Key Messages:
 
1. Melissa is expected to produce heavy rainfall across portions of
the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica through this weekend,
bringing a risk of significant flash flooding and landslides.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are possible in the southwestern peninsula
of Haiti where a Hurricane Watch is in effect.  A Tropical Storm
Watch is in effect for Jamaica.  Preparations to protect life and
property should be completed by Thursday.
 
3. There is significant uncertainty in the track and intensity
forecast of Melissa.  Interests elsewhere in Hispaniola and Cuba
should continue to monitor the latest forecasts.
