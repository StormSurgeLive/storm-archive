the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds,
conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was 
located by Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft near latitude 
15.7 North, longitude 74.6 West. Melissa may have reformed recently, 
with an estimated motion toward the east-southeast near 2 mph     
(4 km/h). A slow motion turning to the northeast and then north is 
expected to begin later today and tonight. A westward turn is then 
forecast to begin on Saturday with that motion continuing through 
Monday. On the forecast track, the center of Melissa is expected to 
move near or just south of Jamaica early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Gradual strengthening is forecast today, followed by rapid 
intensification this weekend. Melissa is forecast to become a 
hurricane by Saturday and a major hurricane by Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical 
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header 
WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti later this weekend and Jamaica beginning late this weekend or 
early next week. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin 
in Haiti tonight or Saturday and in Jamaica later this weekend.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring 10 to 20 inches of rain to 
portions of southwestern Haiti and eastern Jamaica through Monday, 
with locally higher amounts possible. Rainfall amounts of 6 to 12 
inches are expected across the rest of southern Haiti and the 
southern Dominican Republic. Additional heavy rainfall is likely 
beyond Monday. However, uncertainty in Melissaâ€™s track and forward 
speed reduces confidence in exact totals. Significant, 
life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides are expected 
in the southern Dominican Republic and eastern Jamaica, with 
catastrophic flash flooding and landslides anticipated in southern 
Haiti.

Across portions of northern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and 
western Jamaica, 3 to 5 inches of rain is expected through Monday. 
Flash and urban flooding will be possible. Flooding impacts will 
likely increase across western Jamaica next week.

Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at

STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding is likely along the coast of
Jamaica by Saturday in areas of onshore winds as tropical storm
conditions begin to reach the area.  However, there is a potential
risk of a more significant storm surge, especially along the south
coast of Jamaica, early next week.  Due to Melissa's slow motion and
large forecast uncertainty, it is still too soon to know exactly how
high the storm surge could reach.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions
of Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next several
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
