DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Melissa was located 
by NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 16.4 North, 
longitude 76.6 West. Melissa is moving toward the west near 3 mph  
(6 km/h). A slow westward motion is expected today, followed by a 
turn to the north and northeast on Monday and Tuesday. On the 
forecast track, the core of Melissa is expected to move near or 
over Jamaica on Tuesday, across southeastern Cuba Tuesday 
night, and across the southeastern Bahamas on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 140 mph (220 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Melissa is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional intensification is forecast over 
the next day or so, followed by fluctuations in intensity.  Melissa 
is expected to be a powerful major hurricane when making landfall in 
Jamaica Monday night or Tuesday morning and southeastern Cuba late 
Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated by aircraft dropsonde data 
is 953 mb (28.15 inches).

Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are likely occuring in Jamaica, with
hurricane conditions expected to begin by Monday. Tropical storm
conditions are expected in the warning area in Haiti today. The
potential for hurricane conditions in the watch area in Haiti have
diminished for today, but there is still a possibility of hurricane
conditions occurring there on Tuesday. Hurricane conditions are
possible in the watch area in eastern Cuba on Tuesday into
Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 15 to
30 inches to portions of southern Hispaniola and Jamaica through
Wednesday, with local maxima of 40 inches possible.  Catastrophic
flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely.
 
For eastern Cuba, total rainfall of 10 to 15 inches, with local
amounts to 20 inches, is expected by Tuesday into Wednesday
resulting in life-threatening flash flooding and numerous
landslides.
 
Over the Southeast Bahamas, total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches is

STORM SURGE: Life-threatening storm surge is likely along the south
coast of Jamaica late Monday through Tuesday morning.  Peak
storm surge heights could reach 9 to 13 feet above ground level,
near and to the east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall.
This storm surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
There is a potential for significant storm surge along the 
southeast coast of Cuba late Tuesday or Wednesday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions of
Hispaniola, Jamaica, eastern Cuba, and the Cayman Islands during the
next several days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
