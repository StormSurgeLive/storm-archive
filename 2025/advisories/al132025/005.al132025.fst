A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was 
located by Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft near latitude 
14.4 North, longitude 73.6 West. Melissa is moving slowly toward the 
west-northwest near 2 mph (4 km/h). A continued slow forward speed 
and a gradual turn to the northwest and north-northwest is expected 
during the next couple of days, followed by a turn back westward by 
the end of the week.  On the forecast track, Melissa is expected to 
approach Jamaica and the southwestern portion of Haiti later this 
week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some gradual strengthening is anticipated during the next few days, 
and Melissa could become a hurricane by Friday. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated by aircraft dropsonde data is 
1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti beginning late on Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions could
begin in Jamaica late on Thursday or Friday.
 
RAINFALL:  Melissa is expected to bring 5 to 10 inches of rain to
the southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica
through Saturday, with locally higher amounts possible. Additional
heavy rainfall is possible beyond Saturday; however, uncertainty in
Melissaâ€™s track and forward speed reduces confidence in exact
totals. Significant flash flooding and landslides are possible.
 
Across Puerto Rico, northern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and 
western Jamaica, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected through Saturday. 
Flash and urban flooding will be possible through at least Saturday.
