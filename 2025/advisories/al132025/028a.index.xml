DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Melissa was located 
near latitude 17.5 North, longitude 78.1 West. Melissa is moving 
toward the north-northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h). A turn toward the 
northeast with an increase in forward speed is expected later today, 
followed by a faster northeastward motion on Wednesday and Thursday. 
On the forecast track, the core of Melissa is expected to make 
landfall on Jamaica during the next several hours, move across 
southeastern Cuba Wednesday morning, and move across the 
southeastern or central Bahamas later on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 175 mph (280 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Melissa is a category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in strength is expected 
before Melissa makes landfall on Jamaica. Melissa is expected to 
reach Jamaica and southeastern Cuba as an extremely dangerous major 
hurricane, and it will still be at hurricane strength when it moves 
across the southeastern Bahamas.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195
miles (315 km). During the past few hours, Norman Manley 
International Airport in Kingston, Jamaica, reported a sustained 
wind of 43 mph (69 km/h) and a gust of 59 mph (93 km/h). Also 
during the past few hours, Sangster International Airport in Montego 
Bay, Jamaica, reported a sustained wind of 38 mph (61 km/h) and a 
gust of 54 mph (87 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 901 mb (26.61 inches). An 
Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is enroute to 
investigate Melissa.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occurring in Jamaica, and
catastrophic hurricane-force winds are expected to begin during 
the next few hours. Within the eyewall, total structural failure is 
likely, especially in higher elevation areas where wind speeds atop 
and on the windward sides of hills and mountains could be up to 30 
percent stronger.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in eastern Cuba
today, with hurricane conditions expected in the hurricane warning
area starting tonight into Wednesday morning. Tropical storm
conditions are expected in Haiti later today and Wednesday.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in the southeastern and central
Bahamas on Wednesday. Tropical storm conditions are expected and
hurricane conditions are possible in the Turks and Caicos Islands on
Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring rainfall of 15 to 30 inches
to portions of Jamaica and additional rainfall of 6 to 12 inches for
southern Hispaniola through Wednesday, with storm total local maxima
of 40 inches possible. Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous
landslides are likely.
 
For eastern Cuba, storm total rainfall of 10 to 20 inches, with
local amounts to 25 inches, is expected into Wednesday resulting in
life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding with
numerous landslides.
 
Over the Southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos, rain is
expected to develop later today and continue into Wednesday. Total
rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is expected to result in areas of flash
flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: A life-threatening storm surge is likely along the
south coast of Jamaica today. Peak storm surge heights could reach 9
to 13 feet above ground level, near and to the east of where the
center of Melissa makes landfall. This storm surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves. On the northwest coast
of Jamaica, near Montego Bay, there is the possibility of 2 to 4
feet of storm surge above ground level.
 
There is a potential for significant storm surge along the southeast
coast of Cuba late today or Wednesday. Peak storm surge heights
could reach 7 to 11 feet above normal tide levels, near and to the
east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall. This storm surge
will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
Storm surge of 4 to 6 ft above normally dry ground is possible in
the southeastern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands on Wednesday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions of
Hispaniola, Jamaica, eastern Cuba, and the Cayman Islands during the
next several days, likely causing life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. These swells will reach the Bahamas, the Turks
and Caicos Islands, and Bermuda later this week. Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Melissa Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
500 AM EDT Tue Oct 28 2025
 
Melissa has a circular, 10-n-mi-wide eye surrounded by a symmetric 
ring of very intense convection with cloud tops colder than -80 deg 
C. Radar data from Jamaica suggests that a secondary outer eyewall 
may have formed, which could signal that an eyewall replacement 
cycle is underway. The last couple of overnight center fixes by the 
Air Force Hurricane Hunters revealed 700-mb height falls within the 
eye, and dropsonde data indicated the central pressure had fallen to 
around 901 mb. A standard reduction of the peak 700-mb flight-level 
winds from that mission (165 kt) supports an initial intensity of 
150 kt. Conditions are deteriorating across Jamaica, where heavy 
rainfall and tropical storm conditions have spread across the 
island. NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft are scheduled 
to investigate the hurricane again this morning.

Melissa is moving slowly north-northeastward (025/4 kt). Over the 
next several days, the hurricane is expected to accelerate to the 
northeast within the flow ahead of an amplifying trough over the 
southeastern U.S. This steering flow will bring the core of Melissa 
across Jamaica today, over eastern Cuba early Wednesday, and across 
the southeastern or central Bahamas later on Wednesday. Then, the 
hurricane is forecast to pass near Bermuda Thursday night or early 
Friday. Overall, the near-term NHC track forecast is very similar to 
the previous one. At 72-120 h, the official forecast was adjusted to 
the left of the previous prediction based on the latest multi-model 
consensus aids and Google DeepMind ensemble guidance.

Near-term intensity fluctuations are possible this morning and will 
likely be driven by internal dynamic processes like eyewall 
replacement cycles. Regardless, Melissa will reach Jamaica as an 
extremely dangerous major hurricane within the next 12 h. While land 
interaction with Jamaica and eastern Cuba is expected to cause some 
weakening, Melissa is still forecast to pass over portions of the 
Bahamas as a strong hurricane on Wednesday. Increasing westerly 
shear is likely to impact Melissa later this week while the 
hurricane accelerates toward higher latitudes. As a result, the 
hurricane is forecast to have a broader and asymmetric wind field 
when it passes near Bermuda later this week. Some minor upward 
adjustments were made to the NHC intensity forecast during the 
middle portion of the period in agreement with the latest HCCA 
and GDMI aids. Melissa is forecast to become a strong extratropical 
cyclone over the North Atlantic by 96 h.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Jamaica: Remain sheltered! Catastrophic flash flooding, 
landslides, and destructive winds will continue through today, 
causing widespread infrastructure damage, power and communication 
outages, and isolated communities. Total structural failure is 
possible near the path of Melissa’s center. Along the southern 
coast, life-threatening storm surge and damaging waves are expected 
through the day. Failure to act may result in serious injury or loss 
of life.
 
2. Haiti and the Dominican Republic: Catastrophic flash flooding 
and landslides are expected across southwestern Haiti and southern 
portions of the Dominican Republic through midweek. In Haiti, 
extensive damage and isolation of communities is likely. Tropical 
storm conditions are expected later today and Wednesday.
 
3. Eastern Cuba: Heavy rainfall, flash flooding and landslides are 
expected soon. Life-threatening storm surge and damaging winds are 
likely to begin later today. Complete all preparations now.
 
4. Southeastern and Central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos: 
Hurricane conditions, life-threatening storm surge, and heavy 
rainfall are expected across portions of the southeastern and 
central Bahamas on Wednesday. Complete preparations by tonight and 
follow local official guidance. Tropical storm conditions, heavy 
rains, and significant storm surge are expected in the Turks and 
Caicos Islands on Wednesday.
