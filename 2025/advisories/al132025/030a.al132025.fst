Hurricane Wind Scale.  Melissa is expected to remain a powerful 
hurricane when it moves across Cuba, the Bahamas, and near 
Bermuda. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: The damaging winds are expected to gradually subside across 
Jamaica, but it is advised to remain in a safe shelter until 
sunrise.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in the warning area in Cuba 
later tonight through Wednesday morning. Tropical storm conditions 
are expected in Haiti tonight and Wednesday.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in the southeastern and central
Bahamas on Wednesday. Tropical storm conditions are expected and
hurricane conditions are possible in the Turks and Caicos Islands on
Wednesday.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible on Bermuda Thursday and Thursday
night.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring an additional 6 to 12 inches
across Jamaica, where storm total amounts will be between 12 to 24
inches. Isolated areas near 30 inches will be possible over
mountainous terrain. Ongoing catastrophic flash flooding and
numerous landslides will continue through Tuesday night.
 
For eastern Cuba, storm total rainfall of 10 to 20 inches is
expected through Wednesday, with local amounts to 25 inches expected
over mountainous terrain. This will cause life-threatening and
potentially catastrophic flash flooding with numerous landslides.
 
Over the Southeast Bahamas, storm total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches
is expected through Wednesday, which will result in areas of flash
flooding. For the Turks and Caicos, rainfall totals of 1 to 3
inches are expected. Heavy rain may begin to affect Bermuda Thursday
night.
 
Over southern Hispaniola, additional rainfall of 2 to 6 inches is
expected through Wednesday, with storm total local maxima of 40
inches possible.

STORM SURGE: On the northwest coast of Jamaica, near Montego Bay,
there is the possibility of 2 to 4 feet of storm surge above ground
level. Storm surge flooding on the southern coast of Jamaica should
subside later tonight.
 
There is a potential for significant storm surge along the southeast
coast of Cuba through early Wednesday. Peak storm surge heights
could reach 8 to 12 feet above normal tide levels, near and to the
east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall. This storm surge
will be accompanied by large and destructive waves. Minor coastal
flooding is possible in bays and inlets along the north coast of
eastern Cuba.
 
Storm surge of 5 to 8 ft above normally dry ground is possible in
the southeastern Bahamas on Wednesday, and 2 to 4 ft above normally
dry ground in the Turks and Caicos Islands on Wednesday.
 
Minor coastal flooding is expected along the coast of Haiti.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions of 
Hispaniola, Jamaica, eastern Cuba, and the Cayman Islands during the 
next day or so, causing life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions. These swells will reach the Bahamas and the Turks and 
Caicos Islands overnight, and Bermuda later this week. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
