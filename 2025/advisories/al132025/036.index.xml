* Bermuda
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area. Preparations should be rushed to

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Melissa was 
located near latitude 25.8 North, longitude 73.4 West. Melissa is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 21 mph (33 km/h), and the 
hurricane is expected to continue accelerating northeastward during 
the next couple of days. On the forecast track, the center of 
Melissa is expected to pass to the northwest of Bermuda later today 
and tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 105 mph (165 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Slight strengthening is possible today before 
weakening likely begins on Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles
(315 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 968 mb (28.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions will begin on Bermuda later today,
with hurricane conditions expected there tonight.
 
RAINFALL: Over the Southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos,
an additional inch of rain is possible, with storm total maxima up
to 10 inches in the southeast Bahamas and storm total maxima up to
4 inches across the Turks and Caicos. Any residual flooding should
be waning.
 
Over portions of Hispaniola, additional rainfall of 1 to 3 inches
is possible this morning, with storm total accumulations up to 40
inches possible in southern Hispaniola.
 
Across Bermuda, outer bands east of Melissa’s track may bring up to
an inch (25 mm) of rain today and tonight.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf

STORM SURGE: Water levels should continue to subside through the 
morning for the southeastern Bahamas.

Coastal flooding from storm surge is possible in areas of onshore 
winds for Bermuda.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa will continue to affect portions
of Hispaniola, Cuba, the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands
during the next couple of days, and will spread toward Bermuda later
today, causing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Melissa Discussion Number  36
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
500 AM EDT Thu Oct 30 2025
 
Melissa appears slightly better organized this morning. Overnight 
GMI passive microwave images showed a closed mid-level eyewall, and 
there have been hints of a ragged eye feature in recent conventional 
satellite images with deep convection surrounding the center. Based 
on these developments, the initial intensity is raised to 90 kt for 
this advisory, which is supported by a 5.0/90 kt Dvorak 
classification from SAB. A comparison of the 89 and 37 GHz GMI 
images indicates the vortex is tilted toward the northeast with 
height, likely the result of southwesterly shear over the hurricane. 
An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to 
investigate the hurricane this morning.

Melissa is moving quickly northeastward (030/18 kt) away from the 
Bahamas. An even faster northeastward motion is expected during the 
next couple of days as Melissa moves within the flow between a 
mid-level trough over the southeastern U.S. and a subtropical ridge 
over the central Atlantic. The tightly clustered track guidance 
shows the center of Melissa passing to the northwest of Bermuda 
tonight, and a Hurricane Warning remains in effect for the island. 
Then, Melissa should pass near the southeastern tip of Newfoundland 
as a strong extratropical cyclone on Friday night before moving 
across the North Atlantic this weekend. No notable changes were 
made to the NHC track forecast with this update.

Slight additional strengthening is possible today while Melissa 
remains over warm waters in a diffluent upper-level environment. 
However, the shear is forecast to become prohibitively strong later 
tonight and Friday, and Melissa will reach much cooler waters during 
the next 24-48 h. As a result, Melissa is expected to quickly lose 
tropical characteristics once it passes Bermuda, and it is forecast 
to become a strong post-tropical cyclone over the North Atlantic by 
Friday night or early Saturday. The latest NHC intensity forecast 
remains on the high end of the guidance envelope, and more closely 
follows the global models during the extratropical phase later in 
the forecast period.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Bermuda: Hurricane conditions are expected in Bermuda tonight, 
with tropical storm conditions beginning later today. Preparations 
should be rushed to completion.

2. Post-storm safety:  Follow advice of local officials as you may 
need to remain sheltered after the storm due to downed power lines 
and flooding. Any flooding across the Bahamas is expected to subside 
today. Flooding across Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola could persist 
for another few days. Ensure generators are properly ventilated and 
placed outside at least 20 feet away from dwellings and garages to 
avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. During clean up, be careful when 
using chainsaws and power tools. Drink plenty of water to avoid heat 
exhaustion.
