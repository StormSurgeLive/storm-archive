DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was 
located by Air Force reconnaissance aircraft near latitude 15.9 
North, longitude 75.0 West. Melissa is drifting toward the 
east-southeast near 1 mph (2 km/h). A slow drift toward the 
northeast and north is expected to begin later today and tonight.  A 
westward drift is then forecast to begin on Saturday and continue 
through Monday.  On the forecast track, the center of Melissa is 
expected to move near or just south of Jamaica early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Gradual strengthening is forecast over the next day or so, followed 
by rapid intensification this weekend.  Melissa is forecast to 
become a hurricane by Saturday and a major hurricane by Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated by aircraft dropsonde data is 
1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti on Saturday and Jamaica beginning late Saturday or Sunday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in Haiti later today
and in Jamaica on Saturday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring 8 to 14 inches of rain to
southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica
through Sunday night, with locally higher amounts possible.
Additional heavy rainfall is likely beyond Sunday night; however,
uncertainty in Melissaâ€™s track and forward speed reduces confidence
in exact totals. Significant, life-threatening flash flooding and
numerous landslides are expected in the southern Dominican Republic
and eastern Jamaica, with catastrophic flash flooding and landslides
anticipated in southern Haiti.
 
Across northern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and western
Jamaica, 3 to 5 inches of rain are expected through Sunday night.
Flash and urban flooding will be possible through Sunday night.
Flooding impacts may increase across western Jamaica next week.

Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding is likely along the coast of
Jamaica by Saturday in areas of onshore winds as tropical storm
conditions begin to reach the area.  However, there is a potential
risk of a more significant storm surge, especially along the south
coast of Jamaica, early next week.  Due to Melissa's slow motion and
large forecast uncertainty, it is still too soon to know exactly how
high the storm surge could reach.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions
of Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next several
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
