DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Melissa was located 
near latitude 16.8 North, longitude 78.4 West. Melissa is moving 
toward the north-northeast near 2 mph (4 km/h). A turn toward the 
northeast with an increase in forward speed is expected today, 
followed by a faster northeastward motion on Wednesday and Thursday. 
On the forecast track, the core of Melissa is expected to move over 
Jamaica today, across southeastern Cuba Wednesday morning, and 
across the southeastern or central Bahamas later on Wednesday.
 
Data from the Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters indicate that 
maximum sustained winds are near 175 mph (280 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Melissa is a category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Some fluctuations in intensity are likely 
before Melissa makes landfall on Jamaica later today. However, 
Melissa is expected to reach Jamaica and southeastern Cuba as an 
extremely dangerous major hurricane, and will still be at hurricane 
strength when it moves across the southeastern Bahamas.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195
miles (315 km). Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston, 
Jamaica, recently reported a sustained wind of 40 mph (65 km/h) 
and a gust of 52 mph (83 km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Hurricane 
Hunter observations is 901 mb (26.61 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occurring in Jamaica, and 
catastrophic and life-threatening hurricane-force winds are expected 
to begin this morning. Within the eyewall, total structural failure 
is likely, especially in higher elevation areas where wind speeds 
atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains could be up to 
30 percent stronger.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in eastern Cuba 
today, with hurricane conditions expected in the hurricane warning 
area starting tonight into Wednesday morning. Tropical storm 
conditions are expected in Haiti later today and Wednesday.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in the southeastern and central 
Bahamas on Wednesday. Tropical storm conditions are expected and 
hurricane conditions are possible in the Turks and Caicos Islands on 
Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring rainfall of 15 to 30 inches
to portions of Jamaica and additional rainfall of 6 to 12 inches for
southern Hispaniola through Wednesday, with storm total local maxima
of 40 inches possible. Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous
landslides are likely.
 
For eastern Cuba, storm total rainfall of 10 to 20 inches, with
local amounts to 25 inches, is expected into Wednesday resulting in
life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding with
numerous landslides.
 
Over the Southeast Bahamas, total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is 
expected today into Wednesday resulting in areas of flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: A life-threatening storm surge is likely along the 
south coast of Jamaica today. Peak storm surge heights could reach 9 
to 13 feet above ground level, near and to the east of where the 
center of Melissa makes landfall. This storm surge will be 
accompanied by large and destructive waves. On the northwest coast 
of Jamaica, near Montego Bay, there is the possibility of 2 to 4 
feet of storm surge above ground level.
 
There is a potential for significant storm surge along the southeast
coast of Cuba late today or Wednesday. Peak storm surge heights
could reach 7 to 11 feet above normal tide levels, near and to the
east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall. This storm surge
will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
Storm surge of 4 to 6 ft above normally dry ground is possible in
the southeastern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands on Wednesday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions of 
Hispaniola, Jamaica, eastern Cuba, and the Cayman Islands during the 
next several days, likely causing life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions. These swells will reach the Bahamas, the Turks 
and Caicos Islands, and Bermuda later this week. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Melissa Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
1100 PM EDT Mon Oct 27 2025
 
Both Air Force and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft have been
investigating Melissa this evening.  They found that the system
is maintaining category 5 intensity with the central pressure near
903 mb and peak 700 mb flight-level and tail Doppler radar winds
supporting 150 kt for the current intensity.  The hurricane
continues to exhibit a well-defined eye about 10 n mi in diameter
embedded within extremely cold cloud tops to near -90 deg C.
Upper-level outflow remains well defined over the system.  Although
such intense tropical cyclones typically undergo an eyewall
replacement, radar observations from Jamaica do not show this
occurring thus far.
 
After remaining nearly stationary over the past few hours, Melissa 
now appears to be moving slowly north-northeastward with an initial 
motion estimate of around 020/02 kt.  During the next few days, a 
mid-tropospheric trough is forecast to deepen near the southeastern 
U.S. coast.  This should result in Melissa moving 
north-northeastward to northeastward with increasing forward speed 
through the forecast period.  The official forecast is similar to 
the previous one and also close the tightly-clustered consensus and 
Google DeepMind guidance.  The only significant difference in the 
track forecast compared to earlier today is a slower motion during 
the first couple of days, which delays the expected arrival of the 
core of Melissa over Jamaica, eastern Cuba, and the southeastern or 
Central Bahamas.
 
Some fluctuations in intensity could still occur during the short
period before Melissa reaches Jamaica.  The primary influence on
the hurricane's intensity during the next 36 hours will be the
interaction with land.  Some weakening is anticipated after the
system moves over Jamaica and eastern Cuba.  More substantial
weakening is likely after the system moves past Cuba and over the
southwestern Atlantic, where the vertical wind shear is likely to
increase significantly.  The official intensity forecast is close
to the latest LGEM guidance.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Jamaica: Remain in your safe shelter. Catastrophic flash flooding
and numerous landslides are expected through Tuesday. The eyewall’s
destructive winds may cause total structural failure, particularly
in higher elevations, leading to widespread infrastructural damage,
prolonged power and communication outages, and isolated communities.
Along the southern coast, life-threatening storm surge and damaging
waves are anticipated through Tuesday. Failure to take immediate
action may result in serious injury or significant loss of life.
 
2. Haiti and the Dominican Republic:  Catastrophic flash flooding
and landslides are expected across southwestern Haiti and southern
portions of the Dominican Republic through midweek.  In Haiti,
extensive infrastructural damage and isolation of communities is
likely. Tropical storm conditions are expected late Tuesday and
Wednesday.
 
3. Eastern Cuba:  Heavy rainfall with life-threatening flash
flooding and landslides is expected to begin shortly.
Life-threatening storm surge and damaging winds are expected late
Tuesday and Tuesday night.  Preparations should be rushed to
completion.
 
4. Southeast and Central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos: Hurricane
conditions, life-threatening storm surge, and heavy rainfall are
expected across portions of the southeast and central Bahamas on
Wednesday. Residents should follow advice given by local officials
and be sure to have preparations complete by Tuesday night.
Tropical storm conditions, heavy rains, and a significant storm
surge is expected in the Turks and Caicos Islands on Wednesday.
