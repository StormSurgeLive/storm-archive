DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Melissa was
located near latitude 16.5 North, longitude 78.3 West. Melissa is
moving toward the west-northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h). A slow turn 
toward the northwest and north is expected later today, followed by 
a turn toward the northeast and a faster forward speed on Tuesday. 
A northeastward motion is expected on Wednesday and Thursday. On 
the forecast track, the core of Melissa is expected to move over 
Jamaica tonight and early Tuesday, across southeastern Cuba Tuesday 
night, and across the southeastern Bahamas on Wednesday.
 
Reports from an Air force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds are now near 175 mph       
(280 km/h) with higher gusts.  Melissa is a category 5 hurricane on 
the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in 
intensity are likely before Melissa makes landfall on Jamaica on 
Tuesday.  However, Melissa is expected to reach Jamaica and 
southeastern Cuba as an extremely powerful major hurricane, and will 
still be at hurricane strength when it moves across the southeastern 
Bahamas.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195
miles (315 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from the latest Air Force 
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft data is 906 mb (26.76 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occurring in Jamaica, and
catastrophic and life-threatening hurricane-force wind conditions
are expected to begin tonight and continue into early Tuesday.
Within the eyewall, total structural failure is likely, especially
in higher elevation areas where wind speeds atop and on the windward
sides of hills and mountains could be up to 30 percent stronger.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in eastern Cuba on
Tuesday, with hurricane conditions expected to begin in the
hurricane warning area by Tuesday evening. Tropical storm conditions
are expected in Haiti late Tuesday and Wednesday.
 
Tropical storm and hurricane conditions are possible in the
southeastern and central Bahamas, as well as the Turks and Caicos
Islands, on Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring rainfall of 15 to 30 inches
to portions of Jamaica and additional rainfall of 8 to 16 inches for
southern Hispaniola through Wednesday, with storm total local maxima
of 40 inches possible.  Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous
landslides are likely.
 
For eastern Cuba, storm total rainfall of 15 to 20 inches, with
local higher amounts, is expected by Monday into Wednesday resulting
in life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding with
numerous landslides.
 
Over the Southeast Bahamas, total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches is
expected Tuesday into Wednesday resulting in areas of flash
flooding.

Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: A life-threatening storm surge is likely along the 
south coast of Jamaica tonight and on Tuesday.  Peak storm surge 
heights could reach 9 to 13 feet above ground level, near and to the 
east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall. This storm surge 
will be accompanied by large and destructive waves. On the northwest 
coast of Jamaica, near Montego Bay, there is the possibility of 1 to 
3 feet of storm surge above ground level.
 
There is a potential for significant storm surge along the southeast
coast of Cuba late Tuesday or Wednesday. Peak storm surge heights
could reach 7 to 11 feet above normal tide levels, near and to the
east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall. This storm surge
will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
Storm surge of 4 to 6 ft above normally dry ground is possible in
the southeastern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands on Wednesday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions of
Hispaniola, Jamaica, eastern Cuba, and the Cayman Islands during the
next several days, and the Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands,
and Bermuda later this week. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
