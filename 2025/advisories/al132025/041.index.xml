information on impacts in Canada, see the Canadian Hurricane Center
website at https://weather.gc.ca/hurricane/index_e.html
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone 
Melissa was located near latitude 39.0 North, longitude 60.5 West. 
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the northeast near 48 mph 
(78 km/h). This general motion is expected to continue into 
Saturday, followed by a gradual slowdown and turn toward the 
east-northeast later this weekend. On the forecast track, the center 
of Melissa is expected to pass to the southeast of the Avalon 
Peninsula of Newfoundland as a post-tropical cyclone tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast during the next 
few days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275
miles (445 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 973 mb (28.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Gusty winds are possible over the southern Avalon Peninsula of
Newfoundland tonight.
 
RAINFALL: A brief period of heavy rain is possible over the southern
Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland tonight.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa will continue to affect portions
of the Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Bermuda, the
Northeastern United States coast and portions of Atlantic Canada
during the next couple of days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system. Additional information on this system can be 
found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service,

Post-Tropical Cyclone Melissa Discussion Number  41
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
1100 AM AST Fri Oct 31 2025
 
Melissa no longer possesses organized convection, and is now merging 
with a warm front extending eastward and a cold front extending 
toward the southwest.  Therefore, Melissa is now a post-tropical 
cyclone.  Melissa still has hurricane-force winds, especially in 
the southeastern semicircle, as shown in Thursday evening ASCAT data 
and also shown in the latest global model fields for the current 
time of 15Z.  The initial intensity is lowered slightly to 75 kt, 
mainly based on forecast continuity.  Large swells from Melissa are 
spreading over much of the western Atlantic, resulting in hazardous 
marine conditions in this region.

The post-tropical cyclone is racing northeastward, or 40 degrees at 
42 kt.  This motion should continue into Saturday within the flow 
ahead of an upper-level trough.  Track guidance is in excellent 
agreement that the center of post-tropical Melissa will pass near, 
but to the southeast of, the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland late 
tonight, bringing the potential for some gusty winds and heavy rain. 
Later this weekend, Melissa is forecast to turn east-northeastward 
while interacting with a higher-latitude, upper-level low over the 
North Atlantic.  Very little change has been made to the NHC track 
forecast, which lies very close to the average of the GFS and ECMWF 
deterministic models (GFEX).

Global models indicate that Melissa will continue to be a large and 
strong extratropical cyclone for the next couple of days as it 
traverses the North Atlantic.  Only gradual weakening is expected 
through the weekend, with the system forecast to have 
hurricane-force winds for another 24 h and still be a storm-force 
cyclone in 60 hours.  The NHC intensity forecast is at the high end 
of the guidance suite through 60 hours.  By early next week, global 
models show the large system weakening further as it begins to join 
up with a large and elongated area of low pressure over the far 
northeastern Atlantic, and the system should be absorbed and 
dissipated just beyond the 96-hour point.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Post-storm safety:  Follow advice of local officials and avoid
areas of downed power lines and flooding. Ensure generators are 
properly ventilated and placed outside at least 20 feet away from 
dwellings and garages to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. During 
clean up, be careful when using chainsaws and power tools. Drink 
plenty of water to avoid heat exhaustion.
