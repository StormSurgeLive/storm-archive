DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was
located by an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft near latitude 14.3 
North, longitude 74.5 West.  Melissa is drifting toward the west 
near 1 mph (2 km/h).  A slow forward speed and a gradual turn to 
the northwest or north-northwest is forecast during the next couple 
of days, followed by a westward turn by this weekend.  On the 
forecast track,  Melissa is expected to be nearer to Jamaica and 
the southwestern portion of Haiti later this week.

Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some slow strengthening is forecast during the next few 
days, and Melissa could become a hurricane by Friday, with more 
substantial intensification forecast by this weekend. 

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti beginning on Friday.  Tropical storm conditions could begin in
Jamaica late on Thursday or on Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring 5 to 10 inches of rain to the
southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica
through Saturday, with locally higher amounts possible.  Additional
heavy rainfall is possible beyond Saturday.  However, uncertainty
in Melissaâ€™s track and forward speed reduces confidence in exact
totals.  Significant, life-threatening flash flooding and numerous
landslides are possible.
 
Across Puerto Rico, northern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and
western Jamaica, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected through Saturday.
Flash and urban flooding will be possible through at least Saturday.
