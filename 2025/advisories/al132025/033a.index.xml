DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Melissa was 
located by Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near 
latitude 22.1 North, longitude 75.3 West. Melissa is moving toward 
the northeast near 15 mph (24 km/h). An accelerating northeastward 
motion is expected during the next few days. On the forecast track, 
the core of Melissa is expected to move across the southeastern or 
central Bahamas this afternoon and evening, and pass near or to the 
west of Bermuda late Thursday and Thursday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some slight strengthening is possible today into tomorrow
with little change in strength thereafter.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185
miles (295 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from aircraft dropsonde data 
is 974 mb (28.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are occurring within the warning area in
Cuba but expected to begin subsiding this afternoon. Tropical storm
conditions are expected in Haiti today.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in the southeastern and central
Bahamas today. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Turks
and Caicos Islands today.
 
Hurricane conditions are now expected on Bermuda late Thursday and
Thursday night with Tropical storm conditions expected earlier on
Thursday.
 
RAINFALL: For eastern Cuba, heavy rains will continue this morning,
tapering off this afternoon.  Storm total rainfall of 10 to 20
inches with local amounts to 25 inches over mountainous terrain is
expected. This will cause life-threatening and potentially
catastrophic flash flooding with numerous landslides.
 
Over the Southeast Bahamas, storm total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches
are expected today, which will result in areas of flash flooding.
For the Turks and Caicos rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are
expected. Heavy rain may begin to affect Bermuda on Thursday or
Thursday night.
 
Rainfall has diminished across Jamaica.  However, additional
scattered showers are possible with additional rainfall amounts of
2 to 4 inches.  This will bring storm total amounts to 12 to 24
inches, with isolated areas of 30 inches possible over mountainous
terrain. Ongoing catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides
will continue today and into tonight.
 
Over southern Hispaniola, additional rainfall of 4 to 6 inches are
expected today, with storm total local maxima of 40 inches possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge of 4 to 7 ft above normally dry ground is
possible in the southeastern Bahamas today, and minor coastal
flooding is possible in the Turks and Caicos Islands today.
 
Minor coastal flooding is possible in bays and inlets along the
north coast of eastern Cuba and minor coastal flooding is expected
along the coast of Haiti.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa will continue to affect portions
of Hispaniola, Jamaica, eastern Cuba, the Cayman Islands during the
next day or so, and now affecting the Bahamas and the Turks and
Caicos Islands, and will spread toward Bermuda later this week,
causing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Melissa Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
1100 AM EDT Wed Oct 29 2025
 
Melissa is moving back offshore, now in the Southwestern Atlantic 
Ocean. The NOAA hurricane hunter aircraft flew around Cuba and more 
recently was able to make a fix of Melissa just offshore. This 
matches the latest view from the GOES-19 mesoscale sector and radar 
out of Camaguey, Cuba. However, the smaller core that Melissa had 
stubbornly maintained over the past few days has been destroyed by 
the higher terrain of Cuba, and a larger core structure is 
developing. This has led to a significant expansion of the 50-kt 
wind radii on the eastern side of the hurricane. Land interaction 
also appears to have lead to additional weakening of the the maximum 
sustained winds that are now estimated to be around 85 kt, with the 
pressure up to 974 mb based on the first NOAA-P3 aircraft fix. This 
may still be a little generous given the aircraft wind data thus 
far. An Air Force Reserve reconnaissance mission will also be 
sampling Melissa later today.
 
The hurricane is continuing to slowly accelerate, now estimated to
be moving to the northeast at 030/12 kt. Melissa is expected to
continue accelerating northeastward during the next several days as
the hurricane is picked up by a very large an amplified upper-level
trough currently digging into the southeastern United States. This
motion will bring the core of the hurricane over portions of the
southeastern and central Bahamas over the next several hours. After
today, the track models remain tightly clustered on the center of
Melissa passing just to the northwest of Bermuda late Thursday and
Thursday night. The center of the hurricane is a little bit further
to the west emerging off Cuba, and the overall track guidance has
nudged a little bit further west this cycle, and the NHC track
forecast was also nudged in that direction, continuing to blend the
reliable consensus aids with the Google DeepMind ensemble mean
(GDMI).
 
Now that Melissa is back offshore, it has a short-term opportunity
for the hurricane to re-intensify a little as long as the larger
core that has developed is able to reorganize. Shear does start to
increase over the next 24-36 h, but the shear vector is also in the
same direction as the forward motion of the storm, which could
still allow some core reorganization of the convection while the
hurricane remains over warm 27-28 C sea-surface temperatures. Thus,
the short-term NHC forecast shows a little bit of intensification
over the next 12-24 h before weakening begins by 36 h.
Extratropical transition is expected to be well underway at or just
after Melissa passes by Bermuda, with the global model fields and
model-simulated satellite imagery show Melissa quickly losing
tropical characteristics and becoming an extratropical cyclone by 60
h. However, Melissa will still likely be a formidable extratropical
cyclone as it moves up into the Canadian Maritimes by this weekend
into early next week. The NHC intensity forecast is in good
agreement with the HAFS model guidance and HFIP Corrected Consensus
approach (HCCA).
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Eastern Cuba: Life-threatening storm surge, flash flooding and
landslides, and damaging winds are ongoing through this afternoon.
Remain in a safe shelter.
 
2. Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos: Hurricane conditions,
life-threatening storm surge, and heavy rainfall are expected across
portions of the southeastern and central Bahamas today. Find a safe
shelter and follow local official guidance. Tropical storm
conditions, heavy rains, and significant storm surge are expected in
the Turks and Caicos Islands today.
 
3. Haiti and the Dominican Republic: Catastrophic flash flooding and
landslides are expected across portions of Haiti and the Dominican
Republic through today. In Haiti, extensive damage and isolation of
communities is likely. Tropical storm conditions are expected
through this afternoon.
 
4. Bermuda: Hurricane conditions and heavy rainfall are expected in
Bermuda beginning late Thursday and continuing through Thursday
night.
 
5. Post-storm safety in impacted areas:  Follow advice of local
officials as you may need to remain sheltered after the storm due to
downed power lines and flooded areas.  Ensure generators are
properly ventilated and placed outside at least 20 feet away from
dwellings and garages to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. During
clean up, be careful when using chainsaws and power tools. Drink
plenty of water to avoid heat exhaustion.
