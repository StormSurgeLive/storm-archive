PORTIONS OF HISPANIOLA AND JAMAICA INTO THE WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM EDT...0600 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.5N 74.7W
ABOUT 280 MI...450 KM SSE OF KINGSTON JAMAICA
ABOUT 325 MI...520 KM SSW OF PORT AU PRINCE HAITI
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 280 DEGREES AT 2 MPH...4 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1003 MB...29.62 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the
Dominican Republic to Port-Au-Prince
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Jamaica
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba
should monitor the progress of Melissa.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was
located near latitude 14.5 North, longitude 74.7 West. Melissa is
moving toward the west near 2 mph (4 km/h). A slow forward speed 
and a gradual turn to the northwest or north-northwest is forecast 
during the next day or two, followed by a westward turn by the 
weekend.  On the forecast track,  Melissa is expected to be nearer 
to Jamaica and the southwestern portion of Haiti during the next 
couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some slow strengthening is forecast during the next day or 
two, with more substantial intensification expected by the 
weekend.  Melissa is forecast to become a hurricane in a couple of 
days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti beginning on Friday.  Tropical storm conditions could begin in
Jamaica tonight or on Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring 5 to 10 inches of rain to the
southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica
through Saturday, with locally higher amounts possible.  Additional
heavy rainfall is possible beyond Saturday.  However, uncertainty
in Melissaâ€™s track and forward speed reduces confidence in exact
totals.  Significant, life-threatening flash flooding and numerous
landslides are possible.
 
Across Puerto Rico, northern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and
western Jamaica, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected through Saturday.
Flash and urban flooding will be possible through at least Saturday.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions 
of Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next several
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

      <title>Tropical Storm Melissa Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Tropical Storm Melissa Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
1100 PM EDT Wed Oct 22 2025

Air Force and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft observations and 
satellite imagery indicate that Melissa remains a sheared tropical 
cyclone, With The low-level center of the storm situated to the 
west and northwest of the main areas of thunderstorms.  The 
convection continue to be very deep with cloud tops to -80 deg C or 
colder.  There is some evidence of a convective banding feature over 
the southern portion of the circulation, but the overall cloud 
pattern is not well organized.  Upper-level outflow continues to be 
restricted to the west of the storm due to the west-northwesterly 
shear.  Tail Doppler data from the NOAA aircraft show a 
significant eastward tilt of the vortex with height.  Observations 
from the Hurricane Hunters indicate that the central pressure is not 
falling at this time, and that the maximum winds remain near 45 kt.  
This is also supported by objective satellite-derived intensity 
estimates from UW-CIMSS.

Center fixes from the aircraft show that Melissa is still moving 
very slowly, at around 270/2 kt.  In the short term, the cyclone is 
expected to turn northwestward to northward in a weakness in the 
mid-level ridge.  In 48 hours or so, a weak ridge is expected to 
build to the north of Melissa which should induce a westward turn.  
Around the end of the forecast period, the ridge is expected to  
weaken and the system is predicted to turn to the right.  The 
official track forecast is very similar to the previous one and 
lies between the latest HCCA corrected consensus and the simple 
dynamical model consensus.   This is somewhat west of the latest 
Google DeepMind ensemble mean forecast.  There continues to be a 
large spread in the guidance models, indicating less than normal 
confidence in the track forecast, especially around day 5.

Melissa is likely to continue to be influenced by significant 
westerly vertical wind shear during the next day or two, so only 
slow strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours.  Later in 
the forecast period, the global models show a relaxation of the 
shear.  This, along with the very high oceanic heat content over 
the area, could result in significant strengthening.  The official 
intensity forecast is similar to the previous one, and very close 
to the HCCA and FSU Superensemble guidance.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Melissa is forecast to meander over the central Caribbean Sea and
could potentially become a major hurricane by late this weekend or 
early next week.  Interests in Jamaica, Haiti, Cuba, and the 
Dominican Republic are urged to continue monitoring the latest 
forecasts.
 
2. Due to Melissaâ€™s slow motion, the risk of a prolonged period of
strong winds, possibly lasting for a day or more, is increasing for
Jamaica and the Tiburon peninsula of Haiti.  Preparations to protect
life and property should be rushed to completion, since strong
winds could begin in these areas as early as late Thursday or
Friday and continue increasing over the weekend.
 
3. Melissa is expected to produce heavy rainfall across portions of
the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica through this weekend,
bringing a risk of significant, life-threatening flash flooding and
numerous landslides.
