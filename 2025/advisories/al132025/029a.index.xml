DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Melissa was located 
over western Jamaica near latitude 18.2 North, longitude 78.0 West. 
Melissa is moving toward the north-northeast near 8 mph (13 km/h). A 
turn toward the northeast with an increase in forward speed is 
expected later today, followed by a faster northeastward motion on 
Wednesday and Thursday. On the forecast track, the core of Melissa 
will cross western Jamaica during the next few hours and then move 
back into the Caribbean Sea.  After that, the center is expected to 
move across southeastern Cuba early Wednesday morning, and move 
across the southeastern or central Bahamas later on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are now near 165 mph (270 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Melissa is a category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Continued weakening is expected while the 
center is over Jamaica. However, Melissa is expected to reach
southeastern Cuba as an extremely dangerous major hurricane, and it 
will still be a strong hurricane when it moves across the 
southeastern Bahamas.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195
miles (315 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 899 mb (26.55 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Catastrophic hurricane-force winds are spreading over
Jamaica within the eyewall of Melissa.  Total structural failure
is likely near the path of Melissa, especially in higher elevation
areas where wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and
mountains could be up to 30 percent stronger.  Do not venture out
in the eye as winds will rapidly increase within the backside of the
eyewall.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in eastern Cuba
during the next few hours, with hurricane conditions expected in 
the hurricane warning area starting tonight into Wednesday morning. 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in Haiti later today and 
Wednesday.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in the southeastern and central
Bahamas on Wednesday. Tropical storm conditions are expected and
hurricane conditions are possible in the Turks and Caicos Islands on
Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring rainfall of 15 to 30 inches
to portions of Jamaica and additional rainfall of 6 to 8 inches with
localized maximum to 12 inches for southern Hispaniola through
Wednesday, with storm total local maxima of 40 inches possible.
Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely.
 
For eastern Cuba, storm total rainfall of 10 to 20 inches, with
local amounts to 25 inches, is expected into Wednesday resulting in
life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding with
numerous landslides.
 
Over the Southeast Bahamas, rain is expected to develop later today
and continue into Wednesday.  Total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is
expected to result in areas of flash flooding. For the Turks and
Caicos rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches are expected.  Heavy rain
may begin to affect Bermuda Thursday night.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: A life-threatening storm surge is likely along the
south coast of Jamaica today. Peak storm surge heights could reach
9 to 13 feet above ground level, near and to the east of where the
center of Melissa makes landfall. This storm surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves. On the northwest coast
of Jamaica, near Montego Bay, there is the possibility of 2 to 4
feet of storm surge above ground level.
 
There is a potential for significant storm surge along the southeast
coast of Cuba late today or Wednesday. Peak storm surge heights
could reach 8 to 12 feet above normal tide levels, near and to the
east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall. This storm surge
will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
Storm surge of 5 to 8 ft above normally dry ground is possible in
the southeastern Bahamas on Wednesday, and 2 to 4 ft above normally
dry ground in the Turks and Caicos Islands on Wednesday.
 
Minor coastal flooding is expected along the coast of Haiti.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions of
Hispaniola, Jamaica, eastern Cuba, and the Cayman Islands during the
next day or two, likely causing life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. These swells will reach the Bahamas, the Turks
and Caicos Islands, and Bermuda later this week. Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Melissa Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
1100 AM EDT Tue Oct 28 2025
 
Reports from Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft
show that Melissa has strengthened since the last advisory.  The
central pressure inside the 15 n mi wide eye has fallen to near
892 mb, and the NOAA aircraft reported flight-level winds of 172 kt 
at 700 mb.  Based on these data, the the initial intensity has been 
increased to 160 kt.
 
The initial motion is now 025/8. This general motion should 
continue with some increase in forward speed, with the center 
making landfall in Jamaica in a couple of hours and reaching 
eastern Cuba late tonight or early Wednesday. After that, a faster 
motion toward the northeast should bring the center through the 
southeastern and central Bahamas on Wednesday and near Bermuda 
Thursday or Thursday night. After passing Bermuda the cyclone 
should continue quickly northeastward into the north Atlantic. The 
new forecast track is similar to the previous track through 36 h 
and a little north of the previous track after that time.

Melissa should weaken over Jamaica as the inner core gets disrupted 
by the mountainous terrain.  However, the cyclone should maintain 
major hurricane status until the center reaches eastern Cuba.  
After leaving Cuba, Melissa should encounter increasing 
southwesterly vertical shear that should cause steady weakening, 
although the cyclone should still be at hurricane strength when it 
passes near Bermuda. Based on global model guidance, Melissa is 
forecast to become a strong extratropical cyclone over the North 
Atlantic by 96 h.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Jamaica: THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND LIFE-THREATENING 
SITUATION! TAKE COVER NOW! Catastrophic winds with total 
structural failure are liklely near the path of Melissa’s center. 
Catstrophic flash flooding, landslides, and destructive winds are 
expected across the remainder of the island causing widespread 
infrastructure damage, power and communication outages, and isolated 
communities.  Along the southern coast, life-threatening storm surge 
and damaging waves are expected through the day.
 
2. Haiti and the Dominican Republic: Catastrophic flash flooding
and landslides are expected across southwestern Haiti and southern
portions of the Dominican Republic through midweek. In Haiti,
extensive damage and isolation of communities is likely. Tropical
storm conditions are expected later today and Wednesday.
 
3. Eastern Cuba: Heavy rainfall, flash flooding and landslides are
expected soon. Life-threatening storm surge and damaging winds are
likely to begin later today. Complete all preparations now.
 
4. Southeastern and Central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos:
Hurricane conditions, life-threatening storm surge, and heavy
rainfall are expected across portions of the southeastern and
central Bahamas on Wednesday. Complete preparations by tonight and
follow local official guidance. Tropical storm conditions, heavy
rains, and significant storm surge are expected in the Turks and
Caicos Islands on Wednesday.

Hurricane Melissa Tropical Cyclone Update
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
100 PM EDT Tue Oct 28 2025

...CATEGORY 5 MELISSA MAKES LANDFALL IN JAMAICA...
...ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL HURRICANE LANDFALLS ON RECORD IN THE 
ATLANTIC BASIN...

Melissa has made landfall in southwestern Jamaica near New Hope with 
estimated maximum sustained winds of 185 mph (295 km/h) and an  
estimated minimum central pressure of 892 mb (26.34 inches).

THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND LIFE-THREATENING SITUATION! Do 
not leave your shelter as the eye passes over, as winds will 
quickly, and rapidly increase on the other side of the eye. 
Residents should remain in place through the passage of these 
life-threatening conditions. To protect yourself from wind, the 
best thing you can do is put as many walls as possible between you 
and the outside. An interior room without windows, ideally one where 
you can also avoid falling trees, is the safest place you can be in 
a building. You can cover yourself with a mattress and wear a 
helmet for added protection.

The next position update will be provided with the intermediate 
advisory at 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC).
