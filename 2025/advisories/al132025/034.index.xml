products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Melissa was 
located near latitude 22.9 North, longitude 74.8 West. Melissa is 
moving toward the northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h). An accelerating 
northeastward motion is expected during the next few days. On the 
forecast track, the core of Melissa is expected to move across the 
southeastern or central Bahamas this evening, and is forecast to 
pass near or to the west of Bermuda late Thursday and Thursday 
night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Some restrengthening is possible tonight into tomorrow with 
weakening beginning thereafter. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km). A private weather station at Pitts Town on Crooked Island 
recently reported sustained winds of 69 mph (111 km/h) and a wind 
gust of 82 mph (131 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 974 mb (28.77 inches). A 
private weather station at Buckley's Settlement on Long Island 
recently reported a pressure of 978.4 mb (28.89 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are occurring within the warning area in
the southeastern and central Bahamas and should continue through
tonight. Tropical storm conditions are ongoing in the Turks and
Caicos Islands and should continue through tonight.
 
Hurricane conditions are now expected on Bermuda late Thursday and
Thursday night with Tropical storm conditions expected earlier on
Thursday.
 
RAINFALL: Over the Southeast Bahamas, storm total rainfall of 5 to 
10 inches are expected through Thursday morning, which will result 
in areas of flash flooding. For the Turks and Caicos rainfall totals 
of 1 to 3 inches are expected. Heavy rain may begin to affect 
Bermuda on Thursday or Thursday night.

Over southern Hispaniola, additional rainfall of 1 to 2 inches are 
through this evening, with storm total local maxima of 40 inches 
possible.

For eastern Cuba, the rainfall has subsided. However, additional 
scattered showers are expected through this evening, with additional 
rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches. With storm total rainfall of 10 
to 20 inches, possibly up to 25 inches over mountainous terrain, the 
ongoing life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding 
and landslides will likely persist into the evening.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge of 4 to 7 ft above normally dry ground is
possible in the southeastern Bahamas today, and minor coastal
flooding is possible in the Turks and Caicos Islands today.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa will continue to affect portions
of Hispaniola, Jamaica, eastern Cuba, the Cayman Islands for the
remainder of the day, will affect the Bahamas and the Turks and
Caicos Islands for the next few days, and will spread toward Bermuda
later this week, causing life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Melissa Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
1100 AM EDT Wed Oct 29 2025
 
Melissa is moving back offshore, now in the Southwestern Atlantic 
Ocean. The NOAA hurricane hunter aircraft flew around Cuba and more 
recently was able to make a fix of Melissa just offshore. This 
matches the latest view from the GOES-19 mesoscale sector and radar 
out of Camaguey, Cuba. However, the smaller core that Melissa had 
stubbornly maintained over the past few days has been destroyed by 
the higher terrain of Cuba, and a larger core structure is 
developing. This has led to a significant expansion of the 50-kt 
wind radii on the eastern side of the hurricane. Land interaction 
also appears to have lead to additional weakening of the the maximum 
sustained winds that are now estimated to be around 85 kt, with the 
pressure up to 974 mb based on the first NOAA-P3 aircraft fix. This 
may still be a little generous given the aircraft wind data thus 
far. An Air Force Reserve reconnaissance mission will also be 
sampling Melissa later today.
 
The hurricane is continuing to slowly accelerate, now estimated to
be moving to the northeast at 030/12 kt. Melissa is expected to
continue accelerating northeastward during the next several days as
the hurricane is picked up by a very large an amplified upper-level
trough currently digging into the southeastern United States. This
motion will bring the core of the hurricane over portions of the
southeastern and central Bahamas over the next several hours. After
today, the track models remain tightly clustered on the center of
Melissa passing just to the northwest of Bermuda late Thursday and
Thursday night. The center of the hurricane is a little bit further
to the west emerging off Cuba, and the overall track guidance has
nudged a little bit further west this cycle, and the NHC track
forecast was also nudged in that direction, continuing to blend the
reliable consensus aids with the Google DeepMind ensemble mean
(GDMI).
 
Now that Melissa is back offshore, it has a short-term opportunity
for the hurricane to re-intensify a little as long as the larger
core that has developed is able to reorganize. Shear does start to
increase over the next 24-36 h, but the shear vector is also in the
same direction as the forward motion of the storm, which could
still allow some core reorganization of the convection while the
hurricane remains over warm 27-28 C sea-surface temperatures. Thus,
the short-term NHC forecast shows a little bit of intensification
over the next 12-24 h before weakening begins by 36 h.
Extratropical transition is expected to be well underway at or just
after Melissa passes by Bermuda, with the global model fields and
model-simulated satellite imagery show Melissa quickly losing
tropical characteristics and becoming an extratropical cyclone by 60
h. However, Melissa will still likely be a formidable extratropical
cyclone as it moves up into the Canadian Maritimes by this weekend
into early next week. The NHC intensity forecast is in good
agreement with the HAFS model guidance and HFIP Corrected Consensus
approach (HCCA).
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Eastern Cuba: Life-threatening storm surge, flash flooding and
landslides, and damaging winds are ongoing through this afternoon.
Remain in a safe shelter.
 
2. Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos: Hurricane conditions,
life-threatening storm surge, and heavy rainfall are expected across
portions of the southeastern and central Bahamas today. Find a safe
shelter and follow local official guidance. Tropical storm
conditions, heavy rains, and significant storm surge are expected in
the Turks and Caicos Islands today.
 
3. Haiti and the Dominican Republic: Catastrophic flash flooding and
landslides are expected across portions of Haiti and the Dominican
Republic through today. In Haiti, extensive damage and isolation of
communities is likely. Tropical storm conditions are expected
through this afternoon.
 
4. Bermuda: Hurricane conditions and heavy rainfall are expected in
Bermuda beginning late Thursday and continuing through Thursday
night.
 
5. Post-storm safety in impacted areas:  Follow advice of local
officials as you may need to remain sheltered after the storm due to
downed power lines and flooded areas.  Ensure generators are
properly ventilated and placed outside at least 20 feet away from
dwellings and garages to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. During
clean up, be careful when using chainsaws and power tools. Drink
plenty of water to avoid heat exhaustion.
