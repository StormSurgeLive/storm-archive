DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Melissa was located 
by Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 16.4 
North, longitude 76.9 West. Melissa is moving toward the west near 5 
mph (7 km/h). A slow westward motion is expected today, followed by 
a turn to the north and northeast on Monday and Tuesday. On the 
forecast track, the core of Melissa is expected to move near or over 
Jamaica on Tuesday, across southeastern Cuba Tuesday night, and 
across the southeastern Bahamas on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 140 mph (220 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Melissa is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional intensification is forecast over 
the next day or so, followed by fluctuations in intensity.  Melissa 
is expected to be a powerful major hurricane when making landfall in 
Jamaica Monday night or Tuesday morning and southeastern Cuba late 
Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175
miles (280 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated by aircraft dropsonde data is 
946 mb (27.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are likely occuring in Jamaica, with
hurricane conditions expected to begin by Monday. Tropical storm
conditions are expected in the warning area in Haiti today. The
potential for hurricane conditions in the watch area in Haiti have
diminished for today, but there is still a possibility of hurricane
conditions occurring there on Tuesday. Hurricane conditions are
possible in the watch area in eastern Cuba on Tuesday into
Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 15 to
30 inches to portions of southern Hispaniola and Jamaica through
Wednesday, with local maxima of 40 inches possible.  Catastrophic
flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely.
 
For eastern Cuba, total rainfall of 10 to 15 inches, with local
amounts to 20 inches, is expected by Tuesday into Wednesday
resulting in life-threatening flash flooding and numerous
landslides.
 
Over the Southeast Bahamas, total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches is
expected Tuesday into Wednesday resulting in areas of flash
flooding.  Over the Turks and Caicos, total rainfall of 1 to 4
inches is expected Tuesday into Wednesday.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Life-threatening storm surge is likely along the south
coast of Jamaica late Monday through Tuesday morning.  Peak
storm surge heights could reach 9 to 13 feet above ground level,
near and to the east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall.
This storm surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
There is a potential for significant storm surge along the
southeast coast of Cuba late Tuesday or Wednesday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions of 
Hispaniola, Jamaica, eastern Cuba, and the Cayman Islands during the 
next several days.  These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Melissa Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
1100 AM EDT Sun Oct 26 2025

After rapidly intensifying over the past day or so, NOAA-P3 aircraft 
data indicates that Melissa's intensity has leveled off this 
morning. Melissa remains a very formidable hurricane on satellite 
imagery, with a clearing eye quite evident on morning visible 
imagery, and the eye temperature has warmed to +15-20C. Meanwhile 
the eyewall convection continues to remain robust with cloud tops as 
low as -75 to -80C encircling the core. With that said, the eye 
presentation from the Kingston, Jamaica radar is not as pristine, 
with the eyewall occasionally open on the east side, and some 
evidence of concentric bands forming off and on. Zooming out a bit, 
there still remains some evidence of light to moderate westerly 
shear undercutting the expanding storm outflow, and Melissa’s 
primarily rainbands are distributed mostly on the eastern side of 
the circulation. NOAA-P3 aircraft data this morning had a peak 700- 
mb flight level wind of 120 kt, and Tail Doppler Radar (TDR) wind 
retrievals were up to 129 kt at 0.5 km, and 129 kt in the 500 m 
average of a dropsonde launched in the north eyewall. While this 
data would support a somewhat lower intensity, the subjective and 
objective satellite based intensity estimates are mostly higher, 
ranging from 115 to 140 kt. The initial intensity will be held at 
120 kt, on the lower end of those estimates, and this value could be 
a little generous based on the aircraft data.

The major hurricane is moving westward this morning, from aircraft 
fixes estimated at 270/3 kt. This motion is expected to continue for 
the next 24-36 h as a narrow mid-level ridge to the north of Melissa 
imparts the majority of the steering. Thereafter, a short-wave 
trough moving into the southeastern United States is expected to 
erode this ridge, allowing Melissa to turn sharply to the northeast, 
with gradual acceleration. On the forecast track,  Melissa's core 
is expected to be near the Jamaica coastline by Tuesday morning, 
moving across the island and then approaching and moving over 
eastern Cuba by Tuesday night. While the track guidance has become 
tightly clustered over the first 24-48 hours, the along-track spread 
starts to increase significantly after that time period, with Google 
DeepMind ensemble solutions on Wednesday morning ranging from 
between Jamaica and eastern Cuba in the Caribbean Sea, over eastern 
Cuba, or in the Southwestern Atlantic near the Southeastern Bahamas 
and Turks and Cacaos Islands. The latest NHC track forecast was 
nudged just a little westward of the prior track, once again 
blending the reliable track aids HFIP Corrected Consensus Approach 
(HCCA), and Google DeepMind ensemble mean (GDMI). 

It is unclear if the current pause in Melissa's intensification is 
temporary. While there have not been obvious indications of a 
secondary eyewall formation yet, there are some concentric 
reflectivity bands appearing on both Jamaica and NOAA-P3 TDR data 
occasionally, though the inner eyewall remains strong. Some of the 
guidance this morning has actually increased from yesterday at this 
time, and notably both the HAFS-A/B explicitly forecast a Category 5 
hurricane shortly before they show landfall in Jamaica. The latest 
NHC intensity forecast will continue to show a peak intensity of 140 
kt. However, inner-core fluctuations like eyewall replacement cycles 
could occur at any time. Regardless, Melissa is forecast to reach 
Jamaica as an upper-end category 4 hurricane, which will only 
exacerbate any damages caused by heavy rainfall and flooding over 
the next 2 days. Melissa will likely weaken some as it traverses 
over the higher terrain of Jamaica, but it is still forecast to be a 
major hurricane when it subsequently moves over eastern Cuba in 
60-72 hours. Thereafter, increasing southwesterly shear should 
cause gradual weakening, but Melissa could still be near hurricane 
intensity when it makes it closest approach to Bermuda in about 5 
days. The latest NHC intensity forecast is on the high end of the 
intensity guidance, but not far off the GDMI, and HAFS-A/B intensity 
aids. 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Jamaica:  Seek shelter now.  Damaging winds and heavy rainfall 
today and Monday will cause catastrophic and life-threatening flash 
flooding and numerous landslides before potentially devastating 
winds arrive Monday night and Tuesday morning.  Extensive 
infrastructural damage, long-duration power and communication 
outages, and isolation of communities are expected. Life-threatening 
storm surge is likely along portions of the southern coast Monday 
night and Tuesday morning.
 
2. Haiti:  Catastrophic and life-threatening flash flooding and 
landslides are expected across southwestern Haiti through midweek, 
likely causing extensive infrastructural damage and isolation of 
communities. Although winds are temporarily decreasing on the 
Tiburon peninsula, they could increase again across much of western 
Haiti on Tuesday.
 
3. Dominican Republic: Heavy rainfall through midweek could produce 
catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides in southern 
portions of the country.
 
4. Eastern Cuba, Southeast Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos: 
Monitor Melissa closely.  There is an increasing risk of a 
significant storm surge, damaging winds, and heavy rainfall Tuesday 
and Wednesday.  In eastern Cuba, the risk of life-threatening flash 
flooding and landslides is increasing. A Hurricane Watch is in 
effect for portions of eastern Cuba.
