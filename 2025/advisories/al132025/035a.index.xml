DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Melissa was 
located near latitude 24.8 North, longitude 73.9 West. Melissa is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 21 mph (33 km/h), and the 
hurricane is expected to continue accelerating northeastward during 
the next few days. On the forecast track, the core of Melissa is 
expected to move away from the southeastern and central Bahamas this 
morning, then pass near or to the west of Bermuda later today and 
tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Further strengthening is possible today before weakening 
likely begins on Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185
miles (295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 970 mb (28.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions, mainly in gusts, will continue over the 
southeastern and central Bahamas for the next few hours. Tropical 
storm conditions, mainly in gusts, will continue in the Turks and 
Caicos Islands for the next few hours.
 
On Bermuda, tropical storm conditions will begin later today and 
hurricane conditions are expected tonight.
 
RAINFALL: Over the Southeastern Bahamas, storm total rainfall of 5
to 10 inches is expected through this morning, which will result
in areas of flash flooding. For the Turks and Caicos, rainfall
totals of 1 to 2 inches are expected.
 
Over southern Hispaniola, additional rainfall of 1 to 2 inches is
expected through early this morning, with storm total local maxima 
of 40 inches possible.
 
Across Bermuda, outer bands east of Melissa’s track may bring up to
an inch (25 mm) of rain today and tonight.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge of 4 to 7 ft above normally dry ground is
possible in the southeastern Bahamas overnight, and minor coastal
flooding is possible in the Turks and Caicos Islands overnight.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa will continue to affect portions 
of Hispaniola, Cuba, the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands 
for the next couple of days, and will spread toward Bermuda later 
today, causing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. 
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Melissa Discussion Number  35
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
1100 PM EDT Wed Oct 29 2025

Melissa is starting to re-intensify.  A large convective burst 
continues near the center, albeit stretched from northeast to 
southwest.  An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft found 
that the pressure has fallen a few mb to 970 mb, with increased 
maximum 700-mb flight-level wind to 100 kt.  While normally this 
would support closer to 90-kt surface winds, those strong winds 
were over 75 n mi from the center well away from the central core.  
This typically signifies a lower-than-standard wind reduction, so 
the initial intensity is set to 85 kt on this advisory.  

The hurricane is moving faster tonight, with microwave and 
aircraft fixes resulting in an initial motion estimate of 030/18 
kt. Melissa is forecast to greatly accelerate during the next 
two days due to steering flow between a trough moving through 
the southeastern United States and a mid-level ridge over the 
central Atlantic.  This should cause the hurricane to move away 
from the Central Bahamas on Thursday morning and to the northwest 
of Bermuda Thursday night.  The fast track continues into Friday, 
with the then post-tropical Melissa forecast to move near the 
Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland as the calendar turns to November.  
Only a slight westward adjustment was made to the NHC forecast, 
near the Google DeepMind and HFIP Corrected Consensus models.

Melissa has a short window of time to intensify during the next day 
or so as it remains over warm waters with moderate shear.  While 
the shear greatly increases on Halloween along with cooling waters, 
the forecast speed of the cyclone also jumps up along with upper- 
level divergence from an approaching trough, which could lessen 
the weakening rate.  Extratropical transition is anticipated in 
about 48 hours due to very strong shear and cold waters.  The new 
NHC intensity forecast is close to the previous one, remaining on 
the high side of the guidance.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos: Hurricane conditions,
life-threatening storm surge, and heavy rainfall are expected across
portions of the southeastern and central Bahamas through overnight. 
Remain sheltered until local officials deem it safe to venture out. 
Tropical storm conditions, heavy rains, and significant storm surge 
are expected in the Turks and Caicos Islands through overnight.
 
2. Bermuda: Hurricane conditions are expected in Bermuda beginning 
late Thursday and continuing through Thursday night.
 
3. Post-storm safety:  Follow advice of local officials as you may
need to remain sheltered after the storm due to downed power lines
and flooded areas.  Ensure generators are properly ventilated and
placed outside at least 20 feet away from dwellings and garages to
avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. During clean up, be careful when
using chainsaws and power tools. Drink plenty of water to avoid heat
exhaustion.
