HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone 
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti beginning late on Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions could 
begin in Jamaica on Thursday or Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is forecast to bring 5 to 10 inches of rain to 
southern Haiti and the southern Dominican Republic through Friday, 
with locally higher amounts possible.  Across eastern Jamaica, 4 to 
8 inches of rain is expected, also with locally higher amounts 
possible.  Additional heavy rainfall is possible beyond Friday; 
however, uncertainty in Melissaâ€™s track and forward speed reduces 
confidence in exact totals. Significant flash flooding and 
landslides are possible.

Across the northern Dominican Republic and northern Haiti, 2 to 4 
inches of rain is expected through Friday. For Aruba, western 
Jamaica, and Puerto Rico, 1 to 3 inches is expected through the same 
period. Flash and urban flooding will be possible through at least 
Friday.

days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
