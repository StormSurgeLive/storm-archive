DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was 
located near latitude 14.4 North, longitude 74.3 West. Melissa is 
moving slowly toward the west-northwest near 2 mph (4 km/h). A slow 
forward speed and a gradual turn to the northwest or north-northwest 
is forecast during the next couple of days, followed by a turn back 
westward by this weekend.  On the forecast track, Melissa is 
expected to approach Jamaica and the southwestern portion of Haiti 
later this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some slow strengthening is forecast during the next few days, and 
Melissa could become a hurricane by Friday, with more substantial 
intensification forecast by this weekend. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti beginning on Friday.  Tropical storm conditions could begin in 
Jamaica late on Thursday or Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring 5 to 10 inches of rain to the 
southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica 
through Saturday, with locally higher amounts possible. Additional 
heavy rainfall is possible beyond Saturday.  However, uncertainty 
in Melissaâ€™s track and forward speed reduces confidence in exact 
totals. Significant, life-threatening flash flooding and numerous 
landslides are possible.

Across Puerto Rico, northern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and 
western Jamaica, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected through Saturday. 
Flash and urban flooding will be possible through at least Saturday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Melissa are expected to spread to

days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
