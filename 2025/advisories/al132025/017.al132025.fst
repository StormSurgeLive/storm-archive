DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was 
located by Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunters near 
latitude 16.5 North, longitude 75.1 West. Melissa is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 1 mph (2 km/h). A slow west-northwestward or 
westward motion is expected today through Sunday night. A turn to 
the north and northeast is forecast on Monday and Tuesday. On the 
forecast track, the center of Melissa is expected to move near or 
over Jamaica during the weekend and early next week, and it could be 
near or over eastern Cuba by the middle of next week.
 
Reports from NOAA and Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds remain near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Rapid intensification is forecast to occur over 
the next 24 hours. Melissa is forecast to become a hurricane later 
today and a major hurricane by Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 982 mb (29.00 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in Jamaica by
tonight, with hurricane conditions expected by Sunday or Monday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected and hurricane conditions are
possible within the watch and warning area in Haiti later today.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring total rainfall of 15 to 25 
inches to portions of southern Hispaniola and Jamaica into 
Wednesday, with local maxima of 35 inches possible across eastern 
Jamaica and the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti. Additional heavy 
rainfall is likely beyond Wednesday but exact storm totals are still 
uncertain. Catastrophic flash flooding and landslides are expected 
across southwestern Haiti and portions of Jamaica, with the 
possibility of catastrophic flood impacts also extending across the 
remainder of southern Haiti into southern Dominican Republic.
 
For eastern Cuba, total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches, with local
amounts to 15 inches, are expected into Wednesday resulting in
life-threatening flash flooding and landslides. Additional heavy
rainfall is likely beyond Wednesday; uncertainty at that time range
precludes exact storm totals.

Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Life-threatening storm surge is becoming more likely 
along the south coast of Jamaica later in the weekend or early next 
week.  Peak storm surge heights could reach 7 to 11 feet above 
ground level, near and to the east of where the center of Melissa 
makes landfall. This storm surge will be accompanied by large and 
destructive waves.

There is a potential for significant storm surge along the 
southeast coast of Cuba early next week.

SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions
of Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next several
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
