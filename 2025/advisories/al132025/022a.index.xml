DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Melissa was located 
near latitude 16.4 North, longitude 77.3 West. Melissa is moving 
toward the west near 5 mph (7 km/h).   A slow westward motion 
is expected tonight, followed by a turn to the north and northeast 
on Monday and Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the core of Melissa 
is expected to move near or over Jamaica on Tuesday, across 
southeastern Cuba Tuesday night, and across the southeastern 
Bahamas on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Melissa is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.   Additional intensification is forecast over 
the next day or so, followed by fluctuations in intensity.  Melissa 
is expected to be a powerful major hurricane when making landfall 
in Jamaica.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft observations is 933 mb (27.55 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are likely occuring in Jamaica, with
hurricane conditions expected to begin by Monday. Tropical storm
conditions are expected to begin in Eastern Cuba by Tuesday
afternoon, with Hurricane conditions expected to begin in the
hurricane warning area by Tuesday evening. Tropical storm conditions
are ongoing in the warning area in Haiti.  Hurricane conditions are 
possible in the Hurricane Watch area in Haiti.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring rainfall of 15 to 30 inches
to portions of Jamaica and additional rainfall of 8 to 16 inches for
southern Hispaniola through Wednesday, with local storm total maxima
of 40 inches possible.  Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous
landslides are likely.
 
For eastern Cuba, storm total rainfall of 10 to 15 inches, with
local amounts to 20 inches, is expected by Monday into Wednesday
resulting in life-threatening flash flooding and numerous
landslides.
 
Over the Southeast Bahamas, total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches is
expected Tuesday into Wednesday resulting in areas of flash
flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Life-threatening storm surge is likely along the south
coast of Jamaica late Monday through Tuesday morning.  Peak storm
surge heights could reach 9 to 13 feet above ground level, near and
to the east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall. This
storm surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
There is a potential for significant storm surge along the southeast
coast of Cuba late Tuesday or Wednesday. Peak storm surge heights
could reach 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels, near and to the
east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall. This storm surge
will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions of
Hispaniola, Jamaica, eastern Cuba, and the Cayman Islands during the
next several days, and In the Bahamas and Bermuda later this week.

Hurricane Melissa Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
500 PM EDT Sun Oct 26 2025
 
After an earlier pause in intensification, this afternoon's Air 
Force Reserve reconnaissance mission has found Melissa intensifying 
again. The minimum pressure has fallen 12 mb from this morning 
NOAA-P3 mission, with the last dropsonde indicating a minimum 
pressure of 941 mb, and the plane reported a shrinking eyewall down 
to 6 n mi in diameter. In addition to the low pressure, the 
satellite presentation of Melissa remains very impressive, with 
1-minute visible satellite images from a GOES-19 meso-sector showing 
a very clear eye with a stadium effect. The eye temperature on water 
vapor imagery has continued to warm, while the thick ring of eyewall 
cloud tops remains between -75 to -80 C around the eye. The 
presentation of Melissa on radar reflectivity from Kingston, Jamaica 
has also improved, though there still appear to be hints of a moat 
forming around the inner eyewall, though without an obvious 
secondary eyewall formation yet. Subjective Dvorak CI-numbers from 
both SAB and TAFB were T7.0/140 kt, with objective satellite 
estimates between 132-143 kt. However, Melissa's peak winds from the 
last couple of recon missions have been lagging the satellite-based 
estimates. The last fix had peak 700 mb flight level winds of only 
129 kt, but a dropsonde launched in the north eyewall also reported 
a 500 m layer average of 142 kt, with an earlier dropsonde in the NE 
eyewall with a surface wind gust of 131 kt. This data is enough to 
raise the maximum sustained winds of 125 kt, and given the satellite 
presentation, this could be conservative. 

Melissa continues to move slowly westward, estimated at 270/4 kt. 
The hurricane has been moving a little faster to the west today, and 
this motion will likely continue for another 12-18 hours while the 
narrow mid-level ridge to the north remains in place. Soon, a 
short-wave trough will be moving into the SE United States, and this 
feature should create a weakness that Melissa will turn 
sharply northeast into, as it gradually accelerates. The track 
guidance has shifted a little westward again this cycle, and the NHC 
track forecast was nudged a little west again, but still shows 
landfall on Tuesday morning along the south coast of Jamaica. There 
remain some timing differences thereafter, but a second landfall is 
anticipated along the southeastern Cuba coast by Tuesday night or 
early Wednesday morning. As Melissa then accelerates into the 
southwestern Atlantic, it will move through the Bahamas and 
potentially approach Bermuda by the day 4-5 time frame, with a 
reinforcing trough helping to kick it farther out to sea. The latest 
NHC track forecast is a little west in the first 24-60 h, but falls 
back near the previous forecast track thereafter. The track is 
roughly a blend of the reliable HFIP Corrected Consensus Approach 
(HCCA) and Google Deep Mind ensemble mean (GDMI). 

Now that Melissa is intensifying again, it seems more clear that the 
earlier pause in intensification was a temporary oscillation, and 
the hurricane now appears poised to intensify more in the 
short-term. The latest NHC intensity forecast shows a little more 
intensification in 12 h, but continues to show a peak intensity of 
140 kt, which is supported by HAFS-B which shows landfall of Melissa 
as a catastrophic Category 5 hurricane. The Google DeepMind ensemble 
members also continue to indicate this peak, with now 48/50 members 
reaching this lofty intensity. However, inner-core processes like 
ERCs could occur at any time, and the current small eye of Melissa 
likely suggests an ERC could begin in the next 24 hours or so, 
though it is very difficult to predict these occurrences with much 
skill. After landfall in Jamaica, Melissa will likely weaken some 
due to the interaction with that Island's high terrain, but it is 
still expected to be a major hurricane when crossing the Cuba 
coastline on Tuesday night. After emerging into the southwestern 
Atlantic Ocean, increasing vertical wind shear should continue 
gradual weakening through the end of the forecast, with the 
possibility that Melissa could start extratropical transition by day 
5. The NHC intensity forecast continues to be on the high side of 
the guidance, but falls closer to the HCCA and IVCN aids towards the 
end of the forecast period.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Jamaica:  Seek shelter now.  Damaging winds and heavy rainfall 
tonight and Monday will cause catastrophic and life-threatening 
flash flooding and numerous landslides before potentially 
devastating winds arrive Monday night and Tuesday morning.  
Extensive infrastructural damage, long-duration power and 
communication outages, and isolation of communities are expected. 
Life-threatening storm surge and damaging waves are expected along 
portions of the southern coast Monday night and Tuesday morning.
 
2. Haiti and the Dominican Republic:  Catastrophic and 
life-threatening flash flooding and landslides are expected across 
southwestern Haiti and southern portions of the Dominican Republic 
through midweek.  In Haiti, extensive infrastructural damage and 
isolation of communities is likely. Although winds have temporarily 
decreased on the Tiburon peninsula, they are likely to increase 
again across much of western Haiti on Tuesday.
 
3. Eastern Cuba:  Life-threatening storm surge is expected along 
portions of the southern coast of eastern Cuba late Tuesday and 
Tuesday night.  Damaging winds and heavy rainfall with 
life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding and 
landslides are also expected beginning on Monday.  Preparations 
should be rushed to completion.
 
4. Southeast Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos: Monitor Melissa 
closely.  There is an increasing risk of a significant storm surge, 
damaging winds, and heavy rainfall Tuesday and Wednesday.  Watches 
will likely be required early Monday.
