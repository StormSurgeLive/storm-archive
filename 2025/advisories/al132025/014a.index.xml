...LIFE-THREATENING AND CATASTROPHIC FLASH FLOODING AND LANDSLIDES
EXPECTED IN PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN HISPANIOLA AND JAMAICA THROUGH THE
WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 PM EDT...0000 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.2N 74.6W
ABOUT 190 MI...310 KM SE OF KINGSTON JAMAICA
ABOUT 225 MI...360 KM SW OF PORT AU PRINCE HAITI
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 355 DEGREES AT 2 MPH...4 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...993 MB...29.33 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the
Dominican Republic to Port-Au-Prince
* Jamaica
 
A Tropical Storm Warning in effect for...
* Southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the
Dominican Republic to Port-Au-Prince
* Jamaica
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours before
the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds,
conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and eastern
Cuba, and the Bahamas should monitor the progress of Melissa.  A
hurricane warning may be required for Jamaica later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was
located near latitude 16.2 North, longitude 74.6 West. A turn to 
the west is forecast on Saturday and this general motion is 
expected to continue through Monday. A turn to the north and 
northeast is forecast on Tuesday and Wednesday. On the forecast 
track, the center of Melissa is expected to move near or over 
Jamaica early next week and could be near or over eastern Cuba by 
the middle of next week.
 
Reports from NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Rapid intensification is forecast over the 
next several days, and Melissa is forecast to become a hurricane 
tomorrow and a major hurricane by Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure reported by the Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft is 993 mb (29.33 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti later this weekend and Jamaica beginning late this weekend or
early next week. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in
Haiti tonight or Saturday and in Jamaica late Saturday into Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring total rainfall of 15 to 25
inches to portions of southern Hispaniola and Jamaica through
Tuesday, with local maxima of 35 inches possible across the Tiburon
Peninsula of Haiti.  Additional heavy rainfall is likely beyond
Tuesday. The uncertainty at that time range precludes exact storm
totals.  Potentially catastrophic flash flooding and landslides are
possible across portions of Jamaica and the southern Dominican
Republic, while catastrophic flash flooding is anticipated in
southern Haiti.
 
For southeast Cuba, total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches, with local
amounts to 12 inches, are possible into Tuesday.  Additional heavy
rainfall is likely beyond Tuesday. The uncertainty at that time
range precludes exact storm totals.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding is likely along the coast of
Jamaica by Saturday in areas of onshore winds as tropical storm
conditions begin to reach the area.
 
However, there is a risk of a more life-threatening storm surge,
especially along the south coast of Jamaica, early next week.  Peak
storm surge heights could reach 5 to 10 feet above ground level,
near and to the east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall.
This storm surge will be accompanied by large and destructive
waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions
of Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next several
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM EDT.

Tropical Storm Melissa Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
500 PM EDT Fri Oct 24 2025
 
After the previous advisory, the last couple of aircraft fixes from 
the C-130 indicated that Melissa likely completed a center 
relocation as a very large burst of deep convection with cloud tops 
below -90C rotated up-shear of the center. This evolution was also 
nicely captured on the GOES-19 mesoscale sector, where GLM lightning 
flashes, which had been parked down-shear earlier in the morning, 
started to rotate cyclonically along Melissa's eastern flank, 
indicating convection was finally starting to wrap around the 
low-level vortex. A GMI microwave pass at 1527 UTC also hinted at a 
nascent inner core feature on the 37 GHz channel as the convective 
burst wrapped around the center. Before the Air Force Hurricane 
Hunters left Melissa, they measured a peak flight level wind of 59 
kt, and a pressure down to 997 mb, supporting the 50 kt intensity 
for the intermediate advisory. However, given the improvement of 
Melissa's structure since that time, the initial intensity is being 
raised to 55 kt for this advisory, in best agreement with the 
T3.5/55-kt Dvorak intensity estimate provided by TAFB. Another Air 
Force Reserve and a NOAA-P3 reconnaissance mission will be in the 
storm tonight to provide more data on Melissa's intensity and 
structure.
 
Now that the center is becoming better aligned with its mid-level 
vortex, it also appears the tropical storm has finally turned more 
northward, with an estimated motion of 360/2 kt. The synoptic track 
reasoning remains similar to this morning, with a slow motion 
expected to continue in the short-term due light steering currents, 
due to competing mid-level ridges to the southeast and northwest of 
Melissa. After 24 hours, the mid-level ridge located to the 
northwest is expected to strengthen to the north of Melissa, and the 
guidance is coming into better agreement on a very slow westward 
motion through 72 hours. Beyond that time frame, a strengthening 
mid-latitude trough expected to move into the Southeastern U.S., 
providing a path for Melissa to turn northeastward out of the 
Caribbean Sea into the southwestern Atlantic by the end of the 
forecast period. The track guidance this cycle has shifted a bit 
eastward beyond day 3, and is also notably faster than before. 
However, it should be stressed that there remains a substantial 
amount of along track spread. On the forecast track, Melissa could 
potentially be near Jamaica by day 4 and move across Cuba before the 
end of the forecast period, though the timing of this track remains 
more uncertain than usual.
 
Compared to yesterday, the UW-CIMSS shear estimates have dropped 
from 25 kt a day ago to 15 kt currently with mid-level shear also 
decreasing. This reduction in shear, in combination with the 
dramatically improved structure of Melissa this afternoon, suggests 
that the system is ready to take advantage of other favorable 
environmental conditions (30-31 C sea-surface temperatures, a 
moistening deep-layer environment). The intensity guidance is 
sharply higher this afternoon in the short-term, and it appears that 
Melissa could begin a period of rapid intensification (RI) at any 
time. The NHC intensity forecast responds to this guidance change by 
explicitly show RI earlier and continuing over the weekend. The 
forecast now shows a 135 kt peak in 60 h, and there is a distinct 
possibility that Melissa could become a Category 5 hurricane during 
this time period. In fact, the latest 12z Google DeepMind ensemble 
distribution shows the majority of its members reaching this lofty 
intensity. After that time period, inner-core structural changes are 
likely to cause fluctuations in intensity, and land interaction in 
both Jamaica and Cuba will likely lead to some weakening by the end 
of the forecast. The NHC intensity forecast is on the high side of 
the guidance envelope, and closest too the Google DeepMind ensemble 
mean (GDMI).
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Jamaica:  Due to Melissa’s slow motion, a prolonged multi-day 
period of damaging winds and heavy rainfall resulting in potentially 
catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides is likely to 
begin late Saturday or Sunday.  There is an increasing risk of 
life-threatening storm surge when the center of Melissa nears 
Jamaica early next week. Preparations to protect life and property 
should be rushed to completion.
 
2. Haiti:  Heavy rainfall will result in catastrophic flash flooding 
and landslides across southwestern Haiti into early next week. 
Extensive damage to roads and buildings is expected, potentially 
isolating communities for an extended period of time. Immediate 
preparations to protect life and property should be taken. Strong 
winds could also potentially last for a day or more over the Tiburon 
peninsula of Haiti.
 
3. Dominican Republic:  Heavy rainfall could produce potentially 
catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides in southern 
portions of the Dominican Republic.

4. Eastern Cuba and Bahamas:  Interests in Cuba and the Bahamas 
should monitor the progress of Melissa since there is an increasing 
risk of a significant storm storm surge, damaging winds, and heavy 
rainfall by the middle of next week. The risk of life-threatening 
flash flooding and landslides in eastern Cuba are increasing.
