products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Melissa was
located by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
near latitude 23.5 North, longitude 74.8 West.  Melissa is
moving toward the north-northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h).  An 
accelerating northeastward motion is expected during the next few 
days.  On the forecast track, the core of Melissa is expected to 
continue to move across the southeastern or central Bahamas this 
evening, and is forecast to pass near or to the west of Bermuda 
late Thursday and Thursday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Some restrengthening is forecast tonight into tomorrow with 
weakening beginning thereafter. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).  A private weather station at Pitts Town on Crooked Island 
recently reported sustained winds of 76 mph (122 km/h) and a wind 
gust of 85 mph (137 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 970 mb (28.65 inches) 
based on dropsonde data.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are occurring within the warning area in
the southeastern and central Bahamas and should continue through
tonight. Tropical storm conditions are ongoing in the Turks and
Caicos Islands and should continue through tonight.
 
Hurricane conditions are now expected on Bermuda late Thursday and
Thursday night with Tropical storm conditions expected earlier on
Thursday.
 
RAINFALL: Over the Southeast Bahamas, storm total rainfall of 5 to
10 inches are expected through Thursday morning, which will result
in areas of flash flooding. For the Turks and Caicos rainfall totals
of 1 to 3 inches are expected. Heavy rain may begin to affect
Bermuda on Thursday or Thursday night.
 
Over southern Hispaniola, additional rainfall of 1 to 2 inches are
through this evening, with storm total local maxima of 40 inches
possible.
 
For eastern Cuba, the rainfall has subsided. However, additional
scattered showers are expected through this evening, with additional
rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches. With storm total rainfall of 10
to 20 inches, possibly up to 25 inches over mountainous terrain, the
ongoing life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding
and landslides will likely persist into the evening.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at

Hurricane Melissa Discussion Number  34
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
500 PM EDT Wed Oct 29 2025

Melissa showing some some signs of convective recovery after 
weakening a little more from the land interaction with Cuba. After 
looking quite ragged after emerging off Cuba, convection is 
redeveloping on its upshear flank, and showing some signs of 
wrapping around the center again. Aircraft fixes from the Air Force 
Hurricane Hunter mission also show that the hurricane is beginning 
to accelerate to the northeast. Peak 700 mb flight level winds were 
87 kt both to the east and northeast of the center, and the minimum 
central pressure was unchanged from this morning, at around 974 mb. 
The mission also indicated a much larger eyewall with an eye 
diameter of 40 n mi. Using a standard 0.9 reduction from the 700 mb 
wind yields a maximum sustained wind of 80 kt this advisory, which 
is also in between the TAFB and SAB subjective Dvorak intensity 
estimates. Aircraft and scatterometer data were used to expand some 
of the wind radii associated with Melissa this afternoon. Another 
Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter mission is scheduled for this 
evening. 

The hurricane continues to gradually accelerate this afternoon, with 
the motion currently estimated at 035/14 kt. Not much has changed 
with the track reasoning this afternoon, as Melissa is beginning to 
be captured in the flow between an amplified trough swinging into 
the southeastern United States and a mid-level ridge centered to the 
east of the tropical cyclone. This motion will bring Melissa across 
the southeastern and central Bahamas though the evening. The track 
models continue to remain clustered on the center of Melissa passing 
just northwest of Bermuda late Thursday and Thursday night, though 
the enlarging wind radii will likely cause hurricane conditions to 
be experienced near or on the island. The track guidance this cycle 
remains in fairly good agreement, and only subtle changes to the 
track forecast were made this cycle, sticking close to a blend of 
the HFIP Corrected Consensus Approach (HCCA) and Google DeepMind 
ensemble mean (GDMI). It is also worth noting that the forecast 
track does also take Melissa close to the southeastern tip of 
Newfoundland, but as an post-tropical extratropical cyclone. 

While Melissa has weakened substantially in the past 24 h due to 
land interaction from the high terrain of Jamaica and Cuba, the 
global and hurricane-regional models continue to suggest it has a 
short-term window to re-intensify some while it remains over 
sufficently warm 27-28 C sea-surface temperatures. While vertical 
wind shear is starting to increase over the hurricane, it is in the 
same direction as the current accelerating motion, and the current 
satellite structure suggests that convection is not having any 
issues wrapping around the circulation. In addition, the 
accelerating forward motion might have the net effect of increasing 
the maximum winds speeds on the southeastern flank of Melissa. 
Finally, the hurricane finds itself positioned in the right entrance 
region of a jet streak located over the northeastern United States, 
which may aid in upper-level divergence over the system before the 
shear becomes prohibitively strong. Thus, the NHC intensity forecast 
does show some modest intensification over the next 24 h, and it is 
worth nothing this forecast is a little lower than some of the 
hurricane-regional models (HAFS-B/HWRF/HMON) that suggest it could 
re-intensify into a major hurricane. Once the hurricane approaches 
the north wall of the gulf stream in 48 h, extratropical transition 
will likely be well underway, with most models suggesting it 
completing this process between 48 to 60 h. The NHC intensity 
forecast is a little on the high side of the overall guidance 
envelope.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos: Hurricane conditions, 
life-threatening storm surge, and heavy rainfall are expected across 
portions of the southeastern and central Bahamas through this 
evening. Remain sheltered until local officials deem it safe to 
venture out. Tropical storm conditions, heavy rains, and significant 
storm surge are expected in the Turks and Caicos Islands through 
this evening.
   
2. Bermuda: Hurricane conditions and heavy rainfall are expected in 
Bermuda beginning late Thursday and continuing through Thursday 
night.

3. Post-storm safety:  Follow advice of local officials as you may 
need to remain sheltered after the storm due to downed power lines 
and flooded areas.  Ensure generators are properly ventilated and 
placed outside at least 20 feet away from dwellings and garages to 
avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. During clean up, be careful when 
using chainsaws and power tools. Drink plenty of water to avoid heat 
exhaustion.
