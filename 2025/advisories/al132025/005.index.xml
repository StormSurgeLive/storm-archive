...MELISSA DRIFTING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD IN THE CENTRAL CARIBBEAN...
...HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLOODING EXPECTED OVER PORTIONS OF HISPANIOLA
AND JAMAICA OVER THE REMAINDER OF THIS WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM EDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.4N 73.6W
ABOUT 300 MI...485 KM SSW OF PORT AU PRINCE HAITI
ABOUT 325 MI...525 KM SE OF KINGSTON JAMAICA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 2 MPH...4 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the
Dominican Republic to Port-Au-Prince
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Jamaica
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba
should monitor the progress of Melissa.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was 
located by Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft near latitude 
14.4 North, longitude 73.6 West. Melissa is moving slowly toward the 
west-northwest near 2 mph (4 km/h). A continued slow forward speed 
and a gradual turn to the northwest and north-northwest is expected 
during the next couple of days, followed by a turn back westward by 
the end of the week.  On the forecast track, Melissa is expected to 
approach Jamaica and the southwestern portion of Haiti later this 
week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some gradual strengthening is anticipated during the next few days, 
and Melissa could become a hurricane by Friday. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated by aircraft dropsonde data is 
1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti beginning late on Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions could
begin in Jamaica late on Thursday or Friday.
 
RAINFALL:  Melissa is expected to bring 5 to 10 inches of rain to
the southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica
through Saturday, with locally higher amounts possible. Additional
heavy rainfall is possible beyond Saturday; however, uncertainty in
Melissaâ€™s track and forward speed reduces confidence in exact
totals. Significant flash flooding and landslides are possible.
 
Across Puerto Rico, northern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and 
western Jamaica, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected through Saturday. 
Flash and urban flooding will be possible through at least Saturday.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Melissa are expected to spread to
Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next couple of
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?ripCurrents
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 500 PM EDT.

      <title>Tropical Storm Melissa Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>

Tropical Storm Melissa Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
500 AM EDT Wed Oct 22 2025
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft has been
extremely useful in showing that the center of Melissa has
re-formed to the northeast of the previous center.  Earlier
scatterometer data had already shown an elongated circulation, and
the very deep convection combined with the moderate westerly shear
has caused the re-formation.  The initial intensity is kept at 45
kt, a compromise between somewhat lower aircraft winds but also
lower central pressure, now at 1000 mb.
 
The initial motion is estimated, with low confidence, to be 295/6.
Melissa is forecast to move very slowly to the northwest and
north-northwest during the next few days into a weakness by an
approaching mid-latitude trough.  There continues to be a very
large uncertainty on whether the storm would turn more into the
weakness and threaten Haiti or Cuba, or whether it would turn
more westward to the south of Jamaica as a ridge rebuilds over the
Bahamas, with reliable models in either camp.  This appears to be
somewhat tied to the storm's structure, with the less vertically
coherent model solutions generally ending up on the western side of
the track envelope this weekend, and stronger initial storm
representations on the northeastern side.  With such a distinct
track bifurcation noted in the guidance (excluding the consensus
aids) and dependence on structure, this should be considered an
extremely uncertain forecast, and significant changes could be
required.  The model trends have been favoring the more westward
solutions recently, and the official forecast is nudged in that
direction at long range.
 
Melissa is likely to be encountering moderate wind shear for the
next few days, counteracted by the very warm and moist conditions
in the Caribbean Sea.  This pattern favors slow intensification 
through that time.  At long range, some relaxation of this shear is 
anticipated with the more equatorward storm solutions showing the 
most conducive environment.  The new NHC wind speed prediction
is much higher than the last one by day 5, but still lower than the 
model consensus due to continuity constraints.  While there is 
still a large forecast intensity uncertainty, the chances of a major
hurricane increase if this forecast were to trend farther southwest
at long range, similar to many of the recent regional hurricane
model forecasts.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Melissa is expected to produce heavy rainfall across portions of
the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica through this weekend,
bringing a risk of significant flash flooding and landslides.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are possible in the southwestern peninsula
of Haiti where a Hurricane Watch is in effect.  A Tropical Storm
Watch is in effect for Jamaica.  Preparations to protect life and
property should be completed by Thursday.
 
3. There is significant uncertainty in the track and intensity
forecast of Melissa.  Interests elsewhere in Hispaniola and Cuba
should continue to monitor the latest forecasts.
