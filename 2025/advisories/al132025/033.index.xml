Holguin, and Las Tunas
* Southeastern and Central Bahamas
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Haiti
* Cuban province of Camaguey

A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area. Residents in Cuba should remain
sheltered. In the Bahamas, preparations to protect life and property
should be completed and residents should remain sheltered. In
Bermuda preparations should be underway and be completed before
anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds,
conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.

products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Melissa was 
located by NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 21.4 North, 
longitude 75.6 West. Melissa is moving toward the northeast near 14 
mph (22 km/h).  A faster northeastward motion is expected during the 
next few days. On the forecast track, the core of Melissa is 
expected to move further offshore of Eastern Cuba this morning, move 
across the southeastern or central Bahamas today, and pass near or 
to the west of Bermuda late Thursday and Thursday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are now near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some slight strengthening is possible today into tomorrow
with little change in strength thereafter.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure measured by aircraft
dropsonde data is 974 mb (28.76 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are occurring within the warning area in
Cuba but expected to begin subsiding this afternoon. Tropical storm
conditions are expected in Haiti today.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in the southeastern and central
Bahamas today. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Turks
and Caicos Islands today.
 
Hurricane conditions are now expected on Bermuda late Thursday and
Thursday night with Tropical storm conditions expected earlier on
Thursday.
 
RAINFALL: For eastern Cuba, heavy rains will continue this morning,
tapering off this afternoon.  Storm total rainfall of 10 to 20
inches with local amounts to 25 inches over mountainous terrain is
expected. This will cause life-threatening and potentially
catastrophic flash flooding with numerous landslides.
 
Over the Southeast Bahamas, storm total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches
are expected today, which will result in areas of flash flooding.
For the Turks and Caicos rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are
expected. Heavy rain may begin to affect Bermuda on Thursday or
Thursday night.
 
Rainfall has diminished across Jamaica.  However, additional
scattered showers are possible with additional rainfall amounts of
2 to 4 inches.  This will bring storm total amounts to 12 to 24
inches, with isolated areas of 30 inches possible over mountainous
terrain. Ongoing catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides
will continue today and into tonight.
 
Over southern Hispaniola, additional rainfall of 4 to 6 inches are
expected today, with storm total local maxima of 40 inches possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge of 5 to 8 ft above normally dry ground is
possible in the southeastern Bahamas today, and minor coastal
flooding is possible in the Turks and Caicos Islands today.
 
Minor coastal flooding is possible in bays and inlets along the
north coast of eastern Cuba and minor coastal flooding is expected
along the coast of Haiti.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa will continue to affect portions
of Hispaniola, Jamaica, eastern Cuba, the Cayman Islands during the
next day or so, and now affecting the Bahamas and the Turks and
Caicos Islands, and will spread toward Bermuda later this week,
causing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Melissa Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
500 AM EDT Wed Oct 29 2025
 
Radar data and satellite images indicate that Melissa made landfall
in the province of Santiago de Cuba to the east of Chivirico around
0710 UTC this morning. The estimated landfall intensity of 105 kt
was based on a blend of the earlier Air Force Hurricane Hunter wind
and pressure data with the available satellite intensity estimates.
The hurricane is now centered inland over eastern Cuba, where
damaging winds and heavy rainfall continue across the region. Outer
rainbands are also noted across Haiti and portions of the Bahamas
and Turks and Caicos. Land interaction with the rugged terrain of
eastern Cuba has likely caused some weakening over the past couple
of hours, so the initial intensity is lowered to 100 kt.
 
The hurricane is moving to the northeast at 10 kt within the flow 
between an upper trough over the southeastern U.S. and a subtropical 
ridge over the central Atlantic. After crossing eastern Cuba this 
morning, Melissa is expected to continue accelerating northeastward 
during the next several days. This motion will bring the core of the 
hurricane over portions of the southeastern and central Bahamas 
later today. Then, the track models are tightly clustered on the 
center of Melissa passing to the west of Bermuda late Thursday and 
Thursday night. With good overall model agreement, no notable 
changes were made to this portion of the NHC track forecast. There 
was a leftward shift in much of the guidance at 96-120 h, and the 
official track forecast was adjusted to reflect these trends.
 
Additional weakening is expected while the hurricane moves across
eastern Cuba this morning. Melissa is expected to remain a strong
hurricane while it crosses portions of the Bahamas later today. Over
the next few days, increasing vertical wind shear, cooler waters,
and a drier surrounding mid-level environment will likely induce
further weakening. However, Melissa is forecast to still be a
hurricane when it makes it closest approach to Bermuda later this
week. Then, the global model fields and model-simulated satellite
imagery show Melissa quickly losing tropical characteristics and
becoming an extratropical cyclone by Friday night or early Saturday.
No major changes were made to the updated NHC intensity prediction,
which remains near the middle of the intensity guidance envelope.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Jamaica: You may need to remain sheltered after the storm due to
downed power lines and flooded areas. Ensure generators are
properly ventilated and placed outside at least 20 feet away from
dwellings and garages to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. During
clean up, be careful when using chainsaws and power tools. Drink
plenty of water to avoid heat exhaustion.
 
2. Haiti and the Dominican Republic: Catastrophic flash flooding and
landslides are expected across portions of Haiti and the Dominican
Republic through today. In Haiti, extensive damage and isolation of
communities is likely. Tropical storm conditions are expected
through this morning.
 
3. Eastern Cuba: Life-threatening storm surge, flash flooding and
landslides, and damaging hurricane winds are ongoing this morning.
Remain in a safe shelter.
 
4. Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos: Hurricane conditions,
life-threatening storm surge, and heavy rainfall are expected across
portions of the southeastern and central Bahamas today. Find a safe
shelter and follow local official guidance. Tropical storm
conditions, heavy rains, and significant storm surge are expected in
the Turks and Caicos Islands today.
 
5. Bermuda: Hurricane conditions and heavy rainfall are possible in
Bermuda beginning Thursday or Thursday night.
