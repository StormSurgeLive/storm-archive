tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours before
the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds,
conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and eastern
Cuba, the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands should monitor
the progress of Melissa. Watches could be required for portions of
eastern Cuba later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was
located near latitude 16.3 North, longitude 74.9 West. Melissa is
moving toward the northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h). A turn to the west 
is forecast today, and this general motion is expected to continue 
through Monday. A turn to the north and northeast is forecast on 
Tuesday and Wednesday. On the forecast track, the center of Melissa 
is expected to move near or over Jamaica during the weekend and 
early next week, and it could be near or over eastern Cuba by the 
middle of next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Rapid intensification is expected to begin soon. 
Melissa is forecast to become a hurricane today and a major 
hurricane by Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure based on Air Force Reserve Hurricane 
Hunter dropsonde data is 986 mb (29.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the warning area in
Jamaica beginning Sunday, with tropical storm conditions beginning
later today.  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch
area in Haiti later this weekend, with tropical storm conditions
expected to begin today.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring total rainfall of 15 to 25
inches to portions of southern Hispaniola and Jamaica through
Tuesday, with local maxima of 35 inches possible across the Tiburon
Peninsula of Haiti.  Additional heavy rainfall is likely beyond
Tuesday; uncertainty at that time range precludes exact storm
totals.  Potential catastrophic flash flooding and landslides are
possible across portions of Jamaica and the southern Dominican
Republic, while catastrophic flash flooding is anticipated in
southern Haiti.
 
For eastern Cuba, total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches, with local
amounts to 12 inches, are possible into Tuesday.  Additional heavy
rainfall is likely beyond Tuesday; uncertainty at that time range
precludes exact storm totals.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding is likely along the coast of
Jamaica starting today in areas of onshore winds as tropical storm
conditions begin to reach the area.
 
However, there is a risk of a more life-threatening storm surge,
especially along the south coast of Jamaica, later in the
weekend or early next week.  Peak storm surge heights could reach 5
to 10 feet above ground level, near and to the east of where the
center of Melissa makes landfall. This storm surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions
of Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next several
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM EDT.

      <title>Tropical Storm Melissa Forecast Discussion Number 15</title>

Tropical Storm Melissa Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
1100 PM EDT Fri Oct 24 2025
 
Reports from NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft
indicate that Melissa is still trying to get organized. While the
central pressure has fallen to 993 mb, the tail Doppler radar data
from the NOAA aircraft shows that the 500-mb center is displaced
about 20-25 n mi east-southeast of the surface center. The tilt is
also present at the aircraft flight levels, with dropsondes
released at the flight-level center missing the surface center and
reporting 25-35 kt surface winds. In addition, the aircraft radar
data and land-based radar data from Jamaica show that the cyclone
has not yet been able to develop a persistent eyewall. Based mainly
on the central pressure and satellite intensity estimates the
initial intensity is held at 55 kt.
 
Although the initial motion is a bit uncertain, Melissa now appears
to be moving slowly northwest with the initial motion 325/3 kt. A 
turn toward the west or west-northwest and a continued slow forward 
speed are expected in 12-24 h as low- to mid-level ridging builds 
to the north of the cyclone. This motion should continue through 
about 72 h. After that time, a deep-layer mid-latitude trough 
moving into the southeastern United States and the southwestern 
Atlantic will break the ridge to the north, with Melissa expected 
to turn northward and eventually northeastward as it recurves into 
the westerlies.  There remains a substantial spread in the guidance 
with respect to where the center of Melissa may pass in relation to 
Jamaica, with solutions ranging from the GFS passing near the 
eastern end of the island to the Canadian passing west of the 
island. The new forecast track is similar to the previous track and 
shows the center passing over Jamaica just after 72 h. However, any 
motion north of the current forecast track could bring the center 
near or over Jamaica at almost any time between 24-72 h. After 
passing Jamaica, Melissa is likely to move near or over eastern 
Cuba, but which portion of eastern Cuba may be most affected 
remains uncertain at this time.
 
While the westerly shear that has been affecting Melissa will not
completely stop during the next 2-3 days, it is forecast to
decrease to about 10-15 kt in 24 h or less. This should allow rapid
development as the storm is located in a moist environment over
very warm sea surface temperatures. The one short-term restraining
factor is that Melissa's structure is not quite good enough yet to
allow rapid intensification (RI), and thus it could be another
6-12 h before RI begins in earnest. The latest round of intensity
guidance shows somewhat lower peak intensities than the previous
advisory, mainly due to the models moving Melissa near or over
Jamaica. However, the current forecast track keeps the center
offshore for 72 h or more, and based on this the new intensity
forecast is at the high end of the guidance with a peak intensity
of 135 kt. Despite the weaker guidance, there is still a
possibility that Melissa could become a category 5 hurricane during
the forecast period. After passing near or over Jamaica, the cyclone
is forecast to weaken due to possible interaction with Cuba and
increasing southwesterly shear as Melissa encounters the
mid-latitude westerlies.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Jamaica:  Melissa’s slow movement will bring a multi-day period
of damaging winds and heavy rainfall beginning late Saturday or
Sunday, likely causing catastrophic flash flooding and numerous
landslides.  There is an increasing risk of life-threatening storm
surge early next week. All preparations should be complete by late
Saturday.
 
2. Haiti:  Catastrophic flash flooding and landslides are expected
across southwestern Haiti into early next week, likely causing
extensive infrastructural damage and potentially prolonged isolation
of communities. Immediate preparations to protect life and property
are urged. Strong winds could also potentially last for a day or
more over the Tiburon peninsula.
 
3. Dominican Republic: Heavy rainfall could produce potentially
catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides in southern
regions.
 
4. Eastern Cuba, Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos:  Monitor Melissa
closely.  There is an increasing risk of a significant storm storm
surge, damaging winds, and heavy rainfall by the middle of next
week. In eastern Cuba, the risk of life-threatening flash flooding
and landslides is increasing.
