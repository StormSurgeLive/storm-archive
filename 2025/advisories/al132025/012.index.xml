500 AM EDT Fri Oct 24 2025
 
...MELISSA NEARLY STATIONARY...
...LIFE-THREATENING AND CATASTROPHIC FLASH FLOODING AND LANDSLIDES
EXPECTED IN PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN HISPANIOLA AND JAMAICA THROUGH THE
WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM EDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.0N 75.5W
ABOUT 165 MI...260 KM SSE OF KINGSTON JAMAICA
ABOUT 275 MI...445 KM SW OF PORT AU PRINCE HAITI
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...STATIONARY
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the
Dominican Republic to Port-Au-Prince
* Jamaica
 
A Tropical Storm Warning in effect for...
* Southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the
Dominican Republic to Port-Au-Prince
* Jamaica
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours before
the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds,
conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and eastern
Cuba should monitor the progress of Melissa.  A hurricane warning
may be required for Jamaica later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was
located near latitude 16.0 North, longitude 75.5 West. Melissa is
nearly stationary, but a slow drift toward the northeast and 
north is expected later today and tonight.  A westward drift is 
then forecast to begin on Saturday and continue through Monday.  On 
the forecast track, the center of Melissa is expected to move near 
or just south of Jamaica early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is forecast over the next day or so, followed
by rapid intensification this weekend.  Melissa is forecast to
become a hurricane by Saturday and a major hurricane by Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
to the east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti on Saturday and Jamaica beginning late Saturday or Sunday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in Haiti later today
and in Jamaica on Saturday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring 8 to 14 inches of rain to 
southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica 
through Sunday night, with locally higher amounts possible. 
Additional heavy rainfall is likely beyond Sunday night; however, 
uncertainty in Melissa’s track and forward speed reduces confidence 
in exact totals. Significant, life-threatening flash flooding and 
numerous landslides are expected in the southern Dominican Republic 
and eastern Jamaica, with catastrophic flash flooding and landslides 
anticipated in southern Haiti.

Across northern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and western 
Jamaica, 3 to 5 inches of rain are expected through Sunday night. 
Flash and urban flooding will be possible through Sunday night. 
Flooding impacts may increase across western Jamaica next week.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total 
Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding is likely along the coast of
Jamaica by Saturday in areas of onshore winds as tropical storm
conditions begin to reach the area.  However, there is a potential
risk of a more significant storm surge, especially along the south
coast of Jamaica, early next week.  Due to Melissa's slow motion and
large forecast uncertainty, it is still too soon to know exactly how
high the storm surge could reach.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions
of Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next several
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.

Tropical Storm Melissa Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
500 AM EDT Fri Oct 24 2025
 
For all intents and purposes, Melissa is nearly stationary over the 
north-central Caribbean Sea.  The estimated center has been 
adjusted a bit based on scatterometer data from last evening, but 
wind direction data from buoy 42058 also suggest that the 
circulation could still be a bit elongated.  There are several deep 
convective bursts embedded within the overall cloud canopy, 
although banding features are not particularly well defined at the 
moment.  An Air Force Reserve mission should provide a more accurate 
estimate of Melissa's center location and intensity in a couple of 
hours, and for now the estimated intensity is maintained at 40 kt.

With Melissa located within a break in the mid-level ridge, the 
steering currents remain weak.  Track models suggest that some 
meandering or a slow northeast to north drift is likely to occur 
over the next 24 hours.  By Saturday, there will likely be just 
enough mid-level ridging building north of the storm to cause 
Melissa to begin moving very slowly westward, with that motion 
continuing through Tuesday.  What's most noteworthy is that several 
reliable models, including the ECMWF, HCCA, and Google DeepMind 
ensemble mean have shifted southward during this period.  The new 
NHC forecast reflects this slight shift, but it's important to note 
that several other models continue to show Melissa's center getting 
perilously close to or over Jamaica in 2-3 days.  A slow 
recurvature is forecast on days 4 and 5, with Melissa potentially 
moving near western Jamaica and approaching southeastern Cuba by 
early Wednesday.  Interestingly, the 00z ECMWF keeps Melissa south 
or southwest of Jamaica through day 5, but it appears to be an 
outlier compared to the other guidance.
 
Strong westerly shear continues to affect Melissa, but there are 
some indications that the shear could gradually decrease over the 
next 24-36 hours.  At the same time, high ocean heat content values 
and stronger upper-level divergence should help to induce 
strengthening.  There is fairly strong agreement among the 
intensity models that a period of rapid intensification could begin 
in about 24 hours, and the NHC forecast shows Melissa becoming a 
hurricane in 36 hours.  Although this is an aggressive forecast 
given Melissa's current structure, several models are even stronger 
than the NHC forecast at that forecast time.  There is less model 
agreement on Melissa's intensity after 48 hours.  In order to 
maintain continuity with previous forecasts, the NHC prediction is 
near the top end of the guidance envelope and close to the Google 
DeepMind ensemble mean.  Other models show flatlining or decreasing 
intensity after 48 hours, but that is likely due to scenarios that 
account for more land interaction.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Jamaica:  Due to Melissa’s slow motion, the risk of a prolonged
multi-day period of potentially damaging winds, heavy rainfall
resulting in life-threatening flash flooding and numerous
landslides, and storm surge continues to increase for Jamaica.
Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to
completion, since strong winds and flooding rains could begin in
Jamaica later today or on Saturday.
 
2. Haiti:  Heavy rainfall will result in catastrophic flash
flooding and landslides across southwestern Haiti by this weekend
into early next week. Extensive damage to roads and buildings is
expected, potentially isolating communities for an extended period
of time. This is a life-threatening situation and immediate
preparations to protect life and property should be taken.  Strong
winds could also potentially last for a day or more over the Tiburon
peninsula of Haiti.
 
3. Remainder of Hispaniola and Eastern Cuba: Heavy rainfall could
also produce significant, life-threatening flash flooding and
numerous landslides in southern Dominican Republic. Interests in
Cuba should monitor the progress of Melissa since the risk of heavy
rainfall, damaging winds, and storm surge appears to be increasing.
