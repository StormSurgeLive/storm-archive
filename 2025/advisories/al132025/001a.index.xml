...HEAVY RAINS EXPECTED TO SPREAD TOWARD HISPANIOLA DURING THE 
NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM EDT...1800 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.2N 72.6W
ABOUT 305 MI...490 KM S OF PORT AU PRINCE HAITI
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 280 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1003 MB...29.62 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Southern coast of Haiti from the border with Dominican Republic
to Port-Au-Prince
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Jamaica
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba
should monitor the progress of Melissa.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was 
located near latitude 14.2 North, longitude 72.6 West. Melissa is 
moving toward the west near 14 mph (22 km/h). A decrease in forward 
speed and a gradual turn to the northwest and north is expected 
during the next few days.  On the forecast track, Melissa is 
expected to approach the southwestern portion of Haiti and Jamaica 
later this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Gradual strengthening is expected during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Melissa can be found in the 
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO 
header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti beginning on Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions could begin
in Jamaica on Thursday or Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa will bring heavy rainfall to Haiti and the
Dominican Republic, with totals of 5 to 10 inches expected through
Friday. Additional heavy rainfall is possible beyond Friday, but
uncertainty regarding the track and forward speed of Melissa
reduces confidence in exact amounts. Areas of significant flash
flooding and mudslides are possible.
 
Over Aruba, Puerto Rico and Jamaica rainfall of 1 to 3 inches is
expected through Friday. Flash and urban flooding will be possible
across Puerto Rico through at least Friday.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Melissa are expected to spread to
Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next couple of
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Melissa Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
1100 AM EDT Tue Oct 21 2025
 
Satellite images, regional Caribbean radar data, and surface 
observations indicate that invest 98L has developed a well-defined 
center and organized deep convection to be designated a tropical 
cyclone.  A ship report that recently passed near the center of the 
system reported a minimum pressure of about 1003 mb.  Satellite 
imagery shows the system is asymmetric, with the low-level center 
near the western edge of the central dense overcast.  The initial 
intensity is set at 45 kt, based on a blend of the latest satellite 
intensity estimates, marking the formation of Tropical Storm 
Melissa.  An  Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to 
investigate the system this afternoon, and their data should provide 
a better assessment of Melissa's strength and structure.  

The system was moving very quickly westward over the past several 
days, but it has slowed down significantly this morning, which has 
likely helped Melissa form.  The initial motion is estimated to be 
280/12 kt.  Melissa should continue to slow down and gradually turn 
to the northwest and then north during the next couple of days 
toward a weakness in the subtropical ridge.  This motion will likely 
take the storm very near the southwestern tip of Haiti and Jamaica 
by Thursday.  After that time, the guidance diverges significantly 
with some models like the GFS and HWRF showing a motion to the 
northeast into the weakness, while the other solutions show a stall 
or a westward drift on the south side of a building ridge.  An 
examination of the GFS, ECMWF, and Google DeepMind ensemble suites 
suggest that the majority of the members show Melissa not moving 
into the weakness and remaining in the Caribbean Sea throughout the 
week and into the weekend.  The NHC official track forecast lies 
between the Google DeepMind ensemble mean track and the correct 
consensus aid, HCCA.

Melissa is expected to be over the very warm waters of the 
Caribbean, but the models suggest that vertical wind shear will be 
moderate with some dry air in the vicinity of the storm during the 
next few days.  Based on these mixed signals, the strengthening 
trend is expected to be slow and steady, not rapid.  However, the 
future intensity of Melissa is linked to the track and since that is 
quite uncertain beyond a couple of days, the strength of the storm 
is also quite uncertain.  The NHC intensity forecast is in best 
agreement with the HCCA model.

Key Messages:

1. Melissa is expected to bring heavy rainfall and the risk of 
significant flash flooding and the danger of landslides to portions 
of Haiti and the Dominican Republic through the weekend.

2. A Hurricane Watch has been issued for the southern coast and 
Tiburon peninsula of Haiti.  A Tropical Storm Watch has been issued 
for Jamaica.  Preparations to protect life and property should be 
completed by Thursday.

3. There is significant uncertainty in the track and intensity 
forecast of Melissa.  Interests elsewhere in Hispaniola and Cuba 
should continue to monitor the latest forecasts.
