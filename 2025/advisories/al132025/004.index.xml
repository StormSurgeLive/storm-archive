Tropical Storm Melissa Advisory Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
500 AM EDT Wed Oct 22 2025
 
...MELISSA RE-FORMS TO THE NORTHEAST...
...HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLOODING EXPECTED OVER PORTIONS OF HISPANIOLA 
AND JAMAICA...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM EDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.3N 73.5W
ABOUT 305 MI...495 KM SSW OF PORT AU PRINCE HAITI
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the
Dominican Republic to Port-Au-Prince
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Jamaica
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba
should monitor the progress of Melissa.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was
located by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near 
latitude 14.3 North, longitude 73.5 West. Melissa is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h). A decrease in forward 
speed and a gradual turn to the northwest and north-northwest is 
expected during the next few days.  On the forecast track, Melissa 
is expected to approach Jamaica and the southwestern portion of 
Haiti later this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some gradual strengthening is anticipated during the next few days, 
and Melissa could become a hurricane on Thursday.  
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches) 
based on Air Force dropsonde data.  
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti beginning late on Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions could
begin in Jamaica late on Thursday or Friday.
 
RAINFALL:  Melissa is expected to bring 5 to 10 inches of rain to 
the southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern 
Jamaica through Saturday, with locally higher amounts possible. 
Additional heavy rainfall is possible beyond Saturday; however, 
uncertainty in Melissaâ€™s track and forward speed reduces confidence 
in exact totals. Significant flash flooding and landslides are 
possible.

Across the northern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and western 
Jamaica, 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected through Saturday. For 
Aruba and Puerto Rico, 1 to 3 inches are expected through the same 
period. Flash and urban flooding will be possible through at least 
Saturday.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total 
Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Melissa are expected to spread to
Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next couple of
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.

Tropical Storm Melissa Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
1100 PM EDT Tue Oct 21 2025

Melissa continues to be under the influence of significant westerly 
vertical wind shear.  The center of the storm appears to be exposed 
to the west of a cluster of very deep convection, and overall the 
system is not very well organized with poorly-defined banding 
features.  The advisory intensity is held at 45 kt in agreement 
with a Dvorak classification from TAFB, though objective intensity 
estimates from UW-CIMSS are somewhat lower.  An Air Force Reserve 
Unit Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate the 
tropical cyclone in a few hours and should provide a good intensity 
estimate.  Melissa remains an asymmetric storm with most of the 
strong winds over the northeastern and eastern portions of the 
circulation.

The system continues to move a little southwest of the previous 
track with an initial motion estimate of 270/11 kt.  The track 
forecast for the next several days remains quite challenging.  
Melissa is likely to remain in a region of weak steering currents 
for most of this week.  Once again, the GFS model looks like an 
outlier with a track across Hispaniola by this weekend and most of 
the other guidance much farther south and west. The future track 
depends, among other things, on how strong and vertically deep 
Melissa will become while it is over the Caribbean, and how much a 
mid-level trough digs along the U.S. east coast during the next 
5 days.  A stronger tropical cyclone would likely move more 
northward or northeastward than a weak system would.  The new 
official forecast is shifted somewhat west of the previous one and 
is in good agreement with the dynamical model consensus and the FSU 
Superensemble solution.  The latest Google DeepMind ensemble mean is 
just a little to the left of the official forecast.

Water vapor imagery continues to show upper-level westerlies ahead 
of Melissa, and the shear is not likely to decrease much over the 
next few days.  The SHIPS guidance using the large-scale predictors 
from the ECMWF model indicates some relaxation of the shear in 3-5 
days.  The official intensity forecast, like the previous one, 
shows strengthening into a hurricane by the latter part of the 
forecast period.  This is in good agreement with the LGEM guidance. 
However it should be noted that this is a low-confidence intensity 
forecast.

Key Messages:
 
1. Melissa is expected to produce heavy rainfall across portions of 
the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica through this weekend, 
bringing a risk of significant flash flooding and landslides.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are possible in the southwestern peninsula
of Haiti where a Hurricane Watch is in effect.  A Tropical Storm
Watch is in effect for Jamaica.  Preparations to protect life and
property should be completed by Thursday.
 
3. There is significant uncertainty in the track and intensity
forecast of Melissa.  Interests elsewhere in Hispaniola and Cuba
should continue to monitor the latest forecasts.
