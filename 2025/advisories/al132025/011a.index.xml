NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
200 AM EDT Fri Oct 24 2025
 
...LIFE-THREATENING AND CATASTROPHIC FLASH FLOODING AND LANDSLIDES 
EXPECTED IN PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN HISPANIOLA AND JAMAICA THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM EDT...0600 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.2N 75.4W
ABOUT 155 MI...250 KM SE OF KINGSTON JAMAICA
ABOUT 265 MI...425 KM SW OF PORT AU PRINCE HAITI
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 10 DEGREES AT 2 MPH...4 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the
Dominican Republic to Port-Au-Prince
* Jamaica
 
A Tropical Storm Warning in effect for...
* Southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the
Dominican Republic to Port-Au-Prince
* Jamaica
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours before
the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds,
conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and eastern 
Cuba should monitor the progress of Melissa. A hurricane warning 
will likely be required for Jamaica later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products 
issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was
located near latitude 16.2 North, longitude 75.4 West.  Melissa is
drifting toward the north near 2 mph (4 km/h).  A slow northward or
north-northeastward motion is forecast during the next day or so,
followed by a sharp turn westward over the weekend. On the forecast
track, Melissa is expected to move closer to Jamaica and the
southwestern portion of Haiti during the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Gradual strengthening is forecast over the next day or so, followed 
by rapid intensification this weekend.  Melissa is forecast to 
become a hurricane by Saturday and a major hurricane by the end of 
the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
to the east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti on Saturday and Jamaica beginning late Saturday or Sunday. 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in Haiti later today 
and in Jamaica on Saturday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring 8 to 14 inches of rain to the
southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica
through Sunday, with locally higher amounts possible.  Additional
heavy rainfall is likely beyond Sunday; however, uncertainty in
Melissa's track and forward speed reduces confidence in exact
totals.  Significant, life-threatening flash flooding and numerous
landslides are expected in the southern Dominican Republic and
eastern Jamaica, with catastrophic flash flooding and landslides
anticipated in southern Haiti.
 
Across the northern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and western
Jamaica, 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected through Sunday.  Flash
and urban flooding will be possible through Sunday.  Flooding 
impacts may increase across western Jamaica next week.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding is likely along the coast of
Jamaica by Saturday in areas of onshore winds as tropical storm 
conditions begin to reach the area.  However, there is a potential 
risk of a more significant storm surge, especially along the south 
coast of Jamaica, early next week.  Due to Melissa's slow motion and 
large forecast uncertainty, it is still too soon to know exactly how 
high the storm surge could reach.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions
of Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next several
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 500 AM EDT.

Tropical Storm Melissa Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
1100 PM EDT Thu Oct 23 2025

Melissa has gotten a little better organized this evening, with the 
low-level center re-forming a little to the north close to a burst 
of deep convection. However, tail Doppler radar data from a NOAA 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft suggests the storm is still not 
vertically aligned, and the circulation at 700 and 500 mb is still 
poorly defined. The central pressure remains near 1001 mb, so the 
initial intensity will be held at 40 kt. However, the aircraft wind 
data suggest this could be a little generous.

The initial motion is now slowly northward, 355/3 kt. Melissa 
remains trapped in an area of weak steering currents between 
mid-level ridges to the southeast and northwest.  During the next 
couple of days, the ridge to the northwest is forecast to build 
eastward to the north of Melissa in the wake of a mid-latitude 
shortwave trough currently moving eastward through the Bahamas.  
This evolution would cause Melissa to move slowly northward for the 
next 24 h or so, followed by a westerly turn at a continued slow 
forward speed.  The GFS and the HAFS regional hurricane models show 
a more initial eastward motion possibly due to center re-formation, 
and due to this they forecast a track east of Jamaica, followed by 
an eventual northward motion toward eastern Cuba.  The ECMWF, 
Canadian, UKMET, HFIP Corrected Consensus, and Google DeepMind 
forecast a more westerly track that passes south of Jamaica, 
followed by a northward turn near or west of the western end of the 
island near the end of the forecast period. The HRWF, HMON, and the 
other consensus models are in between these and forecast the center 
to cross Jamaica. The new forecast continues to follow the more 
westerly solution and is little changed from the previous forecast. 
It should be noted that regardless of the exact track, the center 
of Melissa is likely to pass dangerously close to Jamaica during 
the next few days, and it could also come close to the southwestern 
peninsula of Haiti.

Melissa is still feeling the effects of about 15 kt of westerly 
shear, and between this and the disorganized structure only slow 
strengthening is expected during the next 24 h. After that time, a 
combination of more favorable upper-level winds and very warm sea 
surface temperatures should allow considerable strengthening once 
the cyclone gets better organized. The intensity guidance remains 
in good agreement on the possibility of rapid intensification as 
the center nears Jamaica, and the new intensity forecast is 
unchanged from the previous forecast.  In addition, the tropical 
cyclone is expected to grow significantly in size, and it will 
likely be a large and dangerous hurricane towards the end of the 
forecast period.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Jamaica:  Due to Melissa’s slow motion, the risk of a prolonged
multi-day period of potentially damaging winds, heavy rainfall
resulting in life-threatening flash flooding and numerous
landslides, and storm surge continues to increase for Jamaica.
Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to
completion, since strong winds and flooding rains could begin in
Jamaica by Saturday.
 
2. Haiti:  Heavy rainfall will result in catastrophic flash
flooding and landslides across southwestern Haiti by this weekend
into early next week. Extensive damage to roads and buildings is
expected, potentially isolating communities for an extended period
of time. This is a life-threatening situation and immediate
preparations to protect life and property should be taken.  Strong
winds could also potentially last for a day or more over the Tiburon
peninsula of Haiti.
 
3. Remainder of Hispaniola and Eastern Cuba: Heavy rainfall could
also produce significant, life-threatening flash flooding and
numerous landslides in southern Dominican Republic. Interests in
Cuba should monitor the progress of Melissa since the risk of heavy
rainfall, damaging winds, and storm surge appears to be increasing.
