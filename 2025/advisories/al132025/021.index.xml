WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Jamaica
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the
Dominican Republic to Port-Au-Prince
* Cuban provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and
Holguin.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning in effect for...
* Southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the
Dominican Republic to Port-Au-Prince
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be complete.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, the
southeastern and central Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands, 
and Bermuda should monitor the progress of Melissa. Additional 
watches and warnings could be required later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Melissa was located 
by NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 16.4 North, 
longitude 76.6 West. Melissa is moving toward the west near 3 mph  
(6 km/h). A slow westward motion is expected today, followed by a 
turn to the north and northeast on Monday and Tuesday. On the 
forecast track, the core of Melissa is expected to move near or 
over Jamaica on Tuesday, across southeastern Cuba Tuesday 
night, and across the southeastern Bahamas on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 140 mph (220 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Melissa is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional intensification is forecast over 
the next day or so, followed by fluctuations in intensity.  Melissa 
is expected to be a powerful major hurricane when making landfall in 
Jamaica Monday night or Tuesday morning and southeastern Cuba late 
Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated by aircraft dropsonde data 
is 953 mb (28.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are likely occuring in Jamaica, with
hurricane conditions expected to begin by Monday. Tropical storm
conditions are expected in the warning area in Haiti today. The
potential for hurricane conditions in the watch area in Haiti have
diminished for today, but there is still a possibility of hurricane
conditions occurring there on Tuesday. Hurricane conditions are
possible in the watch area in eastern Cuba on Tuesday into
Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring storm total rainfall of 15 to
30 inches to portions of southern Hispaniola and Jamaica through
Wednesday, with local maxima of 40 inches possible.  Catastrophic
flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely.
 
For eastern Cuba, total rainfall of 10 to 15 inches, with local
amounts to 20 inches, is expected by Tuesday into Wednesday
resulting in life-threatening flash flooding and numerous
landslides.
 
Over the Southeast Bahamas, total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches is
expected Tuesday into Wednesday resulting in areas of flash
flooding.  Over the Turks and Caicos, total rainfall of 1 to 4
inches is expected Tuesday into Wednesday.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Life-threatening storm surge is likely along the south
coast of Jamaica late Monday through Tuesday morning.  Peak
storm surge heights could reach 9 to 13 feet above ground level,
near and to the east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall.
This storm surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
There is a potential for significant storm surge along the 
southeast coast of Cuba late Tuesday or Wednesday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions of
Hispaniola, Jamaica, eastern Cuba, and the Cayman Islands during the
next several days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Melissa Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
500 AM EDT Sun Oct 26 2025
 
Melissa is in the midst of a period of extreme rapid
intensification.  Its intensity has increased by 50 kt over the
past 24 hours and 35 kt over the past 12 hours.  Data from the last
pass of an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft through the
eye just before 1 AM EDT indicated that maximum winds had increased
to 105 kt and the pressure had fallen to 958 mb.  The eye has been
clearing out and warming since that time in infrared satellite
imagery, with the Dvorak data-T numbers from both TAFB and SAB up to
T6.0/115 kt at 2 AM EDT.  The intensity is estimated to be 120 kt at
the time of this advisory based on the latest AiDT and DPRINT
estimates.
 
The center had taken a west-southwestward jog over the past 12
hours, but more recent frames of satellite images suggest it is now
moving westward (270 degrees) at 4 kt.  There is very little change
in the forecast reasoning or the forecast track itself.  Over the
next 48 hours, Melissa is expected to make a slow westward to
north-northeastward recurvature just to the south of Jamaica, likely
reaching the island's southern coast Tuesday morning.  An
acceleration toward the northeast is expected after 48 hours when
Melissa is picked up by a trough moving off the southeast coast of
the United States, and this motion should bring the center across
southeastern Cuba late Tuesday or early Wednesday, across the
southeastern Bahamas later on Wednesday, and then reaching the
vicinity of Bermuda on Friday.
 
It's assumed that the current period of rapid intensification will
continue, and Melissa could reach category 5 intensity by tonight.
An eyewall replacement would be likely to occur at some point over
the next couple of days, which would cause a decrease or at least
fluctuations in Melissa's intensity after 24 hours.  Regardless,
Melissa is forecast to reach Jamaica as a category 4 hurricane,
which will only compound any damages caused by heavy rainfall and
flooding over the next 2 days.  Melissa is likely to weaken a
little during its passage across Jamaica, but intensity guidance
suggests that it will likely still be a major hurricane when it
reaches southeastern Cuba late Tuesday and the southeastern Bahamas
on Wednesday.  Stronger shear should cause the storm to weaken
below major hurricane strength on days 4 and 5 while over the
western Atlantic.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Jamaica:  Seek shelter now.  Damaging winds and heavy rainfall
today and on Monday will cause catastrophic and life-threatening
flash flooding and numerous landslides before the strongest winds
arrive Monday night and Tuesday morning.  Extensive infrastructural
damage, long-duration power and communication outages, and isolation
of communities are expected. Life-threatening storm surge is likely
along portions of the southern coast Monday night and Tuesday
morning.
 
2. Haiti:  Catastrophic and life-threatening flash flooding and
landslides are expected across southwestern Haiti through midweek,
likely causing extensive infrastructural damage and isolation
of communities. Although winds are temporarily decreasing on the
Tiburon peninsula, they could increase again across much of western
Haiti on Tuesday.
 
3. Dominican Republic: Heavy rainfall through midweek could produce
catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides in southern
portions of the country.
 
4. Eastern Cuba, Southeast Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos:
Monitor Melissa closely.  There is an increasing risk of a
significant storm surge, damaging winds, and heavy rainfall by the
middle of the week. In eastern Cuba, the risk of life-threatening
flash flooding and landslides is increasing. A Hurricane Watch is in
effect for portions of eastern Cuba.
