IN PORTIONS OF JAMAICA AND SOUTHERN HISPANIOLA ALSO EXPECTED...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM EDT...0600 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.3N 77.7W
ABOUT 130 MI...210 KM SSW OF KINGSTON JAMAICA
ABOUT 315 MI...505 KM SSW OF GUANTANAMO CUBA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...150 MPH...240 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 270 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...926 MB...27.34 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Jamaica
* Cuban provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and
Holguin.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Haiti
* Cuban province of Las Tunas
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be complete in Jamaica and rushed to completion 
in Cuba.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests in the southeastern and central Bahamas, the Turks and 
Caicos Islands, and Bermuda should monitor the progress of Melissa.  
Additional watches and warnings are likely today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products 
issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Melissa was
located near latitude 16.3 North, longitude 77.7 West. Melissa is
moving toward the west near 5 mph (7 km/h). A turn to the north and 
northeast is expected today and on Tuesday.  On the forecast track, 
the core of Melissa is expected to move near or over Jamaica 
tonight and Tuesday, across southeastern Cuba Tuesday night, and 
across the southeastern Bahamas on Wednesday.
 
Satellite images indicate that maximum sustained winds have 
increased to near 150 mph (240 km/h) with higher gusts.  Melissa is 
a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  
Additional intensification is forecast today, followed by 
fluctuations in intensity before Melissa reaches Jamaica.  Melissa 
is expected to be a powerful major hurricane when making landfall 
in Jamaica and southeastern Cuba.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195
miles (315 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 926 mb (27.34 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occuring in Jamaica, and
hurricane conditions are expected to begin tonight. Wind speeds atop 
and on the windward sides of hills and mountains could be up to 30 
percent stronger than the near-surface winds indicated in this 
advisory, and in some elevated locations could be even greater.

Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in eastern Cuba by 
Tuesday afternoon, with hurricane conditions expected to begin in 
the hurricane warning area by Tuesday evening. Tropical storm 
conditions are expected in Haiti late Tuesday and Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring rainfall of 15 to 30 inches
to portions of Jamaica and additional rainfall of 8 to 16 inches for
southern Hispaniola through Wednesday, with storm total local maxima
of 40 inches possible.  Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous
landslides are likely.
 
For eastern Cuba, storm total rainfall of 10 to 15 inches, with
local amounts to 20 inches, is expected today into Wednesday
resulting in life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash
flooding with numerous landslides.
 
Over the Southeast Bahamas, total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches is
expected Tuesday into Wednesday resulting in areas of flash
flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: A life-threatening storm surge is likely along the
south coast of Jamaica late today through Tuesday morning.  Peak
storm surge heights could reach 9 to 13 feet above ground level,
near and to the east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall.
This storm surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
There is a potential for significant storm surge along the southeast
coast of Cuba late Tuesday or Wednesday. Peak storm surge heights
could reach 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels, near and to the
east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall. This storm surge
will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions of
Hispaniola, Jamaica, eastern Cuba, and the Cayman Islands during the
next several days, and the Bahamas and Bermuda later this week.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM EDT.

Hurricane Melissa Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
1100 PM EDT Sun Oct 26 2025
 
Melissa remains a very intense hurricane with a well-defined eye
surrounded by extremely cold cloud tops, significantly colder than
-80 deg C.  The cloud pattern is quite symmetrical on satellite
imagery with strong upper-level outflow, especially over the
northern semicircle.  A NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft has been
investigating the system this evening and found that the central
pressure had fallen to near 933 mb, and peak flight-level winds
support an intensity of 125 kt.  It should be noted that
satellite-based estimates, including subjective Dvorak analyses of 
T7.0, suggest a higher intensity than found by the aircraft thus 
far.

Although the eye wobbled a bit to the south recently, this is 
believed to be temporary and a more representative initial motion 
estimate is about 270/4 kt.  The track forecast reasoning is 
essentially unchanged from the previous advisory. The mid-level 
ridge that had been steering Melissa westward is expected to weaken 
by tomorrow.  This should allow the hurricane to turn to the north 
and north-northeast during the next day or so.  Then, a developing 
mid-level trough near the southeast U.S. coast is expected to 
cause Melissa to move northeastward with increasing forward 
speed.  The official track forecast is very similar to the 
previous one and lies between the HFIP corrected consensus and 
Google DeepMind ensemble mean predictions.

Since the hurricane is expected to remain in a relatively low 
vertical wind shear environment during the next day or two, it is 
expected to strengthen some more until it interacts with the land 
masses of Jamaica and eastern Cuba.  The global models show stronger 
vertical shear north of Cuba so the system should gradually weaken 
later in the period.  The official intensity forecast remains on 
the high side of the model guidance.  
  
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Jamaica:  Seek shelter now.  Damaging winds and heavy rainfall
tonight and Monday will cause catastrophic and life-threatening
flash flooding and numerous landslides before potentially
devastating winds arrive Monday night and Tuesday morning.
Extensive infrastructural damage, long-duration power and
communication outages, and isolation of communities are expected.
Life-threatening storm surge and damaging waves are expected along
portions of the southern coast Monday night and Tuesday morning.
 
2. Haiti and the Dominican Republic:  Catastrophic and
life-threatening flash flooding and landslides are expected across
southwestern Haiti and southern portions of the Dominican Republic
through midweek.  In Haiti, extensive infrastructural damage and
isolation of communities are likely. Although winds have temporarily
decreased on the Tiburon peninsula, they are likely to increase
again across much of western Haiti on Tuesday.
 
3. Eastern Cuba:  Life-threatening storm surge is expected along
portions of the southern coast of eastern Cuba late Tuesday and
Tuesday night.  Damaging winds and heavy rainfall with
life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding and
landslides are also expected beginning on Monday.  Preparations
should be rushed to completion.
 
4. Southeast Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos: Monitor Melissa
closely.  There is an increasing risk of a significant storm surge,
damaging winds, and heavy rainfall Tuesday and Wednesday.  Watches
will likely be required early Monday.
