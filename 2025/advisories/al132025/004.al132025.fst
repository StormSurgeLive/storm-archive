DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was
located by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near 
latitude 14.3 North, longitude 73.5 West. Melissa is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h). A decrease in forward 
speed and a gradual turn to the northwest and north-northwest is 
expected during the next few days.  On the forecast track, Melissa 
is expected to approach Jamaica and the southwestern portion of 
Haiti later this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some gradual strengthening is anticipated during the next few days, 
and Melissa could become a hurricane on Thursday.  
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches) 
based on Air Force dropsonde data.  
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti beginning late on Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions could
begin in Jamaica late on Thursday or Friday.
 
RAINFALL:  Melissa is expected to bring 5 to 10 inches of rain to 
the southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern 
Jamaica through Saturday, with locally higher amounts possible. 
Additional heavy rainfall is possible beyond Saturday; however, 
uncertainty in Melissaâ€™s track and forward speed reduces confidence 
in exact totals. Significant flash flooding and landslides are 
possible.

Across the northern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and western 
Jamaica, 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected through Saturday. For 
Aruba and Puerto Rico, 1 to 3 inches are expected through the same 
period. Flash and urban flooding will be possible through at least 
Saturday.

Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total 
Rainfall Graphic, available at

SURF:  Swells generated by Melissa are expected to spread to
Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next couple of
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
