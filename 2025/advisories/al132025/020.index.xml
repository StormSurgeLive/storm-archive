36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be complete.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, the
southeastern and central Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands
should monitor the progress of Melissa.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Melissa was
located near latitude 16.3 North, longitude 76.3 West. Melissa is
moving toward the west near 5 mph (7 km/h). A slow westward motion
is expected today, followed by a turn to the north and northeast on
Monday and Tuesday. On the forecast track, the center of Melissa is
expected to move near or over Jamaica through Tuesday, across
southeastern Cuba Tuesday night, and across the southeastern
Bahamas on Wednesday.
 
Satellite images indicate that maximum sustained winds have rapidly
increased to near 140 mph (220 km/h) with higher gusts.  Melissa is
a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.
Continued rapid intensification is expected through tonight,
followed by fluctuations in intensity.  Melissa is expected to be a
major hurricane when making landfall in Jamaica Monday night or
Tuesday morning and southeastern Cuba late Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 944 mb (27.88 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are likely occuring in Jamaica,
with hurricane conditions expected by Monday. Tropical storm
conditions are expected in the warning area in Haiti today. The
potential for hurricane conditions in the watch area in Haiti
have diminished for today, but there is still a possibility of
hurricane conditions occurring there on Tuesday. Hurricane
conditions are possible in the watch area in eastern Cuba on Tuesday
into Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring total rainfall of 15 to 30
inches to portions of southern Hispaniola and Jamaica into
Wednesday, with local maxima of 40 inches possible.  Additional
heavy rainfall is likely beyond Wednesday; uncertainty at that time
range precludes exact storm totals.  Catastrophic flash flooding and
landslides are probable across portions of southern Hispaniola and
Jamaica.
 
For eastern Cuba, total rainfall of 6 to 12 inches, with local
amounts to 18 inches, are expected into Wednesday resulting in
life-threatening flash flooding and landslides. Additional heavy
rainfall is likely beyond Wednesday; uncertainty at that time range
precludes exact storm totals.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Life-threatening storm surge is likely along the south
coast of Jamaica late Monday through Tuesday morning.  Peak
storm surge heights could reach 9 to 13 feet above ground level,
near and to the east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall.
This storm surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
There is a potential for significant storm surge along the
southeast coast of Cuba late Tuesday or Wednesday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions of
Hispaniola, Jamaica, eastern Cuba, and the Cayman Islands during the
next several days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.

      <title>Hurricane Melissa Forecast Discussion Number 19</title>

Hurricane Melissa Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
1100 PM EDT Sat Oct 25 2025
 
Reports from NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft
indicate that Melissa is continuing rapid intensification. The Air 
Force aircraft reported flight-level winds of 115 kt in the north 
eyewall of the 17 nm wide eye at 700 mb, along with a central 
pressure of 967 mb.  Based on these data, the initial intensity is 
increased to 100 kt, making Melissa a category 3 major hurricane.
 
The initial motion is now just south of due west or 265/3 kt.  A
low- to mid-level ridge to the north of Melissa should steer the
hurricane generally westward at a slow forward speed during the
next 36 h or so. After that time, a deep-layer mid-latitude trough
moving through the southeastern United States will break the ridge,
with Melissa expected to turn northward and then recurve into the
mid-latitude southwesterly flow. The guidance is fairly well
clustered during the first 72 h, with Melissa expected to pass over
Jamaica in 48-60 h and then be near or over eastern Cuba around 72
h. Beyond 72 h, there is some speed and direction spread, but
overall the guidance is in good agreement that Melissa should
accelerate northeastward through portions of the Bahamas into the
Atlantic.  The new forecast track is a little to the south and west
of the previous track through 60 h and similar to the previous
track after that time.
 
Rapid intensification is expected to continue for the next 24-36 h,
and it is possible that during this time Melissa could intensify 
even faster than what is currently forecast.  The regional hurricane
models show the cyclone peaking before it reaches Jamaica, and
based on this the new forecast keeps a 48-h peak intensity of 140
kt. Afterwards, some inner-core oscillations such as eyewall
replacement cycles could lead to fluctuations in intensity before
Melissa's first landfall in Jamaica. It must be noted that there is 
very little practical difference in the overall impacts of a 
Category 4 or 5 landfall, and Melissa is expected to be at least 
that intensity when it moves over Jamaica.  Melissa should weaken 
as it interacts with Jamaica and Cuba, although it is still forecast 
to be a major hurricane when it nears Cuba. A faster weakening 
should occur after passing Cuba when the cyclone encounters strong 
shear over the southwestern Atlantic.
 
This remains a very serious situation, in terms of catastrophic
rainfall, wind, and storm surge hazards for Jamaica, and
preparations should be rushed to completion in the area currently
under a Hurricane Warning.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Jamaica:  Seek shelter now.  A multi-day period of damaging
winds and heavy rainfall have begun and will cause catastrophic and
life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides.  Extensive
infrastructural damage, long-duration power and communication
outages, and isolation of communities are expected.
Life-threatening storm surge is likely along portions of the
southern coast early next week.
 
2. Haiti:  Catastrophic and life-threatening flash flooding and
landslides are expected across southwestern Haiti into early next
week, likely causing extensive infrastructural damage and isolation
of communities.  Strong winds could last for a day or more over the
Tiburon peninsula.
 
3. Dominican Republic: Heavy rainfall through the middle of next
week could produce catastrophic flash flooding and numerous
landslides in southern portions of the country.
 
4. Eastern Cuba, Southeast Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos:
Monitor Melissa closely.  There is an increasing risk of a
significant storm surge, damaging winds, and heavy rainfall by the
middle of next week. In eastern Cuba, the risk of life-threatening
flash flooding and landslides is increasing. A Hurricane Watch is in
effect for portions of eastern Cuba.
