...MELISSA EXPECTED TO RAPIDLY INTENSIFY INTO A MAJOR HURRICANE
THIS WEEKEND...
...LIFE-THREATENING AND CATASTROPHIC FLASH FLOODING AND LANDSLIDES
EXPECTED IN PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN HISPANIOLA AND JAMAICA THROUGH THE
WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM EDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.0N 74.3W
ABOUT 215 MI...345 KM SE OF KINGSTON JAMAICA
ABOUT 225 MI...360 KM SW OF PORT AU PRINCE HAITI
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 360 DEGREES AT 2 MPH...4 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...995 MB...29.39 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the
Dominican Republic to Port-Au-Prince
* Jamaica
 
A Tropical Storm Warning in effect for...
* Southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the
Dominican Republic to Port-Au-Prince
* Jamaica
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours before
the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds,
conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and eastern
Cuba, and the Bahamas should monitor the progress of Melissa.  A
hurricane warning may be required for Jamaica later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was 
located near latitude 16.0 North, longitude 74.3 West. Melissa is 
moving slowly toward the north near 2 mph (4 km/h). A turn to the 
west is forecast on Saturday and this general motion is expected to 
continue through Monday. A turn to the north and northeast is 
forecast on Tuesday and Wednesday. On the forecast track, the center 
of Melissa is expected to move near or over Jamaica early next week 
and could be near or over eastern Cuba by the middle of next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Rapid intensification is now forecast over the 
next several days, and Melissa is forecast to become a hurricane 
tomorrow and a major hurricane by Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in 
Haiti later this weekend and Jamaica beginning late this weekend or 
early next week. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in 
Haiti tonight or Saturday and in Jamaica late Saturday into Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring total rainfall of 15 to 25 
inches to portions of southern Hispaniola and Jamaica through 
Tuesday, with local maxima of 35 inches possible across the Tiburon 
Peninsula of Haiti.  Additional heavy rainfall is likely beyond 
Tuesday. The uncertainty at that time range precludes exact storm 
totals.  Potentially catastrophic flash flooding and landslides are 
possible across portions of Jamaica and the southern Dominican 
Republic, while catastrophic flash flooding is anticipated in 
southern Haiti.

For southeast Cuba, total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches, with local 
amounts to 12 inches, are possible into Tuesday.  Additional heavy 
rainfall is likely beyond Tuesday. The uncertainty at that time 
range precludes exact storm totals.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding is likely along the coast of
Jamaica by Saturday in areas of onshore winds as tropical storm
conditions begin to reach the area.  

However, there is a risk of a more life-threatening storm surge, 
especially along the south coast of Jamaica, early next week.  Peak 
storm surge heights could reach 5 to 10 feet above ground level, 
near and to the east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall. 
This storm surge will be accompanied by large and destructive 
waves. 
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions
of Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next several
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM EDT.

      <title>Tropical Storm Melissa Forecast Discussion Number 13</title>

Tropical Storm Melissa Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
1100 AM EDT Fri Oct 24 2025

The Air Force Reserve reconnaissance that has been flying through 
Melissa this morning found the center significantly further to 
the east-southeast than what was observed last night. How much of 
this position is related to a real motion, or a center reformation 
is unclear at this time. The storm remains about the same on 
satellite imagery this morning, with a large burst of 
deep convection, primarily along its southeastern flank, with 
evidence of northwesterly shear still undercutting the outflow. A 
WSFM microwave pass shows very deep hot towers, but not with that 
much structure beyond that. In addition, there hasn't been a 
significant change to Melissa's intensity, with peak 850 mb flight 
level winds of 49 kt, and these winds support maintaining 40 kt 
intensity this advisory. 

As has been stated for the last few days, the lack of persistent 
steering currents, due to competing mid-level ridges to the 
southeast and northwest of Melissa, is responsible for the storm's 
very slow motion. This is likely to continue for the next day or so, 
and much of the system's motion could be just as influenced by 
center reformations during this time period. After 24 hours, the 
mid-level ridge located to the northwest is expected to strengthen 
to the north of Melissa, and the guidance is coming into better 
agreement on a very slow westward motion through 72 hours. Beyond 
that time frame, a strengthening mid-latitude trough expected to 
move into the Southeastern U.S., should provide an avenue for 
Melissa to escape the Caribbean Sea to the northeast by the end of 
the forecast period. The track guidance overall has shifted south 
over the first few days, but there is still substantial spread in 
solutions at the end of the forecast period, related to when and 
how fast Melissa turns to the northeast. The latest NHC track 
forecast is a little south of the prior one early on, but is 
shifted a little eastward in 4-5 days, roughly a blend of the latest 
HCCA and GDMI model aid solutions. On the forecast track, Melissa 
could potentially be near western Jamaica by day 4 and near or 
over southeastern Cuba by day 5, though timing still remains more 
uncertain than usual. 
 
The GFS and ECMWF-based SHIPS shear guidance indicates the 
deep-layer shear is lower than yesterday, between 14-17 kt, but 
there still appears to be mid-level shear undercutting the outflow 
layer. Until Melissa also become better aligned vertically, any 
intensification is likely to be slow to occur over the next 12 h or 
so. After that, once Melissa's structure improves, environmental 
conditions still appear favorable for a period of rapid 
intensification (RI). Every single Google DeepMind member shows the 
system become a Category 4 hurricane or higher, and the uncertainty 
is more related on the timing of when RI occurs. After 96 hours, 
Melissa could weaken some due to the combined effects of land 
interaction, and an increase in southwesterly vertical wind shear by 
the end of the forecast period. The latest NHC intensity forecast is 
on the higher end of the model solutions, but more or less in line 
with the latest GDMI guidance.
 
Key Messages:

1. Jamaica:  Due to Melissa’s slow motion, the risk of a prolonged 
multi-day period of potentially damaging winds, heavy rainfall 
resulting in life-threatening flash flooding and numerous 
landslides, and storm surge continues to increase for Jamaica. 
Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to 
completion, since strong winds and flooding rains could begin in 
Jamaica on Saturday or Sunday.
 
2. Haiti:  Heavy rainfall will result in catastrophic flash flooding 
and landslides across southwestern Haiti into early next week. 
Extensive damage to roads and buildings is expected, potentially 
isolating communities for an extended period of time. This is a 
life-threatening situation and immediate preparations to protect 
life and property should be taken.  Strong winds could also 
potentially last for a day or more over the Tiburon peninsula of 
Haiti.
 
3. Remainder of Hispaniola and Eastern Cuba: Heavy rainfall could 
also produce significant, life-threatening flash flooding and 
numerous landslides in southern Dominican Republic. Interests in 
Cuba should monitor the progress of Melissa since the risk of heavy 
rainfall, damaging winds, and storm surge appears to be increasing.
