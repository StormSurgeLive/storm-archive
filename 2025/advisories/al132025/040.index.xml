The Meteorological Service of Bermuda has discontinued the Hurricane 
Warning for Bermuda.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
None.
 
After Melissa becomes post-tropical, a brief period of heavy rain
and gusty winds is possible over the southern Avalon Peninsula of
Newfoundland tonight. For more information on impacts in Canada, see
the Canadian Hurricane Center website at
https://weather.gc.ca/hurricane/index_e.html
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Melissa was 
located near latitude 35.9 North, longitude 64.0 West. Melissa is 
moving toward the northeast near 41 mph (67 km/h). This general 
motion is expected to continue into Saturday, followed by a gradual 
slowdown and turn toward the east-northeast later this weekend. On 
the forecast track, the center of Melissa is expected to pass to the 
south of the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland as a post-tropical 
cyclone tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Melissa is expected to become a strong post-tropical cyclone 
later today, with gradual weakening forecast over the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 265
miles (425 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 973 mb (28.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Gusty winds over Bermuda will gradually subside this morning.
Gusty winds are possible over the southern Avalon Peninsula of
Newfoundland tonight.
 
RAINFALL: A brief period of heavy rain is possible over the southern
Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland tonight.
 
STORM SURGE: Water levels should continue to subside this morning
for Bermuda.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa will continue to affect portions
of Hispaniola, Cuba, the Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and
Bermuda during the next couple of days. These swells are expected to
reach the coast of the Northeastern United States and Atlantic
Canada today and persist into the weekend. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Melissa Discussion Number  40
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
500 AM AST Fri Oct 31 2025
 
Recent satellite images show Melissa is quickly losing tropical 
characteristics. The estimated low-level center is displaced well to 
the west of the weakening convection associated with the system. 
Decreasing satellite intensity estimates and the latest global model 
wind fields support lowering the intensity to 80 kt this morning. 
Earlier ASCAT data showed an expanding wind field in the southern 
semicircle of Melissa, with 50-kt winds that extended up to 140 n mi 
from the center in the southeastern quadrant. Large swells from 
Melissa are spreading over much of the western Atlantic, resulting 
in hazardous marine conditions in this region.

Melissa remains in a highly-sheared environment and will move over 
rapidly cooling SSTs while completing extratropical transition 
today. Based on current satellite trends and simulated satellite 
imagery from the GFS and ECMWF, the updated NHC forecast now shows 
Melissa becoming a hurricane-force extratropical cyclone in 12 h, 
though this could occur as soon as later this morning. Gradual 
weakening is forecast over the next few days, but Melissa will 
remain a large and powerful extratropical cyclone as it moves over 
the North Atlantic through early next week.

Melissa is racing northeastward (040/36 kt) away from Bermuda and is 
expected to continue this general motion for the next day or two 
within the flow ahead of an upper-level trough. The tightly 
clustered track guidance agrees that the center of post-tropical 
Melissa will pass near, but to the south of, the Avalon Peninsula of 
Newfoundland late tonight, bringing the potential for some gusty 
winds and heavy rain. Later this weekend, Melissa is forecast to 
turn east-northeastward while interacting with a higher-latitude, 
upper-level low over the North Atlantic. The latest NHC track 
prediction remains very similar to the previous forecast, generally 
following a blend of the HCCA and GDMI aids.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Bermuda: Gusty winds over Bermuda are expected to gradually 
subside this morning.
 
2. Post-storm safety:  Follow advice of local officials and avoid 
areas of downed power lines and flooding. The flooding across Cuba, 
Jamaica, and Hispaniola could persist for another day or two. Ensure 
generators are properly ventilated and placed outside at least 20 
feet away from dwellings and garages to avoid carbon monoxide 
poisoning. During clean up, be careful when using chainsaws and 
power tools. Drink plenty of water to avoid heat exhaustion.
