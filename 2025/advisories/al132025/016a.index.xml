...MELISSA NEAR HURRICANE STRENGTH AND FORECAST TO RAPIDLY INTENSIFY 
THIS WEEKEND...
...LIFE-THREATENING AND CATASTROPHIC FLASH FLOODING AND LANDSLIDES 
EXPECTED IN PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN HISPANIOLA AND JAMAICA THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM EDT...1200 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.4N 75.0W
ABOUT 160 MI...260 KM SE OF KINGSTON JAMAICA
ABOUT 235 MI...375 KM SW OF PORT AU PRINCE HAITI
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...70 MPH...110 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 1 MPH...2 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...982 MB...29.00 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Jamaica
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the
Dominican Republic to Port-Au-Prince
 
A Tropical Storm Warning in effect for...
* Southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the
Dominican Republic to Port-Au-Prince
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, eastern Cuba,
the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands should monitor the
progress of Melissa. Watches could be required for portions of
eastern Cuba later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was
located by both NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft near latitude 16.4 North, longitude 75.0 West. Melissa is
moving slowly toward the west-northwest near 1 mph (2 km/h). 
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Rapid intensification is forecast to begin over the next 24 
hours. Melissa is forecast to become a hurricane shortly and a major 
hurricane by Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure measured by Air Force and NOAA aircraft 
dropsonde data is 982 mb (29.00 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in Jamaica by
tonight, with hurricane conditions expected by Sunday or Monday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected and hurricane conditions are
possible within the watch and warning area in Haiti later today.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring total rainfall of 15 to 25
inches to portions of southern Hispaniola and Jamaica through
Tuesday, with local maxima of 35 inches possible across the Tiburon
Peninsula of Haiti.  Additional heavy rainfall is likely beyond
Tuesday; uncertainty at that time range precludes exact storm
totals.  Potential catastrophic flash flooding and landslides are
possible across portions of Jamaica and the southern Dominican
Republic, while catastrophic flash flooding is anticipated in
southern Haiti.
 
For eastern Cuba, total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches, with local
amounts to 12 inches, is possible into Tuesday.  Additional heavy
rainfall is likely beyond Tuesday; uncertainty at that time range
precludes exact storm totals.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding is likely along the coast of
Jamaica starting by tonight in areas of onshore winds as tropical
storm conditions begin to reach the area.
 
However, there is a risk of a more life-threatening storm surge,
especially along the south coast of Jamaica, later in the
weekend or early next week.  Peak storm surge heights could reach 5
to 10 feet above ground level, near and to the east of where the
center of Melissa makes landfall. This storm surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions
of Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next several
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.

Tropical Storm Melissa Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
500 AM EDT Sat Oct 25 2025
 
During the last center fix of the Air Force Reserve mission into 
Melissa several hours ago, a dropsonde measured a surface pressure 
of 989 mb with winds of 27 kt, suggesting that the central pressure 
has fallen to about 986 mb.  The plane did not measure stronger 
winds, but it did not fly through the area due east of the center, 
which is where a nearly coincident ASCAT pass suggested the 
strongest winds would be located.  Some westerly shear is still 
evident, but the center is now embedded far enough under the 
Central Dense Overcast to yield Dvorak estimates of T4.0/65 kt from 
TAFB and T3.5/55 kt from SAB.  The current intensity is estimated to 
be 60 kt based on all these data.  It's also worth noting that an 
eye feature has occasionally been apparent in radar images from 
Jamaica.

Melissa is currently moving slowly northwestward (310/3 kt).  
Steering currents will remain weak for the next 3 days, and Melissa 
is forecast to drift westward through Sunday night to the south of 
Jamaica.  A sharp but still very slow turn toward the north is 
expected Monday and Monday night.  Unfortunately, a large majority 
of the latest reliable track models show Melissa making landfall on 
Jamaica in about 72 hours.  What's most concerning here is that the 
island is likely to experience a couple of days of heavy rainfall 
and tropical-storm-force winds before the core--and strongest 
winds--even reach the coast.  An increase in forward motion is 
expected by days 4 and 5, with Melissa accelerating northeastward 
across eastern Cuba, the southeastern Bahamas, and the Turks and 
Caicos Islands.  Although there are some speed differences among 
the models, for the most part the cross-track spread is generally 
small.
 
Although some westerly shear is likely to continue for the next few 
days, high oceanic heat content and stronger upper-level 
divergence should be able to support significant strengthening.  
The dynamical model-based Rapid Intensification (RI) indices 
(DTOPS) in particular are quite aggressive, showing a very high 
probability of a 55-kt increase in intensity over the next 48 
hours.  In addition, 41 of the 50 Google DeepMind ensemble members 
show Melissa at category 4 or 5 strength by Monday afternoon (60 
hours), which is the same time that the NHC forecast continues to 
show a peak intensity of 135 kt.  Although some slight weakening is 
possible after 60 hours, possibly due to the circulation 
interacting with land and/or an eyewall replacement, Melissa still 
has a significant possibility of making landfall on Jamaica as a 
major hurricane.  Melissa could maintain major hurricane strength 
when it reaches eastern Cuba, but increased shear should lead to 
weakening below major hurricane strength by day 5.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Jamaica:  Melissa’s slow movement will bring a multi-day period
of damaging winds and heavy rainfall beginning tonight, likely 
causing catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides.  There 
is an increasing risk of life-threatening storm surge early next 
week. All preparations should be completed today.
 
2. Haiti:  Catastrophic flash flooding and landslides are expected
across southwestern Haiti into early next week, likely causing
extensive infrastructural damage and potentially prolonged isolation
of communities. Immediate preparations to protect life and property
are urged. Strong winds could also potentially last for a day or
more over the Tiburon peninsula.
 
3. Dominican Republic: Heavy rainfall could produce potentially
catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides in southern
regions.
 
4. Eastern Cuba, Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos:  Monitor Melissa
closely.  There is an increasing risk of a significant storm surge, 
damaging winds, and heavy rainfall by the middle of next week. In 
eastern Cuba, the risk of life-threatening flash flooding and 
landslides is increasing.
