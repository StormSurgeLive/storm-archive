DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was
estimated near latitude 14.2 North, longitude 74.0 West.  While the 
storm has recently been nearly stationary, Melissa is expected to 
move toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h) overnight.  A decrease 
in forward speed and a gradual turn to the northwest and north is 
expected during the next few days.  On the forecast track, Melissa 
is expected to approach Jamaica and the southwestern portion of 
Haiti later this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual strengthening is expected during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti beginning late on Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions could
begin in Jamaica on Thursday or Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is forecast to bring 5 to 10 inches of rain to
southern Haiti and the southern Dominican Republic through Friday,
with locally higher amounts possible.  Across eastern Jamaica, 4 to
8 inches of rain are expected, also with locally higher amounts
possible.  Additional heavy rainfall is possible beyond Friday;
however, uncertainty in Melissaâ€™s track and forward speed reduces
confidence in exact totals. Significant flash flooding and
landslides are possible.
 
Across the northern Dominican Republic and northern Haiti, 2 to 4
inches of rain are expected through Friday. For Aruba, western
Jamaica, and Puerto Rico, 1 to 3 inches are expected through the 
same period. Flash and urban flooding will be possible through at 
least Friday.
