WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the
Dominican Republic to Port-Au-Prince
* Jamaica
 
A Tropical Storm Warning in effect for...
* Southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the
Dominican Republic to Port-Au-Prince
* Jamaica
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours before
the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds,
conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and eastern 
Cuba, and the Bahamas should monitor the progress of Melissa.  A 
hurricane warning may be required for Jamaica later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was 
located by Air Force Reserve reconnaissance data near latitude 15.6 
North, longitude 74.4 West. Melissa is drifting toward the 
east-southeast near 2 mph (4 km/h). A turn to the northeast and 
north at a continued slow motion is expected to begin this afternoon 
and tonight. A westward turn is forecast on Saturday and this 
general motion is expected to continue through Monday. A turn to the 
north and northeast is forecast on Tuesday and Wednesday. On the 
forecast track, the center of Melissa is expected to move near or 
just south of Jamaica early next week and could be near eastern Cuba 
by the middle of next week. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Additional strengthening is forecast today, followed by rapid 
intensification this weekend. Melissa is forecast to become a 
hurricane by Saturday and a major hurricane by Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated by aircraft dropsonde data is 
997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti later this weekend and Jamaica beginning late this weekend or
early next week. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin
in Haiti tonight or Saturday and in Jamaica later this weekend.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring 10 to 20 inches of rain to
portions of southwestern Haiti and eastern Jamaica through Monday,
with locally higher amounts possible. Rainfall amounts of 6 to 12
inches are expected across the rest of southern Haiti and the
southern Dominican Republic. Additional heavy rainfall is likely
beyond Monday. However, uncertainty in Melissaâ€™s track and forward
speed reduces confidence in exact totals. Significant,
life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides are expected
in the southern Dominican Republic and eastern Jamaica, with
catastrophic flash flooding and landslides anticipated in southern
Haiti.
 
Across portions of northern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and
western Jamaica, 3 to 5 inches of rain is expected through Monday.
Flash and urban flooding will be possible. Flooding impacts will
likely increase across western Jamaica next week.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding is likely along the coast of
Jamaica by Saturday in areas of onshore winds as tropical storm
conditions begin to reach the area.  However, there is a potential
risk of a more significant storm surge, especially along the south
coast of Jamaica, early next week.  Due to Melissa's slow motion and
large forecast uncertainty, it is still too soon to know exactly how
high the storm surge could reach.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions
of Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next several
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM EDT.

Tropical Storm Melissa Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
1100 AM EDT Fri Oct 24 2025

The Air Force Reserve reconnaissance that has been flying through 
Melissa this morning found the center significantly further to 
the east-southeast than what was observed last night. How much of 
this position is related to a real motion, or a center reformation 
is unclear at this time. The storm remains about the same on 
satellite imagery this morning, with a large burst of 
deep convection, primarily along its southeastern flank, with 
evidence of northwesterly shear still undercutting the outflow. A 
WSFM microwave pass shows very deep hot towers, but not with that 
much structure beyond that. In addition, there hasn't been a 
significant change to Melissa's intensity, with peak 850 mb flight 
level winds of 49 kt, and these winds support maintaining 40 kt 
intensity this advisory. 

As has been stated for the last few days, the lack of persistent 
steering currents, due to competing mid-level ridges to the 
southeast and northwest of Melissa, is responsible for the storm's 
very slow motion. This is likely to continue for the next day or so, 
and much of the system's motion could be just as influenced by 
center reformations during this time period. After 24 hours, the 
mid-level ridge located to the northwest is expected to strengthen 
to the north of Melissa, and the guidance is coming into better 
agreement on a very slow westward motion through 72 hours. Beyond 
that time frame, a strengthening mid-latitude trough expected to 
move into the Southeastern U.S., should provide an avenue for 
Melissa to escape the Caribbean Sea to the northeast by the end of 
the forecast period. The track guidance overall has shifted south 
over the first few days, but there is still substantial spread in 
solutions at the end of the forecast period, related to when and 
how fast Melissa turns to the northeast. The latest NHC track 
forecast is a little south of the prior one early on, but is 
shifted a little eastward in 4-5 days, roughly a blend of the latest 
HCCA and GDMI model aid solutions. On the forecast track, Melissa 
could potentially be near western Jamaica by day 4 and near or 
over southeastern Cuba by day 5, though timing still remains more 
uncertain than usual. 
 
The GFS and ECMWF-based SHIPS shear guidance indicates the 
deep-layer shear is lower than yesterday, between 14-17 kt, but 
there still appears to be mid-level shear undercutting the outflow 
layer. Until Melissa also become better aligned vertically, any 
intensification is likely to be slow to occur over the next 12 h or 
so. After that, once Melissa's structure improves, environmental 
conditions still appear favorable for a period of rapid 
intensification (RI). Every single Google DeepMind member shows the 
system become a Category 4 hurricane or higher, and the uncertainty 
is more related on the timing of when RI occurs. After 96 hours, 
Melissa could weaken some due to the combined effects of land 
interaction, and an increase in southwesterly vertical wind shear by 
the end of the forecast period. The latest NHC intensity forecast is 
on the higher end of the model solutions, but more or less in line 
with the latest GDMI guidance.
 
Key Messages:

1. Jamaica:  Due to Melissaâ€™s slow motion, the risk of a prolonged 
multi-day period of potentially damaging winds, heavy rainfall 
resulting in life-threatening flash flooding and numerous 
landslides, and storm surge continues to increase for Jamaica. 
Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to 
completion, since strong winds and flooding rains could begin in 
Jamaica on Saturday or Sunday.
 
2. Haiti:  Heavy rainfall will result in catastrophic flash flooding 
and landslides across southwestern Haiti into early next week. 
Extensive damage to roads and buildings is expected, potentially 
isolating communities for an extended period of time. This is a 
life-threatening situation and immediate preparations to protect 
life and property should be taken.  Strong winds could also 
potentially last for a day or more over the Tiburon peninsula of 
Haiti.
 
3. Remainder of Hispaniola and Eastern Cuba: Heavy rainfall could 
also produce significant, life-threatening flash flooding and 
numerous landslides in southern Dominican Republic. Interests in 
Cuba should monitor the progress of Melissa since the risk of heavy 
rainfall, damaging winds, and storm surge appears to be increasing.
