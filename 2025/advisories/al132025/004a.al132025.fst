DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was 
located by Air Force Reserve Reconnaissance aircraft near latitude 
14.3 North, longitude 73.5 West. Melissa is moving very slowly 
toward the west-northwest near 2 mph (4 km/h). A slow forward speed 
and a gradual turn to the northwest and north-northwest is expected 
during the next few days.  On the forecast track, Melissa is 
expected to approach Jamaica and the southwestern portion of Haiti 
later this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some gradual strengthening is anticipated during the next few days, 
and Melissa could become a hurricane on Thursday.  
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated by aircraft dropsonde data 
is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti beginning late on Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions could
begin in Jamaica late on Thursday or Friday.
 
RAINFALL:  Melissa is expected to bring 5 to 10 inches of rain to 
the southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica 
through Saturday, with locally higher amounts possible. Additional 
heavy rainfall is possible beyond Saturday; however, uncertainty in 
Melissaâ€™s track and forward speed reduces confidence in exact 
totals. Significant flash flooding and landslides are possible.
 
Across the northern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and western
Jamaica, 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected through Saturday. For
Aruba and Puerto Rico, 1 to 3 inches are expected through the same
period. Flash and urban flooding will be possible through at least
Saturday.

days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
