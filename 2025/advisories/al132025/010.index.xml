ABOUT 185 MI...300 KM SSE OF KINGSTON JAMAICA
ABOUT 295 MI...475 KM SW OF PORT AU PRINCE HAITI
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 345 DEGREES AT 2 MPH...4 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the
Dominican Republic to Port-Au-Prince
* Jamaica
 
A Tropical Storm Warning in effect for...
* Southwestern peninsula of Haiti from the border with the
Dominican Republic to Port-Au-Prince
* Jamaica
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours before
the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds,
conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba
should monitor the progress of Melissa. A hurricane warning may be
required for the island of Jamaica tonight or tomorrow.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was
located near latitude 15.6 North, longitude 75.5 West. Melissa is
moving toward the north-northwest near 2 mph (4 km/h). A slow
northward or north-northeastward motion is forecast during the next
day or so, followed by a sharp turn westward over the weekend. On
the forecast track, Melissa is expected to move closer to Jamaica
and the southwestern portion of Haiti during the next couple of
days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is forecast over the next day or so, followed
by rapid intensification this weekend.  Melissa is forecast to
become a hurricane by Saturday and a major hurricane by the end
of the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti and Jamaica beginning on late Friday or Saturday. Tropical
storm conditions are expected to begin in Haiti and Jamaica earlier
on Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring 8 to 14 inches of rain to the
southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica
through Sunday, with locally higher amounts possible. Additional
heavy rainfall is likely beyond Sunday. However, uncertainty in
Melissa’s track and forward speed reduces confidence in exact
totals. Significant, life-threatening flash flooding and numerous
landslides are expected.
 
Across northern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and western
Jamaica, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected through Sunday. Flash and
urban flooding will be possible through Sunday. Flooding impacts may
increase across western Jamaica next week.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding is likely along the coast of
Jamaica by late Friday into Saturday in areas of onshore winds as
tropical storm conditions begin to reach the area. However, there is
potential risk of a more significant storm surge, especially along
the south coast of Jamaica, early next week.  Due to Melissa’s slow
motion and large forecast uncertainty, it is still too soon to know
exactly how high the storm surge could reach.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions
of Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next several
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM EDT.

      <title>Tropical Storm Melissa Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Tropical Storm Melissa Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
1100 AM EDT Thu Oct 23 2025

Melissa's structure has undergone a metamorphosis this morning. 
Convection developed up-shear of the system for the first time after 
the prior advisory, with some evidence of loose banding beginning to 
take shape. This structure could indicate that the westerly vertical 
wind shear that has been affecting the system the last couple of 
days is beginning to subside, and could allow the low and mid-level 
centers to become better aligned. For now though, the surface 
circulation remains rather broad and still tilted to the northeast 
with height. The peak 850 mb flight level winds from the ongoing Air 
Force Reserve reconnaissance mission have only been 40 to 45 kt. A 
blend of the lower aircraft data and higher satellite estimates 
results in the initial intensity being adjusted to 40 kt for this 
advisory. 

The center of the tropical storm may have reformed northward from 
last night, as the last several aircraft fixes indicates a very 
slow north-northwestward drift, estimated at 345/2 kt. As has been 
emphasized over the last few discussions, Melissa is likely to 
continue moving very slowly as it drifts northward towards a 
weakness in the mid-level ridging produced by an upper-level trough 
over the Bahamas. This trough is expected to lift out over the next 
24-48 hours, allowing a narrow mid-level ridge to build back in from 
the west. In response, the track guidance shows Melissa turning 
westward between 48 to 96 h, but the ridge remains centered to the 
northwest, likely explaining why the forward motion is expected to 
remain quite slow. Compared to 24 h ago, the guidance is in better 
agreement on this westward turn, but how sharp this turn is, and how 
far northward Melissa makes it in the meantime still remains 
uncertain. A variety of model solutions show Melissa south of 
Jamaica (ECMWF), over Jamaica (GDMI), or north of Jamaica (HMON). 
The track forecast this cycle continues to split the difference 
between the HFIP Corrected Consensus Approach (HCCA) and GDMI 
solutions, and is shifted a bit north compared to the previous track 
forecast.

The shear over Melissa has been gradually decreasing, now under 20 
kt in the latest ECMWF-SHIPS guidance. This shear is expected to 
decrease further, remaining between 10-15 kt over the remainder of 
the forecast period. Other environmental favors are also very 
favorable, with 30-31 C sea-surface temperatures, and sufficient 
mid-level moisture. The main intensity challenge is predicting when 
Melissa becomes a more symmetric and vertical aligned tropical 
cyclone. Given the improved structure seen on satellite, it seems 
the time-table for this process to occur has moved up in the 
forecast period. Assuming Melissa can then establish an inner core 
in the next 48 hours, a period of rapid intensification also appears 
increasingly likely, sometime in the 2 to 3 day period. The latest 
NHC intensity forecast now makes Melissa a hurricane in 48 hours, a 
major hurricane in 72 h, and a peak intensity of 115 kt in 96 hours. 
The end intensity could be conservative if Melissa ends up further 
south of Jamaica with less land interaction, as suggested by the 00z 
ECMWF and HAFS guidance. Over this period, the tropical cyclone is 
expected to grow in size, and likely be a large and dangerous 
hurricane towards the end of the forecast period.
 
Key Messages:

1. Melissa is expected to meander over the central Caribbean Sea for 
several days and become a major hurricane by late this weekend or 
early next week.  Due to Melissa’s slow motion, the risk of a 
prolonged multi-day period of potentially damaging winds, heavy 
rainfall resulting in life-threatening flash flooding and numerous 
landslides, and coastal flooding continues to increase for Jamaica.  
Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to 
completion, since strong winds and flooding rains could begin in 
Jamaica by Friday or Saturday. 

2.  Strong winds could also potentially last for a day or more over 
the Tiburon peninsula of Haiti.  In addition, interests in Cuba and 
the rest of Haiti are urged to continue monitoring the latest 
forecasts for Melissa.
 
3. In addition to Jamaica, Melissa will produce heavy rainfall 
across portions of the southern Dominican Republic and southern 
Haiti through this weekend and continuing into next week. This 
rainfall will result in significant, life-threatening flash flooding 
and numerous landslides.
