DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Melissa was
located near latitude 15.6 North, longitude 75.5 West. Melissa is
moving toward the north-northwest near 2 mph (4 km/h). A slow
northward or north-northeastward motion is forecast during the next
day or so, followed by a sharp turn westward over the weekend. On
the forecast track, Melissa is expected to move closer to Jamaica
and the southwestern portion of Haiti during the next couple of
days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is forecast over the next day or so, followed
by rapid intensification this weekend.  Melissa is forecast to
become a hurricane by Saturday and a major hurricane by the end
of the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in
Haiti and Jamaica beginning on late Friday or Saturday. Tropical
storm conditions are expected to begin in Haiti and Jamaica earlier
on Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring 8 to 14 inches of rain to the
southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica
through Sunday, with locally higher amounts possible. Additional
heavy rainfall is likely beyond Sunday. However, uncertainty in
Melissa’s track and forward speed reduces confidence in exact
totals. Significant, life-threatening flash flooding and numerous
landslides are expected.
 
Across northern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and western
Jamaica, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected through Sunday. Flash and
urban flooding will be possible through Sunday. Flooding impacts may
increase across western Jamaica next week.

Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at

STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding is likely along the coast of
Jamaica by late Friday into Saturday in areas of onshore winds as
tropical storm conditions begin to reach the area. However, there is
potential risk of a more significant storm surge, especially along
the south coast of Jamaica, early next week.  Due to Melissa’s slow
motion and large forecast uncertainty, it is still too soon to know
exactly how high the storm surge could reach.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions
of Hispaniola, Jamaica, and eastern Cuba during the next several
days.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
