located by Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft near latitude 
15.5 North, longitude 74.9 West. Melissa is moving toward the 
northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h). A slow northwest or north motion is 
forecast during the next couple of days, followed by a westward turn

move closer to Jamaica and the southwestern portion of Haiti during 
the next couple of days.

Little change in strength is expected during the next day or so, but 
significant strengthening is expected by late Friday and over the

days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in 
Haiti and Jamaica beginning on Friday afternoon.  Tropical storm 
conditions are expected to begin in Jamaica earlier on Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring 5 to 10 inches of rain to the
southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica
through Sunday, with locally higher amounts possible. Additional
heavy rainfall is possible beyond Sunday; however, uncertainty in
Melissaâ€™s track and forward speed reduces confidence in exact
totals. Significant, life-threatening flash flooding and numerous
landslides are possible.
 
Across Puerto Rico, northern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, and
western Jamaica, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected through Sunday.
Flash and urban flooding will be possible through at least Sunday.
