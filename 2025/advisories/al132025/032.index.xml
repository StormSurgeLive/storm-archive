DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Melissa was 
located near latitude 20.3 North, longitude 76.1 West. Melissa is 
moving toward the northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h). A faster 
northeastward motion is expected during the next few days. On the 
forecast track, the core of Melissa is expected to cross eastern 
Cuba this morning, move across the southeastern or central Bahamas 
later today, and pass near or to the west of Bermuda late Thursday 
and Thursday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Melissa is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Melissa is expected to remain a powerful 
hurricane when it moves across the Bahamas later today and passes 
near Bermuda on Thursday night.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the 
center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 
miles (295 km). Leeward Point Field in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, 
recently reported a sustained wind of 59 mph (94 km/h) and a gust of 
75 mph (120 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 960 mb (28.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Damaging winds are subsiding across Jamaica, but residents
are advised to remain in a safe shelter until sunrise.
 
Hurricane conditions are occurring within the warning area in Cuba.
Tropical storm conditions are expected in Haiti today.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in the southeastern and central
Bahamas today. Tropical storm conditions are expected and hurricane
conditions are possible in the Turks and Caicos Islands today.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible on Bermuda late Thursday and
Thursday night.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring an additional 3 to 6 inches
across Jamaica, where storm total amounts will be between 12 to 24
inches. Isolated areas near 30 inches will be possible over
mountainous terrain. Ongoing catastrophic flash flooding and
numerous landslides will continue today and into tonight.
 
For eastern Cuba, storm total rainfall of 10 to 20 inches are
expected through today with local amounts to 25 inches expected over
mountainous terrain. This will cause life-threatening and
potentially catastrophic flash flooding with numerous landslides.
 
Over the Southeastern Bahamas, storm total rainfall of 5 to 10
inches are expected today, which will result in areas of flash
flooding. For the Turks and Caicos, rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches
are expected. Heavy rain may begin to affect Bermuda on Thursday or
Thursday night.
 
Over southern Hispaniola, additional rainfall of 2 to 6 inches are
expected today, with storm total local maxima of 40 inches possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: There is a potential for significant storm surge along
the southeast coast of Cuba this morning. Peak storm surge heights
could reach 8 to 12 feet above normal tide levels, near and to the
east of where the center of Melissa made landfall. This storm surge
will be accompanied by large and destructive waves. Minor coastal
flooding is possible in bays and inlets along the north coast of
eastern Cuba.
 
Storm surge of 5 to 8 ft above normally dry ground is possible in
the southeastern Bahamas today, and 2 to 4 ft above normally dry
ground is possible in the Turks and Caicos Islands today.
 
Minor coastal flooding is expected along the coast of Haiti.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa will continue to affect portions
of Hispaniola, Jamaica, eastern Cuba, and the Cayman Islands during
the next day or so, causing life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. These swells are beginning to reach the Bahamas and the
Turks and Caicos Islands, and will spread toward Bermuda later this
week. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.

Hurricane Melissa Discussion Number  31
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
1100 PM EDT Tue Oct 28 2025
 
Melissa's passage over Jamaica this afternoon and evening caused a
significant amount of weakening.  The pressure rose nearly 60 mb,
and the maximum winds decreased by about 50 kt based on data
collected by the NOAA Hurricane Hunters earlier this evening.
However, now that the core is pulling away from Jamaica, satellite
images and radar data from Cuba show that the eye is becoming better
defined again and the eyewall is gaining symmetry.  Melissa appears
to be on a strengthening trend, and based on a combination of the
earlier aircraft data and the latest satellite intensity estimates,
the initial wind speed is set at 115 kt.  The inner core appears
larger than it was earlier today.
 
The hurricane has turned to the northeast and is currently moving at
040/8 kt. A trough is expected to amplify and shift eastward across
the southeast U.S. during the next few days.  This feature combined
with a subtropical ridge over the central Atlantic should cause
Melissa to accelerate northeastward through the end of the week.
This motion should take the core of Melissa over eastern Cuba
overnight, and then across portions of the southeast and central
Bahamas on Wednesday.  Melissa will likely be in the vicinity of
Bermuda late Thursday.  The models are in good agreement, but there
is some along-track (timing) spread.  The NHC track forecast is
similar to the previous one and near a blend of the HCCA and Google
DeepMind ensemble mean.
 
Melissa is expected to continue to strengthen until it reaches Cuba
in a few hours, and it is expected to make landfall there as a very
dangerous major hurricane. After Melissa moves inland, the passage
over the rugged island combined with a gradual increase in vertical
wind shear and intrusions of dry air should cause the hurricane to
gradually weaken through the period.  That being said, Melissa is
still expected to be a powerful hurricane when it moves through the
Bahamas and near Bermuda.  The models suggest that Melissa should
complete extratropical transition by 72 hours when it is forecast to
have crossed the north wall of the Gulf Stream current. The NHC
intensity forecast is above the guidance in the short term, based on
recent data trends, but generally near the middle of the guidance
envelope from 36 to 120 h.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Jamaica: Although Melissa is pulling away from the island,
deadly hazards remain including downed power lines and flooded
areas.  Ensure generators are properly ventilated and placed outside
at least 20 feet away from doors, windows, and garages to avoid
carbon monoxide poisoning. If you are cleaning up storm damage, be
careful when using chainsaws and power tools, and drink plenty of
water to avoid heat exhaustion.
 
2. Haiti and the Dominican Republic: Catastrophic flash flooding and
landslides are expected across southwestern Haiti and southern
portions of the Dominican Republic during the next day or so. In
Haiti, extensive damage and isolation of communities is likely.
Tropical storm conditions are expected into Wednesday.
 
3. Eastern Cuba: Life-threatening storm surge, flash flooding and
landslides, and extremely damaging hurricane winds are likely
through Wednesday morning. Seek safe shelter now.
 
4. Southeastern and Central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos:
Hurricane conditions, life-threatening storm surge, and heavy
rainfall are expected across portions of the southeastern and
central Bahamas on Wednesday. Complete preparations by tonight and
follow local official guidance. Tropical storm conditions, heavy
rains, and significant storm surge are expected in the Turks and
Caicos Islands on Wednesday.
 
5. Bermuda: Hurricane conditions and heavy rainfall are possible in
Bermuda beginning Thursday or Thursday night, where a Hurricane
Watch is in effect.
