DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Melissa was
located near latitude 18.5 North, longitude 77.7 West. Melissa is
moving toward the north-northeast near 8 mph (13 km/h). A turn
toward the northeast with an increase in forward speed is expected
this evening, followed by a faster northeastward motion on
Wednesday and Thursday. On the forecast track, the core of Melissa
will move away from western Jamaica this evening. After that, the
center is expected to move over southeastern Cuba later tonight
and early Wednesday morning, move across the southeastern or central
Bahamas later on Wednesday, and approach Bermuda Thursday and
Thursday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Melissa is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Melissa is expected to reach southeastern
Cuba as an extremely dangerous major hurricane, and it could
still be a major hurricane when it moves across the southeastern
Bahamas. NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft will
be investigating Melissa this evening.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles
(315 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 921 mb (27.20 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
WIND: Damaging winds will continue across portions of Jamaica
through this evening, especially in mountainous areas. Remain in a
safe shelter in Jamaica through tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are spreading across eastern Cuba, with
hurricane conditions expected in the hurricane warning area
starting tonight into Wednesday morning. Tropical storm conditions
are expected in Haiti tonight and Wednesday.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in the southeastern and central
Bahamas on Wednesday. Tropical storm conditions are expected and
hurricane conditions are possible in the Turks and Caicos Islands on
Wednesday.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible on Bermuda Thursday and Thursday
night.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring an additional 6 to 12 inches
across Jamaica, where storm total amounts will be between 12 to 24
inches. Isolated areas near 30 inches will be possible over
mountainous terrain. Ongoing catastrophic flash flooding and
numerous landslides will continue through Tuesday night.
 
For eastern Cuba, storm total rainfall of 10 to 20 inches is
expected through Wednesday, with local amounts to 25 inches expected
over mountainous terrain. This will cause life-threatening and
potentially catastrophic flash flooding with numerous landslides.
 
Over the Southeast Bahamas, storm total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches
is expected through Wednesday, which will result in areas of flash
flooding. For the Turks and Caicos, rainfall totals of 1 to 3
inches are expected. Heavy rain may begin to affect Bermuda Thursday
night.
 
Over southern Hispaniola, additional rainfall of 2 to 6 inches is
expected through Wednesday, with storm total local maxima of 40
inches possible.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Melissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total
Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf
 
STORM SURGE: On the northwest coast of Jamaica, near Montego Bay,
there is the possibility of 2 to 4 feet of storm surge above ground
level. Storm surge flooding on the southern coast of Jamaica should
subside tonight.
 
There is a potential for significant storm surge along the southeast
coast of Cuba late today or Wednesday. Peak storm surge heights
could reach 8 to 12 feet above normal tide levels, near and to the
east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall. This storm surge
will be accompanied by large and destructive waves. Minor coastal
flooding is possible in bays and inlets along the north coast of
eastern Cuba.
 
Storm surge of 5 to 8 ft above normally dry ground is possible in
the southeastern Bahamas on Wednesday, and 2 to 4 ft above normally
dry ground in the Turks and Caicos Islands on Wednesday.
 
Minor coastal flooding is expected along the coast of Haiti.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions of
Hispaniola, Jamaica, eastern Cuba, and the Cayman Islands during the
next day or two, likely causing life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. These swells will reach the Bahamas, the Turks
and Caicos Islands, and Bermuda later this week. Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Melissa Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132025
500 PM EDT Tue Oct 28 2025
 
The eye of Melissa made landfall in western Jamaica near 17Z with
maximum sustained winds estimated at 160 kt and a central pressure
near 892 mb. Since that time, the hurricane has been weakening over
the mountains of western Jamaica with the eye disappearing and some
warming of the convective cloud tops. Based on these changes, the
initial intensity has been reduced to a highly uncertain 125 kt.
NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft are scheduled
to investigate Melissa this evening to provide better information
on how much it has weakened. It should be noted that while
Melissa's landfall intensity is among the strongest ever recorded
in the Atlantic basin, it will take extensive post-analysis to
determine exactly where it ranks among landfalling Atlantic
hurricanes.
 
The initial motion is now 025/7. A turn toward the northeast with
an increase in forward speed is expected this evening, and this
should bring the center near or over southeastern Cuba late tonight
or early Wednesday. After that, an even faster motion toward the
northeast should bring the center through the southeastern and
central Bahamas on Wednesday and near Bermuda Thursday or Thursday
night. After passing Bermuda, the cyclone should continue quickly
northeastward into the north Atlantic. The track guidance envelope
has shifted a little to the left (north and west) through 72 h
since the last advisory, and the new forecast track during this
time is also shifted a little to the north and west.
 
While the center of Melissa is now emerging over water, it will 
probably not re-intensify significantly before landfall in Cuba due 
to the limited amount of time before landfall and an upper-level 
wind environment that is becoming less favorable. Based on this, the
intensity forecast calls for little change in strength before
Melissa reaches Cuba.  After leaving Cuba, Melissa should encounter
increasing southwesterly vertical shear that should cause gradual
weakening, although the cyclone should still be at hurricane
strength when it passes near Bermuda. Based on global model
guidance, Melissa is forecast to become a strong extratropical
cyclone over the North Atlantic by 96 h.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Jamaica: Remain in a safe shelter tonight. Damaging winds will
continue over portions of Jamaica this evening. Catastrophic flash
flooding, and landslides, are expected across the island tonight
with widespread infrastructure damage, power and communication
outages, and isolated communities.
 
2. Haiti and the Dominican Republic: Catastrophic flash flooding
and landslides are expected across southwestern Haiti and southern
portions of the Dominican Republic during the next day or so. In
Haiti, extensive damage and isolation of communities is likely.
Tropical storm conditions are expected later today and Wednesday.
 
3. Eastern Cuba: Heavy rainfall, flash flooding and landslides are
expected soon. Life-threatening storm surge and damaging winds are
likely to begin later today. Seek safe shelter.
 
4. Southeastern and Central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos:
Hurricane conditions, life-threatening storm surge, and heavy
rainfall are expected across portions of the southeastern and
central Bahamas on Wednesday. Complete preparations by tonight and
follow local official guidance. Tropical storm conditions, heavy
rains, and significant storm surge are expected in the Turks and
Caicos Islands on Wednesday.
 
5. Bermuda: Hurricane conditions and heavy rainfall are possible in
Bermuda beginning Thursday or Thursday night where a Hurricane
Watch is now in effect.

THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND LIFE-THREATENING SITUATION!  
Residents should not leave their shelter and should remain in place 
through the passage of these life-threatening conditions. To protect 
yourself from wind, the best thing you can do is put as many walls 
as possible between you and the outside. An interior room without 
windows, ideally one where you can also avoid falling trees, is the 
safest place you can be in a building. You can cover yourself with a 
mattress and wear a helmet for added protection.

EDT (2100 UTC). This is the last scheduled position update.
