WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occuring in Jamaica, and
hurricane conditions are expected to begin tonight. Wind speeds atop 
and on the windward sides of hills and mountains could be up to 30 
percent stronger than the near-surface winds indicated in this 
advisory, and in some elevated locations could be even greater.

Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in eastern Cuba by 
Tuesday afternoon, with hurricane conditions expected to begin in 
the hurricane warning area by Tuesday evening. Tropical storm 
conditions are expected in Haiti late Tuesday and Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring rainfall of 15 to 30 inches
to portions of Jamaica and additional rainfall of 8 to 16 inches for
southern Hispaniola through Wednesday, with storm total local maxima
of 40 inches possible.  Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous
landslides are likely.
 
For eastern Cuba, storm total rainfall of 10 to 15 inches, with
local amounts to 20 inches, is expected today into Wednesday
resulting in life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash
flooding with numerous landslides.
 
Over the Southeast Bahamas, total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches is
expected Tuesday into Wednesday resulting in areas of flash
flooding.

STORM SURGE: A life-threatening storm surge is likely along the
south coast of Jamaica late today through Tuesday morning.  Peak
storm surge heights could reach 9 to 13 feet above ground level,
near and to the east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall.
This storm surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
There is a potential for significant storm surge along the southeast
coast of Cuba late Tuesday or Wednesday. Peak storm surge heights
could reach 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels, near and to the
east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall. This storm surge
will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions of
Hispaniola, Jamaica, eastern Cuba, and the Cayman Islands during the
next several days, and the Bahamas and Bermuda later this week.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
