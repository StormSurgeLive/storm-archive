expected. Heavy rain may begin to affect Bermuda on Thursday or
Thursday night.
 
Rainfall has diminished across Jamaica.  However, additional
scattered showers are possible with additional rainfall amounts of
2 to 4 inches.  This will bring storm total amounts to 12 to 24
inches, with isolated areas of 30 inches possible over mountainous
terrain. Ongoing catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides
will continue today and into tonight.
 
Over southern Hispaniola, additional rainfall of 4 to 6 inches are
