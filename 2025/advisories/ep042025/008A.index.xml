Tropical Storm Dalila Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042025
900 AM CST Sat Jun 14 2025
 
Dalila continues to show signs of strengthening, with deep 
convection bursting over the low-level center, and curved banding 
features near the coast of southwestern Mexico. There is a fairly 
large range of satellite intensity estimates this morning from 45 to 
65 kt. Given the improving satellite presentation, the initial 
intensity is raised to 50 kt for this advisory. A scatterometer pass 
is scheduled over the system around 16Z, which may give a better 
estimate of surface winds. 
 
The storm is currently moving northwestward at an estimated 305/10 
kt. A mid-level ridge is building westward over northern Mexico, 
which should cause Dalila to gradually turn west-northwestward 
later today. As the system begins to weaken into a shallower vortex 
on Sunday, Dalila will turn more westward within the low-level wind 
flow. The latest NHC forecast is near the previous one, and lies 
near the latest simple and corrected consensus aids.
 
Dalila may be nearing peak intensity, with only about 6 to 12 h left 
within a favorable environment. Thus, the NHC forecast shows slight 
strengthening today, with a peak intensity of 55 kt. Along the 
forecast track, Dalila will move over much cooler SSTs tonight and 
begin to enter a drier, more stable airmass. This will lead to 
steady weakening, and eventually the system will struggle to produce 
convection. The NHC intensity forecast is near the previous one, 
however now shows the system becoming a remnant low in 48 h, 
although this could occur sooner. By day 4, models depict the 
remnant low dissipating into an open trough. 

KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Dalila will bring locally heavy 
rainfall to the Mexican states of Michoac√°n and Guerrero through 
Sunday morning. Scattered areas of flooding and mudslides are 
expected, especially in areas of steep terrain near the coast.
 
2. Dalila is expected to produce tropical-storm-force winds across
portions of the warning area today.
