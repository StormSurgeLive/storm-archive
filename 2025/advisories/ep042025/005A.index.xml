DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM CST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Dalila was 
located near latitude 15.1 North, longitude 102.8 West. Dalila is 
moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this

toward the west is forecast by Sunday. On the forecast track, the 
center of Dalila is forecast to move parallel to, but offshore of, 
the southwestern coast of Mexico.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Gradual strengthening is expected during the next day or so. 
Weakening should begin by Sunday.
 
Dalila is a large system. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward
up to 310 miles (500 km) from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Dalila can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header
WTPZ44 KNHC.

RAINFALL: Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected across 
portions of the Mexican states of Guerrero, Michoac√°n, and Colima 
through Sunday morning, with localized amounts up to 9 inches near 
the coast. This rainfall will lead to areas of flooding and 
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain near the coast.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Tropical Storm Dalila, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic available at

WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area and are possible within the watch area tonight and Saturday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Dalila will affect
portions of the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next few
days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.

Tropical Storm Dalila Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042025
300 PM CST Fri Jun 13 2025
 
Satellite images and recent ASCAT data show that Dalila is a large 
tropical storm with its 34-kt wind radii spread out over a broad 
area, especially east of the center. The ASCAT passes showed 
tropical-storm-force winds occurring very near the coast of southern 
Mexico, which are likely aided by the local terrain. The initial 
intensity of the storm remains 35 kt based on the aforementioned 
ASCAT data and a Dvorak estimate from TAFB. Dalila is the second 
earliest fourth named storm in the eastern Pacific basin since 
records began in 1949, behind 1956.
 
Dalila likely will strengthen during the next day or so while it 
remains over warm waters and in a low to moderate wind shear 
environment. However, rapid intensification is not expected given 
the large size of the storm's wind field and the lack of an inner 
core. The opportunity for strengthening should end by late Saturday 
when Dalila is expected to cross the 26 C SST isotherm. Thereafter, 
a combination of cool waters and stable air should cause rapid 
weakening, and Dalila is now forecast to become a post-tropical 
cyclone by late Sunday. The NHC intensity forecast is similar to the 
previous one and near the high end of the model guidance.
 
The storm is still moving north-northwestward at about 12 kt. A 
gradual turn to the northwest and then the west is expected over the 
next few days as Dalila moves on the south side of a building 
mid-level ridge. There is high confidence that the center of the 
system should stay off the coast of Mexico, but the northern extent 
of the tropical-storm-force winds are expected to brush the 
southwestern coast of Mexico tonight and Saturday. The NHC track 
forecast is a touch north of the previous one and near the middle of 
the guidance envelope.
 

KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Dalila could bring locally
heavy rainfall to the Mexican states of Guerrero, Michoac√°n, and
Colima through this weekend. Isolated flooding and mudslides,
especially in areas of steep terrain, are possible.
 
2. Dalila is expected to produce tropical-storm-force winds across 
portions of the warning area tonight and Saturday.
