At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Dalila was
located near latitude 18.0 North, longitude 107.2 West. Dalila is

gusts. Dalila has reached its peak intensity and will begin to 
weaken soon. Steady weakening is then forecast during the next 
couple of days, with the system becoming a post-tropical remnant 
low tonight or Monday.
  
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
