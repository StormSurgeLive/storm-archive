DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM MST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Dalila was 
located near latitude 18.1 North, longitude 107.4 West. Dalila is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). This general 
motion is expected during the next couple days, as Dalila moves 
farther away from the southwestern coast of Mexico.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Steady weakening is forecast during the next couple of 
days, with the system becoming a post-tropical remnant low tonight 
or Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Dalila can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header
WTPZ44 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are expected
across portions of the Mexican states of Michoacán and Guerrero
this morning, with localized storm totals up to 9 inches near the
coast. Any instances of flash flooding and mudslides should
decrease later today.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Dalila, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Gusty winds are possible along the coast of southwestern 
Mexico this morning.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Dalila will affect portions
of the coast of southwestern Mexico today. These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM MST.

Tropical Storm Dalila Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042025
200 AM MST Sun Jun 15 2025
 
Dalila is likely near its peak intensity, with little change in
organization evident since the previous advisory package. The latest
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were 65
knots and 55 knots, respectively. Objective estimates ranged from
45 to 57 knots, while an ASCAT pass earlier in the day showed
numerous 50 knot wind barbs. Based on a blend of these data, the
initial intensity for this advisory has been held at 55 knots.
 
Dalila is now heading toward the west-northwest, or 285/12 knots. A
turn toward the west is expected during the next day or so, as 
Dalila is steered by a mid-level ridge over northern Mexico and the 
southwest U.S. A westward to slightly south of due west motion is 
then forecast through dissipation as Dalila moves over much
cooler waters. The current forecast shows Dalila becoming a
post-tropical remnant low in a day or so, and dissipating by 
Tuesday. The latest track forecast is very close to that of the 
previous advisory, and is close to the track consensus aids.

Dalila should begin to weaken later today as some drier mid-level
air evident in water vapor imagery begins to impact the system.  
More steady weakening is then likely as the system moves
over much cooler water and into a progressively drier mid-level
environment. The latest intensity forecast is close to the previous
advisory and in good agreement with the intensity consensus
guidance.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Dalila will bring locally heavy 
rainfall to the Mexican states of Michoacán and Guerrero through 
this morning. Scattered areas of flooding and mudslides are 
expected, especially in areas of steep terrain near the coast.
 
2. Dalila is expected to produce tropical-storm-force winds across
portions of the warning area during the next few hours.  Winds 
will diminish today while the system moves farther offshore of the 
coast of southwestern Mexico.
