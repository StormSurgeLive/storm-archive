WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Dalila was 
located near latitude 18.2 North, longitude 107.8 West. Dalila is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A gradual 
turn towards the west will occur later today, with a continued 
westward motion the next couple of days
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Steady weakening is forecast the during the next 
few days, and the system is expected to become a remnant low 
tonight or Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are 
possible across portions of the Mexican states of Nayarit, Jalisco, 
Colima, and Michoac√°n today, with localized storm totals up to 9 
inches near the coast. Any instances of flash flooding and mudslides 
should decrease today.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Tropical Storm Dalila, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Dalila will affect portions 
of the coast of southwestern Mexico today. These swells are likely 
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Dalila Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042025
800 AM MST Sun Jun 15 2025
 
Dalila's satellite appearance has degraded since the previous 
advisory. Cloud tops have been warming, and what convection remains 
is displaced to the southwest. First-light visible imagery showed 
that the system has decoupled with the low-level center exposed due 
to moderate northeasterly wind shear. Given the current satellite 
presentation, subjective and objective intensity estimates have 
started to drop-off, and the initial intensity is lowered to 45 kt 
for this advisory.
 
Dalila is moving towards the west-northwest, at an estimated 295/8 
kt. As Dalila continues to weaken and becomes a shallower vortex, a 
turn towards the west is expected within the low-level wind flow. 
The current NHC track forecast is similar to the previous, near the 
consensus aids. 

The storm will continue to weaken today within a cooler SSTs and a 
drier, more stable environment. Dalila is already struggling to 
produce convection and should become a post-tropical cyclone later 
tonight. The latest intensity forecast shows steady weakening and 
the system dissipating in a couple of days.
