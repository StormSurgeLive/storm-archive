DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 PM CST (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Dalila
was located near latitude 14.5 North, longitude 101.8 West.  Dalila

is forecast to move parallel to, but offshore of, the southwestern 
coast of Mexico.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is expected during the 
next couple of days as the storm moves parallel to the coast
of southwestern Mexico.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 120 miles (195 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).

      <title>Tropical Depression Four-E Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>

Tropical Depression Four-E Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042025
900 AM CST Fri Jun 13 2025
 
Latest satellite imagery depicts that the disturbance south of 
Mexico has continued to become better organized this morning. 
First-light visible imagery shows that the system has developed a 
well-defined low-level center, and infrared imagery shows a large 
burst of organized deep convection with cold cloud tops near -80 C. 
Thus, the disturbance now meets the requirements to be classified a 
tropical cyclone. Subjective Dvorak satellite intensity estimates 
remain around 30 kt with a T2.0 from TAFB. Thus, the intensity is 
held at 30 kt, and the system is now Tropical Depression Four-E.
 
The initial motion remains uncertain given the recent formation of a 
well-defined low-level center, but it is estimated at 335/9 kt. A 
mid-level ridge is forecast to strengthen and build over Mexico 
later today, which will cause a more northwestward motion this 
afternoon and evening, followed by a west-northwestward motion later 
this weekend. The track guidance is tightly clustered, and the 
latest NHC track forecast is near the previous one, which lies near 
the simple consensus aids. Along the forecast track, the system 
will parallel the coast of southwestern Mexico, remaining offshore. 

As the depression continues to become better organized, steady 
strengthening is forecast over the next 36-48 h, with the system 
over warm sea surface temperatures. However, there is some moderate 
easterly vertical wind shear that the system will have to deal with. 
As the system took a little longer to consolidate, the latest NHC 
intensity forecast is slightly lower, with a peak intensity of 55 
kt, which lies near the simple consensus. However, some of the 
regional hurricane models continue to show a higher peak. Beyond 48 
h, the system will cross into a drier, more stable airmass and over
cooler SSTs which will lead to steady weakening. Global models show 
the system struggling to produce convection by 72 h, becoming a 
remnant low, and then dissipating by 120 h.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Depression Four-E may bring locally 
heavy rainfall to the Mexican states of Guerrero, Michoacán, and 
Colima through this weekend. Isolated flooding and mudslides, 
especially in areas of steep terrain, are possible.
 
2. The Tropical Depression is forecast to be at tropical storm 
strength when it moves near the southwestern coast of Mexico on 
Saturday. Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of 
that area.
