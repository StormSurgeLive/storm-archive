Post-Tropical Cyclone Ivo Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 11 2025
 
The last bit of convection associated with Ivo dissipated about 15 
hours ago, and it has therefore degenerated into a remnant low.  
Maximum winds are estimated to be 25 kt, and further weakening is 
forecast as the system moves over colder waters.  Ivo is expected 
to open up into a trough--and thus dissipate--in about 36 hours, as 
depicted in global model fields.  Until that time, a low-level 
ridge to the north is expected to steer the remnant low westward at 
about 10 kt, and no major changes were made to the official track 
forecast.
