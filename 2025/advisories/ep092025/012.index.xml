SUMMARY OF 800 AM MST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.0N 112.7W
ABOUT 220 MI...360 KM SW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 6 MPH...9 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ivo was
located near latitude 21.0 North, longitude 112.7 West.  Ivo is
moving toward the west-northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h).  A faster
motion toward the west-northwest and then west is expected during
the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast during the next few days, and Ivo is likely
to become post-tropical by late Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Ivo will continue to affect the southern
portion of the Baja California peninsula during the next day or so.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
800 AM MST Sat Aug 09 2025
 
Ivo is being affected by moderate northeasterly shear, with its
low-level center near the northern edge of the deep convection.
Dvorak CI numbers from TAFB and SAB are 3.5/55 kt and 3.0/45 kt,
respectively, while objective numbers from UW-CIMSS range from
35-55 kt.  Ivo's intensity is held at 50 kt, leaning toward the
blend of CI numbers.  The cyclone is expected to reach sub-26
degree Celsius waters in 12-24 hours, while at the same time the
environment becomes more stable and more convergent aloft.  As a
result, steady weakening is anticipated, and Ivo is forecast to
become post-tropical in about 36 hours when the environment becomes
too hostile to support organized deep convection.  The remnant low
will last for a few more days after that, likely opening up into a
trough by late Tuesday/early Wednesday.
 
Ivo's position was adjusted a bit north based on recent data, which
ended up shifting the entire forecast track in that direction as
well.  Still, the track models are tightly clustered and in good
agreement that Ivo will move generally west-northwestward and then
westward, steered by low- to mid-level ridging to the north.  The
NHC track forecast is relatively close to the HCCA and TVCE
consensus aids.
