BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Ivo Advisory Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 PM MST Sat Aug 09 2025
 
...IVO WEAKENING AND EXPECTED TO BECOME POST-TROPICAL BY LATE
SUNDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM MST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.0N 113.5W
ABOUT 265 MI...425 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 280 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1003 MB...29.62 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ivo was
located near latitude 21.0 North, longitude 113.5 West.  Ivo is
moving toward the west near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A westward to 
west-northwestward motion at a slightly faster forward speed is 
expected during the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast, and Ivo is 
expected to degenerate into a remnant low by late Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Ivo will continue to affect the southern
portion of the Baja California peninsula during the next day or so.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM MST.

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 PM MST Sat Aug 09 2025
 
Moderate northeasterly shear is displacing most of Ivo's convection 
south of the center, and the convective mass itself has begun to 
shrink.  The initial intensity is lowered to 45 kt based on a T3.0 
classification from TAFB, and this is also supported by a recent 
ASCAT pass which showed a maximum of 38 kt (but is likely limited 
by the instrument's resolution).  Continued moderate shear, 
gradually cooling sea surface temperatures, and a stable air mass 
ahead of Ivo are forecast to continue the weakening trend.  GFS- 
and ECMWF-based simulated satellite imagery show all deep convection 
dissipating by 36 hours, which is when Ivo is shown degenerating 
into a remnant low in the official forecast.  Dissipation is now 
expected by day 3, which is when the remnant low loses its 
integrity in the global model fields.

Ivo has been moving westward, or 280/6 kt.  Low- to mid-level 
ridging is expected to keep Ivo on a westward or west-northwestward 
track through dissipation.  There is low spread among the track 
models, and only minor adjustments were made to the new NHC 
forecast.
