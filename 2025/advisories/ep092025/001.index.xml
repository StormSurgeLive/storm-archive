Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 AM HST Wed Aug 06 2025
 
Henriette continues along with little change in its structure. Like 
6 h ago, it is producing a relatively small area of deep convection, 
with cold cloud tops present mostly to the north of its low-level 
center. Recent scatterometer data showed winds just above 40 kt, 
which supports maintaining the intensity at 45 kt for this 
advisory, after accounting for undersampling. The scatterometer data 
was also helpful with identifying the exact position of Henriette's 
center, which was slightly south of previous estimates.
 
No significant change was made to the NHC track forecast outside a 
slight southward adjustment based on the initial position estimate 
in the short term. Henriette is moving westward to 
west-northwestward to the south of a deep ridge centered over the 
northern east Pacific. In a few days, a trough approaching from the 
west will turn Henriette toward the northwest, taking the tropical 
cyclone north of Hawaii. The various deterministic and global 
ensemble models are all in good agreement on the forecast, so 
confidence in the track forecast is fairly high.
 
The tropical storm is still forecast to slowly weaken during the 
next few days while it moves over cool SSTs near 24C. However, once 
Henriette moves north of Hawaii, it will move over warmer waters. 
Upper-level difluent flow associated with a mid-latitude trough to 
the northwest may also provide additional support for 
intensification. As a result, most of the dynamical models forecast 
strengthening to occur near the end of the forecast period, and the 
NHC intensity forecast reflects this and is very similar to the 
previous advisory.

...TROPICAL STORM IVO FORMS SOUTH OF MEXICO...
...LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS AND ROUGH SURF WILL AFFECT COASTAL SECTIONS 
OF SOUTHWESTERN MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM CST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.2N 99.1W
ABOUT 195 MI...310 KM SSE OF ACAPULCO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 22 MPH...35 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1008 MB...29.77 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ivo was
located near latitude 14.2 North, longitude 99.1 West. Ivo is moving
toward the west-northwest near 22 mph (35 km/h). The tropical storm 
is forecast to move generally parallel, but offshore of the coast 
of Mexico during the couple of days, and then turn westward, moving 
further from land.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is anticipated for the next couple of days. Ivo is 
forecast to be near hurricane strength by the end of the week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Ivo is expected to produce storm total 
rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 6 inches, 
across portions of the Mexican states of Guerrero, Michoacan and 
southwestern Oaxaca through Saturday. This rainfall could lead to 
flash flooding. 

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Tropical Depression Nine-E, please see the National Weather Service 
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?rainqpf

SURF:  Swells generated by Ivo will be affecting the southwestern 
coast of Mexico during the next couple of days. These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  
Please consult products from your local weather office.

NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
300 PM CST Wed Aug 06 2025

One-minute GOES-E visible imagery, microwave imagery and 
scatterometer data from this morning indicate that the disturbance 
south of Mexico has become much better organized. The system has 
developed banding features, and the most recent TAFB Dvorak analysis 
shows a Final-T of 2.0. The ASCAT data showed peak winds between 
30-35 kt, so advisories have been initiated on Tropical Storm Ivo, 
with an initial intensity of 35 kt.

Ivo has a relatively small circulation, but it's embedded within a 
fairly large area of deep convection. SHIPS diagnostics indicate 
that wind shear could be a limiting factor for Ivo's intensity 
during the next couple of days, but the tropical storm is in an 
otherwise conducive environment for strengthening. The NHC forecast 
follows the multi-model consensus and shows Ivo reaching hurricane 
strength within the next couple of days, but there is about 30 kt of 
spread in the intensity guidance, both above and below the official 
forecast.

Ivo is moving fairly quickly toward the west-northwest near 19 kt. A 
deep-layer ridge centered over the southwestern U.S. should steer 
Ivo parallel to the coast of Mexico for the next couple of days. 
The ridge is forecast to weaken by the weekend, causing Ivo to move 
at a slower forward speed, but by then Ivo will reach cooler SSTs 
and a more stable environment. That should cause the cyclone to 
quickly weaken and turn westward, steered primarily by low-level 
flow. The NHC track forecast is near the center of the guidance 
envelope, very close to HCCA throughout the 5-day period.

The tropical-storm-force winds associated with Ivo are expected to 
remain offshore of the coast of Mexico, however heavy rain and 
rough surf are likely along portions of the southwest coast of 
Mexico during the next day or two.
