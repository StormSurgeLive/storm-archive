Tropical Storm Ivo Advisory Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 AM MST Sun Aug 10 2025
 
...IVO WEAKENING...
...LIKELY TO BECOME A REMNANT LOW IN A DAY OR SO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM MST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.5N 114.9W
ABOUT 335 MI...535 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 285 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1006 MB...29.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ivo was
located near latitude 21.5 North, longitude 114.9 West. Ivo is
moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A gradual
turn toward the west with a slight increase in forward speed is
expected through early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Continued weakening is anticipated, and Ivo is forecast to become a 
post-tropical remnant low during the next day or so.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Ivo will continue to affect the southern
portion of the Baja California peninsula during the next day or so.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM MST.

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 AM MST Sun Aug 10 2025

Ivo is weakening while it passes over the cooler waters well to the 
west of Baja California Sur, and its associated deep convection 
is gradually decreasing in coverage and intensity.  Data from an 
excellent scatterometer overpass just before 0500 UTC showed that 
the maximum winds have decreased to near 35 kt.  Subjective Dvorak 
analyses from TAFB and SAB, along with objective Dvorak values from 
UW-CIMSS gave a similar intensity estimate, indicating that Ivo is 
now at minimal tropical storm strength.

Center fixes indicate that the cyclone continues to move 
west-northwestward, or at about 285/7 kt.  A low- to mid-level 
ridge is predicted to remain to the north of Ivo during the next 
couple of days.  The system is likely to turn more westward with a 
slight increase in forward speed in a day or so as the increasingly 
shallow circulation becomes steered by the low-level easterlies.  
The official forecast track is very similar to the one from the 
previous advisory.

Ivo is moving over cooler waters with gradually decreasing 
environmental moisture.  Therefore weakening should continue, and 
the system will likely degenerate into a post-tropical remnant low 
in 24 hours or so.  The intensity forecast is similar to the 
previous NHC forecast and near the high end of the model guidance.
