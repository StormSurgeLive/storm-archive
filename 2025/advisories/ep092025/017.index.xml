Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 PM PDT Sun Aug 10 2025
 
Even over waters of 23-24 degrees Celsius, Ivo is managing to 
maintain a persistent area of deep convection.  A recent ASCAT pass 
showed maximum winds of 30 kt.  Accounting for the instrument's 
sampling limitations, and combined with satellite estimates still 
running around 35 kt, it is estimated that Ivo is hanging on to 
tropical storm status.  Sea surface temperatures drop by another 2-3 
degrees along Ivo's forecast track, so weakening is expected to 
resume tonight, and simulated satellite images from the GFS and 
ECMWF show that deep convection could finally be gone by Monday 
morning.  Degeneration into a remnant low is forecast by 24 hours, 
followed by dissipation into a trough in 60 hours.
 
Ivo is moving west-northwestward (285 deg) at 10 kt.  This motion 
should continue for the next 12 hours, followed by a slight bend to 
the west in 24 hours as Ivo stays situated to the south of the low- 
to mid-level ridge.  The track models are tightly clustered, and 
the new NHC forecast is mainly an update of the previous 
prediction.
