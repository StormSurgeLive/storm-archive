Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
500 AM HST Thu Aug 07 2025
 
Henriette continues to hang in there despite straddling 25 C 
sea-surface temperatures. Since the prior advisory, a little more 
convection has redeveloped close to the estimated center, though 
overall the appearance of the tropical storm is still rather ragged 
looking. The current intensity estimate from TAFB has not changed 
for 12 UTC at 45 kt. In deference to this value and earlier 
scatterometer data, the initial intensity is being maintained at 45 
kt this advisory. 

The tropical storm continues to move westward, or 280 degrees at 14 
kt. This general motion will continue through today, followed by a 
turn west-northwestward and then more northwestward due to the 
influence of a subtropical ridge to its north that will become 
gradually eroded by a large mid-oceanic trough amplifying over the 
North-Central Pacific in 2-3 days. The track guidance is essentially 
a carbon copy of the previous cycle, and only slight changes were 
made to the official track forecast. This forecast lies near the 
various multi-model consensus aids. 

Henriette is already moving over cool ocean waters, which are 
expected to cool to 24C over the next 12-24 hours. While it would 
not be surprising to see a little more weakening over the short 
term, the storm has proven to be resilient thus far. Another 
environmental factor to consider is the upper-level temperatures, 
which are colder than normal due to a negatively tilted upper-level 
trough to the storm's west. This trough might help to sustain some 
convection over what would ordinarily be waters too cool to allow 
such activity to persist. Once Henriette begins to move over warmer 
ocean waters again in the Central Pacific west of 150W, the other 
environmental factors are expected to remain favorable, and 
intensification is shown in the latter half of the forecast period. 
In fact, Henriette could become a hurricane in 96-120 h well to the 
north of Hawaii. The latest NHC intensity forecast is a little 
higher than the prior advisory, though there remain some guidance 
aids that are even higher than the NHC forecast at the end of the 
period (HAFS-B).

BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Ivo Advisory Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
900 AM CST Thu Aug 07 2025
 
...TINY IVO CONTINUES MOVING QUICKLY WEST-NORTHWESTWARD...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM CST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.8N 104.4W
ABOUT 305 MI...490 KM WNW OF ACAPULCO MEXICO
ABOUT 500 MI...805 KM SE OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 24 MPH...39 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1006 MB...29.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
Interests along the coast of southwestern Mexico should continue to
monitor the progress of Ivo.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM CST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ivo was 
located near latitude 17.8 North, longitude 104.4 West. Ivo is 
moving quickly toward the west-northwest near 24 mph (39 km/h). The 
system is forecast to move generally parallel to, but offshore of, 
the coast of Mexico during the next day or so and turn westward away 
from Mexico thereafter.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with
higher gusts. Strengthening is forecast, and Ivo is expected to be
near hurricane strength by the end of the week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Ivo is expected to produce storm total
rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 6 inches,
across portions of the Mexican states of Guerrero, Michoacan de
Ocampo and Colima through Friday. This would result in an elevated
risk for flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Ivo please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ivo will be affecting the southwestern
coast of Mexico during the next couple of days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found

NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM CST.

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
900 AM CST Thu Aug 07 2025
 
Finding the exact center of Ivo is tricky this morning, but my best 
guess is that its track has deviated rightward since the prior 
advisory. A pair of helpful microwave passes, an AMSR2 pass at 0850 
UTC and a SSMIS pass at 1050 UTC, showed well-defined curved banding 
on the 37-GHz to 91-GHz channels respectively. More recently, a 
visible satellite animation of 1-min GOES-19 imagery shows bursting 
convection near the estimated center. Subjective Dvorak estimates by 
TAFB and SAB were T3.0/45 kt and T2.5/35 kt respectively, with the 
objective intensity estimates ranging from 34 to 51 kt. Thus, the 
initial intensity has been bumped up to 40 kt this morning.
 
Ivo appears to be maintaining a brisk west-northwestward motion, 
estimated at 300/21 kt. This rapid forward motion is thanks in part 
to a strong and large mid-level ridge stretching across northern 
Mexico and southwestern United States. This ridge is forecast to 
move along with Ivo though it does gradually dampen out in 
magnitude. The net result of this pattern should keep Ivo on a 
general west-northwestward heading, with the cyclone turning more 
westward and slowing down towards the latter half of the forecast. 
The track guidance this cycle is a little farther north, largely a 
reflection of the farther north initial position. The latest NHC 
track forecast is also farther north roughly blending the simple and 
corrected consensus aids (TVCE and HCCA), but still remains offshore 
of Mexico, making its point of closest approach in the next 12-18 
hours.
 
The small core of Ivo likely could make it susceptible to rapid
changes in intensity, either up or down. Because vertical wind
shear is relatively low (10-15 kt), and sea surface temperatures
remain above 27 C for the next 36 hours, the NHC intensity forecast
continues to show significant intensification, making Ivo a
hurricane. Thereafter, the storm will reach a sharp sea-surface
temperature gradient, and should begin a gradual weakening trend.
Towards the end of the forecast Ivo will likely lose its remaining
deep convection over the sub 24 C waters west of Baja California,
marking its transition to a post-tropical remnant low by 96 h. The
NHC intensity forecast remains a bit on the high end of the overall
model suite.
 
Given the small radius of tropical-storm-force winds associated with 
Ivo, these winds are expected to remain offshore as it makes its 
closest approach to Mexico later today. However, heavy rain and 
rough surf are likely to occur along portions of the southwest coast 
of Mexico during the next day or so.  Outer bands of Ivo are 
expected to produce locally heavy rainfall in portions of the 
Mexican states of Guerrero, Michoacan de Ocampo and Colima through 
Friday where Flash flooding is possible.
