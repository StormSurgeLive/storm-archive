      <title>Tropical Storm Henriette Forecast Discussion Number 17</title>

Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 PM HST Thu Aug 07 2025
 
Henrietteâ€™s satellite presentation remains unimpressive this 
evening, having lost nearly all deep convection and with the 
low-level center fully exposed.  The latest subjective Dvorak 
current intensity estimate from TAFB was T2.5/35 kt, while 
objective estimates from UW-CIMSS have ranged from 26 to 34 kt over 
the past several hours. A timely 08/0534z Metop-B Ascat pass 
depicted quite a few 30 to 33 kt wind barbs and this was the basis 
for holding the initial intensity steady at 35 kt for this advisory.
 
Henriette is moving westward, or 280 degrees at 15 kt. A turn toward 
the west-northwest is expected soon, with this general motion 
expected to persist over the next couple of days as the cyclone 
tracks along the southwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge to 
its northeast. A turn toward the northwest is forecast this weekend 
and into early next week as Henriette becomes steered between an 
amplifying longwave trough northwest of Hawaii and the subtropical 
ridge to its northeast. The official track forecast remains in close 
agreement with the latest multi-model consensus aids and is very 
close to the previous advisory.  Confidence remains high that 
Henriette will remain far to the north of Hawaii.
 
Henriette will traverse sea surface temperatures near 24C with 
mid-level relative humidity below 50 percent during the next 24 
hours or so. Despite these unfavorable thermodynamic conditions, the 
cycloneâ€™s well-defined circulation is expected to remain fairly 
resilient within the prevailing low-shear environment, allowing for 
occasional pulses of deep convection to continue.  As a result, 
little change in intensity is anticipated during the next day or so. 
If Henriette can withstand the next 24 hours over cooler waters, as 
continues to be indicated by the GFS and ECMWF models again with the 
00Z cycle, re-intensification will likely occur over the weekend and 
into early next week as sea surface temperatures steadily rise to 
levels conducive for strengthening.  The official forecast continues 
to reflect intensification, bringing Henriette to hurricane strength 
by 72 hours.  The cyclone will begin to experience increasing 
vertical wind shear as it moves toward the higher latitudes, which 
should result in rather rapid weakening beginning between 96 and 120 
hours.  The intensity forecast is on the higher end of the guidance 
envelope, and is most closely aligned with the CTCI and HMNI 
intensity aids, but below the peak depicted by the HAFS models.

Future information on Henriette can be found under Central Pacific 
basin headers beginning at 500 AM HST.  Future Tropical Cyclone 
Discussions will be issued under AWIPS header HFOTCDCP3 and WMO 
header WTPA43 PHFO.  Products will continue to be available on the 
web at hurricanes.gov.

BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Ivo Advisory Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 AM MST Fri Aug 08 2025
 
...IVO MOVING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD AWAY FROM MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM MST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.4N 109.0W
ABOUT 180 MI...295 KM SSE OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 21 MPH...33 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
Interests along the coast of southwestern Mexico and the southern
portion of the Baja California peninsula should continue to monitor
the progress of Ivo.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ivo was 
located near latitude 20.4 North, longitude 109.0 West. Ivo is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 21 mph (33 km/h).  A decrease 
in forward speed and a turn to the west are expected on Saturday, 
and this motion should continue through the weekend. On the forecast 
track, Ivo is expected to pass well south of the Baja California 
peninsula.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Strengthening is forecast for the next day or so, and Ivo could 
become a hurricane later today or tonight. Weakening should begin 
over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Ivo will continue to affect the 
southwestern coast of Mexico during the next day or so, and are 
forecast to reach the southern portion of the Baja California 
peninsula later today. These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found

NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM MST.

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 AM MST Fri Aug 08 2025
 
Ivo seems to be responding to the conducive environmental 
conditions.  Convection has been building within the core of the 
storm and geostationary satellite imagery has depicted a growing 
CDO overnight.  The small storm has managed to elude recent 
scatterometer and microwave overpasses and no new information has 
been collected with respect to the low-level structure. The initial 
intensity is held at 50 kt for this cycle based on persistence, 
which is slightly above the latest TAFB Dvorak estimate of T3.5/45 
kt.
 
Ivo is moving quickly along the southern periphery of a mid-level 
ridge at 295/18 kt.  The ridge is expected to continue turning the 
storm toward the west during the next couple of days with a 
significant decrease in forward motion.  Ivo is forecast to stay 
well south of the Baja California peninsula.  The latest official 
track forecast lies slightly to the south of the previous prediction 
beyond the 24 h forecast time.

Atmospheric and oceanic conditions are conducive for strengthening 
during the next day or so.  The NHC intensity forecast still brings 
Ivo up to hurricane strength within a day, however this peak lies 
above all the latest model guidance.  It should be noted that this 
portion of the forecast has higher-than-average uncertainty due to 
the high spread in the model guidance.  Beyond 24 hours, the model 
and official forecasts come into better agreement when Ivo moves 
over cooling sea surface temperatures and into a dry and stable 
environment with moderate vertical wind shear.  The system is still 
expected to become a remnant low within a few day and open into a 
trough by the end of the forecast period.
