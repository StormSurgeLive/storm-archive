DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM EST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nicole was
located near latitude 27.8 North, longitude 72.7 West. Nicole is
moving toward the west near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A west to 
west-southwest motion should continue through Wednesday.  A 
west-northwest motion is forecast to begin on Wednesday night, 
followed by a turn toward the northwest and north-northwest 
on Thursday and Thursday night.  On the forecast track, 
the center of Nicole will approach the northwestern Bahamas today 
and tonight, move near or over those islands on Wednesday, and 
approach the east coast of Florida within the hurricane 
warning area Wednesday night.  Nicole's center is then expected to 
move across central and northern Florida into southern Georgia 
Thursday and Thursday night.

Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
strengthening is expected during the next 36 to 48 hours, and 
Nicole is forecast to be near or at hurricane strength by Wednesday 
and Wednesday night while it is moving near the northwestern 
Bahamas and approaching the east coast of Florida.

Nicole is a large tropical cyclone.  Tropical-storm-force winds 
extend outward up to 380 miles (610 km) from the center.

The minimum central pressure estimated from NOAA reconnaissance 
aircraft data is 994 mb (29.36 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nicole can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the web at www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the northwestern Bahamas
within the hurricane warning area on Wednesday, with tropical storm
conditions beginning across all of the northwestern Bahamas by
tonight.  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area along the east coast of Florida Wednesday night
with tropical storm conditions expected by tonight or early
Wednesday within the tropical storm and hurricane warning areas.
Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area
on Wednesday night and Thursday. Tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area along the west coast of Florida by
Wednesday night.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

* North Palm Beach to Altamaha Sound including the St. Johns
River to the Fuller Warren Bridge...3 to 5 ft
* Altamaha Sound to the Savannah River...2 to 4 ft
* St. Johns River south of the Fuller Warren Bridge to
Georgetown...2 to 4 ft
* Hallandale Beach to North Palm Beach...2 to 4 ft
* Anclote River to the Suwannee River...2 to 4 ft
* Middle of Long Boat Key to Anclote River including Tampa Bay...1
to 3 ft
* North of Ocean Reef to Hallandale Beach including Biscayne Bay...1
to 2 ft

Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast of the northwestern
Bahamas in areas of onshore winds.

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to
your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.

RAINFALL: Nicole is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts through Friday:

Northwest Bahamas into the eastern, central and northern portions of
the Florida Peninsula: 3 to 5 inches with local maxima of 7 inches

Southeast Georgia into portions of South Carolina: 1 to 4 inches.

Flash and urban flooding will be likely, along with possible renewed
river rises on the St. Johns River, across the Florida Peninsula on
Wednesday and Thursday. Heavy rainfall from this system will spread
north farther up the Eastern Seaboard late Thursday into Friday.

SURF:  Large swells generated by Nicole will affect the northwestern
Bahamas, the east coast of Florida, and much of the southeastern
United States coast during the next several days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
