preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
A Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening
inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline, in

meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM EST (0600 UTC), the center of Subtropical Storm Nicole was
located by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near 
latitude 27.3 North, longitude 71.2 West.  Nicole is moving toward 
the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A turn toward the west or 
west-southwest is forecast to begin today, and that motion should 
continue through early Thursday.  On the forecast track, the center 
of Nicole will approach the northwestern Bahamas today and tonight, 
move near or over those islands on Wednesday, and approach the east 
coast of Florida Wednesday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some strengthening is expected today and on Wednesday.  Nicole is 
forecast to be at or near hurricane intensity by Wednesday or 
Wednesday night while it is moving near or over the northwestern
Bahamas.
 
Winds of 40 mph extend outward up to 310 miles (500 km) from the
center.
 
Data from NOAA buoy 41047 indicate that the minimum central pressure 
is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nicole can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the web at www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the northwest Bahamas
within the hurricane warning area by early Wednesday, with tropical
storm conditions expected elsewhere in the northwest Bahamas by
tonight.  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch
area in Florida by Wednesday night with tropical storm conditions
possible by tonight or early Wednesday.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
* North Palm Beach to Altamaha Sound including the St. Johns
River to the Fuller Warren Bridge...3 to 5 ft
* St. Johns River south of the Fuller Warren Bridge to
Georgetown...2 to 4 ft
* Hallandale Beach to North Palm Beach...2 to 4 ft
* North of Ocean Reef to Hallandale Beach including Biscayne Bay...1
to 2 ft
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet above 
normal tide levels along the immediate coast of the northwestern 
Bahamas in areas of onshore winds.
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding 
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and 
can vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to 
your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather 
Service forecast office.
 
RAINFALL: Nicole is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts through Thursday:
 
Northwest Bahamas, central and northern portions of the Florida
Peninsula: 3 to 5 inches with local maxima of 7 inches.
 
Southeast Florida and Southeast Georgia: 1 to 3 inches with local
maxima of 5 inches.
 
Heavy rainfall from this system will spread north farther up the
Eastern Seaboard late this week into this weekend.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Nicole will affect the northwest
Bahamas, the east coast of Florida, and much of the southeastern
United States coast during the next several days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Subtropical Storm Nicole Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172022
1000 PM EST Mon Nov 07 2022
 
Satellite images continue to show the signature of a subtropical
cyclone, with limited deep convective activity near the center and a
large band of convection extending well to the east and southeast.
A subtropical satellite classification from TAFB, along with
observations from NOAA data buoy 41047 indicate little change in
strength, and the current intensity estimate remains at 40 kt.  The
system remains very broad, with the strongest winds well removed
from the center.
 
Nicole is moving slowly northwestward, or about 310/7 kt, on the
northeastern side of a mid- to upper-level low, and this general
motion is likely to continue into Tuesday morning.  The system
should turn toward the west and west-southwest beginning tomorrow
as an eastward-moving high pressure area builds to its north, and
move over the Florida peninsula on Thursday.  Then, the cyclone is
likely to move around the western periphery of the ridge near
northern Florida and accelerate northeastward ahead of a large
mid-tropospheric trough moving into the east-central United States
around day 4.  Nicole should continue to accelerate northeastward
near the northeastern United States coast around the end of the
forecast period.  The official track forecast is very close to the
simple dynamical model consensus, TVCA, and is also similar to the
previous NHC track.
 
There is more than the usual amount of uncertainty in the intensity
forecast.  Nicole's sprawling structure and nearby dry
mid-level air suggest that it will take some time for the cyclone to
begin strengthening.  It is expected, however, that the system will
at least begin to acquire an inner core structure within 24 hours
and be near or at hurricane intensity by the time it reaches the
northwest Bahamas and the Florida peninsula.  The official
intensity forecast remains close to the HFIP corrected consensus
guidance and is a little above the GFS and ECMWF global model
wind speed predictions.  Regardless of Nicole's exact intensity,
the storm's large size due to an enhanced pressure gradient north of
the cyclone will likely cause significant wind, storm surge, and
rainfall impacts over a large portion of the northwestern Bahamas,
Florida, and the southeastern coast of the United States during the
next few days.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane conditions and a dangerous storm surge are expected in
portions of the northwestern Bahamas beginning Tuesday night, where
a Hurricane Warning is in effect.
 
2.  Hurricane conditions are possible across portions of the coast
of southeast and east-central Florida beginning late Wednesday,
where a Hurricane Watch is in effect.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected in the Tropical Storm Warning areas in Florida and Georgia
beginning early Wednesday.
 
3. A dangerous storm surge is expected  along much of the east coast
of Florida and portions of coastal Georgia where a storm surge
warning is now in effect. The storm surge will be accompanied by
large and damaging waves.  Residents in the warning area should
listen to advice given by local officials.
 
4. Do not focus on the exact track of Nicole since it is expected to
be a large storm with hazards extending well to the north of the
center, outside of the forecast cone. These hazards are likely to
affect much of the Florida peninsula and portions of the southeast
U.S.
 
5. Nicole will produce heavy rainfall by Wednesday night and
Thursday across the Florida Peninsula. Flash and urban flooding will
be possible along with river rises on portions of the St. Johns
River.
