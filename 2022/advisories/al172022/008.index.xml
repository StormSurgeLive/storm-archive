DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM EST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nicole was
located near latitude 27.1 North, longitude 74.8 West.  Nicole is
moving toward the west-southwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A
west-southwestward to westward motion is expected through early 
Wednesday.  A west-northwestward motion is forecast to begin later 
on Wednesday, followed by a turn toward the northwest and north on 
Thursday and Thursday night.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Nicole will approach the northwestern Bahamas overnight, move near 
or over those islands on Wednesday, and approach the east coast of 
Florida within the hurricane warning area Wednesday night or early 
Thursday.  Nicole's center is then expected to move across central 
and northern Florida into southern Georgia Thursday and Thursday 
night.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Some strengthening is expected during the next 
day or so, and Nicole is forecast to become a hurricane later 
tonight and remain a hurricane when it reaches the east coast of 
Florida.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 380 miles (610 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from NOAA and Air Force 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft observations is 984 mb (29.06 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nicole can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the web at www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the northwestern Bahamas
within the hurricane warning area on Wednesday, with tropical storm
conditions beginning across all of the northwestern Bahamas tonight.
Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane warning area
along the east coast of Florida Wednesday night or Thursday morning
with tropical storm conditions expected by tonight or early
Wednesday within the tropical storm and hurricane warning areas.
Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area
on Wednesday night and Thursday. Tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area along the west coast of Florida by
Wednesday night.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
* North Palm Beach Florida to Altamaha Sound Georgia including the
St. Johns River to the Fuller Warren Bridge...3 to 5 ft
* Altamaha Sound Georgia to the South Santee River South
Carolina...2 to 4 ft
* St. Johns River south of the Fuller Warren Bridge to Georgetown
Florida...2 to 4 ft
* Hallandale Beach to North Palm Beach...2 to 4 ft
* Anclote River to Indian Pass...2 to 4 ft
* Englewood to Anclote River including Tampa Bay...1 to 3 ft
* North of Ocean Reef to Hallandale Beach including Biscayne Bay...1
to 2 ft
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast of the northwestern
Bahamas in areas of onshore winds.
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to
your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
RAINFALL: Nicole is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts through Friday:
 
Northwest Bahamas into the eastern, central and northern portions
of the Florida Peninsula: 3 to 5 inches with local maxima of 8
inches.
 
Southeast into the southern and central Appalachians, western
Mid Atlantic, and eastern portions of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Ohio:
2 to 4 inches with local maxima of 6 inches along the Blue Ridge.
 
Flash and urban flooding will be likely, along with possible renewed
river rises on the St. Johns River, across the Florida Peninsula on
Wednesday and Thursday. Heavy rainfall from this system will spread
north farther up the Eastern Seaboard late Thursday into Friday.
 
TORNADOES: Isolated tornadoes will be possible from eastern Florida
into parts of eastern Georgia and eastern South Carolina beginning
late Wednesday night and continuing through Friday.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Nicole will affect the northwestern
Bahamas, the east coast of Florida, and much of the southeastern
United States coast during the next several days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Nicole Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Tropical Storm Nicole Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172022
1000 PM EST Tue Nov 08 2022
 
Nicole's satellite appearance has changed little since this
afternoon.  Deep convection is not very strong near the center of
the cyclone at this time, and there appears to be some dry air
intrusions into the circulation as evidenced by water vapor 
imagery.  Nonetheless, wind and central pressure observations from 
NOAA and Air Force Hurricane aircraft indicate that the system is 
very close to hurricane strength and the current advisory intensity 
is set to 60 kt.
 
Center fixes indicate that the cyclone is moving
west-southwestward, or about 250/9 kt  The track forecast
philosophy is basically the same as in the previous advisory
package.  Nicole should move west-southwestward to westward, on the
south side of an eastward-moving high pressure area, for the next 24
hours.  Thereafter, the system should turn northwestward and then
northward along the western side of the high.  In 3-5 days, Nicole
is likely to accelerate northeastward over the eastern United
States, to the east of a large mid-level trough.  The track model
guidance has not changed significantly, nor has the official
forecast.  This is near the southern edge of the guidance suite for
the next 1-2 days, and roughly in the middle of the guidance
thereafter.
 
Nicole will be moving over fairly warm SSTs of 27-28 degrees
Celsius during the next day or so.  However, the SHIPS guidance
indicates that the vertical shear will be 25 kt or higher, with
low-to mid-tropospheric humidities on the order of 50 percent,
during the next 24 hours.  Nicole is likely to become a hurricane
soon but, given the marginal dynamic and thermodynamic environment, 
significant strengthening seems unlikely.  The official intensity 
forecast is near or above the available model guidance, and closely 
follows the decay-SHIPS model after landfall.  Weakening is expected 
after Nicole moves inland over Florida and Georgia and while it
accelerates northeastward over the southeastern United States.  The
cyclone should complete extratropical transition by 72 hours and
merge with another extratropical low near Atlantic Canada in 120
hours.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane conditions and a dangerous storm surge are expected in
portions of the northwestern Bahamas on Wednesday, where a Hurricane
Warning is in effect.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are expected across portions of the coast
of southeast and east-central Florida beginning late Wednesday or
Wednesday night, where a Hurricane Warning is in effect.  Tropical
storm conditions are expected in the Tropical Storm Warning
areas in Florida and Georgia beginning early Wednesday.
 
3. A dangerous storm surge is expected along much of the east coast
of Florida and portions of coastal Georgia where a Storm Surge
Warning is in effect.  The storm surge will be accompanied by large
and damaging waves.  Residents in the warning area should listen to
advice given by local officials.
 
4. Do not focus on the exact track of Nicole since it is expected to
be a large storm with hazards extending well to the north of the
center, outside of the forecast cone.  These hazards are likely to
affect much of the Florida peninsula and portions of the southeast
United States.
 
5. Nicole will produce heavy rainfall Wednesday and Thursday across
the Florida Peninsula.  Flash and urban flooding will be likely
across portions of the Florida Peninsula along with possible renewed
river rises on the St. Johns River.  On Friday and Saturday, flash,
urban and small stream flooding will be possible in the Southeast
through the Mid-Atlantic and central Appalachians.
