<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Subtropical <br/>
Storm Nicole, located over the southwestern Atlantic. <br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic:<br/>
A well-defined area of low pressure located about 650 miles east of <br/>
Bermuda continues to produce gale-force winds, but the associated <br/>
shower and thunderstorm activity remains displaced to the east of <br/>
the low's center due to strong upper-level winds. These conditions <br/>
are expected to remain unfavorable for development through tonight, <br/>
but upper-level winds could briefly become more favorable on <br/>
Tuesday, and a short-lived tropical storm could still form as the <br/>
system begins to move northward and then northeastward at about 10 <br/>
mph. The low is then forecast to merge with a cold front by the <br/>
middle part of this week, ending the chances of tropical <br/>
development. Additional information on this system, including gale <br/>
warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National <br/>
Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM EST (2100 UTC), the center of Subtropical Storm Nicole was 
located near latitude 26.6 North, longitude 70.6 West. The storm is 
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A slower 
northwestward motion is expected tonight. A turn toward the west or 
west-southwest is forecast to begin by Tuesday night and that motion 
should continue through early Thursday. On the forecast track, the 
center of Nicole will approach the northwestern Bahamas on Tuesday 
and Tuesday night, move near or over those islands on Wednesday, and 
approach the east coast of Florida Wednesday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some slight strengthening is forecast tonight or Tuesday, with a 
faster rate of strengthening expected Tuesday night and Wednesday.  
Nicole is forecast to be at or near hurricane intensity by 
Wednesday or Wednesday night while it is moving near or over the 
northwestern Bahamas.
 
Winds of 40 mph extend outward up to 310 miles (500 km) from the
center.
 
The latest minimum central pressure estimated from data from an Air 
Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nicole can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the web at www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the northwest Bahamas
within the hurricane warning area by early Wednesday, with tropical
storm conditions expected elsewhere in the northwest Bahamas by
Tuesday night.  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch
area in Florida by Wednesday night with tropical storm conditions
possible by Tuesday night or early Wednesday.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
*North Palm Beach to Altamaha Sound including the St. Johns
River to the Fuller Warren Bridge...3 to 5 ft
* St. Johns River south of the Fuller Warren Bridge to East
Palatka...2 to 4 ft
*Hallandale Beach to North Palm Beach...2 to 4 ft
*North of Ocean Reef to Hallandale Beach including Biscayne Bay...1
to 2 ft
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet
above normal tide levels along the immediate coast of the
northwestern Bahamas in areas of onshore winds.
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related
flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal
cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
RAINFALL:  Nicole is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts through Thursday:
 
Across the northwest Bahamas, and the central and northern portions
of the Florida Peninsula: 2 to 4 inches, with local maxima of 6
inches.
 
Across coastal areas of southeast Florida: 1 to 3 inches, with local
maxima of 5 inches.
 
Heavy rainfall from this system will spread north across the
Southeast late this week.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Nicole will affect the northwest
Bahamas, east coast of Florida, and much of the coast of the
southeastern United States during the next several days.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

Subtropical Storm Nicole Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172022
400 PM EST Mon Nov 07 2022
 
Nicole's structure has changed little today. There is some limited
convective activity near the center with a large band of showers and
thunderstorms extending well north and east over the southwestern
Atlantic.  An Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft that has
been investigating the system this afternoon and has found
flight-level and SFMR winds supporting tropical storm strength about
80 n mi northwest of the center, but earlier scatterometer data
indicated that the strongest winds are likely occurring in the band
well removed from the center.  The aircraft reported that the
pressure is down to around 1000 mb.  The initial intensity is
maintained at 40 kt and is based on a blend of the aircraft and
earlier satellite wind data.
 
Nicole is moving northwestward or 310/8 kt.  A northwestward
motion is expected to continue overnight as the storm moves around
the northeastern portion of a decaying upper-level low. On Tuesday,
Nicole is forecast to turn westward or west-southwestward as a
strong mid-level ridge amplifies over the eastern United States.
This motion should bring the center of Nicole near or over the
northwestern Bahamas on Wednesday.  After that time, the ridge is
forecast to shift eastward, which should allow Nicole to turn
west-northwestward or northwestward as it approaches and then moves
over the Florida Peninsula. Later in the period, a large
mid-latitude trough moving into the central United States is
expected to cause Nicole to recurve northeastward. The track
guidance is in good agreement during the first few days of the
forecast period, and the confidence in this portion of the track
forecast is relatively high.  The new NHC track foreast is similar
to the previous advisory through 72 hours, but shows a track
slightly farther inland along the southeast U.S. coast on day 4.
There is increasing along-track spread after 72 hours, with the
GFS and UKMET slower than the latest ECMWF. The NHC forecast is
near the multi-model consensus aids at those times.
 
Nicole's sprawling structure and nearby dry mid-level air suggest
that it will take some time for the cyclone to begin strengthening.
Warm ocean temperatures that Nicole will be traversing should
allow for a gradual increase in convection near the center, and
this combined with low vertical wind shear, is expected to result in
gradual moistening of the environment around Nicole.  Most of the
dynamical models indicate that Nicole will be able to develop a
smaller inner core and transition into a tropical cyclone in 24
to 36 hours, and once that occurs, a faster rate of intensification
is anticipated. The latest NHC intensity prediction is similar to
the previous advisory and calls for the system to be at or near
hurricane strength when it passes near or over the northwest
Bahamas and reaches the east coast of Florida. The official wind
speed forecast is closest to the HFIP corrected consensus, and
near the most recent dynamical hurricane models.  Regardless of
Nicole's exact intensity, the storm's large size due to an enhanced
pressure gradient north of the storm will likely cause significant
wind, storm surge, and rainfall impacts over a large portion of the
northwestern Bahamas, Florida, and the southeastern coast of the
United States during the next few days.
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Hurricane conditions and a dangerous storm surge are expected in
portions of the northwestern Bahamas beginning Tuesday night, where
a Hurricane Warning has been issued.
 
2.  Hurricane conditions are possible across portions of the coast
of southeast and east-central Florida beginning late Wednesday,
where a Hurricane Watch is in effect.  Tropical storm conditions
are possible in the Tropical Storm Watch areas in Florida and
Georgia beginning by early Wednesday.
 
3. A dangerous storm surge is possible across much of the east coast
of Florida and portions of coastal Georgia.  The storm surge will be
accompanied by large and damaging waves.
 
4. Do not focus on the exact track of Nicole since it is expected to
be a large storm with hazards extending well to the north of the
center, outside of the forecast cone. These hazards are likely to
affect much of the Florida peninsula and portions of the southeast
U.S.
 
5. Nicole will produce heavy rainfall by Wednesday night and
Thursday across the Florida Peninsula. Flash and urban flooding will
be possible along with river rises on portions of the St. Johns
River.
