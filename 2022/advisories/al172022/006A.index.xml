DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM EST (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nicole was
located near latitude 27.6 North, longitude 73.3 West. Nicole is
moving toward the west near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A west-southwest 
motion is expected through early Wednesday.  A west-northwest 
motion is forecast to begin on Wednesday night, followed by a turn 
toward the northwest and north-northwest on Thursday and Thursday 
night.  On the forecast track, the center of Nicole will approach 
the northwestern Bahamas today and tonight, move near or over those 
islands on Wednesday, and approach the east coast of Florida within 
the hurricane warning area Wednesday night. Nicole's center is then 
expected to move across central and northern Florida into southern 
Georgia Thursday and Thursday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Strengthening is expected during the next day 
or so, and Nicole is forecast to a hurricane on Wednesday when it 
is near the northwestern Bahamas, and remain a hurricane when it 
approaches the east coast of Florida. 
 
Nicole is a large tropical cyclone.  Tropical-storm-force winds
extend outward up to 380 miles (610 km) from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.29 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nicole can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the web at www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the northwestern Bahamas
within the hurricane warning area on Wednesday, with tropical storm
conditions beginning across all of the northwestern Bahamas by
tonight.  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area along the east coast of Florida Wednesday night
with tropical storm conditions expected by tonight or early
Wednesday within the tropical storm and hurricane warning areas.
Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area
on Wednesday night and Thursday. Tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area along the west coast of Florida by
Wednesday night.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
* North Palm Beach to Altamaha Sound including the St. Johns
River to the Fuller Warren Bridge...3 to 5 ft
* Altamaha Sound to the Savannah River...2 to 4 ft
* St. Johns River south of the Fuller Warren Bridge to
Georgetown...2 to 4 ft
* Hallandale Beach to North Palm Beach...2 to 4 ft
* Anclote River to the Suwannee River...2 to 4 ft
* Middle of Long Boat Key to Anclote River including Tampa Bay...1
to 3 ft
* North of Ocean Reef to Hallandale Beach including Biscayne Bay...1
to 2 ft
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast of the northwestern
Bahamas in areas of onshore winds.
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to
your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
RAINFALL: Nicole is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts through Friday:
 
Northwest Bahamas into the eastern, central and northern portions of
the Florida Peninsula: 3 to 5 inches with local maxima of 7 inches
 
Southeast Georgia into portions of South Carolina: 1 to 4 inches.
 
Flash and urban flooding will be likely, along with possible renewed
river rises on the St. Johns River, across the Florida Peninsula on
Wednesday and Thursday. Heavy rainfall from this system will spread
north farther up the Eastern Seaboard late Thursday into Friday.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Nicole will affect the northwestern
Bahamas, the east coast of Florida, and much of the southeastern
United States coast during the next several days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Nicole Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Nicole Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172022
1000 AM EST Tue Nov 08 2022
 
Deep convection has developed and persisted near the center of
Nicole this morning and while there are still some characteristics
of a subtropical cyclone, the smaller radius of maximum winds and
improving inner-core convection suggest it has made the transition
to a tropical cyclone.  A NOAA reconnaissance aircraft has reported
that the pressure has fallen to around 992 mb, and has found 
700-mb flight-level winds of 54 kt and believable SFMR winds of 
40-42 kt. Based on those data, the initial intensity was raised to 
45 kt at 1200 UTC, and is kept there for this advisory.
 
The anticipated westward turn appears to have occurred, and the
initial motion estimate is 280/8 kt. A strong deep-layer ridge
over the southeastern United States is expected to steer the storm
westward to west-southwestward during the next 24 to 36 hours.
This motion will bring the center of Nicole near the northwest 
Bahamas on Wednesday.  After that time, the ridge is forecast to 
shift eastward allowing Nicole to turn west-northwestward to
northwestward, as it approaches the east coast of Florida.
By 72 hours, Nicole is forecast to recurve over the southeastern
United States ahead of a mid-latitude trough.  Although there is 
good agreement on this overall scenario, there is some increased 
spread in the track guidance on exactly when Nicole makes the 
west-northwestward turn near the east coast of Florida.  The 
typically reliable GFS and ECMWF models are along the southern side 
of the guidance envelope, while the regional hurricane models (HWRF 
and HMON) are on the northern side.  Since the storm is likely near 
the apex of its most northern point, it is worth noting the the 
model trackers are noticeable north of the raw model fields.  In 
fact, the GFS tracker is about 45-50 n mi north of its raw fields.  
The NHC track is very close to the previous forecast, which is 
along the southern side of dynamical model trackers and is closest 
to the GFS ensemble mean. Until the guidance stabilizes, it is 
prudent not to make any significant changes.
 
Nicole will be traversing relatively warm SSTs of 27-28 degrees 
Celsius and upper-level conditions that are expected to allow for 
steady strengthening during the approach to the northwestern
Bahamas and the east coast of Florida.  The NHC forecast calls for
Nicole to become a hurricane when it is near the northwest Bahamas
and remain a hurricane when it reaches Florida.  The NHC
intensity forecast is close to the various intensity consensus
aids.  Weakening is expected after Nicole moves inland over Florida
and while it accelerates northeastward over the southeastern United 
States.  Although the system could still produce 
tropical-storm-force winds over the adjacent offshore waters.  
Nicole should be extratropical by late Friday, and most of the 
global models show the circulation dissipating between days 4 and 5.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane conditions and a dangerous storm surge are expected in 
portions of the northwestern Bahamas on Wednesday, where a Hurricane 
Warning is in effect.

2.  Hurricane conditions are expected across portions of the coast 
of southeast and east-central Florida beginning late Wednesday or 
Wednesday night, where a Hurricane Warning has been issued.  
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Tropical Storm Warning 
areas in Florida and Georgia beginning early Wednesday.

3. A dangerous storm surge is expected along much of the east coast 
of Florida and portions of coastal Georgia where a Storm Surge 
Warning is in effect.  The storm surge will be accompanied by large 
and damaging waves.  Residents in the warning area should listen to 
advice given by local officials.

4. Do not focus on the exact track of Nicole since it is expected to 
be a large storm with hazards extending well to the north of the 
center, outside of the forecast cone. These hazards are likely to 
affect much of the Florida peninsula and portions of the southeast 
United States.

5. Nicole will produce heavy rainfall Wednesday and Thursday across 
the Florida Peninsula. Flash and urban flooding will be likely with 
possible river rises on the St. Johns River. Flash, urban and small 
stream flooding will be possible in Southeast Georgia and portions 
of South Carolina Thursday into Thursday night.
