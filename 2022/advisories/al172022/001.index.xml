Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
100 AM EST Mon Nov 7 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
Recent satellite-derived wind data and reports from a NOAA buoy <br/>
indicate that the center of a low pressure system located more than <br/>
300 miles northeast of the southeastern Bahamas is becoming better <br/>
defined, and the system is producing an area of gale-force winds <br/>
well to the east of its center.  In addition, the associated shower <br/>
and thunderstorm activity is beginning to show signs of <br/>
organization.  Environmental conditions appear conducive for <br/>
additional development, and a subtropical or tropical storm is <br/>
expected to form later today or tonight while moving slowly <br/>
northwestward over the southwestern Atlantic.  The system is then <br/>
forecast to turn westward and west-southwestward on Tuesday and <br/>
Wednesday, approaching and moving near the northwestern Bahamas and <br/>
the east coast of Florida, where additional development is possible.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of development, the risk continues to increase for a <br/>
prolonged period of coastal flooding, tropical-storm-force winds, <br/>
heavy rainfall, rough surf and rip currents, and beach erosion along <br/>
the southeastern United States coast, the Florida east coast, and <br/>
portions of the central and northwestern Bahamas during much of the <br/>
upcoming week.  Interests in those areas should continue to monitor <br/>
the progress of this system as tropical storm, hurricane, and storm <br/>
surge watches could be required for a portion of these areas later <br/>
today.  Additional information on this system, including gale <br/>
warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National <br/>
Weather Service and in products from your local weather office. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic:<br/>
A well-defined area of low pressure located about 650 miles east of <br/>
Bermuda continues to produce gale-force winds, but the associated <br/>
shower and thunderstorm activity is displaced to the east of the <br/>
low's center due to strong upper-level winds.  Upper-level winds are <br/>
expected to remain unfavorable for development while the system <br/>
moves northward and then northeastward at about 10 mph, but a <br/>
short-lived tropical storm could still form later today or on <br/>
Tuesday before the low dissipates and merges with a cold front.  <br/>
Additional information on this system, including gale warnings, can <br/>
be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather <br/>
Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Subtropical Storm Nicole was
located near latitude 25.5 North, longitude 68.5 West. Nicole is
moving toward the north-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A turn 
toward the northwest with a decrease in forward speed is expected 
later today.  A westward or west-southwestward motion is forecast 
Tuesday through early Thursday.  On the forecast track, the center 
of Nicole will approach the northwestern Bahamas on Tuesday, move 
near or over those islands on Wednesday, and approach the east 
coast of Florida by Wednesday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is forecast during the next few days, and 
Nicole could be near or at hurricane intensity by Wednesday or 
Wednesday night while it is moving near the northwestern Bahamas.
 
Winds of 40 mph or greater extend outward up to 275 miles (445 km) 
to the east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nicole can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC, 
and on the web at www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml. 

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible in the northwestern 
Bahamas by Tuesday night or early Wednesday.

STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3 
to 5 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast of 
the northwestern Bahamas in areas of onshore winds.
 
RAINFALL:  Nicole is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 2 to 4
inches, with local maxima of 6 inches, across the northwestern
Bahamas Tuesday through Thursday.
 
Heavy rainfall from this system is expected to impact portions of
Florida and the southeastern United States by mid to late week.

Subtropical Storm Nicole Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172022
500 AM AST Mon Nov 07 2022
 
The area of disturbed weather that NHC has been monitoring over the 
southwestern Atlantic Ocean has been gradually becoming better 
organized.  Scatterometer data and buoy observations from last 
evening indicated that the system has developed a sufficiently 
well-defined center of circulation, with gale-force winds as high as 
40 kt occurring in a band that lies between 180-240 n mi to the east 
of the center.  Moderate to deep convection has also increased a 
bit, with TAFB providing a subtropical Hebert-Poteat classification 
of ST1.5.  Given these data, the system is now being classified as a 
subtropical storm.

Since Nicole's center has only recently formed, the initial motion 
is a little uncertain, but the best estimate is north-northwestward, 
or 330/12 kt.  Model guidance indicates that the system should turn 
northwestward and slow down later today, followed by a turn toward 
the west and west-southwest tonight through Tuesday night due to a 
mid-level ridge axis poking eastward off the U.S. Mid-Atlantic 
coast.  In about 3 days, the high over the southeastern United 
States will slide eastward over the Atlantic as a large mid-latitude 
trough traverses the country, and Nicole is expected to make a sharp 
recurvature toward the north and northeast on days 4 and 5 in the 
vicinity of Florida.  The track guidance is in fairly good agreement 
on this scenario, and the official NHC track forecast is fairly 
close to the TVCN and HCCA consensus aids. 

Some gradual strengthening is anticipated over the next few days, 
although Nicole's sprawling nature does not favor fast 
intensification, at least not initially.  For the first couple of 
days of the forecast, the NHC intensity prediction closely follows 
the GFS global model solution.  Although Nicole is likely to 
maintain a large wind field, models suggest that it could make a 
transition to a tropical cyclone and develop a smaller inner-core 
wind field in about 2 to 3 days, and at that point more significant 
intensification is possible.  For now, the NHC intensity forecast 
brings Nicole close to hurricane strength in 60-72 hours while it 
moves near the northwestern Bahamas and approaches the east coast of 
Florida, which is in line with the HCCA consensus aid.  It's not out 
of the question for Nicole to reach hurricane strength, especially 
given how warm the waters are in the vicinity of the Bahamas.  It 
should be stressed, however, that no matter Nicole's ultimate 
intensity, the storm's large size will likely cause significant 
wind, storm surge, and rainfall impacts over a large portion of the 
northwestern Bahamas, Florida, and the southeastern coast of the 
United States during much of the upcoming week.

Key Messages:

1.  Nicole is forecast to be a large storm, and regardless of its 
exact path, widespread impacts from a prolonged period of coastal 
flooding, tropical-storm-force winds, heavy rainfall, rough surf 
and rip currents, and beach erosion are likely along much of the 
southeastern United States coast, the Florida east coast, and 
portions of the northwestern and central Bahamas during much of the 
upcoming week.

2.  Nicole could be at or near hurricane strength when it moves 
near the northwestern Bahamas and the east coast of Florida 
Wednesday and Thursday, bringing the potential for a dangerous 
storm surge, damaging winds, and heavy rainfall to a portion of 
those areas.  A Tropical Storm Watch is now in effect for the 
northwestern Bahamas, and additional watches could be required for 
portions of the Bahamas and the coast of Florida later today.
