DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM EST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Nicole was
located near latitude 27.0 North, longitude 78.9 West.  Nicole is
moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A turn
toward the northwest is expected on Thursday, followed by a turn
toward the north and north-northeast on Friday.  On the forecast
track, the center of Nicole will move onshore the east coast of
Florida within the hurricane warning area late tonight or early
Thursday.  Nicole's center is then expected to move across central
and northern Florida into southern Georgia Thursday and Thursday
night, and into the Carolinas Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected until Nicole makes
landfall along the Florida east coast.   Nicole is expected to
weaken while moving across Florida and the southeastern United 
States Thursday through Friday, and it is likely to become a
post-tropical cyclone by Friday afternoon.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 485 miles 
(780 km), especially to the north of the center. A WeatherFlow 
station at Juno Beach Pier recently reported a wind gust of 55 mph 
(89 km/h), and a C-MAN station at Settlement Point on Grand Bahama 
Island recently reported a wind gust of 55 mph (89 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nicole can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the web at <a href="http://www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml">www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml</a>.
 
WIND:  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions will continue across 
portions of the northwestern Bahamas through tonight.  Tropical 
storm conditions will continue along portions of the east coast of 
Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina in the warning areas into 
Thursday.  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane 
warning area in Florida tonight or Thursday morning.  Hurricane 
conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area tonight. 
Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning area along 
the west coast of Florida tonight and Thursday.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
* North Palm Beach Florida to Altamaha Sound Georgia including the
St. Johns River to the Fuller Warren Bridge...3 to 5 ft
* Anclote River to Ochlockonee River...3 to 5 ft
* Altamaha Sound Georgia to the South Santee River South
Carolina...2 to 4 ft
* St. Johns River south of the Fuller Warren Bridge to Georgetown
Florida...2 to 4 ft
* Hallandale Beach to North Palm Beach...2 to 4 ft
* Ochlockonee River to Indian Pass...2 to 4 ft
* Englewood to Anclote River including Tampa Bay...1 to 3 ft
* North of Ocean Reef to Hallandale Beach including Biscayne Bay...1
to 2 ft
* South Santee River to Surf City North Carolina...1 to 2 ft
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast of the northwestern
Bahamas in areas of onshore winds.
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to
your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
RAINFALL:  Nicole is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts through Saturday:
 
Northwest Bahamas into the eastern, central and northern portions of
the Florida Peninsula: 3 to 5 inches with local maxima of 8 inches.
 
Southeast into the southern and central Appalachians, western
Mid-Atlantic, and eastern portions of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Ohio:
2 to 4 inches with local maxima of 6 inches along the Blue Ridge.
 
Northern Mid-Atlantic into New England: 1 to 4 inches.
 
Flash and urban flooding will be possible, along with renewed river
rises on the St. Johns River, across the Florida Peninsula today
into Thursday.  Heavy rainfall from this system will spread
northward across portions of the Southeast, eastern Ohio Valley,
Mid-Atlantic, and New England Thursday through Saturday, where
limited flooding impacts will be possible.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes will be possible overnight into early
Thursday morning across east-central to northeast Florida.  The
tornado threat will increase and gradually expand north through the
day into southeast Georgia and southern South Carolina.  Some
tornado risk should continue Thursday night into early Friday across
eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina.  Tornadoes
will again be possible during the day Friday centered on central to
eastern North Carolina into southeast Virginia.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Nicole will affect the northwestern
Bahamas, the east coast of Florida, and much of the southeastern
United States coast during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Nicole Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172022
400 PM EST Wed Nov 09 2022
 
The satellite presentation of Nicole has not changed much since
late this morning.  Curved bands of convection wrap around much of
the circulation and there has been a ragged eyewall in radar data
from both the Bahamas and Miami.  An Air Force Reserve 
reconnaissance aircraft reported a minimum pressure of 985 mb and 
peak 850-mb flight-level winds of 72 kt during its final pass 
through the center and northwestern portion of the storm as Nicole 
made landfall on Great Abaco Island in the northwestern Bahamas just
prior to 1700 UTC.  Those aircraft data still supported an
intensity of 60 kt, and that remains the initial intensity for
this advisory.
 
Recent center fixes show that Nicole is moving westward or 270
degrees at 11 kt.  A mid-level ridge located to the north of the
cyclone is expected to shift eastward causing Nicole to turn
west-northwestward to northwestward tonight. This motion
should bring the center onshore the coast of southeastern or
east-central Florida overnight, and across the Florida peninsula
Thursday morning.  As Nicole passes over north Florida late 
Thursday, a mid-latitude trough moving into the central United 
States is expected to turn the cyclone or its remnants northward 
and then northeastward across inland portions of Georgia and the 
Carolinas. The dynamical model guidance is in good agreement during 
the first 12 to 24 hours, with some increase in spread during the 
recurvature portion of the forecast.  The updated NHC track 
forecast is very similar to the previous advisory through 24 hours, 
but is slightly west thereafter to be close to the latest consensus 
aids.
 
Nicole still has about 12 hours in which to strengthen.  Given the
slightly improved inner core structure and the warm waters of the
Gulf Stream that Nicole will be traversing, the forecast still
calls for the cyclone to reach hurricane status before reaching the
east coast of Florida.  After landfall, weakening should occur as
the center cross the Florida peninsula.  Even if the center briefly 
emerges over the extreme northeastern Gulf of Mexico, 
re-intensification is not expected.  Nicole is forecast to weaken 
further over the southeastern United Sates, and then dissipate along 
a frontal zone moving into the eastern United States by 60 hours.


Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane and tropical storm conditions and a dangerous storm
surge are expected to continue over portions of the northwestern
Bahamas through this evening, where a Hurricane Warning remains in
effect.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are expected across portions of the coast
of southeast and east-central Florida beginning this evening or
tonight, where a Hurricane Warning is in effect.  Tropical
storm conditions will continue along the east coast of Florida,
Georgia, and South Carolina within the warning areas into
Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin along
the west coast of Florida within the warning area this evening or
tonight.
 
3. A dangerous storm surge is expected along much of the east coast
of Florida, portions of coastal Georgia, and the Florida Big Bend
along the Gulf coast.  The storm surge will be accompanied by large
and damaging waves along the Atlantic coast.  Residents in the
warning area should listen to advice given by local officials.
 
4. Do not focus on the exact track of Nicole since it is a large
storm with hazards extending well to the north of the center,
outside of the forecast cone.  These hazards will affect much of the
Florida peninsula and portions of the southeast United States.
 
5. Nicole will produce heavy rainfall today into Thursday across the
Florida Peninsula. Flash and urban flooding will be possible across
portions of the Florida Peninsula along with renewed river rises on
the St. Johns River. Isolated flash, urban, and small stream
flooding will also be possible on Friday in the Southeast through
the southern and central Appalachians, including the Blue Ridge
Mountains, and extending northward through west central Pennsylvania
into western New York by Friday night.
