DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM EST (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nicole was
located near latitude 26.5 North, longitude 77.3 West. Nicole is
moving toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A turn toward the
west-northwest is expected tonight, followed by a turn toward the
northwest on Thursday, and north or north-northeast on Friday.  On
the forecast track, the center of Nicole will move near or over the
Abacos and Grand Bahama in the northwestern Bahamas this afternoon 
and move onshore the east coast of Florida within the hurricane 
warning area tonight.  Nicole's center is then expected to move 
across central and northern Florida into southern Georgia Thursday 
and Thursday night, and then across the Carolinas Friday and Friday 
night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is expected today, and Nicole is forecast
to become a hurricane near the northwestern Bahamas and remain a
hurricane when it reaches the east coast of Florida tonight.  Nicole
is expected to weaken while moving across Florida and the
southeastern United States Thursday through Friday, and it is likely
to become a post-tropical cyclone by Friday night over the
Mid-Atlantic states.
 
Nicole is a large tropical storm.  Tropical-storm-force winds
extend outward up to 460 miles (740 km) especially to the north of
the center. A private weather station on Elbow Cay, just east of 
Great Abaco Island, recently reported sustained winds of 43 mph 
(69 km/h) and a wind gust of 59 mph (59 km/h).  The National Ocean 
Service station at the Lake Worth Pier, Florida, recently reported 
a wind gust of 59 mph (95 km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure based on Air Force Reserve Hurricane 
Hunter data is 985 mb (29.09 inches).  The station at Elbow Cay 
recently reported a pressure of 985.7 mb (29.11 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nicole can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the web at www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring across the
northwestern Bahamas, and hurricane conditions are expected to
spread westward in areas in hurricane warning area through this
evening.  Tropical storm conditions are also occurring along
portions of the east coast of Florida and will spread northward
within the warning area through Georgia and South Carolina this 
afternoon and tonight. Hurricane conditions are expected within the 
hurricane warning area in Florida tonight or Thursday morning.  
Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area 
tonight. Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning 
area along the west coast of Florida by this evening or tonight.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
* North Palm Beach Florida to Altamaha Sound Georgia including the
St. Johns River to the Fuller Warren Bridge...3 to 5 ft
* Anclote River to Ochlockonee River...3 to 5 ft
* Altamaha Sound Georgia to the South Santee River South
Carolina...2 to 4 ft
* St. Johns River south of the Fuller Warren Bridge to Georgetown
Florida...2 to 4 ft
* Hallandale Beach to North Palm Beach...2 to 4 ft
* Ochlockonee River to Indian Pass...2 to 4 ft
* Englewood to Anclote River including Tampa Bay...1 to 3 ft
* North of Ocean Reef to Hallandale Beach including Biscayne Bay...1
to 2 ft
* South Santee River to Surf City North Carolina...1 to 2 ft
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast of the northwestern
Bahamas in areas of onshore winds.
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to
your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
RAINFALL:  Nicole is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts through Friday night:
 
Northwest Bahamas into the eastern, central and northern portions
of the Florida Peninsula: 3 to 5 inches with local maxima of 8
inches.
 
Southeast into the southern and central Appalachians, western
Mid-Atlantic, and eastern portions of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Ohio:
2 to 4 inches with local maxima of 6 inches along the Blue Ridge.
 
Northern Mid-Atlantic into portions of New England: 1 to 4 inches.
 
Flash and urban flooding will be possible, along with renewed river
rises on the St. Johns River, across the Florida Peninsula today
into Thursday. Heavy rainfall from this system will spread northward
across portions of the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and New England
Thursday into Friday night, where limited flooding impacts will be
possible.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible this evening through
Thursday across eastern Florida, southeastern Georgia and southern
South Carolina.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Nicole will affect the northwestern
Bahamas, the east coast of Florida, and much of the southeastern
United States coast during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Nicole Forecast Discussion Number 10</title>

TCDAT2
 
Tropical Storm Nicole Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172022
1000 AM EST Wed Nov 09 2022
 
Convection has increased in both coverage and organization near the 
center of Nicole, with a curved band or partial eyewall now 
present near the center.  However, this has not yet resulted in any 
intensification, with reports from NOAA and Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicating the maximum winds are near 
60 kt and the central pressure near 986 mb. 

The aircraft and satellite data, along with radar data from the 
Bahamas show that Nicole is now moving westward with an initial 
motion of 265/10.  This motion should bring the center across the 
Abacos and Grand Bahama in the northwestern Bahamas during the next 
several hours.  Subsequently, a westward to west-northwestward 
motion should bring the center to the southeast or east-central 
coast of Florida tonight.  After landfall in Florida, a low- to 
mid-level ridge over the southeastern U.S. is expected to slide 
eastward over the Atlantic, with Nicole turning northwestward and 
northward across northern Florida or the northeastern Gulf of 
Mexico, and then across the southeastern U.S.  Finally, a deep-layer 
mid-latitude trough approaching from the west should cause Nicole to 
accelerate northeastward toward the Mid-Atlantic states.  The new 
track forecast is similar to the previous forecast and generally 
follows the more southerly and westerly GFS/ECMWF solutions.   

While Nicole is over warm sea surface temperatures, a combination 
of shear of dry air entrainment is likely to allow only gradual 
intensification.  However, that gradual intensification should 
allow Nicole to become a hurricane later today while crossing the 
northwestern Bahamas.  Weakening is expected once the center moves 
over Florida, and even if the center emerges for a time over the 
northeastern Gulf of Mexico re-intensification is not expected.  
The new intensity forecast calls for Nicole to weaken to a 
depression over land by 48 h, and then become extratropical by 60 h 
as it merges with a frontal system.  The global models are in good 
agreement that Nicole should dissipate inside the frontal system by 
72 h as another low forms to the north.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane conditions and a dangerous storm surge are expected in
portions of the northwestern Bahamas today, where a Hurricane
Warning is in effect.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are expected across portions of the coast
of southeast and east-central Florida beginning this evening or
tonight, where a Hurricane Warning is in effect.  Tropical
storm conditions have begun along the east coast of Florida in the
warning areas and will spread northward to Georgia and South
Carolina later today.  Tropical storm conditions are expected to
begin along the west coast of Florida within the warning area this
evening or tonight.
 
3. A dangerous storm surge is expected along much of the east coast
of Florida, portions of coastal Georgia, and the Florida Big Bend 
along the Gulf coast.  The storm surge will be accompanied by large
and damaging waves along the Atlantic coast.  Residents in the 
warning area should listen to advice given by local officials.
 
4. Do not focus on the exact track of Nicole since it is a large 
storm with hazards extending well to the north of the center, 
outside of the forecast cone.  These hazards will affect much of the 
Florida peninsula and portions of the southeast United States.
 
5. Nicole will produce heavy rainfall today into Thursday across the 
Florida Peninsula. Flash and urban flooding will be possible across 
portions of the Florida Peninsula along with river rises on 
the St. Johns River. Isolated flash, urban, and small stream 
flooding will also be possible on Friday in the Southeast through 
the southern and central Appalachians, including the Blue Ridge 
Mountains, and extending northward through west central Pennsylvania 
into western New York by Friday night.
