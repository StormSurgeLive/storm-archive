DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM EST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nicole was
located near latitude 27.3 North, longitude 74.3 West.  Nicole is
moving toward the west-southwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A 
west-southwestward motion is expected through early Wednesday.  A 
westward to west-northwest motion is forecast to begin later on 
Wednesday, followed by a turn toward the northwest and 
north-northwest on Thursday and Thursday night.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Nicole will approach the northwestern Bahamas 
tonight, move near or over those islands on Wednesday, and approach 
the east coast of Florida within the hurricane warning area 
Wednesday night or early Thursday.  Nicole's center is then expected 
to move across central and northern Florida into southern Georgia 
Thursday and Thursday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Some strengthening is expected during the next day or 
so, and Nicole is forecast to become a hurricane by Wednesday when 
it is near the northwestern Bahamas, and remain a hurricane when it 
reaches the east coast of Florida.
 
Nicole is a large tropical cyclone.  Tropical-storm-force winds
extend outward up to 380 miles (610 km) from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure reported by a NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft is 984 mb (29.06 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nicole can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the web at www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the northwestern Bahamas
within the hurricane warning area on Wednesday, with tropical storm
conditions beginning across all of the northwestern Bahamas tonight.
Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane warning area
along the east coast of Florida Wednesday night or Thursday morning
with tropical storm conditions expected by tonight or early
Wednesday within the tropical storm and hurricane warning areas.
Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area
on Wednesday night and Thursday. Tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area along the west coast of Florida by
Wednesday night.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
* North Palm Beach Florida to Altamaha Sound Georgia including the
St. Johns River to the Fuller Warren Bridge...3 to 5 ft
* Altamaha Sound Georgia to the South Santee River South
Carolina...2 to 4 ft
* St. Johns River south of the Fuller Warren Bridge to
Georgetown Florida...2 to 4 ft
* Hallandale Beach to North Palm Beach...2 to 4 ft
* Anclote River to the Ochlockonee River...2 to 4 ft
* Middle of Longboat Key to Anclote River including Tampa Bay...1
to 3 ft
* North of Ocean Reef to Hallandale Beach including Biscayne Bay...1
to 2 ft
* Ochlockonee River to Indian Pass Florida...1 to 2 ft
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast of the northwestern
Bahamas in areas of onshore winds.
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to
your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
RAINFALL: Nicole is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts through Friday:
 
Northwest Bahamas into the eastern, central and northern portions
of the Florida Peninsula: 3 to 5 inches with local maxima of 8
inches.
 
Southeast into the southern and central Appalachians, western
Mid Atlantic, and eastern portions of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Ohio:
2 to 4 inches with local maxima of 6 inches along the Blue Ridge.
 
Flash and urban flooding will be likely, along with possible renewed
river rises on the St. Johns River, across the Florida Peninsula on
Wednesday and Thursday. Heavy rainfall from this system will spread
north farther up the Eastern Seaboard late Thursday into Friday.
 
TORNADOES: Isolated tornadoes will be possible from eastern Florida
into parts of eastern Georgia and eastern South Carolina beginning
late Wednesday night and continuing through Friday.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Nicole will affect the northwestern
Bahamas, the east coast of Florida, and much of the southeastern
United States coast during the next several days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Nicole Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Tropical Storm Nicole Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172022
400 PM EST Tue Nov 08 2022
 
Satellite imagery indicates that the central convection associated
with Nicole has become better organized this afternoon, with a
curved convective band wrapped about three-quarters of the way
around the center.  An earlier scatterometer overpass showed winds
near 45 kt about 60 n mi northwest of the center, and a just 
received microwave overpass shows an additional increase in 
organization.  Based on these data, the initial intensity is 
increased to 55 kt. Water vapor and air mass imagery shows a large 
area of mid- to upper-level dry air over the southern semicircle of 
the circulation, and some of this may be entraining into the core at
this time.
 
Nicole is continuing its anticipated turn with the initial motion
now 260/9.  A strong deep-layer ridge over the eastern United
States should steer the storm west-southwestward during the next
24-30 h, with this motion bringing the center near or over the
Northwestern Bahamas.  After that time, the ridge is forecast to
shift eastward allowing Nicole to turn westward to 
west-northwestward as it approaches the east coast of Florida.  
There is some spread in the guidance as to how much of a turn will 
occur, with the ECMWF and GFS showing a more westward motion, while 
the HWRF and HMON show a more northwestward motion.  This part of 
the forecast track is along the south edge of the guidance and 
agreement with the ECMWF and UKMET. After landfall in Florida, 
Nicole should turn generally northwestward, with the center 
forecast to pass near or over the west coast of Florida north of 
Tampa by about 48 h.  This should be followed by a turn toward the 
north and northeast through the eastern United States as the cyclone 
recurves on the east side of a large baroclinic trough moving 
through the central United States.  This part of the forecast track 
is closer to the various consensus models, and overall the new 
forecast track is a little south of the previous track through 60 h 
and a little west of the previous track after that time.
 
Nicole will be traversing relatively warm SSTs of 27-28 degrees
Celsius and upper-level conditions, while not ideal due to a nearby 
upper-level trough, are expected to allow some strengthening before 
the cyclone reaches Florida. The new intensity forecast follows the 
previous forecast and calls for Nicole to become a hurricane when it 
is near the northwest Bahamas and remain a hurricane when it reaches 
Florida.  This part of the intensity forecast is at the high end of 
the intensity guidance. Weakening is expected after Nicole moves 
inland over Florida and while it accelerates northeastward over the 
southeastern United States.  Extratropical transition is expected 
to start between 60-72 h and be complete by 96 h, with the storm 
likely to maintain gale-force winds after transition.  The cyclone 
is expected to dissipate as it merges with another mid-latitude low 
pressure area by 120 h.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane conditions and a dangerous storm surge are expected in
portions of the northwestern Bahamas on Wednesday, where a Hurricane
Warning is in effect.
 
2.  Hurricane conditions are expected across portions of the coast
of southeast and east-central Florida beginning late Wednesday or
Wednesday night, where a Hurricane Warning is in effect.  Tropical 
storm conditions are expected in the Tropical Storm Warning
areas in Florida and Georgia beginning early Wednesday.
 
3. A dangerous storm surge is expected along much of the east coast
of Florida and portions of coastal Georgia where a Storm Surge
Warning is in effect.  The storm surge will be accompanied by large
and damaging waves.  Residents in the warning area should listen to
advice given by local officials.
 
4. Do not focus on the exact track of Nicole since it is expected to
be a large storm with hazards extending well to the north of the
center, outside of the forecast cone. These hazards are likely to
affect much of the Florida peninsula and portions of the southeast
United States.
 
5. Nicole will produce heavy rainfall Wednesday and Thursday across 
the Florida Peninsula. Flash and urban flooding will be likely 
across portions of the Florida Peninsula along with possible renewed 
river rises on the St. Johns River. On Friday and Saturday, flash, 
urban and small stream flooding will be possible in the Southeast 
through the Mid-Atlantic and central Appalachians.
