Persons located within these areas should take all necessary actions
to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for
other dangerous conditions.  Promptly follow evacuation and other
instructions from local officials.
 
Interests in the remainder of Florida and along the southeastern
coast of the United States should monitor the progress of Nicole.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM EST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nicole was 
located near latitude 29.4 North, longitude 83.2 West. Nicole is 
moving toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this general 
motion should continue this evening, followed by a turn toward the 
north tonight. Nicole is expected to accelerate north-northeastward 
on Friday. On the forecast track, the center of Nicole will move 
along the coast of the Florida Big Bend region for the next several 
hours before moving across the eastern Florida Panhandle.  After 
that, Nicole should move northward over Georgia later tonight, and 
then move through the southeastern United States on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts. These winds are mainly occurring over the Gulf of Mexico to
the west of the center.  Little change in strength is expected this 
evening while the center moves along the coast of the Florida Big 
Bend. Nicole is expected to weaken to a depression over Georgia 
tonight, and then it is expected to dissipate as it merges with a 
frontal boundary over the Mid-Atlantic United States by Friday 
night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.  A WeatherSTEM station on the campus of the
University of Florida in Gainesville recently reported a wind gust
of 54 mph (87 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.24 inches).
The NOAA National Ocean Service Station station at Cedar Key,
Florida, recently reported a pressure of 989.5 mb (29.22 inches) as
the center passed nearby.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nicole can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the web at <a href="http://www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml">www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml</a>.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue along portions of the
east coast of Florida and Georgia in the warning areas this evening.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to occur within the warning
area along the west coast of Florida through tonight.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
* Flagler/Volusia County Line Florida to Altamaha Sound Georgia
including the St. Johns River...2 to 4 ft
* Anclote River to Ochlockonee River...2 to 4 ft
* Altamaha Sound Georgia to the Savannah River...1 to 3 ft
* Ochlockonee River to Indian Pass...1 to 2 ft
* Englewood to Anclote River including Tampa Bay...1 to 2 ft
* North of Ocean Reef to Flagler/Volusia County Line Florida
including Biscayne Bay...1 to 2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to
your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
RAINFALL:  Nicole is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts through Saturday:
 
* Northwest Bahamas and the Florida Peninsula: An inch or less of
additional rainfall.
* Eastern Florida Panhandle and Florida Big Bend into the
Southeast, southern and central Appalachians, eastern and central
portions of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Ohio: 2 to 4 inches with local
maxima of 6 to 8 inches along the Blue Ridge.
* Northern Mid-Atlantic into New England: 1 to 4 inches.
 
Flash and urban flooding will be possible, along with renewed river
rises on the St. Johns River, across the Florida Peninsula today.
Heavy rainfall from this system will spread northward across
portions of the Southeast, upper Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic, and New
England through Saturday, where limited flooding impacts will be
possible.
 
For the latest rainfall reports and wind gusts associated with
Hurricane Nicole, see the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS2 with
the WMO header ACUS42 KWBC or at the following link:
https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc2.html
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible this afternoon through
tonight over parts of southeastern Georgia, eastern South Carolina,
and southeastern North Carolina.  The threat will spread northward
into Virginia and more of North Carolina during the day on Friday.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Nicole will affect the northwestern
Bahamas, the east coast of Florida, and much of the southeastern
United States coast during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Nicole Forecast Discussion Number 14</title>
<description>Issued at 1000 AM EST Thu Nov 10 2022  <![CDATA[<pre>

814 
WTNT42 KNHC 101452
TCDAT2
 
Tropical Storm Nicole Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172022
1000 AM EST Thu Nov 10 2022
 
The center of Nicole is currently over west central Florida to the
northeast of Tampa. While the cyclone remains well organized in
satellite imagery, surface observation and Doppler radar data
indicate that the maximum winds have decreased to near 45 kt, and
that the central pressure has risen to near 985 mb.
 
The initial motion is 295/14 kt.  A low- to mid-level ridge to the 
northeast of Nicole is moving eastward as a deep-layer mid-latitude 
trough and associated surface cold front are approaching from the 
west.  This evolution should cause Nicole to turn northwestward 
today, with the center moving just offshore of the coast of the 
Florida Big Bend.  The storm should turn northward tonight and move 
over the southeastern United States.  On Friday, Nicole or its 
remnants should accelerate north-northeastward on the east side of 
the trough.  The new forecast track is similar to, but just a little 
west of the previous track, and it lies close to the various 
consensus models.

Continued weakening is expected this morning while the center 
remains over land.  While the center is forecast to briefly emerge 
over the Gulf of Mexico this afternoon, it is not expected to be 
over water long enough for significant re-intensification.  After 
landfall in the Florida Panhandle, Nicole should weaken to a 
depression by 24 h.  Subsequently, the cyclone will become 
post-tropical and be absorbed by the large mid-latitude weather 
system.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions will continue along the east coast of
Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina within the warning areas today.
Tropical storm conditions will spread northward along the west
coast of Florida to the coast of the Florida Panhandle through
tonight.
 
2. A dangerous storm surge is expected along portions of the
east-central and northeastern coast of Florida, portions of coastal
Georgia, and the Florida Big Bend along the Gulf coast.  The storm
surge will be accompanied by large and damaging waves along the
Atlantic coast.  Residents in the warning area should listen to
advice given by local officials.
 
3. Do not focus on the exact track of Nicole since it is a large
storm with hazards extending well to the north of the center,
outside of the forecast cone.  These hazards will continue to
affect much of the Florida peninsula and portions of the southeast
United States.
 
4. Nicole will produce heavy rainfall today across the Florida
Peninsula. Flash and urban flooding will be possible across portions
of the Florida Peninsula along with renewed river flooding on the
St. Johns River. Isolated flash, urban, and small stream flooding
will also be possible on Friday in the Southeast through the central
Appalachians, including the Blue Ridge Mountains, and extending
northward through eastern Ohio, west central Pennsylvania, into
western New York by Friday night into Saturday.
