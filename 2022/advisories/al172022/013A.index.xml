hurricanes.gov.
 
Interests in the remainder of Florida and along the southeastern
coast of the United States should monitor the progress of Nicole.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM EST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nicole was 
located inland over central Florida near latitude 28.1 North, 
longitude 81.6 West.  Nicole is moving toward the west-northwest 
near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A turn toward the northwest and 
north-northwest is expected later today and tonight, followed by an 
acceleration toward the north and north-northeast on Friday.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Nicole will move across central 
Florida this morning, possibly emerge over the far northeastern Gulf 
of Mexico this afternoon, and then move across the Florida Panhandle 
and Georgia tonight and on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (100 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast while Nicole
moves over land during the next day or two, and the storm is likely
to become a tropical depression over Georgia tonight or early
Friday.  Nicole is expected to merge with a frontal boundary over
the Mid-Atlantic United States by Friday night.
 
Nicole remains a large tropical storm.  Tropical-storm-force winds
extend outward up to 450 miles (720 km) from the center, especially
to the north.  Daytona Beach, Florida, recently reported sustained 
winds of 49 mph (80 km/h) with a wind gust of 70 mph (113 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface
observations is 984 mb (29.06 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nicole can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the web at www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue along portions of the
east coast of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina in the warning
areas today.  Tropical storm conditions are expected to occur within
the warning area along the west coast of Florida through tonight.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
* Jupiter Inlet Florida to Altamaha Sound Georgia including the
St. Johns River to the Fuller Warren Bridge...3 to 5 ft
* Anclote River to Ochlockonee River...3 to 5 ft
* Altamaha Sound Georgia to the South Santee River South
Carolina...2 to 4 ft
* St. Johns River south of the Fuller Warren Bridge to Georgetown
Florida...2 to 4 ft
* Ochlockonee River to Indian Pass...2 to 4 ft
* Englewood to Anclote River including Tampa Bay...1 to 3 ft
* Jupiter Inlet to Hallandale Beach Florida ...1 to 3 ft
* South Santee River to Surf City North Carolina...1 to 2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to
your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
RAINFALL:  Nicole is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts through Saturday:
 
* Northwest Bahamas into portions of the Florida Peninsula: 3 to 5
inches with local maxima of 8 inches.
* Southeast into the central Appalachians and eastern portions of
Tennessee, Kentucky, and Ohio: 2 to 4 inches with local maxima of 6
inches along the Blue Ridge.
* Northern Mid-Atlantic into New England: 1 to 4 inches.
 
Flash and urban flooding will be possible, along with renewed river
rises on the St. Johns River, across the Florida Peninsula today.
Heavy rainfall from this system will spread northward across
portions of the Southeast, upper Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic, and New
England today through Saturday, where limited flooding impacts
will be possible.
 
For the latest rainfall reports and wind gusts associated with
Hurricane Nicole, see the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS2 with
the WMO header ACUS42 KWBC or at the following link:
https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc2.html
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible this morning over parts of
coastal east-central and northeastern Florida.  The tornado threat
will spread northward across parts of southeastern Georgia and the
Carolinas later today through Friday morning.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Nicole will affect the northwestern
Bahamas, the east coast of Florida, and much of the southeastern
United States coast during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

TCDAT2
 
Tropical Storm Nicole Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172022
400 AM EST Thu Nov 10 2022
 
Nicole's center made landfall around 3 AM EST (0800 UTC) in the
vicinity of Vero Beach, Florida.  Now that the center is inland over
Florida, it is assumed that weakening has begun, and Nicole is being
designated as a tropical storm with maximum winds of 60 kt.
 
The initial motion is west-northwestward, or 295/12 kt.  Mid-level
high pressure is sliding eastward off the North Carolina/Virginia
coast, with a large deep-layer trough moving eastward from the
Rocky Mountains.  This pattern is expected to cause Nicole to turn
northwestward later today and then accelerate toward the
north-northeast over the southeastern U.S. on Friday.  There has
been no appreciable change in the track guidance on this cycle, and
the new NHC track forecast essentially lies on top of the previous
prediction.
 
Weakening is expected to continue while Nicole's center moves
across central Florida during the morning hours.  Although the
center may emerge over the extreme northeastern Gulf of Mexico
early this afternoon, it won't be over water long enough to aid in
any re-intensification.  Continued weakening is forecast tonight
and on Friday while Nicole moves across the southeastern United
States.  The NHC intensity forecast follows a blend of the
solutions from Decay-SHIPS, HCCA, and the Florida State
Superensemble.  Nicole is forecast to merge with another
extratropical system over the Mid-Atlantic states by 48 hours.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions will continue along the east coast of
Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina within the warning areas today.
Tropical storm conditions will spread northward along the west
coast of Florida to the coast of the Florida Panhandle through
tonight.
 
2. A dangerous storm surge is expected along portions of the
east-central and northeastern coast of Florida, portions of coastal
Georgia, and the Florida Big Bend along the Gulf coast.  The storm
surge will be accompanied by large and damaging waves along the
Atlantic coast.  Residents in the warning area should listen to
advice given by local officials.
 
3. Do not focus on the exact track of Nicole since it is a large
storm with hazards extending well to the north of the center,
outside of the forecast cone.  These hazards will continue to
affect much of the Florida peninsula and portions of the southeast
United States.
 
4. Nicole will produce heavy rainfall today across the Florida
Peninsula.  Flash and urban flooding will be possible across
portions of the Florida Peninsula along with renewed river flooding
on the St. Johns River.  Isolated flash, urban, and small stream
flooding will also be possible on Friday in the Southeast through
the central Appalachians, including the Blue Ridge Mountains, and
extending northward through eastern Ohio, west central Pennsylvania,
into western New York by Friday night into Saturday.
