DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM EST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Nicole was located
near latitude 27.2 North, longitude 79.9 West.  Nicole is moving
toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A turn toward the
northwest is expected later today, followed by a turn toward the
north and north-northeast on Friday.  On the forecast track, the
center of Nicole will move onshore the east coast of Florida within
the hurricane warning area within the next couple of hours.  
Nicole's center is then expected to move across central and northern 
Florida into southern Georgia today and tonight, and into the
Carolinas on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected until Nicole makes
landfall along the Florida east coast.  Nicole is expected to weaken
while moving across Florida and the southeastern United States
today through Friday, and it is likely to become a post-tropical
cyclone by Friday afternoon.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 485
miles (780 km), especially to the north of the center.  NOAA buoy 
41009, located about 25 miles east of Cape Canaveral, Florida, 
recently reported a sustained wind of 56 mph (90 km/h) and a wind 
gust to 67 mph (108 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nicole can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC,
and on the web at www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue across portions of 
the northwestern Bahamas for the next several hours.  Hurricane 
conditions are expected within the hurricane warning area in Florida 
during the next few hours, and are possible over Lake Okeechobee 
this morning.  Tropical storm conditions will continue along 
portions of the east coast of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina 
in the warning areas today.  Tropical storm conditions will begin 
soon within the warning area along the west coast of Florida 
and will continue through this evening.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
* North Palm Beach Florida to Altamaha Sound Georgia including the
St. Johns River to the Fuller Warren Bridge...3 to 5 ft
* Anclote River to Ochlockonee River...3 to 5 ft
* Altamaha Sound Georgia to the South Santee River South
Carolina...2 to 4 ft
* St. Johns River south of the Fuller Warren Bridge to Georgetown
Florida...2 to 4 ft
* Hallandale Beach to North Palm Beach...2 to 4 ft
* Ochlockonee River to Indian Pass...2 to 4 ft
* Englewood to Anclote River including Tampa Bay...1 to 3 ft
* North of Ocean Reef to Hallandale Beach including Biscayne Bay...1
to 2 ft
* South Santee River to Surf City North Carolina...1 to 2 ft
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast of the northwestern
Bahamas in areas of onshore winds.
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and
can vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to
your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
RAINFALL:  Nicole is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts through Saturday:
 
Northwest Bahamas into the eastern, central and northern portions of
the Florida Peninsula: 3 to 5 inches with local maxima of 8 inches.
 
Southeast into the southern and central Appalachians, western
Mid-Atlantic, and eastern portions of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Ohio:
2 to 4 inches with local maxima of 6 inches along the Blue Ridge.
 
Northern Mid-Atlantic into New England: 1 to 4 inches.
 
Flash and urban flooding will be possible, along with renewed river
rises on the St. Johns River, across the Florida Peninsula today.  
Heavy rainfall from this system will spread northward across 
portions of the Southeast, eastern Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic, and 
New England today through Saturday, where limited flooding impacts 
will be possible.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes will be possible through early this 
morning across east-central to northeast Florida.  The tornado 
threat will increase and gradually expand north through the day into 
southeast Georgia and southern South Carolina.  Some tornado risk 
should continue tonight into early Friday across eastern South 
Carolina and southeast North Carolina.  Tornadoes will again be 
possible during the day Friday centered on central to eastern North 
Carolina into southeast Virginia.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Nicole will affect the northwestern
Bahamas, the east coast of Florida, and much of the southeastern
United States coast during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Nicole Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172022
1000 PM EST Wed Nov 09 2022

The hurricane has large intense bands extending quite far from the 
center, but does not have a distinct Central Dense Overcast.  
Flight-level wind observations from Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that the maximum winds are near 65 kt.  Dvorak satellite 
classifications gave a slightly lower intensity, probably because 
the system does not have a classic tropical cyclone appearance at 
this time.  Nicole has a large eye over 50 nmi in diameter, and a 
very large extent of tropical-storm-force winds over its northern 
semicircle.

Nicole has made its expected turn toward a west-northwestward 
heading and the motion estimate is now 285/11 kt.  The system 
should turn toward the northwest and north during the next day or 
so while moving along the western side of a mid-level anticyclone, 
moving over the Florida peninsula and northern Florida.  In 36 to 
48 hours, Nicole should accelerate north-northeastward to the east 
of a longwave mid-tropospheric trough.  The official track forecast 
is about the same as the previous one and remains close to the 
multi-model consensus prediction.

The hurricane has little time to strengthen further before making 
landfall in Florida.  Weakening will occur while Nicole moves over 
Florida, and even though the center may briefly emerge over the 
extreme northeastern Gulf of Mexico, this is not likely to result in 
any significant re-intensification.  The system should weaken to a 
depression and become a post-tropical cyclone over the southeastern 
United States.  Nicole should merge with another extratropical low 
over the eastern United States after 48 hours.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane and tropical storm conditions and a dangerous storm
surge are expected to continue over portions of the northwestern
Bahamas tonight, where a Hurricane Warning remains in effect.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are expected across portions of the coast
of southeast and east-central Florida tonight, where a Hurricane 
Warning is in effect.  Tropical storm conditions will continue along 
the east coast of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina within the 
warning areas into Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected 
to begin along the west coast of Florida tonight and Thursday.
 
3. A dangerous storm surge is expected along much of the east coast
of Florida, portions of coastal Georgia, and the Florida Big Bend
along the Gulf coast.  The storm surge will be accompanied by large
and damaging waves along the Atlantic coast.  Residents in the
warning area should listen to advice given by local officials.
 
4. Do not focus on the exact track of Nicole since it is a large
storm with hazards extending well to the north of the center,
outside of the forecast cone.  These hazards will affect much of the
Florida peninsula and portions of the southeast United States.
 
5. Nicole will produce heavy rainfall tonight into Thursday across 
the Florida Peninsula. Flash and urban flooding will be possible 
across portions of the Florida Peninsula along with renewed river 
flooding on the St. Johns River. Isolated flash, urban, and small 
stream flooding will also be possible on Friday in the Southeast 
through the southern and central Appalachians, including the Blue 
Ridge Mountains, and extending northward through west-central 
Pennsylvania into western New York by Friday night into Saturday.
