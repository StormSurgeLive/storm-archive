Post-Tropical Cyclone Bonnie Discussion Number  49
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
200 PM PDT Sat Jul 09 2022
 
Bonnie has now been devoid of deep convection for over 12 hours,
which means it has degenerated into a post-tropical low and this
will be the last advisory.  An ASCAT pass around 1800 UTC showed
maximum winds between 35 and 40 kt, so with the assumption of some 
continued weakening, the advisory intensity is 35 kt.  Additional 
gradual weakening is anticipated over the next day or so while the
convection-less low moves quickly westward between 15-18 kt over
waters of 23-24 degrees Celsius and further into a drier, more
stable air mass.  Global model surface fields indicate that
Bonnie's circulation should open up into a trough by Sunday night,
and dissipation is now shown in the forecast at 36 hours.
 
For additional information on the post-tropical low please see High
Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service...under
AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI and WMO header FZPN02 KWBC.

Tropical Storm Darby Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052022
900 PM MDT Sat Jul 09 2022
 
Darby is a small tropical cyclone. Conventional satellite data and 
passive microwave imagery indicate its inner core convection has 
waned a bit this evening, but it has maintained some curved 
convective bands around its center and signs of healthy upper-level 
outflow. Hopefully, scatterometer data becomes available overnight 
to better assess its current intensity. A blend of the subjective 
Dvorak estimates from SAB (T2.5/35 kt) and TAFB (T3.0/45 kt) 
supports an initial intensity of 40 kt for this advisory.

Environmental conditions appear quite favorable for Darby to 
strengthen during the next couple of days or so. Deep-layer shear is 
expected to remain weak (less than 10 kt) as the small storm moves 
over SSTs of 28-28.5 degrees Celsius within a moist mid-level 
environment. If the inner-core structure of Darby improves 
overnight, there is some potential for significant intensification. 
In fact, the latest ECMWF SHIPS-RII guidance shows a 41 percent 
chance of Darby strengthening by 55 kt during the next 48 h. The 
official NHC intensity forecast still lies on the higher end of the 
guidance envelope through early next week, close to the SHIPS 
guidance and just slightly above the HFIP corrected consensus 
approach (HCCA). By 72 h, the storm is forecast to reach cooler 
waters and encounter a drier environment, which should induce 
weakening that continues through the remainder of the period.  

Darby continues to move quickly westward, or 280/15 kt. A deep-layer 
ridge centered over the southwestern United States is expected to 
steer Darby quickly westward over the next couple of days. Once 
Darby reaches a weakness in the ridge by the middle of next week, 
the cyclone is forecast to slow down a bit and turn toward the 
west-northwest on days 4-5. The official NHC track forecast is very 
similar to the previous one, and it remains close to the TVCE and 
HCCA aids.
