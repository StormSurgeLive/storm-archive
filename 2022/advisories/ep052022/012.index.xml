Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 PM PDT Mon Jul 11 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Darby, located more than 1200 miles west-southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southern Mexico:<br/>
A trough of low pressure located a few hundred miles south of the <br/>
coasts of Guatemala and El Salvador is producing some disorganized <br/>
showers. Environmental conditions appear conducive for gradual <br/>
development over the next several days, and this system is likely to <br/>
become a tropical depression by late this week. The disturbance is <br/>
forecast to drift westward for the next day or two, then move <br/>
west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph later this week while remaining <br/>
offshore of the southern and southwestern coasts of Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Darby Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052022
1100 PM HST Mon Jul 11 2022
 
Darby has remained an impressive, compact hurricane with an 
annular structure through the night.  After a brief period of 
eyewall warming, the cold cloud tops surrounding the clear eye now 
range between -60 and -70 degrees Celsius. The initial intensity is 
held at 120 kt, which is above the subjective Dvorak estimates of 
102 kt and 115 kt based on the current presentation in satellite 
imagery.

The hurricane is expected to remain in a relatively conducive 
environment for the next 12 hours or so.  Beyond that time frame, 
Darby should encounter cooler waters and increasingly dry air 
which will likely begin a general weakening trend.  The system is 
expected to rapidly weaken and become post-tropical when the 
vertical wind shear increases significantly in a few days.  The 
official intensity forecast closely follows the previous advisory 
and is slightly above the model consensus aids in the near-term 
forecast.

Darby is moving westward at about 15 kt.  A mid-level ridge to the 
north should continue to steer the hurricane westward to 
west-northwestward into the central Pacific basin.  As the system 
weakens to a more shallow circulation, it is expected to turn 
westward following the low-level trade winds.  The NHC track 
forecast is slightly south of the previous prediction but is still 
north of the model consensus.
