At 1200 AM HST (1000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Darby was located
near latitude 14.5 North, longitude 122.2 West. Darby is moving
toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h).   A westward motion is
expected to continue for the next couple of days, followed by a
gradual turn toward the west-northwest later this week.

Recent satellite images indicate that the maximum sustained winds

hurricane later today.  A weakening trend is expected to begin 
later this week.

Darby is a small hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend
outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the center and
