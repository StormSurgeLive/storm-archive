DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM HST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Darby was located
near latitude 15.4 North, longitude 136.7 West. Darby is moving
toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h). A west- 
northwestward motion at a similar forward speed is expected through 
tonight followed by a turn toward the west on Thursday or Thursday 
night. Darby is forecast to then continue westward through the end 
of the week.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 110 mph (175 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Short-term fluctuations in intensity are 
possible through tonight. Darby is forecast to resume weakening by 
late tonight or on Thursday. The system will likely become a 
tropical storm by Thursday night and become post-tropical by Friday 
night.

Recent satellite wind data shows that Darby remains a small 
hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles  
(20 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend 
outward up to 60 miles (95 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 971 mb (28.68 inches).
