Tropical Storm Estelle Advisory Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062022
1000 PM CDT Fri Jul 15 2022
 
...TROPICAL STORM ESTELLE FORMS A FEW HUNDRED MILES OFF THE COAST
OF SOUTHWESTERN MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1000 PM CDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...13.2N 102.0W
ABOUT 290 MI...470 KM SSW OF ACAPULCO MEXICO
ABOUT 430 MI...690 KM SSE OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1006 MB...29.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Estelle was
located near latitude 13.2 North, longitude 102.0 West.  Estelle is
moving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A turn toward 
the west-northwest is expected by Saturday morning, with that 
heading at a similar forward speed continuing through late Monday.  
Estelle is forecast to move parallel to but well offshore the coast 
of southwestern Mexico.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast during 
the next few days, and Estelle could become a hurricane by Saturday 
night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Estelle are expected to begin affecting
portions of the southwestern coast of Mexico late Saturday and
will spread northward to the coast of west-central Mexico and the
southern Baja California peninsula Sunday and Monday.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

Tropical Storm Estelle Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062022
1000 PM CDT Fri Jul 15 2022
 
A series of microwave images since the last advisory show that the 
depression's low-level structure has become better defined, with 
the center nearly surrounded by a cyan ring in the 37-GHz channel.  
In addition, a tight band of deep convection with cloud tops colder 
than -80 degrees Celsius has been persisting near the center.  
Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB are a consensus T2.5, so the 
depression is upgraded to Tropical Storm Estelle with 35-kt winds.  
However, this could be a conservative estimate given the improved 
structure, and objective intensity estimates are running slightly 
higher.

The initial motion is a little faster toward the northwest, or 
310/9 kt, but satellite location fixes suggest the storm is 
beginning to turn toward the west-northwest as expected.  Mid-level 
ridging is forecast to be entrenched over the southwestern United 
States for the next 5 days, which should steer Estelle on a general 
west-northwestward heading for the entirety of the forecast period. 
There is not much spread among the track guidance, at least 
cross-track wise, but it is notable that the GFS solution is a bit 
slower than the other reliable guidance.  The NHC track forecast is 
just a little slower than the consensus aids to account for that 
slower scenario, and this update is not too different from the 
previous forecast.

Despite Estelle's improved structure, a sharp edge on the eastern 
side of the deep convection in infrared imagery suggests there is 
still some shear affecting the cyclone, and SHIPS is showing 10-15 
kt of deep-layer shear out of the northeast.  The GFS and ECMWF 
versions of SHIPS differ a bit on when that shear will decrease, 
although both versions show Estelle benefiting from high values of 
upper-level divergence for the next 24-48 hours.  Combined with 
high oceanic heat content and the cyclone's well-defined low-level 
structure, rapid intensification (RI) is a realistic possibility, 
and some guidance is showing a 50/50 chance of RI during the next 
24 hours.  The NHC official intensity forecast hedges on the high 
side of the guidance but stops just short of showing explicit RI 
given the uncertainties on how much vertical shear will decrease.  
Continued strengthening could occur through day 3, but colder 
waters are likely to induce weakening on days 4 and 5.
