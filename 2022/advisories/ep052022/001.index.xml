For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Bonnie, located several hundred miles west-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southwestern Mexico:<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity continues to show signs of <br/>
organization in association with an area of low pressure located <br/>
several hundred miles southwest of the southwestern coast of Mexico. <br/>
If these trends continue, a tropical depression could form as soon <br/>
as this afternoon. This system is forecast to move generally <br/>
westward at 15 to 20 mph across the central part of the eastern  <br/>
North Pacific basin over the next several days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure is forecast to form south of the southern <br/>
coast of Mexico by early next week.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
expected to be conducive for some gradual development of this system <br/>
next week while it moves generally westward at 10 to 15 mph, <br/>
remaining offshore of the southern coast of Mexico. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>

Post-Tropical Cyclone Bonnie Discussion Number  49
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
200 PM PDT Sat Jul 09 2022
 
Bonnie has now been devoid of deep convection for over 12 hours,
which means it has degenerated into a post-tropical low and this
will be the last advisory.  An ASCAT pass around 1800 UTC showed
maximum winds between 35 and 40 kt, so with the assumption of some 
continued weakening, the advisory intensity is 35 kt.  Additional 
gradual weakening is anticipated over the next day or so while the
convection-less low moves quickly westward between 15-18 kt over
waters of 23-24 degrees Celsius and further into a drier, more
stable air mass.  Global model surface fields indicate that
Bonnie's circulation should open up into a trough by Sunday night,
and dissipation is now shown in the forecast at 36 hours.
 
For additional information on the post-tropical low please see High
Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service...under
AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI and WMO header FZPN02 KWBC.

Tropical Storm Darby Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052022
300 PM MDT Sat Jul 09 2022
 
The area of low pressure we have been monitoring well offshore the 
southwestern coast of Mexico has become much better organized on 
conventional satellite imagery throughout the day. The current 
structure on visible satellite imagery consists of a well-defined 
curved band to the north and west with what already appears to be a 
small central dense overcast forming near the estimated center. In 
fact, there is already a small dimple beginning to appear on the 
last few frames of visible satellite imagery which could be the 
initial indications that a small inner core is forming. While C-band 
scatterometer imagery (ASCAT-B/C) largely missed the small storm 
earlier today, there was a KU-band scatterometer late this morning 
that had enough non-rain contaminated vectors to indicate the system 
likely possesses a closed circulation. The subjective Dvorak 
classifications at 1800 UTC from TAFB/SAB were both T2.0/30 kt, but 
given the continued improvement on satellite imagery since then, 
advisories are being initiated on Tropical Storm Darby at this time, 
with winds of 35 kt.

The current motion of Darby is just north of due west at 280/14 kt. 
A general due westward motion is expected over the next 24-48 h as 
the small storm is situated on the south side of a expansive 
deep-layer subtropical ridge centered over the southwestern United 
States. Towards the end of the forecast period, Darby will be 
approaching a weakness in this ridge, which may allow the storm to 
start gaining latitude after 48 hours. The initial track forecast of 
Darby is very close to the reliable track consensus aids, though is 
just a shade further north, in deference to both the GFS and ECMWF 
forecasts.

The structure of Darby is quite impressive for a system that has 
only recently formed. In addition, both the GFS- and ECMWF-based 
SHIPS guidance indicate that the small storm will remain in a low 
shear (under 10 kt), warm sea-surface temperatures (above 28C), and 
sufficient mid-level moisture for the next 2-3 days. Assuming an 
inner core forms relatively soon, this environment likely favors 
quick intensification. In fact, the ECMWF SHIPS-RII guidance 
indicates a 44 percent chance of a 25 kt or higher increase in 
intensity over the next 24 hours. While the current NHC intensity 
forecast will not go that high quite yet, it does make Darby a 
hurricane in only 36 h. This intensity forecast is on the upper-end 
of the guidance envelope, but not far off the HFIP corrected 
consensus approach (HCCA) that is also near hurricane intensity in 
36 h. Late in the forecast, Darby will likely encounter cooler ocean 
waters and much higher shear, which should begin to induce weakening 
by the end of the forecast period.
