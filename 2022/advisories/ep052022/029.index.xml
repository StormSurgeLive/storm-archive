WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Estelle was
located near latitude 13.6 North, longitude 103.1 West. Estelle is
moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h) and this
general motion is expected to continue during the next several days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h)
with higher gusts. Continued strengthening is expected during the
next day or two, and Estelle is forecast to become a hurricane by
tonight.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).

 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Estelle are expected to begin affecting
portions of the southwestern coast of Mexico later today and
will spread northward to the coast of west-central Mexico and the
southern Baja California peninsula Sunday and Monday.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Estelle Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062022
400 AM CDT Sat Jul 16 2022
 
Estelle has become much better organized during the past several
hours. Geostationary satellite and microwave images indicate that
deep convection has increased near the center and an inner core has
formed. An ASCAT pass from around 05Z showed maximum winds of around
40 kt, but since Estelle is a compact tropical cyclone it likely did
not resolve its peak winds. The Dvorak classifications at 06Z from
TAFB, SAB, and CIMSS at the University of Wisconsin were all 3.0/45
kt. Since Estelle has continued to organize since then, the initial
intensity is increased to 50 kt for this advisory, in line with the
latest automated values from CIMSS.
 
The tropical storm seems poised to strengthen further as Estelle is
expected to remain in generally favorable atmospheric and oceanic
conditions. The SHIPS Rapid Intensification (RI) Index shows about
50 percent of RI occurring, and given the environment and
well-defined structure, the NHC forecast now calls for RI to occur
during the next 24 hours. After that time, increasing shear should
cause the intensity to plateau in the 36-72 hour period, followed by
weakening when Estelle moves over cooler waters and into a drier air
mass. This forecast is a little higher than the previous one, and
lies near the high end of the model guidance.
 
Estelle is moving west-northwestward at 11 kt. A mid-level ridge
centered over the southwestern U.S. is expected to gradually build
westward, which should keep Estelle on a general west-northwest
track during the next several days. The models have shifted a
little to the south and are faster this cycle, and the NHC track
forecast has been adjusted accordingly. This prediction still lies
on the northern side of the guidance envelope at days 4 and 5.
