1100 AM PDT Tue Jul 12 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Darby, located more than 1400 miles west-southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure has developed a few hundred miles south <br/>
of the coasts of Guatemala and El Salvador, and continues to produce <br/>
a broad area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear conducive for gradual development <br/>
over the next several days, and this system is likely to become a <br/>
tropical depression towards the end of this week into the weekend. <br/>
The disturbance is forecast to drift westward for the next day or <br/>
so, then move west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph later this week <br/>
while remaining offshore of the southern and southwestern coasts of <br/>
Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Darby Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052022
1100 AM HST Tue Jul 12 2022
 
Darby remains a small and formidable hurricane, although there are 
some subtle changes in its convective pattern.  The hurricane looks 
a little more asymmetric in infrared imagery, favoring the western 
side, and a black ring on the Dvorak enhancement curve (colder than 
-63 degrees Celsius) has struggled to stay wrapped around the eye.
Subjective Dvorak Current Intensity numbers have gradually fallen
closer to objective numbers, and the range of estimated intensities
is now from 90-102 kt.  Darby's current intensity is therefore
lowered to 100 kt.
 
Darby lost a little bit of latitude since overnight, but the
12-hour average motion remains westward, or 270/15 kt.  The
hurricane should maintain a westward motion for another 24 hours
but then take on a slightly slower west-northwestward track from
36-48 hours as it moves toward a break in the subtropical ridge.
After 48 hours, a filling of the break and a weaker Darby should
cause the motion to turn back toward the west, continuing through
dissipation in 4-5 days.  There is very little spread among the
track guidance, and the only noteworthy point is that the ECMWF and
HCCA aid are faster than much of the other models.  The updated
NHC forecast is generally on top of the previous forecast but just
a little faster during the first 36 hours, hedging toward the ECMWF
and HCCA solutions.
 
Vertical shear over Darby is expected to be 10 kt or less during
the next 36 hours, but marginal sea surface temperatures of 26
degrees Celsius are likely to foster additional gradual weakening
during that time.  Southwesterly to westerly shear then increases
in earnest to 20-30 kt on days 2 and 3, which should induce more 
significant weakening.  The intensity guidance is in very good 
agreement, and Darby could weaken below hurricane strength soon 
after 48 hours, become post-tropical by day 4, and degenerate into a 
trough by day 5.  Some of the global model guidance suggest that the
post-tropical phase and dissipation could occur even sooner than
indicated in the official forecast.
