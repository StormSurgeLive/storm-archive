500 PM PDT Mon Jul 11 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Darby, located more than 1100 miles west-southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southern Mexico:<br/>
A trough of low pressure located several hundred miles south of the <br/>
coasts of Guatemala and El Salvador is producing some disorganized <br/>
showers. Environmental conditions appear conducive for gradual <br/>
development over the next several days, and this system is likely to <br/>
become a tropical depression by late this week. The disturbance is <br/>
forecast to drift westward for the next day or two, then move <br/>
west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph later this week while remaining <br/>
offshore of the southern and southwestern coasts of Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Darby Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052022
500 PM HST Mon Jul 11 2022
 
Darby has been generally steady in strength during the past several 
hours and remains a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. It maintains a classic major hurricane 
structure with well-defined outflow in all quadrants, a symmetric 
cloud pattern, and a distinct small eye (less than 10 n mi in 
diameter). Satellite images indicate that the eye has become even 
more defined over the past few hours, but deep convection has been 
weakening a little to the west of the eye. All of the satellite 
intensity estimates have plateaued and suggest that Darby still has 
peak winds of around 120 kt. Although the hurricane is very 
powerful, it is quite compact with tropical-storm-force winds 
estimated to only extend 50 n mi from the center.
 
The hurricane has been moving westward, or 275 degrees, at 15 kt. A
general west to west-northwest motion at a slightly slower pace is
expected during the next few days as Darby continues to move on the
south or southwest side of a mid-level ridge, taking the system into
the central Pacific basin in 60-72 hours. After that time, the
weakening system is expected to be steered due westward by the
low-level flow. There are some speed differences in the models, but
they generally show the same theme. This forecast lies near the
middle of the guidance envelope, and roughly between the GFS and
ECMWF models.
 
Darby is likely near its peak intensity. The major hurricane will
be moving over progressively cooler waters and crossing the 26
degree C isotherm in about 24 hours. In addition, Darby will be
moving into a drier airmass, which should accelerate the weakening
trend. In a few days when Darby is over the central Pacific, a mid-
to upper-level trough should induce strong westerly shear and cause
Darby to become a post-tropical cyclone in about 4 days. The NHC
intensity forecast is similar to the previous one and fairly close
to the IVCN and HCCA consensus models.
