Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 AM PDT Mon Jul 11 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Darby, located more than 1000 miles west-southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southern Mexico:<br/>
An area of disturbed weather associated with a trough of low <br/>
pressure has formed well south of the coasts of Guatemala and El <br/>
Salvador.  Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive <br/>
for gradual development over the next several days, and this system <br/>
is likely to become a tropical depression by late this week. The <br/>
disturbance is forecast to drift westward through Tuesday, then <br/>
move west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph later this week while <br/>
remaining offshore of the southern coast of Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM HST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Darby was located 
near latitude 14.7 North, longitude 125.0 West. Darby is moving

on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Darby is expected to 
peak in intensity in the next day or so and then begin a weakening 
trend by midweek.
 
Darby remains a small system, with hurricane-force winds only 
extending outward 10 miles (20 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extending outward up to 60 miles (95 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 954 mb (28.17 inches).

Hurricane Darby Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052022
500 AM HST Mon Jul 11 2022
 
What a difference 24 hours makes! Darby has been rapidly 
intensifying for the last 12-18 hours, with the eye continuing to 
clear out on GOES-17 infrared satellite imagery surrounded by a 
thick ring of cold -65 to -75C cloud top temperatures. It is clear 
that the tropical cyclone was able to mix out the remaining dry air 
near its center last night and the last several microwave passes 
from GMI at 0732 UTC and AMSR2 at 0959 UTC have an impressive 
presentation with a thick ring of eyewall convection on the 89-GHz 
channel. Subjective Dvorak satellite estimates from TAFB and SAB are 
constrained due to Dvorak rules, but their data-T numbers were both 
T5.5/102 kt. The most recent CI number from the UW-CIMSS objective 
Advanced Dvorak Technique (ADT) was at T6.0/115 kt. Favoring the 
higher ADT estimate more, the current intensity is set to 110 kt, 
though this could be conservative.
 
There are no obvious signs currently that would prevent Darby from 
intensifying further. There are few indications that an eyewall 
replacement cycle is imminent from the earlier microwave imagery and 
SHIPS guidance indicates the storm remains in a very low shear 
(near 5 kt) environment and over sufficently warm sea-surface 
temperatures (27-28 C). Thus, rapid intensification is forecast to 
continue over the next 12 h, and the NHC foreast intensity peaks 
Darby at 120 kt, which matches the latest ECMWF- and GFS-based 
SHIPS which have correctly been on the high side of the guidance 
envelope. After 36 hours, Darby is expected to move into sub 26C 
SSTs, and westerly shear is forecast to increase between 48-72 
hours. Thus, the small vortex of Darby could weaken rapidly after 36 
hours, with the latest intensity forecast still making the system a 
post-tropical cyclone at the end of the forecast period.
 
Darby is continuing westward along at the same general speed and 
heading at 270/13 kt, steered primarily by a mid-level ridge 
centered to its north. The hurricane is expected to approach a 
slight weakness in the ridge after 24 hours, allowing the cyclone to 
gradually shift to a more west-northwestward track between 36-72 
hours. However, by the end of the forecast period, as Darby becomes 
shallow vortex, its track will likely bend back westward as the 
low-level trade wind flow becomes dominant. The latest track 
forecast is not all that different from the previous one, choosing 
to remain close to a consensus of the GFS and ECMWF forecasts (GEFX) 
which remains just a bit north of the consensus aids HCCA and TVCE, 
which are influenced by the further south tracks of the weaker 
HWRF/HMON/UKMET guidance.
