...BARRING ANY NEW THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT, IVETTE SHOULD BECOME A
REMNANT LOW LATER TODAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM MDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.2N 114.3W
ABOUT 485 MI...780 KM SW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WSW OR 245 DEGREES AT 2 MPH...4 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1006 MB...29.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Ivette
was located near latitude 17.2 North, longitude 114.3 West.  Ivette
has been nearly stationary for the past few hours, but since 
yesterday afternoon it has generally moved toward the west-southwest 
near 2 mph (4 km/h).  A slow westward to west-northwestward motion 
is expected during the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual weakening is forecast, and if new thunderstorm activity
does not develop, Ivette is likely to become a remnant low later
today.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.

Tropical Depression Ivette Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102022
300 AM MDT Tue Aug 16 2022
 
A burst of deep convection that developed in the western part of
Ivette's circulation last evening has since been sheared away,
leaving a swirl of low- to mid-level clouds.  Despite the loss of
convection, a blend of TAFB's Dvorak CI number (2.0) with UW-CIMSS
ADT and SATCON estimates supports maintaining 30 kt for this
advisory.  It's possible that some convection could redevelop since
Ivette remains over warm waters of about 28 degrees Celsius.
However, strong deep-layer easterly shear of about 25 kt and a
relatively dry atmosphere are likely to cause any new convection to
be short lived and on the less-than-organized side of the spectrum.
Therefore, barring any surprises, Ivette is expected to degenerate
into a remnant low later today, and gradually spin down during the
next few days.  Global models are in generally good agreement that
the remnant low should open up into a trough in about 4 days.
 
With the development and dissipation of recent convection, Ivette's
movement has been erratic, and it's actually been nearly stationary 
for the past few hours.  Since yesterday afternoon, however, the 
center has generally moved west-southwestward (245 degrees) at about 
2 kt.  The steering flow around the depression is weak at the 
moment, and there is greater-than-normal spread in the track 
guidance.  In general, though, the remnant low is expected to move 
slowly westward to west-northwestward at 5 kt or less until 
dissipation.  The new NHC track has been shifted southward from the 
previous forecast, mainly to account for Ivette's recent motion.
