Tropical Storm Martin Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162022
1100 PM AST Tue Nov 01 2022
 
Deep convection is gradually increasing near the center of Martin 
and banding features are becoming better established on the system's 
north side. Even though the core of Martin looks tropical in nature, 
the storm still has some subtropical characteristics with frontal 
features nearby. The latest Dvorak estimates were unchanged from 
earlier, so the initial wind speed remains 50 kt for this advisory.
 
Martin is moving just south of due east, with the latest initial 
motion estimated to be 100/9 kt. The storm should begin to turn 
northeastward on Wednesday as a mid- to upper-level trough currently 
off the northeast U.S. approaches the system. A stronger mid- to 
upper-level trough near Atlantic Canada should help accelerate 
Martin northeastward by Wednesday night and Thursday before this 
trough interacts and merges with the storm Thursday night and 
Friday. After the two systems merge, Martin will likely slow down 
and move eastward over the northeastern Atlantic. Little change was 
made to the previous track forecast during the first 72 hours, but 
notable eastward adjustments were made at days 4 and 5 to be in 
better agreement with the latest model guidance.
 
Although Martin is over relatively cool 25 degree C waters and 
headed over even cooler SSTs during the next couple of days, 
unstable conditions and upper-level diffluence along with 
non-tropical forcing should cause significant strengthening during 
the next day or two. Martin is forecast to become a powerful 
extratropical low in about 36 hours when it merges with the strong 
trough off Atlantic Canada. After that time, the models show a slow 
weakening trend. The NHC intensity forecast is in line with the 
majority of the guidance and is fairly similar to the previous 
forecast.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lisa was
located near latitude 16.7 North, longitude 84.0 West. Lisa is
moving toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h). This general motion
with some decrease in forward speed is forecast during the next
couple of days. On the forecast track, the center of Lisa will move
near or over the Bay Islands of Honduras early Wednesday, move near
Belize late on Wednesday and over southeastern Mexico on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Further strengthening is expected, and Lisa is forecast to 
become a hurricane overnight over the northwestern Caribbean Sea and 
continue to intensify on Wednesday as it approaches Belize.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure of 996 mb (29.41 inches) is based on 
data from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the Bay Islands of
Honduras beginning early Wednesday and along the coast of Belize
Wednesday afternoon. Tropical storm conditions are expected to
begin along the northern coast of Honduras within the Tropical
Storm Warning area tonight and in Guatemala and Yucatan on
Wednesday. Hurricane conditions are possible in eastern Yucatan on
Wednesday afternoon.
 
RAINFALL: Through Thursday evening, Lisa is expected to produce
rainfall amounts of:
 
* 4 to 6 inches with local amounts to 10 inches across Belize, the
Bay Islands of Honduras, northern Guatemala and the southeast
portion of the Mexican state of Chiapas.
* 2 to 4 inches with local amounts to 6 inches across the far
southeastern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula, Northern Honduras,
and central Guatemala
* 1 inch with local amounts to 2 inches across portions of the
Cayman Islands and eastern Nicaragua.
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding conditions primarily
across Belize into northern Guatemala, the southeast portion of the
Mexican state of Chiapas and the far southeast portion of the
Yucatan peninsula.
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will likely raise water levels by as
much as 4 to 7 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate
coast of Belize in areas of onshore winds, with 2 to 4 feet
possible within the Hurricane Watch area in eastern Yucatan and 1
to 3 feet for the Bay Islands of Honduras. Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and damaging waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lisa are expected to affect Jamaica,
the Cayman Islands, and portions of Central America during the next 
couple of days. These swells could cause life-threatening surf and 
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local 
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Tropical Storm Lisa Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Tropical Storm Lisa Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
500 PM EDT Tue Nov 01 2022
 
Satellite images indicate that Lisa continues to become better 
organized with a central dense overcast feature forming along with 
more curved banding features.  Dvorak estimates have increased as 
well, and the current wind speed is set to 55 kt, closest to the 
TAFB fix and near an average of the available values.  Two Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft, an Air Force C-130 and a NOAA P-3, should be 
investigating Lisa this evening to get more in situ data. 

Conditions look ripe for continued intensification.  Other than some 
lingering dry air, Lisa is moving over very warm waters, in low 
shear, and has a small radius-of-maximum winds and an expanding 
outflow pattern.  These factors suggest a pretty notable chance of 
rapid intensification, and the SHIPS index shows basically a coin 
flip chance of a 25-kt wind speed increase within 24 hours.  
Additionally, the regional hurricane models HWRF and HMON show Lisa 
becoming a category 2 hurricane before landfall.  The new NHC 
forecast is similar to those models (note that further 
intensification is possible between the 24h forecast and Belize 
landfall) and a bit higher than the corrected-consensus guidance.  
 
Lisa continues moving just north of due west or 280/13 kt.  This 
westward track with some reduction in forward speed is anticipated 
due to the storm staying south of a ridge over the Gulf of Mexico.  
While the synoptic pattern is about the same as before, a 
vertically deeper Lisa is more likely to feel upper-level 
southeasterly flow and will probably not lose any latitude near 
landfall.  Thus, the latest forecast has been adjusted about 15-20 
n mi north of the previous one with the model guidance nudging in 
that direction.  

With the northward adjustment and a stronger cyclone in the 
forecast, more of the models are showing Lisa making it across 
Central America and Mexico as a weak tropical cyclone into the 
extreme southern Bay of Campeche on Friday.  Although the new NHC 
forecast now indicates this likelihood, Lisa isn't expected to 
be a significant event there due to stronger shear, and 
re-intensification is not indicated in the official forecast.  
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. There is potential for a life-threatening storm surge near where
the center of Lisa crosses the coast of Belize and for the southern
portions of the Yucatan Peninsula starting Wednesday afternoon.

2. Hurricane conditions are expected in the Bay Islands of Honduras
early Wednesday and along the coast of Belize by Wednesday 
afternoon.  Hurricane conditions are possible in eastern
Yucatan in the Hurricane Watch area Wednesday afternoon.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
north coast of Honduras and Guatemala beginning tonight into
Wednesday, and over the eastern Yucatan Peninsula in the Tropical
Storm Warning areas beginning Wednesday afternoon.
 
4. Localized flash flooding is expected across portions of Belize,
the Bay Islands of Honduras, northern Guatemala and the southeast
portion of the Mexican state of Chiapas starting tonight through
Thursday.
