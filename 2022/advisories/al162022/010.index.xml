Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Thu Nov 3 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems: <br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Lisa, located inland over southeastern Mexico, and on <br/>
Hurricane Martin, located over the central North Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
East of Bermuda:<br/>
A weak non-tropical area of low pressure located a few hundred <br/>
miles east of Bermuda continues to produce a few disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms. Any tropical or subtropical development <br/>
of this disturbance should be slow to occur during the next few days <br/>
as it moves slowly southward today and then turns westward by the <br/>
weekend. The system is forecast to merge with a larger low pressure <br/>
area developing to its southwest by the end of the weekend and <br/>
further development is not anticipated at that time.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
A large non-tropical low pressure system is expected to develop this <br/>
weekend across the northeastern Caribbean sea and southwestern <br/>
Atlantic. The system is expected to initially be very broad and <br/>
disorganized, but environmental conditions could support gradual <br/>
subtropical or tropical development beginning early next week while <br/>
it moves generally northwestward or westward over the southwestern <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

BULLETIN
Post-Tropical Cyclone Martin Advisory Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162022
900 PM GMT Thu Nov 03 2022
 
...POST-TROPICAL MARTIN CAUSING STRONG WINDS AND HAZARDOUS SEAS
ACROSS A LARGE PORTION OF THE CENTRAL NORTH ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM GMT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...50.5N 34.5W
ABOUT 940 MI...1510 KM NNW OF THE AZORES
ABOUT 885 MI...1425 KM ENE OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...80 MPH...130 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 20 DEGREES AT 58 MPH...93 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...950 MB...28.06 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Martin
was located near latitude 50.5 North, longitude 34.5 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the north-northeast near 58
mph (93 km/h). A slower northward to north-northwestward motion is 
expected tonight, followed by a much slower turn toward the east on 
Friday. An eastward to east-southeastward motion is then 
anticipated into the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Martin's peak sustained winds will slowly decrease over the 
next few days, but it will continue to produce strong winds over a 
very large area well into the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 520
miles (835 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 950 mb (28.06 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by post-tropical Martin will likely spread 
across a large portion of the high-latitude North Atlantic basin, 
affecting portions of Atlantic Canada, the Azores, and the Atlantic 
coast of Europe by the weekend. These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.

<title>Post-Tropical Cyclone Martin Forecast Discussion Number 10</title>

Post-Tropical Cyclone Martin Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162022
900 PM GMT Thu Nov 03 2022
 
ASCAT-C data that was not available until after the issuance of the 
last advisory, but was valid at 1317 UTC, showed that Martin likely 
became frontal earlier today and the system no longer has a 
well-defined circulation. In addition, both TAFB and SAB evaluated 
the system as extratropical at 1800 UTC. Therefore, Martin is now 
classified as post-tropical and this will be the last NHC advisory.
 
While Martin does not currently appear to have a well-defined 
center, the powerful post-tropical cyclone is expected to redevelop 
a well-defined center as it occludes over the next 12 to 24 h. 
Martin is moving at a remarkable clip of 50 kt, but should begin to 
slow down soon and turn north-northwestward during the next few 
hours. After that, the cyclone is forecast to move relatively slowly 
on Friday before picking up speed toward the east-southeast or east 
through the early weekend. Martin's maximum winds are still forecast 
to slowly decrease over the next few days, however the combination 
of Martin and other non-tropical low pressure systems are still 
expected to produce hazardous wind and seas over a very wide area of 
the North Atlantic for the next couple of days. 

Additional information on marine hazards can be found in High Seas 
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, the UK Met 
Office, and Meteo France. Links to each product are provided below.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Lisa
was located inland near latitude 18.0 North, longitude 91.0 West. 
The depression is moving toward the west near 10 mph (17 km/h), and 
this general motion is expected to continue through tonight followed 
by a turn toward the northwest.  On the forecast track, the center 
of Lisa will continue to move over southeastern Mexico today and
tonight, and move into the Bay of Campeche on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast, and Lisa is
not expected to re-intensify when the center reaches the Bay of
Campeche.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Lisa is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 4 to 6
inches with local amounts to 10 inches across the Mexican states of
Tabasco, northwestern Chiapas, and far eastern Veracruz.  Rainfall
is expected to continue to diminish across Belize, northern
Guatemala and the Yucatan Peninsula today.  Additional rainfall
totals of 1 to 2 inches are possible across these areas.
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding conditions, especially
across portions of southeastern Mexico
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Tropical Depression Lisa Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
1000 AM CDT Thu Nov 03 2022
 
Lisa has been inland for about 18 hours, and there are no
observations of tropical-storm-force winds.  Also, using a standard
rate of decay over land shows the cyclone weakening below tropical
storm intensity by now.  Therefore the system is being downgraded
to a tropical depression on this advisory.
 
Satellite fixes and observations from the Sabancuy, Mexico, radar
indicate that the cyclone continues moving mainly westward and
the initial motion estimate is 280/9 kt.  Over the next couple of
days, Lisa should gradually turn to the northwest and north while
moving along the southwestern periphery of a mid-level high.  In
2-3 days, the increasingly shallow cyclone is expected to meander
over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico within a weak low-level flow.
The official track forecast is similar to the previous one and
follows the multi-model consensus guidance, TVCA.
 
Lisa is forecast to move over the waters of the Bay of Campeche in
24 hours.  Global models show strong southerly to
south-southwesterly upper-level winds across most of the Gulf of
Mexico during the next few days.  The associated strong vertical
shear should prevent re-intensification.  Global model simulations
also show Lisa's mid- to upper-level vorticity maximum being sheared
north-northeastward into the northern Gulf while the low-level
circulation remains over the Bay of Campeche.  The official
intensity forecast, like the previous ones, shows the system
degenerating into a remnant low in 3 days.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Localized flash flooding is expected across portions of southeast
Mexico.
