Tropical Storm Martin Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162022
1100 PM AST Tue Nov 01 2022
 
Deep convection is gradually increasing near the center of Martin 
and banding features are becoming better established on the system's 
north side. Even though the core of Martin looks tropical in nature, 
the storm still has some subtropical characteristics with frontal 
features nearby. The latest Dvorak estimates were unchanged from 
earlier, so the initial wind speed remains 50 kt for this advisory.
 
Martin is moving just south of due east, with the latest initial 
motion estimated to be 100/9 kt. The storm should begin to turn 
northeastward on Wednesday as a mid- to upper-level trough currently 
off the northeast U.S. approaches the system. A stronger mid- to 
upper-level trough near Atlantic Canada should help accelerate 
Martin northeastward by Wednesday night and Thursday before this 
trough interacts and merges with the storm Thursday night and 
Friday. After the two systems merge, Martin will likely slow down 
and move eastward over the northeastern Atlantic. Little change was 
made to the previous track forecast during the first 72 hours, but 
notable eastward adjustments were made at days 4 and 5 to be in 
better agreement with the latest model guidance.
 
Although Martin is over relatively cool 25 degree C waters and 
headed over even cooler SSTs during the next couple of days, 
unstable conditions and upper-level diffluence along with 
non-tropical forcing should cause significant strengthening during 
the next day or two. Martin is forecast to become a powerful 
extratropical low in about 36 hours when it merges with the strong 
trough off Atlantic Canada. After that time, the models show a slow 
weakening trend. The NHC intensity forecast is in line with the 
majority of the guidance and is fairly similar to the previous 
forecast.

Interests elsewhere in Central America and the Yucatan Peninsula of
Mexico should monitor the progress of Lisa.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lisa was
located near latitude 17.1 North, longitude 86.0 West. Lisa is
moving toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h).  This general motion
with some decrease in forward speed is forecast during the next
couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of Lisa will move
near or north of the Bay Islands of Honduras this morning, make 
landfall in Belize later today, and then cross northern Guatemala 
into southeastern Mexico by Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is expected, and Lisa is forecast to become a 
hurricane during the next several hours over the northwestern 
Caribbean Sea and continue to intensify today as it approaches 
Belize.  Weakening is expected after the center makes landfall.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the Bay Islands of
Honduras in the next several hours and along the coast of Belize and
the southeastern Yucatan this afternoon. Tropical storm conditions
are expected to begin along the northern coast of Honduras within 
portions of the Tropical Storm Warning this morning and in 
Guatemala and Yucatan later today.
 
RAINFALL: Lisa is expected to produce rainfall amounts of:
 
4 to 6 inches with local amounts to 10 inches across Belize, the
Bay Islands of Honduras, northern Guatemala, the eastern portion of
the Mexican state of Chiapas, and the Mexican state of Tabasco.
 
2 to 4 inches with local amounts to 6 inches across the far
southeastern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula, northern Honduras,
and central Guatemala.
 
1 inch with local amounts to 2 inches across portions of the
Cayman Islands and eastern Nicaragua.
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding conditions, primarily
across Belize into northern Guatemala, the far southeast portion of
the Yucatan peninsula, the eastern portion of the Mexican state of
Chiapas, and the Mexican state of Tabasco.
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will likely raise water levels by as
much as 4 to 7 feet above normal tide levels near and to the north
of where the center of Lisa crosses the coast of Belize and
extreme southeastern portions of the Yucatan Peninsula.  Elsewhere,
a storm surge of 2 to 4 feet is possible within the Tropical Storm
Warning area in eastern Yucatan and 1 to 3 feet for the Bay Islands
of Honduras. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large
and damaging waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lisa are expected to affect Jamaica,
the Cayman Islands, and portions of Central America during the next
couple of days. These swells could cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 AM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

Tropical Storm Lisa Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
400 AM CDT Wed Nov 02 2022

A few hours ago, an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
reported 850-mb flight-level winds of 67 kt in the northeastern 
eyewall and estimated 55-60 kt surface winds from the Stepped 
Frequency Microwave Radiometer.  The minimum central pressure was 
near 992 mb.  Since then, satellite imagery and radar data from 
Belize show little change in organization, and based on these 
observations the initial intensity remains 60 kt.

Lisa has 12-18 h before it makes landfall in Belize, and the 
cyclone is expected to become a hurricane during that time.  The 
forecast peak intensity of 75 kt is on the upper edge of the 
intensity guidance.  After landfall, the cyclone should weaken as 
it crosses Belize and northern Guatemala into southeastern 
Mexico.  The center should emerge over the Bay of Campeche before 
the 60 h point. However, strong upper-level winds should cause 
enough shear to keep the cyclone from re-intensifying, and Lisa is 
still forecast to weaken to a remnant low pressure area by 120 h.

The initial motion remains 280/13 kt. A ridge to the north will 
continue to steer Lisa westward at a slightly reduced forward speed 
through landfall.  The storm is the expected to follow the flow
around a low- to mid-level ridge into the Bay of Campeche in 48-60 
h.  After that time, the increasingly shallow cyclone should turn 
southward in the low-level flow.  The new forecast track is similar 
to, but a little faster than the previous track as the guidance is 
in good agreement on a faster motion through 72 h.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. There is potential for a life-threatening storm surge near where
the center of Lisa crosses the coast of Belize and extreme
southeastern portions of the Yucatan Peninsula starting this
afternoon.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are expected in the Bay Islands of Honduras
this morning and along the coast of Belize and southeastern Yucatan 
by this afternoon.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
north coast of Honduras and Guatemala in the next several hours,
and over the eastern Yucatan Peninsula in the Tropical Storm 
Warning areas beginning this afternoon.
 
4. Localized flash flooding is expected across portions of Belize,
the Bay Islands of Honduras, northern Guatemala, the southeastern
portion of the Mexican state of Chiapas, and the Mexican state of
Tabasco.
