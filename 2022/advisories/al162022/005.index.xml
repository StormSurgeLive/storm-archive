<title>Hurricane Martin Forecast Discussion Number 5</title>

Hurricane Martin Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162022
1100 AM AST Wed Nov 02 2022

Satellite images indicate that Martin now has a better-defined eye, 
with a tight banding pattern wrapping over one degree around the 
center.  Additionally, early-morning microwave data show that 
the cyclone has a closed low-level ring on the 37 GHz channel and 
most of an eyewall on the 91 GHz.  Dvorak intensity estimates have 
increased since the last cycle, and the initial wind speed is set to 
65 kt, near the SAB estimate.

The hurricane has about a day left within an unstable atmosphere 
and moderate shear to further intensify in the conventional 
tropical cyclone manner.  However, a more interesting event could
happen in the early-morning hours tomorrow as extratropical 
transition begins.  Most of the high-resolution hurricane models and 
even some of the global models are showing a sting-jet-like feature 
occurring on the southern side of Martin in about 24 hours due to 
a favorable trough interaction.  Guidance is quite a bit higher 
than the last cycle and, with good agreement in the models, the 
official intensity forecast is raised for the first 24 h, then 
blended back toward the global model consensus.  Martin should be a 
very large and strong extratropical cyclone for several days over 
the far North Atlantic.
 
Martin is making a leftward turn and accelerating, now estimated 
at 060/23 kt. The tropical cyclone should continue to turn more
northeastward and accelerate over the next day hours as it becomes 
drawn into a strong deep-layer trough from Atlantic Canada. This 
same trough will ultimately fully capture Martin, leading to its 
extratropical transition by tomorrow afternoon. The merger of both 
systems will lead to a rapid expansion of both the 34- and 50-kt 
radii, and this continues to be indicated in the wind-radii 
forecast. After this trough-TC merger, the resulting extratropical 
cyclone will slow down and then move generally eastward over the 
remainder of the forecast period, with perhaps a northward bend 
early next week.  There is increasing uncertainty on the final 
disposition of the low, perhaps near the British Isles or  
turning northward towards Iceland.  The new forecast is moved 
north of the previous one at long range.

Mexico should monitor the progress of Lisa.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lisa was located 
near latitude 17.2 North, longitude 86.7 West.  Lisa is moving 
toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h).  This general motion with 
some decrease in forward speed is forecast during the next couple 
of days.  On the forecast track, the center of Lisa will move just 
north of the Bay Islands of Honduras this morning, make landfall in 
Belize later today, and then cross northern Guatemala and move into 
southeastern Mexico by Thursday.
 
Reports from an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that 
the maximum sustained winds have increased to near 75 mph (120 
km/h) with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast as 
Lisa approaches Belize.  Weakening is expected after the center 
makes landfall.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft observations is 988 mb (29.18 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the Bay Islands of
Honduras in the next several hours and along the coast of Belize and
the southeastern Yucatan peninsula this afternoon.  Tropical storm 
conditions are expected along the northern coast of Honduras within 
portions of the Tropical Storm Warning area this morning and in 
Guatemala and Yucatan later today.
 
RAINFALL: Lisa is expected to produce rainfall amounts of:
 
4 to 6 inches with local amounts to 10 inches across Belize, the
Bay Islands of Honduras, northern Guatemala, the eastern portion of
the Mexican state of Chiapas, and the Mexican state of Tabasco.
 
2 to 4 inches with local amounts to 6 inches across the far
southeastern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula, northern Honduras,
and central Guatemala.
 
1 inch with local amounts to 2 inches across portions of the
Cayman Islands and eastern Nicaragua.
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding conditions, primarily
across Belize into northern Guatemala, the far southeast portion of
the Yucatan peninsula, the eastern portion of the Mexican state of
Chiapas, and the Mexican state of Tabasco.
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will likely raise water levels by as
much as 4 to 7 feet above normal tide levels near and to the north
of where the center of Lisa crosses the coast of Belize and
extreme southeastern portions of the Yucatan Peninsula.  Elsewhere,
a storm surge of 2 to 4 feet is possible within the Tropical Storm
Warning area in eastern Yucatan and 1 to 3 feet for the Bay Islands
of Honduras. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large
and damaging waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lisa are expected to affect Jamaica,
the Cayman Islands, and portions of Central America during the next
couple of days. These swells could cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.

Tropical Storm Lisa Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
400 AM CDT Wed Nov 02 2022

A few hours ago, an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
reported 850-mb flight-level winds of 67 kt in the northeastern 
eyewall and estimated 55-60 kt surface winds from the Stepped 
Frequency Microwave Radiometer.  The minimum central pressure was 
near 992 mb.  Since then, satellite imagery and radar data from 
Belize show little change in organization, and based on these 
observations the initial intensity remains 60 kt.

Lisa has 12-18 h before it makes landfall in Belize, and the 
cyclone is expected to become a hurricane during that time.  The 
forecast peak intensity of 75 kt is on the upper edge of the 
intensity guidance.  After landfall, the cyclone should weaken as 
it crosses Belize and northern Guatemala into southeastern 
Mexico.  The center should emerge over the Bay of Campeche before 
the 60 h point. However, strong upper-level winds should cause 
enough shear to keep the cyclone from re-intensifying, and Lisa is 
still forecast to weaken to a remnant low pressure area by 120 h.

The initial motion remains 280/13 kt. A ridge to the north will 
continue to steer Lisa westward at a slightly reduced forward speed 
through landfall.  The storm is the expected to follow the flow
around a low- to mid-level ridge into the Bay of Campeche in 48-60 
h.  After that time, the increasingly shallow cyclone should turn 
southward in the low-level flow.  The new forecast track is similar 
to, but a little faster than the previous track as the guidance is 
in good agreement on a faster motion through 72 h.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. There is potential for a life-threatening storm surge near where
the center of Lisa crosses the coast of Belize and extreme
southeastern portions of the Yucatan Peninsula starting this
afternoon.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are expected in the Bay Islands of Honduras
this morning and along the coast of Belize and southeastern Yucatan 
by this afternoon.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
north coast of Honduras and Guatemala in the next several hours,
and over the eastern Yucatan Peninsula in the Tropical Storm 
Warning areas beginning this afternoon.
 
4. Localized flash flooding is expected across portions of Belize,
the Bay Islands of Honduras, northern Guatemala, the southeastern
portion of the Mexican state of Chiapas, and the Mexican state of
Tabasco.
