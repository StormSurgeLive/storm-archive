<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
downgraded Tropical Depression Colin, located near the southeastern <br/>
coast of North Carolina.<br/>
<br/>
Central Caribbean Sea:<br/>
Recent satellite-derived wind data indicate that a tropical wave <br/>
over the central Caribbean Sea is producing winds to near gale <br/>
force just south of Hispaniola, and disorganized shower and <br/>
thunderstorm activity stretches across the Virgin Islands, Puerto <br/>
Rico, Hispaniola, and the adjacent waters of the Caribbean Sea.  <br/>
Despite these conditions, development of the wave is not expected <br/>
while it moves westward at about 20 mph into an area of stronger <br/>
upper-level winds over the western Caribbean Sea.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
<br/>
Public Advisories on Colin are issued under WMO header WTNT33 KNHC <br/>

Remnants Of Colin Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032022
500 AM EDT Sun Jul 03 2022
 
Colin no longer has a discernible center or closed circulation in
satellite imagery or surface observations, and it has therefore
dissipated over eastern North Carolina.  The remnants are
generating a line of convection mainly offshore the North Carolina
coast, where buoy reports and earlier ASCAT data indicate that
maximum winds are now down to 25 kt.
 
Colin's remnants are moving a little faster toward the northeast
(055/9 kt) and are expected to turn east-northeastward and
accelerate soon, crossing the Outer Banks and emerging over the
Atlantic waters this afternoon.  The remnants are then expected to
merge with a frontal system over the western Atlantic in about 24
hours.
 
This is the last advisory on Colin.  For additional information,
please see products issued by the local National Weather Service
forecast offices in Morehead City and Wilmington, North Carolina.
Also refer to High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather
Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and
online at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Rough surf and rip currents are likely to continue along the
North Carolina coast through this evening.
 
2.  Scattered showers and thunderstorms may impact coastal North
Carolina through this morning.  Most areas will see less than an
inch of additional rainfall.
