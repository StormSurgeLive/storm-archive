<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Colin, located along the coast near the border of <br/>
South and North Carolina.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Caribbean Sea:<br/>
A tropical wave continues to produce disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms over the eastern Caribbean Sea, Puerto Rico, the <br/>
Virgin Islands, and portions of the Leeward Islands. Although <br/>
shower activity has increased a little today, significant <br/>
development of this system is unlikely due to strong upper-level <br/>
winds. This disturbance is expected to move westward to <br/>
west-northwestward across the Caribbean Sea during the next few <br/>
days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Colin was
located near latitude 34.0 North, longitude 78.4 West. Colin is
moving toward the northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h). A slightly faster
northeast to east-northeast motion is expected during the next day
or so. On the forecast track, the center of Colin is expected to
move northeastward along or just inland of the North Carolina coast
through Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Colin could weaken to a tropical depression tonight or 
Sunday, and the system is expected to dissipate by Sunday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
southeast of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface 
observations is 1014 mb (29.95 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions, especially in gusts, are expected
within the warning area in North Carolina later this evening

RAINFALL:  Colin will continue to produce locally heavy rainfall
across coastal portions of North Carolina and northern South
Carolina through Sunday morning. An additional 1 to 2 inches of
rainfall, with isolated amounts up to 4 inches in eastern North
Carolina, is possible. This rainfall may result in localized areas
of flash flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Colin are affecting portions of the
North Carolina coast. These swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Colin Forecast Discussion Number 3</title>

Tropical Storm Colin Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032022
500 PM EDT Sat Jul 02 2022
 
Colin has lost organization this afternoon. Visible satellite and
Doppler radar images along with surface observations indicate that
the circulation has become elongated from north-northeast to
south-southwest, and it is starting to resemble a trough. In
addition, the convective pattern remains ragged with deep convection
confined to the east and southeast of the center. The highest wind
reports are in the Wilmington, North Carolina area, where sustained
winds have been in the 20-25 kt range. The initial intensity is held
at 35 kt, but this could be generous. Hopefully ASCAT data will
provide more information on Colin's intensity tonight.
 
The ongoing northwesterly shear of about 20 kt is expected to
continue and an approaching cold front is likely to cause the system
to become even more elongated. Based on these factors, Colin is
expected to dissipate in a day or two, if not sooner. The strongest
winds will likely occur along and off the North Carolina coast
through Sunday.
 
The storm is moving northeastward at 6 kt. A slightly faster
northeast to east-northeast motion is expected, which should take
the center of Colin along or just offshore of the North Carolina
coast during the next 24 hours, followed by a track over the
western Atlantic. The NHC track forecast remains near the middle of
the guidance envelope.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions, especially in gusts, are expected
within the warning area along the North Carolina coast through
Sunday.
 
2.  Rough surf and rip currents are likely to continue along the
North Carolina coast through Sunday.
 
3.  Areas of heavy rainfall may result in localized flash flooding
across portions of coastal North Carolina through Sunday morning.
