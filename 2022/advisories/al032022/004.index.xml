For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Colin, located along the southeast coast of the United States <br/>
near the North Carolina-South Carolina border.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Caribbean Sea:<br/>
A tropical wave continues to produce showers and thunderstorms, <br/>
along with gusty winds, over the eastern Caribbean Sea, Hispaniola, <br/>
Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and portions of the Leeward <br/>
Islands. Although shower activity has become a littler more <br/>
concentrated, significant development of this system is unlikely due <br/>
to strong upper-level winds. This disturbance is expected to move <br/>
westward to west-northwestward across the Caribbean Sea during the <br/>
next few days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Colin Advisory Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032022
1100 PM EDT Sat Jul 02 2022
 
...COLIN WEAKENS TO A DEPRESSION...
...ALL COASTAL WARNINGS DISCONTINUED...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM EDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...34.4N 77.8W
ABOUT 15 MI...20 KM N OF WILMINGTON NORTH CAROLINA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 55 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1014 MB...29.95 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Tropical Storm Warnings for the North Carolina coast and the
Pamlico Sound have been discontinued.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Colin
was located near latitude 34.4 North, longitude 77.8 West. The
depression is moving toward the northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h). A
slightly faster northeast to east-northeast motion is expected
during the next day or so. On the forecast track, the center of
Colin or it remnants is expected to move northeastward along or
just inland of the North Carolina coast through Sunday afternoon.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is likely, and Colin is
expected to degenerate to a remnant area of low pressure later
tonight or on Sunday.  The system is expected to dissipate
completely Sunday night or Monday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface
observations is 1014 mb (29.95 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Gusts to tropical-storm force in squalls are possible across
portions of coastal North Carolina tonight.
 
RAINFALL:  Colin will continue to produce locally heavy rainfall
across coastal portions of North Carolina through Sunday morning,
where an additional 1 to 2 inches of rainfall is possible. This
rainfall may result in localized areas of flash flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Colin are affecting portions of the
North Carolina coast. These swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM EDT.

Tropical Depression Colin Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032022
1100 PM EDT Sat Jul 02 2022
 
Colin continues to become less organized, with only minimal
convection currently occurring and surface observations showing
that the circulation is losing definition.  Offshore buoys have
reported winds of 20-25 kt for the past several hours, suggesting
that there are no tropical-storm-force winds left over water.
Based on this, Colin is downgraded to a tropical depression, and all
of the coastal warnings are discontinued.
 
The current weakening trend is expected to continue due to
increasing northwesterly vertical wind shear and dry air
entrainment, and Colin is now forecast to degenerate to a remnant
low pressure area within the next 12 h.  The remnants are forecast
to dissipate after 24 h as they merge with a frontal system over
the northwestern Atlantic.
 
The initial motion is an somewhat uncertain 055/6 kt.  Colin or its
remnants should continue to move generally northeastward through
eastern North Carolina for the next 12-18 h, and then move out over
the Atlantic before merging with the aforementioned frontal system.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Rough surf and rip currents are likely to continue along the
North Carolina coast through Sunday.
 
2.  Scattered areas of heavy rainfall may result in localized flash
flooding across coastal portions of North Carolina through Sunday
morning.
