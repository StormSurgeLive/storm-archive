NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 PM PDT Fri Sep 2 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Javier, located a couple hundred miles west of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico:<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity associated with a broad area of low <br/>
pressure located several hundred miles south of the southern coast <br/>
of Mexico is slowly beginning to show signs of organization. <br/>
Continued gradual development of this system is expected, and a <br/>
tropical depression will likely form this weekend while the system <br/>
moves generally west-northwestward or northwestward near the coast <br/>
of southern and southwestern Mexico. Regardless of development, <br/>
heavy rain is possible along the coasts of southern and southwestern <br/>
Mexico through early next week, and interests in those locations <br/>
should monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

possible within the watch area, in this case, within the next 12 to
24 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM MDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Javier was
located near latitude 22.5 North, longitude 112.8 West. Javier is
moving toward the north-northwest near 13 mph (21 km/h). A 
slight increase in forward speed with a turn toward the 
west-northwest is anticipated on Saturday, followed by a turn 
toward the west on Sunday. On the forecast track, the center
of Javier should move generally parallel to but well offshore the 
coast of Baja California Sur through Saturday, and then turn away 
from land on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some slight strengthening is possible tonight or Saturday 
before Javier begins to weaken on Sunday. Javier is forecast to 
become post-tropical in about 48 hours.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center. 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Javier can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1, WMO
header WTPZ41 KNHC, and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP1.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible in squalls across 
portions of southern Baja California Sur tonight. Gusty conditions 
will spread northward through Saturday morning.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Javier will continue to affect portions
of the southern and central Baja California peninsula during the
next day or so.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Tropical Storm Javier is expected to produce 1 to 2
inches of additional rainfall, with isolated storm total amounts of
5 inches across portions of Baja California Sur through Saturday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM MDT.

Tropical Storm Javier Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112022
300 PM MDT Fri Sep 02 2022
 
The organization of Javier has not changed significantly over the 
past few hours.  Satellite infrared imagery indicate that convection 
is deepest in the western portion of the tropical storm's elongated 
circulation with an apparent dry slot in the northwest quadrant.  
The initial intensity remains at 40 kt and is a blend of the 
satellite intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB.

Atmospheric and oceanic conditions are expected to be conducive for 
strengthening for the next 24 hours, with warm sea surface 
temperatures, low deep-layer vertical wind shear and sufficient 
environmental moisture.  However, Javier still has a relatively 
broad circulation, so the NHC forecast only calls for slight 
strengthening.  It should be noted that the peak of the official 
intensity forecast is now at the top of the model guidance.  Beyond 
a day, the system is predicted to weaken as it moves over 
progressively cooler waters and into a drier environment.  Javier 
is predicted to become a post-tropical cyclone in a couple of days.

The storm is moving north-northwestward at 10 kt.  The reasoning 
behind the track forecast is unchanged.  A mid-tropospheric ridge to 
the north is the primary synoptic feature steering Javier.  This 
ridge is expected to build westward and turn the cyclone to the 
northwest and west-northwest in the next couple of days.  The 
official forecast has shifted eastward again towards the model 
consensus aids.  Based on the latest forecast, the Government of 
Mexico has issued a tropical storm watch for Baja California Sur. 
Associated outer rainbands and large swells are expected to affect 
portions of the southern and central Baja California peninsula coast 
during the next couple of days.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Although the center is expected to stay offshore, heavy rainfall
from Tropical Storm Javier could lead to localized flash flooding
in Baja California Sur.

2. Tropical storm conditions are possible across portions of Baja 
California Sur through Saturday.
