500 AM PDT Sat Sep 3 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Javier, located a couple hundred miles west of the southern <br/>
portion of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure located just off the coast of southern <br/>
Mexico continues to produce a large area of showers and <br/>
thunderstorms.  This activity is beginning to show signs of <br/>
organization, and a tropical depression is expected to form later <br/>
today or on Sunday while the system moves west-northwestward or <br/>
northwestward near the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico. <br/>
Regardless of development, heavy rain is possible along the coasts <br/>
of southern and southwestern Mexico during the next few days, and <br/>
interests in those locations should monitor the progress of this <br/>
system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* The west coast of Baja California Sur Mexico from Cabo San Lucas
northward to Punta Eugenia
* The east coast of Baja California Sur Mexico from Cabo San Lucas
northward to Bahia San Juan Bautista
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case, within the next 12
hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM MDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Javier was
located near latitude 24.5 North, longitude 114.5 West. Javier is
moving toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h). This general
motion is forecast to continue through today. A slow turn toward the
west-northwest to west is expected to begin early Sunday. On the
forecast track, the center of Javier should move generally parallel
to but well offshore the coast of Baja California Sur through
today, and then turn away from the coast on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts. Slight additional strengthening is possible this morning
before the tropical storm begins to weaken by this evening.  Javier
is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone on Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Javier can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1, WMO
header WTPZ41 KNHC, and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP1.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will be possible in squalls across
portions of southern Baja California Sur through today. Gusty
conditions are forecast to spread northward through the early 
afternoon.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Javier will continue to affect portions
of the southern and central Baja California peninsula during the
next day or so.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Javier is expected to produce 1 to 2 inches of additional
rainfall, with isolated storm total amounts of 5 inches across
portions of Baja California Sur through today.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.

Tropical Storm Javier Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112022
300 AM MDT Sat Sep 03 2022
 
This morning's satellite presentation consists of a recent deep
convective burst with -78C cloud tops just to the west of the
surface circulation center.  A 0116 UTC SSMI/S microwave image
showed a primary curved band wrapping around 65 percent of the
cyclone's surface center.  Based on a compromise of the latest
subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB, a 0428 UTC SATCON 
analysis of 49 kt, and a recent ASCAT-B scatterometer pass 
revealing a few peak-wind retrievals of 39 kt (undersampling 
likely), the initial intensity is held at 45 kt for this advisory.  

There's a small window of opportunity that Javier could strengthen 
slightly today before it moves over a gradient of progressively 
cooler waters of less than 24C this evening.  This negatively 
contributing oceanic parameter, along with an increasingly stable 
surrounding environment should cause Javier to become a 
post-tropical cyclone Sunday, and a remnant low-pressure system by 
early next week.
 
Javier's initial motion is estimated to be northwestward, or 320/13 
kt.  This general motion should continue through today in response 
to the mid-level steering flow produced by a mid-tropospheric ridge 
anchored over the southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico.  By early 
Sunday, the global models are in good agreement that this ridge 
should build westward and influence Javier to slowly turn toward 
the west-northwest to west while the cyclone weakens.  The NHC 
forecast follows suit and lies close to the TVCE and NOAA HFIP HCCA 
consensus aids.
 
Javier's wind radii have been adjusted for this advisory using a
fortuitous 0430 UTC METOP-B ASCAT overpass.  Although the NHC
forecast wind radii do not explicitly reach the coast of Mexico,
any additional eastward deviation from the official track forecast
could result in tropical-storm-force winds reaching portions of
Baja California Sur where a Tropical Storm Watch is in effect.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Although the center is expected to stay offshore, heavy rainfall 
from Tropical Storm Javier could lead to localized flash flooding in 
Baja California Sur.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible across portions of Baja
California Sur through today. A Tropical Storm Watch is in
effect.
