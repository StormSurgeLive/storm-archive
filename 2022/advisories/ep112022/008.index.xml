<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Corrected to add reference to High Seas Forecasts for the system <br/>
south of southern Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Javier, located a couple hundred miles west of the southern <br/>
portion of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure located just off the coast of southern <br/>
Mexico continues to produce a large area of showers and <br/>
thunderstorms.  This activity is beginning to show signs of <br/>
organization, and a tropical depression is expected to form later <br/>
today or on Sunday while the system moves west-northwestward or <br/>
northwestward near the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico. <br/>
Regardless of development, heavy rain is possible along the coasts <br/>
of southern and southwestern Mexico during the next few days, and <br/>
interests in those locations should monitor the progress of this <br/>
system.  Additional information on this system, including gale <br/>
warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National <br/>
Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* The west coast of Baja California Sur Mexico from Cabo San Lucas
northward to Punta Eugenia
* The east coast of Baja California Sur Mexico from Cabo San Lucas
northward to Bahia San Juan Bautista
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case, within the next 12
hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Javier was 
located near latitude 25.1 North, longitude 114.8 West. Javier is 
moving toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h).  This general 
motion is forecast to continue through today. A slow turn toward the 
west-northwest to west is expected to begin early Sunday. On the 
forecast track, the center of Javier should move generally parallel 
to but offshore of the coast of Baja California Sur through today, 
and then turn away from the coast on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Javier is expected to gradually weaken over the next few days and 
become a post-tropical cyclone by early Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Javier can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1, WMO
header WTPZ41 KNHC, and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP1.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will be possible in squalls across
portions of southern Baja California Sur through today. Gusty
conditions are forecast to spread northward through the early
afternoon.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Javier will continue to affect portions
of the southern and central Baja California peninsula during the
next day or so.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Javier is expected to produce 1 to 2 inches of additional
rainfall, with isolated storm total amounts of 5 inches across
portions of Baja California Sur through today.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1200 PM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 300 PM MDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Javier Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Tropical Storm Javier Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112022
900 AM MDT Sat Sep 03 2022
 
The satellite presentation of Javier has continued to deteriorate 
over the past few hours.  The deep convective burst noted in the 
previous discussion has rotated to the southern portion of the 
circulation and cloud top temperatures have warmed to above -70 
degrees C.  Microwave and infrared imagery show the northern half 
of the semicircle to be devoid of any deep convection.  A blend of 
the objective and subjective satellite intensity estimates support 
lowering the intensity to 40 kt for this advisory.  

Javier appears to have begun its weakening trend.  The system has 
crossed over waters cooler than 26 degrees C and the sea surface 
temperatures along the forecast track are expected to be 
progressively colder.  Atmospheric conditions are also predicted to 
not be conducive for any additional strengthening.  Global models 
suggest that the vertical wind shear should increase and the 
environmental moisture to decrease within a day.  Based on this 
information and guidance, the official forecast now shows Javier 
becoming a post-tropical cyclone in 24 hours and weakening to a 
remnant within two days.

The initial motion is estimated to be 325 degrees at 13 kt.  Though 
the center of Javier appears to have shifted slightly to the 
north, the storm is expected to be steered northwestward by a 
mid-level ridge to its northeast.  Within a day or less, model 
guidance agrees that the ridge should turn Javier to the 
west-northwest.  Low-level tradewinds are expected to turn a 
weakening Javier to the west and west-southwest beyond 48 hours.  
The NHC track forecast is shifted slightly northward from the 
previous advisory prediction and is close the model consensus aids.

Although the NHC forecast wind radii do not explicitly reach the 
coast of Mexico, any additional eastward or northward deviations 
from the official track forecast could result in 
tropical-storm-force winds reaching portions of Baja California 
Sur, where a Tropical Storm Watch is in effect.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Although the center is expected to stay offshore, heavy rainfall
from Tropical Storm Javier could lead to localized flash flooding in
Baja California Sur.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible across portions of Baja
California Sur through today. A Tropical Storm Watch remains in
effect.
