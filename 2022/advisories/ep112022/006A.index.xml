1100 PM PDT Fri Sep 2 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Javier, located a couple hundred miles west of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico:<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity continues in association with a <br/>
broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles south of <br/>
the southern coast of Mexico.  Further development of this system <br/>
is expected, and a tropical depression will likely form later today <br/>
or on Sunday while the system moves generally west-northwestward or <br/>
northwestward near the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico. <br/>
Regardless of development, heavy rain is possible along the coasts <br/>
of southern and southwestern Mexico through early next week, and <br/>
interests in those locations should monitor the progress of this <br/>
system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

northward to Punta Eugenia
* The east coast of Baja California Sur Mexico from Cabo San Lucas
northward to Bahia San Juan Bautista
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case, within the next 12 to
24 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 AM MDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Javier was
located near latitude 23.5 North, longitude 113.6 West. Javier is
moving toward the north-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). This
general motion is forecast to continue through today. A slow turn 
toward the west is expected to begin by Sunday. On the forecast 
track, the center of Javier should move generally parallel to but 
well offshore the coast of Baja California Sur through Saturday, 
and then turn away from the coast on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Slight additional strengthening is possible this morning 
before the tropical storm begins to weaken by this evening. 
Javier is forecast to become post-tropical on Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Javier can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1, WMO
header WTPZ41 KNHC, and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP1.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will be possible in squalls across
portions of southern Baja California Sur through today. Gusty 
conditions are forecast to spread northward through early afternoon.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Javier will continue to affect portions
of the southern and central Baja California peninsula during the
next day or so.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Tropical Storm Javier is expected to produce 1 to 2
inches of additional rainfall, with isolated storm total amounts of
5 inches across portions of Baja California Sur through today.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM MDT.

Tropical Storm Javier Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112022
900 PM MDT Fri Sep 02 2022
 
AMSR microwave imagery that arrived after the issuance of the 
previous advisory indicated that Javier's center was slightly 
northeast of previous estimates. The microwave imagery also showed 
that the Tropical Storm still has a broad center, with more recent 
visible imagery suggesting that multiple swirls are rotating around 
a mean center. Despite the cyclone's broad organization, subjective 
Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB have increased and now 
support a higher initial intensity of 45 kt. Slight additional 
strengthening is possible overnight before Javier moves over much 
cooler waters and begins to weaken on Saturday. Simulated satellite 
imagery from the GFS, HWRF, and ECMWF models indicate the cyclone 
will lose all deep convection and become a remnant low in about 
36 h, which is reflected in the latest NHC forecast. No changes of 
note were made to the official intensity forecast.

Due to the relocation of Javier's initial position to the northeast, 
the NHC track forecast has also been adjusted in that direction. 
Otherwise, there has been no change in the thinking behind the track 
forecast. The tropical storm appears to have accelerated slightly 
and now has an initial motion estimate of 330/12 kt. A mid-level 
ridge centered over the southwestern U.S. should steer Javier 
generally parallel to the coast of the Baja California peninsula for 
the next day or so. The ridge is then forecast to build westward as 
Javier weakens, which should cause the cyclone to turn westward 
through the middle of next week. The NHC track forecast is based on 
the latest multi-model track consensus and is near the center of the 
guidance envelope.

Although the NHC forecast wind radii do not explicitly reach the 
coast of Mexico, any additional eastward deviation from the official 
track forecast could result in tropical-storm-force winds reaching 
portions of Baja California Sur where a Tropical Storm Watch is in 
effect.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Although the center is expected to stay offshore, heavy rainfall
from Tropical Storm Javier could lead to localized flash flooding
in Baja California Sur.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible across portions of Baja
California Sur through Saturday. A Tropical Storm Watch is in 
effect.
