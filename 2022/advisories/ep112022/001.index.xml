1100 AM PDT Thu Sep 1 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Offshore of West-Central Mexico:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure <br/>
located about 300 miles south of the southern tip of the Baja <br/>
California peninsula are gradually becoming better organized. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear favorable for development of this <br/>
system, and a tropical depression or tropical storm is forecast to <br/>
form later today or tonight while moving northwestward at about 10 <br/>
mph, likely remaining a couple of hundred miles off the western <br/>
coast of Baja California Sur.  Additional information on this <br/>
system, including gale warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts <br/>
issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico:<br/>
A tropical wave is producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms <br/>
near the Gulf of Tehuantepec.  Gradual development of this system <br/>
is expected, and a tropical depression is likely to form late <br/>
this weekend or early next week while it moves westward or <br/>
west-northwestward near the coast of southern and southwestern <br/>
Mexico.  Interests in southern and southwestern Mexico should <br/>
monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM MDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Eleven-E
was located near latitude 18.9 North, longitude 110.5 West. The
depression is moving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h) and
this motion with some increase in forward speed is expected during 
the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Slow strengthening is forecast during the next 36 to 48 hours, and 
the depression is expected to become a tropical storm tonight or on 
Friday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are expected to affect
portions of the southern and central Baja California peninsula.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.

RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Eleven-E is expected to produce 1 to 
2 inches of rainfall, with isolated storm totals of 3 inches across 
southern portions of Baja California Sur through Friday.

Tropical Depression Eleven-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112022
300 PM MDT Thu Sep 01 2022

The area of low pressure that NHC has been monitoring a few hundred 
miles south of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula 
has developed organized deep convection and a well-defined center.  
Therefore, the system is now being classified as a tropical 
depression and the initial intensity is estimated to be 30 kt based 
on recent ASCAT data and a Dvorak estimate from TAFB.  It should be 
noted that the depression is quite large with its cloud field 
extending several hundred miles across. 

The depression is moving northwestward at 9 kt, and this motion 
with some increase in forward speed is expected during the next 
couple of days as the system remains steered by the western 
periphery of a subtropical ridge.  After that time, the weakening 
system should turn to the west within the low-level flow.  The 
models are in fair agreement, and the NHC track forecast lies near 
the middle of the guidance envelope. 

The environmental conditions appear favorable for intensification 
during the next 36 to 48 hours, however, given the sprawling nature 
of the depression only slow strengthening seems likely during that 
time.  Beyond a couple of days, the system is expected to track over 
much cooler SSTs and into a dry and stable airmass.  These 
conditions should cause the system to decay into a remnant low in 
about 60 h with continued weakening forecast thereafter.  The NHC 
intensity forecast is close to the HCCA and IVCN guidance.

Although the center of the system is forecast to remain a couple of 
hundred miles off the Baja California coast, outer rainbands 
and large swells are expected to affect portions of the southern 
and central Baja California peninsula coast during the next couple 
of days.
