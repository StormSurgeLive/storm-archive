Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 AM PDT Sat Sep 3 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Javier, located about 100 miles west of the south-central <br/>
portion of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms have changed little in organization in <br/>
association with an area of low pressure located just off the coast <br/>
of southern Mexico.  Environmental conditions are conducive for <br/>
development, and a tropical depression is expected to form later <br/>
today or on Sunday while the system moves west-northwestward or <br/>
northwestward near the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico. <br/>
Regardless of development, heavy rain is possible along the coasts <br/>
of southern and southwestern Mexico during the next few days, and <br/>
interests in those locations and the Baja California peninsula <br/>
should monitor the progress of this disturbance.  Additional <br/>
information on this system, including gale warnings, can be found <br/>
in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service<br/>
can be found under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, <br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical Storm Watch
for the west coast of Baja California Sur Mexico from Cabo San Lucas
northward to Puerto San Andresito and the Tropical Storm Watch
for the east coast of Baja California Sur Mexico from Cabo San
Lucas northward to Bahia San Juan Bautista
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* The west coast of Baja California Sur Mexico from Puerto San
Andresito northward to Punta Eugenia
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case, within
the next few hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM PDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Javier was 
located near latitude 26.0 North, longitude 116.1 West. Javier is 
moving toward the northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h) and is expected to 
gradually turn toward the west-northwest and west and slow in 
forward motion for the next couple of days. On the forecast track, 
the center of Javier should begin to move away from the coast of 
Baja California Sur this evening.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours. Javier is 
expected to gradually weaken over the next few days and become a 
post-tropical cyclone by early Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Javier can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1, WMO
header WTPZ41 KNHC, and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP1.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected across portions of the
warning area for the next couple of hours.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Javier will continue to affect portions
of the southern and central Baja California peninsula during the
next day or so.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Javier is expected to produce 1 to 2 inches of additional
rainfall, with isolated storm total amounts of 5 inches across
portions of Baja California Sur through tonight.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 500 PM PDT.
Next complete advisory at 800 PM PDT.

Tropical Storm Javier Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112022
200 PM PDT Sat Sep 03 2022
 
Javier has been devoid of deep convection for the past few hours. 
Recent satellite surface wind measurements also indicate the cyclone 
has a smaller wind field than previously estimated and 
tropical-storm-force winds are only present in the northern portion 
of the circulation.  Based on the ASCAT data the initial intensity 
is held at 40 kt for this cycle.
 
The lack of organized, deep convection is an indication Javier is
likely to become a post-tropical cyclone soon.  The system is
moving over a cooling gradient of ocean surface temperatures and
into a region with moderate to strong vertical wind shear and lower
relative humidities.  Model guidance agrees Javier should continue
to weaken and the official forecast reflects this information.  The
system is now predicted to be a post-tropical cyclone within 12
hours.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be northwestward at 14 kt.  The
mid-level ridge to the north currently steering Javier is expected
to gradually turn the storm west-northwestward and slow its forward
motion.  Low-level tradewinds are then expected to turn the
weakening shallow vortex to the west and west-southwest beyond 48
hours. The NHC track forecast is close to the previous advisory
prediction and the model consensus aids.
 
Although the NHC forecast wind radii do not explicitly reach the
coast of Mexico, any northward deviations from the official track
forecast could result in tropical-storm-force winds reaching
portions of Baja California Sur this evening, where a Tropical 
Storm Warning is in effect.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Although the center is expected to stay offshore, heavy rainfall
from Tropical Storm Javier could lead to localized flash flooding in
Baja California Sur.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected between Puerto de
Andresito and Punta Eugenia through this afternoon. A Tropical Storm
Warning remains in effect.
