Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 PM PDT Sat Sep 3 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Javier, located about 200 miles west of the central portion <br/>
of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure <br/>
located south of the coast of southern Mexico have gradually become <br/>
more organized during the afternoon and early evening. Although <br/>
recent satellite imagery indicates that the system does not have a <br/>
well-defined circulation yet, additional development is likely, and <br/>
a tropical depression is expected to form tonight or on Sunday. The <br/>
system is forecast to move generally west-northwestward or <br/>
northwestward near the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico <br/>
through early next week, bringing heavy rain to portions of that <br/>
region regardless of development. Interests in those locations and <br/>
the Baja California peninsula should monitor the progress of this <br/>
disturbance. Additional information on this system, including gale <br/>
warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National <br/>
Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service<br/>
can be found under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, <br/>
and on the web at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php<br/>

...JAVIER FORECAST TO BECOME POST-TROPICAL WITHIN THE NEXT FEW
HOURS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 PM PDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...26.8N 117.1W
ABOUT 140 MI...225 KM WSW OF PUNTA EUGENIA MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H

MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM PDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Javier was
located near latitude 26.8 North, longitude 117.1 West. Javier is
moving toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). A slow turn 
toward the west is expected on Sunday. Javier is then expected to 
continue westward through early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is anticipated during the next several days. Javier will 
likely become a post-tropical cyclone tonight.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Javier will continue to affect portions
of the southern and central Baja California peninsula during the
next day or so. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Javier may produce up to an additional inch of rainfall
across portions of the Baja California peninsula through tonight.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM PDT.

Tropical Storm Javier Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112022
800 PM PDT Sat Sep 03 2022
 
Javier is nearly post-tropical, having produced little to no deep 
convection since late this morning. Post-tropical transition 
will likely conclude tonight since the cyclone is moving over 
cold water that should prevent the redevelopment of organized deep 
convection. Earlier ASCAT data showed peak winds near 40 kt, so the 
initial intensity was held at that value, possibly conservatively 
so. Without deep convection to sustain it, Javier should slowly 
weaken over the next several days, eventually dissipating by the 
middle of next week. The new official intensity forecast is nearly 
identical to the previous one and is close to the intensity model 
consensus.
 
The tropical storm is now moving away from the Baja California 
peninsula. Low-level easterly steering flow should cause Javier to 
turn westward by the end of the weekend. By then the cyclone is 
forecast to be a shallow remnant low, and it should continue 
westward through the middle of the week until it dissipates. The NHC 
track forecast is heavily based on the TVCN track consensus aid with 
no changes of note made from the previous advisory.
