Tropical Storm Javier Advisory Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112022
300 AM MDT Fri Sep 02 2022
 
...DEPRESSION BECOMES TROPICAL STORM JAVIER...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM MDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.9N 111.7W
ABOUT 235 MI...380 KM SSW OF CABO SAN LUCAS MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 320 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Javier was
located near latitude 19.9 North, longitude 111.7 West. Javier is
moving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and an increase 
in forward speed is expected through early Saturday.  A turn toward 
the west-northwest is forecast on Saturday, followed by a turn 
toward the west on Sunday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some additional strengthening is forecast through Saturday before 
Javier begins to weaken by Sunday evening.  
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.  An automated Mexican navy weather station on 
Socorro Islands recently reported a wind gust of 47 mph (76 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Javier are expected to affect portions 
of the southern and central Baja California peninsula.  These 
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Outer rainbands should move onshore of the southwestern 
coast of Baja California Sur within the next few hours. Tropical 
Storm Javier is expected to produce 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, with 
isolated storm total amounts of 4 inches across portions of Baja 
California Sur through this weekend.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.

Tropical Storm Javier Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112022
300 AM MDT Fri Sep 02 2022
 
Since yesterday afternoon, deep convection has been developing over 
the western half of the cyclone.  Although the surface circulation 
is still elongated (north to south), deep bursts of convection 
have recently appeared near the estimated center.  The latest 
microwave imagery indicated curved banding with cold cloud 
tops of -81C forming in the southeast quadrant.  A blend of the 
subjective satellite intensity from TAFB and SAB yields an estimate 
of 35 kt.  Accordingly, the depression has been upgraded to a 
tropical storm for this advisory.
 
The depression is expected to remain in an environment conducive
for additional strengthening through Saturday, but given its
broad, elongated structure, only modest intensification is 
forecast.  Afterward, gradual weakening is expected as the cyclone 
traverses decreasing (22-24C) oceanic temperatures while moving 
into a stable, dry marine layer.  The intensity forecast is an 
update of the previous one and is based on the various intensity 
consensus guidance.

Javier's initial motion is estimated to be northwestward, or 320/9 
kt, moving along the western periphery of a mid-tropospheric ridge 
over northern Mexico.  By the 48 hour period, the ridge as 
mentioned above is expected to build westward, which should cause 
the cyclone to turn toward the west-northwest and west over the 
weekend.  The official track forecast is again adjusted to the 
right of the previous forecast based on a mean track of the 
clustered guidance, however, tropical-storm-force winds generated 
by Javier are expected to remain well offshore of the western coast 
of Baja California Sur.  Associated outer rainbands and large 
swells are expected to affect portions of the southern and 
central Baja California peninsula coast during the next couple of 
days.
