Tropical Storm Kay Advisory Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122022
1000 PM CDT Sun Sep 04 2022
 
...KAY EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN INTO A HURRICANE DURING THE NEXT
COUPLE OF DAYS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1000 PM CDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.6N 103.8W
ABOUT 275 MI...440 KM WSW OF ACAPULCO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in southwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula
should closely monitor the progress of Kay.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Kay was
located near latitude 15.6 North, longitude 103.8 West. Kay is
moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). This general
motion is expected to continue for the next day or so, followed by a
turn to the northwest and north-northwest on Tuesday. The center of
Kay is expected to remain south of southwestern Mexico during the
next couple of days, then move toward the southern Baja California
peninsula on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is expected, and Kay is forecast to become a hurricane
in a day or so and continue strengthening through midweek.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Kay can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Kay will affect portions of the coast of
southwestern Mexico during the next several days, and are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. These swells
are expected to reach the southern portion of the Baja California
peninsula by Tuesday. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Kay is expected to produce 1 to 3 inches of rainfall,
with isolated storm total amounts of 5 inches, across coastal
portions of southwestern Mexico from the Mexican state of Guerrero
northwestward to Jalisco over the next few days.
 
WIND: Gusty winds are likely near the coast of southwestern Mexico
in outer rainbands during the next couple of days.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Kay Forecast Discussion Number 3</title>

Tropical Storm Kay Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122022
1000 PM CDT Sun Sep 04 2022
 
The structure of Kay has slightly improved in satellite imagery
this evening. Deep convection has increased near the center, with a
more defined curved band over the southern and western portions
of the circulation. Earlier ASCAT data showed several 35-kt wind
vectors in the northeastern quadrant of the storm, and objective
satellite estimates have increased since TAFB provided a T2.5/35 kt
Dvorak classification at 00 UTC. Therefore, the initial intensity
is raised slightly to 40 kt for this advisory.
 
Kay has moved a bit right of the previous forecast track, but its
initial motion is still west-northwestward, or 295/12 kt. This
general motion is expected to continue for the next day or two as
the core of the cyclone passes well south of the coast of
southwestern Mexico. By Tuesday, the tightly clustered guidance
agrees that Kay will turn toward the northwest and then the
north-northwest, moving in the general direction of the Baja
California peninsula. The official NHC forecast track is virtually
unchanged from the previous one beyond 36 h, and closely follows the
HCCA and TVCE consensus aids. There is increased spread in the GFS
and ECMWF ensemble members later this week as Kay moves northward.
Users are reminded not to focus on the exact details of the
long-range forecast, as track errors on average increase with time.
 
The environmental conditions appear favorable for strengthening
during the next few days. Although Kay is currently contending with
some moderate northeasterly wind shear, a moist and unstable
atmosphere over very warm sea-surface temperatures (> 29C) should
allow the storm to intensify through the middle of the week. The
northeasterly shear is forecast to weaken beyond 48 h, which would
be even more conducive for significant strengthening as suggested by
some of the intensity guidance. The NHC intensity forecast generally
lies between the IVCN and HCCA aids, and it shows Kay becoming a
hurricane by early Tuesday and continuing to intensify into
Wednesday. Beyond 72 h, cooler SSTs are expected to induce a
weakening trend through the rest of the forecast period.
 
Tropical Storm or Hurricane Watches could be required tonight or on
Monday for portions of the Baja California peninsula, and interests
there should closely monitor the latest forecast updates.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Although the center of Kay is expected to stay offshore, heavy
rainfall could lead to localized flash flooding in portions of
southwestern Mexico over the next few days.
 
2. Kay is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane while it moves
northward toward the Baja California peninsula later this week.
While the details of the long-range track and intensity forecasts
are uncertain, there is a risk of wind and rainfall impacts in the
Baja California peninsula during the middle and latter parts of the
week. Interests there should closely monitor updates to the forecast
as tropical storm or hurricane watches could be required tonight or
on Monday.
