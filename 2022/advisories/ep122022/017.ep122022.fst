DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kay was located 
near latitude 25.8 North, longitude 113.8 West.  Kay is moving 
toward the north-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this general 
motion should continue through Friday.  A slower northwestward to 
west-northwestward motion is forecast to begin by late Friday and 
continue into Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of Kay is 
expected move over or near the west-central coast of the Baja 
California peninsula later today and tonight, and near the northwest 
coast of the Baja California peninsula on Friday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Weakening is expected during the next couple of days.
However, Kay is expected to remain a large hurricane when it passes
over or near the west-central coast of the Baja California 
peninsula today.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles
(370 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 974 mb (28.77 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Kay can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml.

WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the Hurricane Warning
area beginning during the next several hours, and are possible
within the Hurricane Watch area today.  Tropical storm conditions
are occurring over the Tropical Storm Warning area and are forecast
to spread northward through Friday.

STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal
flooding near where the center passes the coast in areas of onshore
winds, or east of the center if Kay makes landfall along the
western Baja peninsula of Mexico. The surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.

RAINFALL: Kay is expected to produce the following rainfall totals
through Saturdayâ€¦

Baja California Peninsula: 6 to 10 inches, isolated maxima of 15
inches

Northwest Mainland Mexico:  2 to 4 inches, isolated maxima of 6
inches

Southernmost California:  2 to 4 inches with maxima of 6 inches

Southwest Arizona: 1 to 2 inches with isolated maxima of 3 inches

These rainfall amounts could lead to flash flooding, with landslides
possible across mountainous areas of Mexico.

SURF:  Swells generated by Kay will continue to affect portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next day or so. Large
swells are expected to spread northward along the Baja California
peninsula coast, into the Gulf of California, and to southern
California during the next couple of days. These swells will
likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
