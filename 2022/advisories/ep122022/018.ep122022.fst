DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM MDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kay was located
near latitude 27.1 North, longitude 114.3 West. Kay is moving toward
the north-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h), and this general
motion should continue through Friday.  A slower northwestward to
west-northwestward motion is forecast to begin by late Friday and
continue into Saturday.  A turn toward the west is expected by 
Saturday night.  On the forecast track, the center of Kay will pass 
over portions of the Baja California peninsula near Punta Eugenia 
for the next several hours, then move over the Pacific near and 
offshore of the northwest coast of the Baja California peninsula 
later tonight, Friday, and Friday night.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is expected during the 
next couple of days, and Kay is expected to weaken to a tropical 
storm in the next few hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles
(350 km).

The minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 982 mb (29.00 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Kay can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml.

WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the Hurricane Warning
for the next few hours, and are possible within the Hurricane
Watch area this afternoon and evening.  Tropical storm conditions
are occurring over the Tropical Storm Warning area and are forecast
to spread northward through Friday.

Strong winds not directly associated with Kay's core wind field are
expected across portions of southern California and extreme
southwestern Arizona beginning on Friday. For information on this
wind hazard, users should see High Wind Warnings and other products
from their local NWS Weather Forecast Office.

STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal
flooding in areas of onshore winds near the landfall location 
along the western Baja peninsula of Mexico. The surge will be 
accompanied by large and destructive waves.

RAINFALL: Kay is expected to produce the following rainfall totals
through Saturdayâ€¦

Baja California Peninsula: 6 to 10 inches, isolated maxima of 15
inches

Northwest Mainland Mexico:  2 to 4 inches, isolated maxima of 6
inches

Southernmost California:  2 to 4 inches with isolated maxima of 8
inches

Southwest Arizona: 1 to 2 inches with isolated maxima of 3 inches

These rainfall amounts could lead to flash flooding, with landslides
possible across mountainous areas of Mexico.

SURF:  Swells generated by Kay will continue to affect portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next day or so. Large
swells are expected to spread northward along the Baja California
peninsula coast, into the Gulf of California, and to southern
California during the next couple of days. These swells will
likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
