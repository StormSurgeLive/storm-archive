WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warnings south of Punta Abreojos on the west coast of the Baja
California peninsula, south of Santa Rosalia on the east coast of
the Baja California peninsula, and south of Bahia Kino on the Gulf
of California coast of Mainland Mexico.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Punta Abreojos northward along the west coast of the Baja
California peninsula to the U.S./Mexico border
* Santa Rosalia northward along the east coast of the Baja
California peninsula and then southward to Bahia Kino in mainland
Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests in southern California should monitor the progress of Kay
and consult products from your local weather office.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM PDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Kay was
located near latitude 29.4 North, longitude 116.0 West. Kay is
moving toward the north-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). A slower
northwestward to west-northwestward motion is forecast to begin
today and continue into Saturday.  A turn to the west is expected by
late Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of Kay will move
parallel to the coast of the northwestern Baja California peninsula
through today, and then begin to move further offshore by Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with
higher gusts. Additional weakening is forecast during the next
couple of days, and Kay is expected to degenerate into a remnant low
by Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km) 
from the center. In the past few hours, a weather station in Isla 
Cedros reported a sustained wind of 51 mph (82 km/h). 
 
The most recent minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 990 mb (29.24 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Kay can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of the
Tropical Storm Warning area and are forecast to spread northward
today.
 
Strong winds not directly associated with Kay's core wind field are
expected across portions of southern California and extreme
southwestern Arizona beginning today. For information on this
wind hazard, users should see High Wind Warnings and other products
from their local NWS Weather Forecast Office.
 
STORM SURGE: Coastal flooding is possible in areas of onshore winds
along the west coast of the central and northern Baja California
peninsula of Mexico and along the coast of the northern Gulf of
California.  The flooding could be accompanied by large and
damaging waves.
 
RAINFALL: Kay is expected to produce the following rainfall totals
through Saturday:
 
Baja California Peninsula: 6 to 10 inches, isolated maxima of 15
inches
 
Northwest Mainland Mexico:  2 to 4 inches, isolated maxima of 6
inches
 
Southernmost California:  2 to 4 inches with isolated maxima of 6
to 8 inches
 
Southwest Arizona: 1 to 2 inches with isolated maxima of 3 inches
 
These rainfall amounts could lead to flash flooding, with landslides
possible across mountainous areas of Mexico.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Kay will continue to affect portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next day or so. Large
swells are expected to spread northward along the Baja California
peninsula coast, into the Gulf of California, and to southern
California during the next couple of days. These swells will
likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 500 AM PDT.
Next complete advisory at 800 AM PDT.

Tropical Storm Kay Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122022
200 AM PDT Fri Sep 09 2022
 
After moving back offshore yesterday evening, Kay has been roughly
paralleling the northwestern coastline of the Baja California
peninsula. The satellite presentation is not all that impressive,
with the majority of the deep convective activity firing over the
warm waters of the Gulf of California and adjacent mountainous
terrain, well removed from Kay's center. An Air Force Reserve
Hurricane Hunter aircraft was able to reach the center earlier this
morning, and found that Kay's circulation is largely intact, with
peak 700-mb flight-level winds of 62 kt and a minimum central
pressure of 990 mb. While the standard wind reduction at that flight
level would still typically support 55 kt, the SFMR-derived winds
in that area were much lower, which better match a dropsonde also
launched in the area. South of the center, there were some
significant winds observed, with a sustained wind of 44 kt at Isla
Cedros at 0630 UTC. Based on a combination of all these data, the
initial intensity was reduced to 50 kt for this advisory.
 
Additional weakening over the next 24-36 hours is expected as Kay
will be traversing sub-23 C sea-surface temperatures and
approaching even cooler waters in the cold California Current. The
GFS, ECMWF, and HWRF models all indicate that Kay will cease to
produce organized deep convection near its center in about 36 hours,
marking its transition to a post-tropical remnant low off the coast
of Southern California. The low should spin down further and
dissipate sometime in the 4-5 day forecast. The latest NHC intensity
forecast is in good agreement with the intensity guidance suite.
 
From the two recon fixes, Kay continues to move off to the
north-northwest at 330/11 kt. A narrowing mid-level ridge draped
along the northeast side of the storm is expected to maintain this
motion with a gradual turn to the northwest and west-northwest today
into tonight. As Kay loses its remaining deep convection and becomes
more shallow, the weak low-level ridging in the Eastern Pacific
should result in the remnant low making a slow cyclonic turn away
from the western U.S. coastline. The latest track guidance has
shifted a bit more leftward this cycle, and the latest NHC track
forecast was also shifted in that direction, towards the track
consensus aids.
 
Although Kay's maximum sustained winds are lower, the tropical
cyclone 34-kt wind radii remain quite large on its eastern side, as
seen in recent scatterometer data showing these tropical-storm-force
winds extending up to the northern Gulf of California coast. Wind,
surf, and rainfall impacts continue to extend far from the center so
users should not focus on the exact forecast track of Kay.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding, including
landslides, across the Baja California peninsula and portions of
mainland northwestern Mexico through Saturday morning.  Flash,
urban, and small stream flooding is likely across Southern
California beginning today, especially in and near the peninsular
ranges. Flash, urban, and small stream flooding is possible
beginning later today in Southwest Arizona.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of the Baja
California peninsula, and these conditions extend all the way to the
northern Gulf of California coastline, where a Tropical Storm
Warning is in effect.
 
3. Strong winds not directly associated with Kay's core wind field
are expected across portions of southern California and extreme
southwestern Arizona later today. For information on this wind
hazard, users should see High Wind Warnings and other products from
their local NWS Weather Forecast Office.
