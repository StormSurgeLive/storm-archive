to completion.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area, in this case within the next 12 to 18 hours.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM MDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kay was located
near latitude 27.1 North, longitude 114.3 West. Kay is moving toward
the north-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h), and this general
motion should continue through Friday.  A slower northwestward to
west-northwestward motion is forecast to begin by late Friday and
continue into Saturday.  A turn toward the west is expected by 
Saturday night.  On the forecast track, the center of Kay will pass 
over portions of the Baja California peninsula near Punta Eugenia 
for the next several hours, then move over the Pacific near and 
offshore of the northwest coast of the Baja California peninsula 
later tonight, Friday, and Friday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is expected during the 
next couple of days, and Kay is expected to weaken to a tropical 
storm in the next few hours.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles
(350 km).
 
The minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 982 mb (29.00 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Kay can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the Hurricane Warning
for the next few hours, and are possible within the Hurricane
Watch area this afternoon and evening.  Tropical storm conditions
are occurring over the Tropical Storm Warning area and are forecast
to spread northward through Friday.
 
Strong winds not directly associated with Kay's core wind field are
expected across portions of southern California and extreme
southwestern Arizona beginning on Friday. For information on this
wind hazard, users should see High Wind Warnings and other products
from their local NWS Weather Forecast Office.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal
flooding in areas of onshore winds near the landfall location 
along the western Baja peninsula of Mexico. The surge will be 
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: Kay is expected to produce the following rainfall totals
through Saturdayâ€¦
 
Baja California Peninsula: 6 to 10 inches, isolated maxima of 15
inches
 
Northwest Mainland Mexico:  2 to 4 inches, isolated maxima of 6
inches
 
Southernmost California:  2 to 4 inches with isolated maxima of 8
inches
 
Southwest Arizona: 1 to 2 inches with isolated maxima of 3 inches
 
These rainfall amounts could lead to flash flooding, with landslides
possible across mountainous areas of Mexico.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Kay will continue to affect portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next day or so. Large
swells are expected to spread northward along the Baja California
peninsula coast, into the Gulf of California, and to southern
California during the next couple of days. These swells will
likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Hurricane Kay Forecast Discussion Number 18</title>

Hurricane Kay Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122022
300 PM MDT Thu Sep 08 2022
 
Satellite imagery and reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane
Hunter aircraft show that Kay continues to weaken.  The aircraft
did not find winds supporting hurricane intensity in the part of
the storm it sampled, and it reported that the central pressure has
risen to 982 mb.  However, the plane was not able to sample the area
of convection just northeast of the center where the strongest
winds were likely occurring.  The initial intensity is reduced to 65
kt on the premise that those winds still exist in the northeastern
quadrant.  However, this could be generous.
 
The core of Kay will be crossing portions of Baja California near
Punta Eugenia during the next few hours, and then move back over
the cold water of the Pacific.  This combination should cause
additional weakening.  Kay is expected to weaken to a tropical
storm during the next few hours, and the cyclone is forecast to
lose its convection in about 48-60 h at roughly the same time the
winds drop below 35 kt.  After that, the cyclone should quickly
decay to a remnant area of low pressure.
 
Kay continues to move north-northwestward or 335/12 kt. There is 
again no change to the previous track forecast philosophy.  A 
mid-level ridge to the east of Kay should steer it on a 
north-northwestward heading during the next 24 to 36 hours.  After 
that time, a weaker and more vertically shallow Kay is expected to 
turn more westward, and eventually southward to the southeast of a 
low-level ridge over the eastern Pacific.  The new track forecast 
again has only minor adjustments from the previous forecast.
 
Recent scatterometer and dropsonde data indicate that Kay remains a
very large tropical cyclone, with a large area of tropical-storm-
force winds over the Gulf of California. It is also producing an
extensive area of high seas, with swells affecting portions of
southwestern Mexico, the Gulf of California, and the Baja California
peninsula.  Although Kay is forecast to weaken, high wind, surf, and
rainfall impacts will continue to extend far from the center so
users should not focus on the exact forecast track.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding, including 
landslides, across the Baja California peninsula and portions of 
mainland northwestern Mexico through Saturday morning.  Flash, 
urban, and small stream flooding is likely across Southern 
California beginning Friday, especially in and near the peninsular 
ranges. Flash, urban, and small stream flooding is possible 
beginning Friday in Southwest Arizona.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are occuring over portion of the central
Baja California Peninsula and should continue for a few more hours.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of the
Baja California peninsula, and these conditions are expected to 
spread northward during the next day or so, where a Tropical Storm 
Warning is in effect.
 
4. Strong winds not directly associated with Kay's core wind field
are expected across portions of southern California and extreme
southwestern Arizona beginning on Friday. For information on this
wind hazard, users should see High Wind Warnings and other products
from their local NWS Weather Forecast Office.
