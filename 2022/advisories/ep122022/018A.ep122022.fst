DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM MDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kay was located
near latitude 27.8 North, longitude 114.6 West. Kay is moving toward
the north-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h), and this general motion 
should continue through Friday.  A slower northwestward to 
west-northwestward motion is forecast to begin by late Friday and 
continue into Saturday.  A turn to the west is expected by Saturday 
night.  On the forecast track, the center of Kay will pass near the 
northwest coast of the Baja peninsula Friday and Friday night.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast during the 
next 48 hours.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles (350 km) 
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 983 mb (29.03 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Kay can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml.

WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occurring over the Tropical
Storm Warning area and are forecast to spread northward through
Friday.

Strong winds not directly associated with Kay's core wind field are
expected across portions of southern California and extreme
southwestern Arizona beginning on Friday. For information on this
wind hazard, users should see High Wind Warnings and other products
from their local NWS Weather Forecast Office.

STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal
flooding in areas of onshore winds along the west coast of the
central Baja California peninsula of Mexico. The surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.

RAINFALL: Kay is expected to produce the following rainfall totals
through Saturdayâ€¦

Baja California Peninsula: 6 to 10 inches, isolated maxima of 15
inches

Northwest Mainland Mexico:  2 to 4 inches, isolated maxima of 6
inches

Southernmost California:  2 to 4 inches with isolated maxima of 8
inches

Southwest Arizona: 1 to 2 inches with isolated maxima of 3 inches

These rainfall amounts could lead to flash flooding, with landslides
possible across mountainous areas of Mexico.

SURF:  Swells generated by Kay will continue to affect portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next day or so. Large
swells are expected to spread northward along the Baja California
peninsula coast, into the Gulf of California, and to southern
California during the next couple of days. These swells will
likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
