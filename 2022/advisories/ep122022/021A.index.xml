A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Punta Eugenia northward along the west coast of the Baja
California peninsula to the U.S./Mexico border
* Bahia de Los Angeles northward along the east coast of the Baja
California peninsula and then southward to Puerto Libertad in

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests in southern California should monitor the progress of Kay
and consult products from your local weather office.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM PDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Kay was
located near latitude 30.7 North, longitude 117.2 West. Kay is
moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). A turn toward the
west-northwest and a decrease in forward speed are expected later
today, and a turn to the west is expected by late Saturday. On the
forecast track, the center of Kay will move parallel to the coast of
the northwestern Baja California peninsula through today, and then
begin to move further offshore by Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are now near 45 mph (70 km/h) with higher
gusts. Weakening is forecast during the next couple of days, and Kay
is expected to degenerate into a remnant low on Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
mainly to the east of the center over the Gulf of California.  
During the past few hours, wind gusts of hurricane force have been 
reported in the mountains of southern California east and northeast 
of San Diego.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.29 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Kay can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of the
Tropical Storm Warning area.
 
Strong winds not directly associated with Kay's core wind field are
occurring across portions of southern California and extreme
southwestern Arizona. For information on this wind hazard, users
should see High Wind Warnings and other products from their local
NWS Weather Forecast Office.
 
STORM SURGE: Coastal flooding is possible in areas of onshore winds
along the west coast of the central and northern Baja California
peninsula of Mexico and along the coast of the northern Gulf of
California.  The flooding could be accompanied by large and
damaging waves.
 
RAINFALL: Kay is expected to produce the following rainfall totals
through Saturday...
 
Baja California: Additional rainfall of 3 to 6 inches with isolated
maxima of 10 inches. Event total rainfall 6 to 10 inches, isolated
maxima of 15 inches
 
Western Sonora: Additional rainfall of 1 to 2 inches with isolated
maxima of 4 inches. Event total rainfall 2 to 4 inches, isolated
maxima of 8 inches
 
Southernmost California:  2 to 4 inches with isolated maxima of 6 to
8 inches
 
Arizona and Southern Nevada: 1 to 2 inches with isolated maxima of 3
inches
 
These rainfall amounts could lead to flash flooding, with landslides
possible across mountainous areas of Mexico.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Kay will continue to affect portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next day or so. Large
swells are expected to spread northward along the Baja California
peninsula coast, into the Gulf of California, and to southern
California during the next couple of days. These swells will
likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM PDT.

Tropical Storm Kay Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122022
800 AM PDT Fri Sep 09 2022

Kay is gradually becoming less organized.  There is currently 
minimal convection near its center of circulation, although there is 
a complex of convective bands occurring about 75-150 n mi north of 
the center. Doppler radar data from Yuma and San Diego has shown 
winds as high as 60 kt aloft, although it is unclear how well these 
winds are mixing down to the surface.  Based on the radar and 
satellite intensity estimates, the initial intensity is reduced to 
45 kt, and this could be a bit generous.  An Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft is enroute to investigate Kay.
 
Kay should continue to weaken as it reaches sea surface 
temperatures of 20-21C by 24 h, and the dynamical model suggest it 
should stop producing convection near or just after that time.  The 
new intensity forecast shows the cyclone as a minimal tropical storm 
in 24 h, followed by decay to a remnant low as the convection 
dissipates and the winds drop below tropical-storm force.  The 
global models indicate that the remnant low should dissipate 
between 96-120 h, and the new intensity forecast follows this. 

The initial motion is now northwestward or 320/ 11 kt.  A mid-level 
ridge to the north of Kay is expected to cause the cyclone to 
gradually turn west-northwestward away from land in the next 12 h, 
followed by a westward turn between 12-24 h.  After that time, 
low-level ridging in the Eastern Pacific should steer the remnant 
low slowly southward and then southeastward before the system 
dissipates completely.  There was little change in the track 
forecast guidance since the last advisory, and the new forecast 
track is similar to the previous track.
 
Although Kay's intensity has decreased, the tropical cyclone 34-kt 
wind radii remain quite large on its eastern side. Wind, surf, and 
rainfall impacts continue to extend far from the center so users 
should not focus on the exact forecast track of Kay.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. As the center of Kay passes just offshore, heavy rainfall will 
likely result in flash flooding, including possible landslides, 
across the Baja California peninsula and portions of mainland 
northwestern Mexico through Saturday morning.  Flash, urban, and 
small stream flooding is likely across Southern California beginning 
today, especially in and near the peninsular ranges. Flash, urban, 
and small stream flooding is possible beginning today in Arizona 
and southern Nevada.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of the Baja
California peninsula, and these conditions extend all the way to the
northern Gulf of California coastline, where a Tropical Storm
Warning is in effect.
 
3. Strong winds not directly associated with Kay's core wind field
are occurring across portions of southern California and extreme
southwestern Arizona. For information on this wind hazard, users 
should see High Wind Warnings and other products from their local 
NWS Weather Forecast Office.
