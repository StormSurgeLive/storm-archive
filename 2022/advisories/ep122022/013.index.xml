WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has upgraded the Tropical Storm Watch to a
Tropical Storm Warning for the west coast of the Baja California
peninsula from San Jose De Las Palomas to Cabo San Quintin. The
Tropical Storm Warning has been extended on the east coast of Baja 
California from Bahia de Los Angeles northward over the entire 
northern coast of Gulf of California and southward along mainland 
Mexico to Guaymas. A Tropical Storm Watch has been issued on the 
west coast of the Baja California peninsula from Cabo San Quintin 
northward to the U.S./Mexico border.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* North of Punta Abreojos to San Jose De Las Palomas
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Puerto Cortes to Punta Abreojos
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Punta Abreojos southward to Cabo San Lucas
* San Jose De Las Palomas to Cabo San Quintin
* Cabo San Lucas northward along the entire east of Baja and then
southward to Guaymas in mainland Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Cabo San Quintin to U.S./Mexico border
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area, in this case within the next 36 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests in southern California should monitor the progress of Kay
and consult products from your local weather office.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kay was located
near latitude 21.1 North, longitude 112.6 West. Kay is moving toward
the north-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this motion should
continue into Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of Kay is
expected to pass to the west of the southern Baja California
peninsula today, and be near the west-central coast of the Baja
California peninsula Thursday and Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 105 mph (165 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is forecast 
today. Although weakening is forecast to begin by Thursday, Kay is 
expected to remain a large hurricane when it passes near the 
west-central coast of the Baja California peninsula.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles
(370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 967 mb (28.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Kay can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the Hurricane Warning
area beginning on Thursday, and are possible within the Hurricane
Watch area Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the
Tropical Storm Warning area beginning later this morning and are
forecast to spread northward through Friday.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the Tropical Storm Watch on Friday.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal 
flooding near where the center passes the coast in areas of onshore 
winds, or east of the center if Kay makes landfall along the 
western Baja peninsula of Mexico. The surge will be accompanied by 
large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Kay is expected to produce the following rainfall totals
through Saturdayâ€¦
 
Baja California Peninsula: 6 to 10 inches, isolated maxima of 15
inches
 
Northwest Mainland Mexico:  2 to 4 inches, isolated maxima of 6
inches
 
Southernmost California:  2 to 4 inches with maxima of 6 inches
 
Southwest Arizona: 1 to 2 inches with isolated maxima of 3 inches
 
These rainfall amounts could lead to flash flooding, with landslides
possible across mountainous areas of Mexico.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Kay will continue to affect portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next day or so. Large
swells are expected to spread northward along the Baja California
peninsula coast, into the Gulf of California, and to southern 
California during the next few days. These swells will likely cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Kay Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122022
900 AM MDT Wed Sep 07 2022
 
Kay appears to be on a strengthening trend. Satellite images 
indicate that the hurricane has a large eye, with a diameter of 
about 25 n mi, and a nearly symmetric eyewall. There are some dry 
slots between the eyewall and rainbands, however. The subjective 
satellite intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB have increased to 
T5.0/90 kt, and the initial intensity is raised to 90 kt based on 
that data. This intensity estimate is below the latest ADT values 
from CIMSS at the University of Wisconsin, so it is possible that 
Kay could be a little stronger. An Air Force Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft is en route to investigate Kay this afternoon, and the data 
the plane collects will be very helpful in assessing the intensity 
and structure of the hurricane.
 
Kay will likely strengthen a little more, and it could become
a major hurricane while it remains in conducive environmental
conditions today. However, by early tomorrow, the hurricane is
expected to move over sub 26 C SSTs and move over progressively
cooler waters during the following few days. The cooler SSTs and
drier air should cause a steady weakening trend later this week
and this weekend. The NHC intensity forecast is a little higher
than the previous one in the short term, and lies at the high end of
the guidance during the first few days of the forecast.
 
The hurricane is moving north-northwestward, and that motion should
continue for the next couple of days taking the core of Kay very
near or over the west-central Baja California peninsula on Thursday
and Friday. After that time, when Kay moves close to northern Baja,
a turn to the left is expected as the shallow system becomes steered
by the flow on the south side of a low- to mid-level ridge. The
model guidance is in fairly good agreement, and the NHC track
forecast is essentially the same as the previous one and close to
the various consensus models.
 
Kay is a very large tropical cyclone. It is producing an extensive 
area of high seas, with swells affecting portions of southwestern 
Mexico and the southern Baja California peninsula. Although Kay is 
likely to weaken before it makes landfall or moves very close to the 
west-central coast of the Baja peninsula, it is forecast to remain a 
large and dangerous hurricane through that time. In addition, high 
wind, surf, and rainfall impacts will extend far from the center so 
users should not focus on the exact forecast track.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding, including
landslides, across the Baja California peninsula and portions of
mainland northwestern Mexico through Saturday morning. Flash
flooding is possible across the peninsular ranges of southern
California Friday night into Saturday morning.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are expected along portions of the
west-central Baja California coast on Thursday and Thursday night,
and a hurricane warning is in effect for that area.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are beginning over portions of the
Baja California peninsula, and these conditions are expected 
to spread northward during the next day or so, where a
Tropical Storm Warning is in effect.
