HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Kay can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml.

WIND: Tropical-storm-force wind gusts in outer rainbands are likely 
near the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next day or so.  
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in the 
southern Baja California peninsula by early Wednesday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Kay will affect portions of the coast of 
southwestern Mexico during the next few days. Large swells are 
likely to reach the southern portion of the Baja California 
peninsula on Tuesday and are expected to spread northward and into 
the Gulf of California later this week. These swells will likely 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.

RAINFALL:  Kay is expected to produce 3 to 6 inches of rainfall, 
with isolated storm total amounts of 10 inches, across portions of 
the Mexican Riviera and western Mexico through Wednesday night. 
These rainfall amounts could lead to flash flooding, including 
landslides.
