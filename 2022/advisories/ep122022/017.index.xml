DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kay was located 
near latitude 25.8 North, longitude 113.8 West.  Kay is moving 
toward the north-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this general 
motion should continue through Friday.  A slower northwestward to 
west-northwestward motion is forecast to begin by late Friday and 
continue into Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of Kay is 
expected move over or near the west-central coast of the Baja 
California peninsula later today and tonight, and near the northwest 
coast of the Baja California peninsula on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Weakening is expected during the next couple of days.
However, Kay is expected to remain a large hurricane when it passes
over or near the west-central coast of the Baja California 
peninsula today.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles
(370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 974 mb (28.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Kay can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the Hurricane Warning
area beginning during the next several hours, and are possible
within the Hurricane Watch area today.  Tropical storm conditions
are occurring over the Tropical Storm Warning area and are forecast
to spread northward through Friday.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal
flooding near where the center passes the coast in areas of onshore
winds, or east of the center if Kay makes landfall along the
western Baja peninsula of Mexico. The surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: Kay is expected to produce the following rainfall totals
through Saturdayâ€¦
 
Baja California Peninsula: 6 to 10 inches, isolated maxima of 15
inches
 
Northwest Mainland Mexico:  2 to 4 inches, isolated maxima of 6
inches
 
Southernmost California:  2 to 4 inches with maxima of 6 inches
 
Southwest Arizona: 1 to 2 inches with isolated maxima of 3 inches
 
These rainfall amounts could lead to flash flooding, with landslides
possible across mountainous areas of Mexico.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Kay will continue to affect portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next day or so. Large
swells are expected to spread northward along the Baja California
peninsula coast, into the Gulf of California, and to southern
California during the next couple of days. These swells will
likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Hurricane Kay Forecast Discussion Number 17</title>

Hurricane Kay Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122022
900 AM MDT Thu Sep 08 2022
 
Kay continues to lose organization in satellite imagery, as there
is no longer an eye present and the central convection continues to
decrease.  The various subjective and objective satellite intensity
estimates are in the 65-77 kt range, and based on this the initial
intensity is held at a possibly generous 75 kt.  An Air Force
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is currently enroute to
investigate Kay.
 
Kay is now over 23C sea surface temperatures and will be traversing
progressively cooler SSTs over the next couple of days.  That,
along with land interaction and a gradually drying mid-level air
mass, is expected to cause gradual weakening over the next couple of
days. However, Kay is forecast to remain a hurricane when it passes
near or over the west-central coast of the Baja California peninsula
in about 12 h, and remain a tropical storm as it passes just west
of the northwestern portion of the peninsula on Friday.  The cyclone
is expected to lose its convection and become post-tropical between 
48-60 h, and then decay to a remnant low pressure area by 72 h.
 
Kay continues to move north-northwestward or 345/13 kt. There is no 
change to the previous track forecast philosophy.  A mid-level 
ridge to the east of Kay should steer it on a north-northwestward
heading during the next 24 to 36 hours.  After that time, a weaker
and more vertically shallow Kay is expected to turn more westward,
and eventually southward to the southeast of a low-level ridge over
the eastern Pacific.  The track guidance has changed little since 
the last advisory, so the new track forecast has only minor 
adjustments from the previous forecast.
 
Kay remains a very large tropical cyclone. It is producing an 
extensive area of high seas, with swells affecting portions of 
southwestern Mexico, the Gulf of California, and the Baja California 
peninsula.  Although Kay is likely to weaken before it makes 
landfall or moves very close to the west-central coast of the Baja 
peninsula, it is forecast to remain a large and dangerous hurricane 
through that time. In addition, high wind, surf, and rainfall 
impacts will extend far from the center so users should not focus on 
the exact forecast track.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. As the center of Kay passes just offshore, heavy rainfall could 
lead to flash flooding, including landslides, across the Baja 
California peninsula and portions of mainland northwestern Mexico 
through Saturday morning.  Flash, urban, and small stream flooding 
is likely across Southern California beginning Friday, especially in 
and near the peninsular ranges. Flash, urban, and small stream 
flooding is possible beginning Friday in Southwest Arizona.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are expected along portions of the
west-central Baja California coast later this morning through
this evening, and a hurricane warning is in effect for that area.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of the
Baja California peninsula, and these conditions are expected
to spread northward during the next day or so, where a
Tropical Storm Warning is in effect.
