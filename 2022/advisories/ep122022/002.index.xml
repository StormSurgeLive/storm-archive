Tropical Storm Kay Advisory Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122022
400 PM CDT Sun Sep 04 2022
 
...DEPRESSION STRENGTHENS INTO TROPICAL STORM KAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 400 PM CDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.8N 102.5W
ABOUT 225 MI...365 KM SW OF ACAPULCO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1004 MB...29.65 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in southwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula
should closely monitor the progress of Kay.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Kay was 
located near latitude 14.8 North, longitude 102.5 West. Kay is 
moving toward the west-northwest at 13 mph (20 km/h) and a west to 
west-northwest motion is expected during the next couple of days, 
followed by a turn to the north.  Kay is expected to remain south of 
southwestern Mexico during the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Strengthening is expected, and Kay is forecast to 
become a hurricane in a day or two.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Kay can be found in the Tropical 
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header 
WTPZ42 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Kay are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico.  These swells are expected to reach the
southern portion of the Baja California peninsula by Tuesday, and
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Kay is expected to produce 1 to 3 inches of rainfall,
with isolated storm totals of 5 inches, across coastal portions of
southwestern Mexico from Guerrero northwestward to Jalisco over the
next few days.
 
WIND: Gusty winds are likely near the coast of southwestern Mexico
in outer rainbands during the next couple of days.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Kay Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122022
400 PM CDT Sun Sep 04 2022
 
Satellite data indicate that the depression has strengthened into 
Tropical Storm Kay.  Although the convective pattern is still a bit 
ragged, banding features have improved on the south side of the 
cyclone. A pair of ASCAT passes from a few hours ago showed peak 
winds around 35 kt to the northeast of the center.  Based on that 
data and the T2.5 Dvorak classification from TAFB, the initial 
intensity is increased a little to 35 kt.  Kay is a large storm with 
its cloud field extending several hundred miles across, and some of 
the outer bands are moving across the coast of southwestern Mexico.
 
The center is located a little to the north of the previous track, 
and the estimated motion is now 290/11 kt. This general motion is 
expected to continue for the next couple of days, keeping the core 
of the system south of the coast of southwestern Mexico during that 
time.  Thereafter, the models all show a turn to the northwest and 
then the north.  Overall, there has been little change in the model 
guidance this cycle and the solutions remain relatively tightly 
clustered.  Despite the tightly-clustered guidance, the GFS and 
ECMWF ensemble spreads encompass as far east as the Gulf of 
California and as far west as a few hundred miles west of the Baja 
California peninsula.  The NHC track forecast is a little to the 
north of the previous one in the short term, due to the initial 
position and motion, but ends up close to the previous track beyond 
48 h.
 
Kay is likely to strengthen during the next few days while it 
remains over warm water and embedded in a very moist environment. 
Although the Rapid Intensification Indices in the SHIPS model are 
relatively high, rapid intensification in the short term appears 
unlikely given the broad structure of the cyclone and expected 
moderate shear.  The new NHC intensity forecast is largely 
consistent with the previous one and shows steady strengthening 
during the next 2 to 3 days.  Beyond that time, weakening is 
expected due to cooler SSTs.  Regardless of the details, Kay is 
expected to be a significant hurricane near Baja in a few days.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Although Kay is expected to stay offshore, heavy rainfall could
lead to localized flash flooding in portions of southwestern Mexico.
 
2. Interests in the Baja California peninsula should closely monitor 
Kay as tropical storm or hurricane watches could be required tonight 
or on Monday.
