A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Puerto San Andresito northward along the west coast of the Baja
California peninsula to the U.S./Mexico border
* North of Loreto northward along the east coast of the Baja
California peninsula and then southward to Guaymas in mainland
Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests in southern California should monitor the progress of Kay
and consult products from your local weather office.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM PDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Kay was
located near latitude 28.4 North, longitude 115.0 West.  Kay is
moving toward the north-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A slower 
northwestward to west-northwestward motion is forecast to begin 
on Friday and continue into Saturday.  A turn to the west is 
expected by late Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of Kay 
will pass near or west of the northwest coast of the Baja peninsula 
Friday and Friday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast during the 
next couple of days, and Kay is expected to degenerate into a 
remnant low by late Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 985 mb (29.09 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Kay can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of the
Tropical Storm Warning area and are forecast to spread northward
through Friday.
 
Strong winds not directly associated with Kay's core wind field are
expected across portions of southern California and extreme
southwestern Arizona beginning on Friday. For information on this
wind hazard, users should see High Wind Warnings and other products
from their local NWS Weather Forecast Office.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal
flooding in areas of onshore winds along the west coast of the
central Baja California peninsula of Mexico. The surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: Kay is expected to produce the following rainfall totals
through Saturday:
 
Baja California Peninsula: 6 to 10 inches, isolated maxima of 15
inches
 
Northwest Mainland Mexico:  2 to 4 inches, isolated maxima of 6
inches
 
Southernmost California:  3 to 5 inches with isolated maxima of 8
inches
 
Southwest Arizona: 1 to 2 inches with isolated maxima of 3 inches
 
These rainfall amounts could lead to flash flooding, with landslides
possible across mountainous areas of Mexico.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Kay will continue to affect portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next day or so. Large
swells are expected to spread northward along the Baja California
peninsula coast, into the Gulf of California, and to southern
California during the next couple of days. These swells will
likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1100 PM PDT.
Next complete advisory at 200 AM PDT.

Tropical Storm Kay Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122022
800 PM PDT Thu Sep 08 2022

Based on satellite fixes, the center of Kay is estimated to have 
moved back over the waters of the east Pacific to the north of 
Punta Eugenia.  Most of the deep convection is occurring over the 
northern semicircle of the circulation and the cloud tops continue 
to gradually warm.  Using subjective Dvorak Current Intensity 
numbers, the advisory intensity is set at 55 kt, although this could 
still be generous.  An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
is scheduled to investigate Kay in a few hours.

Steady weakening should occur during the next 48 hours due to 
passage over progressively cooler ocean waters west of the northern 
Baja California peninsula.  The official intensity forecast is a 
little below the previous NHC prediction and is in good agreement 
with the latest statistical/dynamical LGEM model guidance.  This is 
also on the high end of the intensity model suite.  The system is 
likely to degenerate into a remnant low pressure area in 48 hours, 
if not sooner.
 
Kay continues to move north-northwestward or around 330/12 kt. 
A mid-level ridge to the east and northeast of the cyclone should 
steer it on a north-northwestward to northwestward heading for the 
next 24 to 36 hours.  Thereafter, the weakening and increasingly 
shallow Kay is expected to turn more westward, and eventually 
southward to the southeast of a low-level ridge over the eastern 
Pacific.  The official track forecast has been shifted a little 
south and west of the previous one, toward the latest dynamical 
model consensus.

Although it is weakening, Kay remains a fairly large tropical 
cyclone.  Wind, surf, and rainfall impacts continue to extend far 
from the center so users should not focus on the exact forecast 
track.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding, including 
landslides, across the Baja California peninsula and portions of 
mainland northwestern Mexico through Saturday morning.  Flash, 
urban, and small stream flooding is likely across Southern 
California beginning Friday, especially in and near the peninsular 
ranges. Flash, urban, and small stream flooding is possible 
beginning Friday in Southwest Arizona.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of the
Baja California peninsula, and these conditions should continue to
spread northward during the next day or so, where a Tropical Storm
Warning is in effect.
 
4. Strong winds not directly associated with Kay's core wind field
are expected across portions of southern California and extreme
southwestern Arizona beginning on Friday. For information on this
wind hazard, users should see High Wind Warnings and other products
from their local NWS Weather Forecast Office.
