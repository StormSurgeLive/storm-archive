DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM MDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kay was located 
near latitude 16.0 North, longitude 108.1 West. Kay is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A turn toward the 
northwest is expected on Tuesday, followed by a north-northwestward 
motion Tuesday night through Thursday. On the forecast track, the 
center of Kay is expected to remain southwest and west of 
southwestern Mexico through Tuesday, then move to the west of the 
southern Baja California peninsula on Wednesday and Thursday.  

Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and 
Kay is expected to be a strong hurricane when it passes near the 
Baja California peninsula during the middle of the week.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Kay can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml.

WIND: Tropical-storm-force wind gusts in outer rainbands are likely
near the coast of southwestern Mexico through Tuesday. Tropical
storm conditions are possible in the watch area in the southern Baja
California peninsula by early Wednesday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Kay will affect portions of the coast of
southwestern Mexico during the next few days. Large swells are
likely to reach the southern portion of the Baja California
peninsula on Tuesday and are expected to spread northward and into
the Gulf of California through midweek. These swells will likely
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.

RAINFALL:  Kay is expected to produce 3 to 6 inches of rainfall,
with isolated storm total amounts of 10 inches, across portions of
the Mexican Riviera and western Mexico through Wednesday night.
These rainfall amounts could lead to flash flooding, including
landslides.
