Hurricane Kay Advisory Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122022
300 PM MDT Tue Sep 06 2022
 
...HURRICANE WATCH AND NEW TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS ISSUED FOR
PORTIONS OF THE BAJA CALIFORNIA PENINSULA...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM MDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.8N 111.0W
ABOUT 290 MI...470 KM SSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...85 MPH...140 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...978 MB...28.88 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has issued a Hurricane Watch for the west 
coast of the Baja California peninsula from Puerto Cortes to Punta 
Eugenia.  

A Tropical Storm Warning has been extended northward to 
Punta Abreojos on the west coast and to Santa Rosalia on the east 
coast.  

A Tropical Storm Watch has been issued from Punta Eugenia to 
San Jose De Las Palomas on the west coast and from Santa Rosalia to
Bahia De Los Angeles on the east coast.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Puerto Cortes to Punta Eugenia
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Punta Abreojos southward to Cabo San Lucas
* Cabo San Lucas northward to Santa Rosalia
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* North of Santa Rosalia to Bahia De Los Angeles
* North of Punta Eugenia to San Jose De Las Palomas
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests north of the watch area on the Baja California peninsula
should closely monitor the progress of Kay as additional tropical
storm watches could be required tonight.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM MDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kay was located
near latitude 18.8 North, longitude 111.0 West. Kay is moving toward
the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h) and this general motion should
continue through tonight.  A turn toward the north-northwest is
expected on Wednesday, and this motion should continue into Friday.
On the forecast track, the center of Kay is expected to pass to the
west of the southern Baja California peninsula on Wednesday, and be
near the west-central coast of the Baja California peninsula
Thursday and Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast during the next 36 hours, and Kay
could become a major hurricane during that time.  Weakening is
forecast to begin by Thursday, but Kay is forecast to remain a
strong hurricane when it passes near the Baja California peninsula.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles
(335 km).  A weather station on Socorro Island recently reported a 
wind gust of 50 mph (80 km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure based on data from the Air Force 
Hurricane Hunters is 978 mb (28.88 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Kay can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch area
beginning Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the 
Tropical Storm Warning area beginning Wednesday morning and are 
forecast to spread northward Wednesday night and Thursday.  Tropical 
storm conditions are possible in the Tropical Storm Watch area on
Thursday.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge could produce coastal flooding near 
where the center passes the coast in areas of onshore winds, or 
east of the center if Kay makes landfall. The surge will be 
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Kay is expected to produce rainfall totals of 6 to 10 
inches with isolated maxima of 15 inches across the central portions 
of the Baja California peninsula through Friday.  Rainfall totals of 
3 to 5 inches with maxima of 8 inches possible across the southern 
portion of the Baja California peninsula.  Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 
inches possible across northwestern portions of mainland Mexico.   
These rainfall amounts could lead to flash flooding, including 
landslides. 
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Kay will continue to affect portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next couple of days.
Large swells are expected to spread northward along the Baja
California coast and into the Gulf of California during the next
few days. These swells will likely cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.

Hurricane Kay Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122022
300 PM MDT Tue Sep 06 2022
 
Kay continues to be relatively steady in strength.  The Air 
Force Hurricane Hunters so far have found peak flight-level winds 
of 75 kt, and the initial intensity is held at 75 kt pending 
the completion of the reconnaissance mission.  The minimum pressure 
is estimated to be 978 mb based on the aircraft data.  The center 
of Kay is currently over Socorro Island, and the island is about to 
experience strong winds on the system's east side.  The aircraft 
data and a recent ASCAT-B pass indicate that Kay is a large 
hurricane, with its tropical-storm- force winds extending outward 
about 200 miles from the center.  Kay is also producing a large area 
of high seas, with swells currently affecting portions of 
southwestern Mexico and the southern Baja California peninsula.
 
Kay is moving northwestward and it continues moving along the 
previous forecast track. A northwest to north-northwest 
motion is expected during the next few days, which will likely 
bring the core of Kay very near the west-central Baja California 
coast on Thursday and Friday. After that time, a turn to the left 
is predicted when the system is steered by a low- to mid-level 
ridge over the western United States.  The GFS has shifted a bit to 
the right this cycle, but the other models have generally held 
steady.  Little change was made to the previous NHC track forecast 
and this one lies near the middle of the guidance envelope.
 
The hurricane is still feeling some effects from moderate northerly
vertical wind shear, but the models suggest that the shear should
decrease during the next day or so.  The anticipated more conducive
upper-level wind pattern combined with warm SSTs and a moist
environment should allow Kay to strengthen during the next 24-36 
hours, and it could become a major hurricane during that time.  
Thereafter, sharply cooler SSTs and drier air should end the 
opportunity for strengthening and induce steady weakening.  Kay is 
expected to become a post-tropical cyclone in 4 to 5 days when it 
is forecast to be over quite cool SSTs of 21-22 C.  The NHC 
intensity forecast is near or a little above the high end of the 
guidance, especially during the first 36-48 hours.
 
Although Kay is likely to weaken before it makes its closest
approach to the west-central coast of the Baja peninsula, it is
forecast to remain a large and dangerous hurricane through that 
time.  In addition, high wind, surf, and rainfall impacts will 
extend far from the center so users should not focus on the exact 
forecast track. 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Kay could lead to flash flooding, including
landslides, across portions of the Baja California peninsula 
through Friday.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
Baja California peninsula beginning Wednesday morning, where a 
Tropical Storm Warning is in effect.
 
3. Hurricane conditions are possible along portions of the
west-central Baja California coast on Thursday, where a hurricane
watch has been issued.  Additional tropical storm watches and 
warnings for the northern Baja California peninsula could be 
required tonight and Wednesday.
