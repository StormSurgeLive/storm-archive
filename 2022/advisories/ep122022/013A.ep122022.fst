DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 PM MDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kay was located
near latitude 21.4 North, longitude 112.8 West. Kay is moving toward
the north-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this motion should
continue into Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of Kay is
expected to pass to the west of the southern Baja California
peninsula this afternoon, and be near the west-central coast of the 
Baja California peninsula Thursday and Friday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Some strengthening is possible this afternoon.  Although 
weakening is forecast to begin by Thursday, Kay is expected to 
remain a large hurricane when it passes near the west-central coast 
of the Baja California peninsula.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230
miles (370 km).

The minimum central pressure just reported by an Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 971 mb (28.67 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Kay can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml.

WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the Hurricane Warning
area beginning on Thursday, and are possible within the Hurricane
Watch area Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the
Tropical Storm Warning area beginning in the next few hours and are
forecast to spread northward through Friday.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the Tropical Storm Watch on Friday.

STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal
flooding near where the center passes the coast in areas of onshore
winds, or east of the center if Kay makes landfall along the
western Baja peninsula of Mexico. The surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.

RAINFALL:  Kay is expected to produce the following rainfall totals
through Saturdayâ€¦

Baja California Peninsula: 6 to 10 inches, isolated maxima of 15
inches

Northwest Mainland Mexico:  2 to 4 inches, isolated maxima of 6
inches

Southernmost California:  2 to 4 inches with maxima of 6 inches

Southwest Arizona: 1 to 2 inches with isolated maxima of 3 inches

These rainfall amounts could lead to flash flooding, with landslides
possible across mountainous areas of Mexico.

SURF:  Swells generated by Kay will continue to affect portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next day or so. Large
swells are expected to spread northward along the Baja California
peninsula coast, into the Gulf of California, and to southern
California during the next few days. These swells will likely cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
