None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Loreto southward to Cabo San Lucas
* Cabo San Lucas northward to Puerto San Andresito
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are 
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests north of the watch area in Baja California should closely
monitor the progress of Kay as hurricane or tropical storm watches
could be required tonight or on Tuesday.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products 
issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM MDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kay was located 
near latitude 15.9 North, longitude 107.8 West. Kay is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A west-northwest motion is 
expected to continue through tonight, followed by a northwest to 
north-northwest motion by late Tuesday. On the forecast track, the 
center of Kay is expected to remain southwest and west of 
southwestern Mexico through Tuesday, then move to the west of the 
southern Baja California peninsula on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast through midweek.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175
miles (280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Kay can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml.
 
WIND: Tropical-storm-force wind gusts in outer rainbands are likely 
near the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next day or so.  
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in the 
southern Baja California peninsula by early Wednesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Kay will affect portions of the coast of 
southwestern Mexico during the next few days. Large swells are 
likely to reach the southern portion of the Baja California 
peninsula on Tuesday and are expected to spread northward and into 
the Gulf of California later this week. These swells will likely 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Kay is expected to produce 3 to 6 inches of rainfall, 
with isolated storm total amounts of 10 inches, across portions of 
the Mexican Riviera and western Mexico through Wednesday night. 
These rainfall amounts could lead to flash flooding, including 
landslides.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM MDT.

Hurricane Kay Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122022
300 PM MDT Mon Sep 05 2022
 
Satellite images indicate that banding features have become better
defined during the past several hours.  The low-level center is now
more embedded in the deep convection, and Kay has strengthened 
significantly.  An ASCAT pass from around 16Z showed peak winds in
the 50-55 kt range on the system's east side, and the 18Z Dvorak
estimates were both 3.5/55 kt from TAFB and SAB.  The Air Force
Hurricane Hunters are currently investigating Kay and the aircraft
recently reported a minimum pressure of 981 mb, which is notably
lower than previously estimated.  The aircraft also measured
maximum SFMR and flight-level winds to support increasing the
intensity to 70 kt.
 
The storm continues to move westward, but at a slightly slower pace
of around 10 kt. The model guidance remains in fairly good agreement
that a turn to the west-northwest is likely to begin tonight
followed by a northwestward motion by Tuesday night. Although this
should take the core of Kay well to the west of the southern tip of
the Baja California peninsula, tropical storm conditions are
possible there by early Wednesday given its expansive wind field.
Kay will likely be very near the west-central portion of the
peninsula on Thursday and Friday, and hurricane watches could be
required for that region tonight or tomorrow.  After that time, a
turn to the west seems likely as Kay weakens and is steered by a
low- to mid-level ridge building over the southwestern United
States. The NHC track forecast is a little to the south of the
previous one in the short term, which is based on the initial motion
and position, but is otherwise largely unchanged.
 
Steady strengthening is expected to continue during the next couple
of days as Kay remains over warm SSTs and embedded in a moist air
mass.  In addition, the storm is forecast to move into a lower wind
shear environment in 36 to 48 hours.  The NHC intensity forecast is
near the high end of the model guidance. Beyond a couple of days, 
however, progressively cooler SSTs and a drier air mass should end 
the strengthening trend and induce steady weakening.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Gusts to tropical-storm-force and rough surf along the coast of
southwestern Mexico are expected through Tuesday.  In addition,
heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding, including landslides,
across portions of the Mexican Riviera and western Mexico through
Wednesday night.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible across the southern
Baja California peninsula by early Wednesday, where a Tropical
Storm Watch has been issued.
 
3. While the details of the long-range track and intensity 
forecasts remain uncertain, there is increasing risk of significant 
wind, surf, and rainfall impacts across the central portion of the 
Baja California peninsula.  A tropical storm or hurricane watch
could be issued for that region tonight or Tuesday.
