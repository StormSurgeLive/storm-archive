The government of Mexico has extended the Tropical Storm Warning
along the west coast of the Baja California peninsula northward to
the U.S./Mexico border.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* North of Punta Abreojos to San Jose De Las Palomas
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Puerto Cortes to Punta Abreojos
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Punta Abreojos southward to Cabo San Lucas
* San Jose De Las Palomas to the U.S./Mexico border
* Cabo San Lucas northward along the entire east coast of the Baja 
California peninsula and then southward to Guaymas in mainland 
Mexico
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area, in this case within the next 12 to 18 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests in southern California should monitor the progress of Kay
and consult products from your local weather office.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kay was located
near latitude 24.5 North, longitude 113.4 West. Kay is moving toward
the north-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h), and this general motion
should continue into midday Friday.  A slower northwestward to 
west-northwestward motion is forecast to begin by late Friday and 
continue into Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of Kay is 
expected move near or over the west-central coast of the Baja 
California peninsula later today and tonight, and near the northwest 
coast of the Baja California peninsula on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Weakening is expected during the next couple of days.
However, Kay is expected to remain a large hurricane when it passes
near the west-central coast of the Baja California peninsula today.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles
(370 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure measured by an Air Force Reserve 
reconnaissance aircraft is 974 mb (28.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Kay can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the Hurricane Warning
area beginning by late this morning, and are possible within the
Hurricane Watch area today.  Tropical storm conditions are occurring
over the Tropical Storm Warning area and are forecast to spread
northward through Friday.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal
flooding near where the center passes the coast in areas of onshore
winds, or east of the center if Kay makes landfall along the
western Baja peninsula of Mexico. The surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL: Kay is expected to produce the following rainfall totals
through Saturday...
 
Baja California Peninsula: 6 to 10 inches, isolated maxima of 15
inches
 
Northwest Mainland Mexico:  2 to 4 inches, isolated maxima of 6
inches
 
Southernmost California:  2 to 4 inches with maxima of 6 inches
 
Southwest Arizona: 1 to 2 inches with isolated maxima of 4 inches
 
These rainfall amounts could lead to flash flooding, with landslides
possible across mountainous areas of Mexico.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Kay will continue to affect portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next day or so. Large
swells are expected to spread northward along the Baja California
peninsula coast, into the Gulf of California, and to southern
California during the next couple of days. These swells will
likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next intermediate advisory at 600 AM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.

<title>Hurricane Kay Forecast Discussion Number 16</title>

Hurricane Kay Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122022
300 AM MDT Thu Sep 08 2022
 
The satellite presentation of Kay has gradually degraded overnight
with the eye becoming less defined, and the deepest convection
confined to the southeastern and eastern portions of the
circulation.  An Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft that 
investigated Kay overnight has measured peak 700-mb flight-level 
winds of 78 kt.  Unfortunately the SFMR data appeared 
unrepresentative as compared to corresponding dropsonde surface 
winds and recent scatterometer data.  As a result, there is higher 
uncertainty in how much the flight-level winds are mixing to the 
surface.  The initial intensity has been conservatively reduced to 
75 kt, which is a blend of the flight-level reduced winds, and 
recent satellite intensity estimates.  The aircraft reported a 
minimum pressure of 974 mb on its final pass through the center. 

Kay has crossed the 26 degree Celsius isotherm and will be 
traversing progressively cooler SSTs over the next couple of days.  
That, along with a gradually drying mid-level air mass, is expected 
to cause gradual weakening over the next couple of days. However, 
Kay is forecast to remain a hurricane when it passes near or over 
the west-central coast of the Baja California peninsula later 
today, and remain a tropical storm as it passes just west of the 
northwestern portion of the peninsula on Friday.  Simulated 
satellite imagery from the global models suggest the convection 
will wane on Saturday, and Kay is forecast to become post-tropical 
at that time.  The new NHC intensity forecast calls for slightly 
faster rate of weakening than before, and is near the IVCN and HCCA 
consensus aids. 

Kay continues to move north-northwestward or 345/12 kt. A mid-level 
ridge to the east of Kay should steer it on a north-northwestward 
heading during the next 24 to 36 hours.  After that time, a weaker 
and more vertically shallow Kay is expected to turn more westward, 
and eventually southward to the southeast of a low-level ridge over 
the eastern Pacific.  The NHC track forecast lies near the HFIP 
corrected consensus model, and is quite similar to the previous 
official forecast. 
 
Kay is a very large tropical cyclone. It is producing an extensive
area of high seas, with swells affecting portions of southwestern
Mexico, the Gulf of California, and the Baja California peninsula. 
Although Kay is likely to weaken before it makes landfall or moves 
very close to the west-central coast of the Baja peninsula, it is 
forecast to remain a large and dangerous hurricane through that 
time. In addition, high wind, surf, and rainfall impacts will 
extend far from the center so users should not focus on the exact 
forecast track.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. As the center of Kay passes near or over the Baja California 
peninsula, heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding, including 
landslides, across the Baja California peninsula and portions of 
mainland northwestern Mexico through Saturday morning.  Flash, 
urban, and small stream flooding is possible across Southern 
California, especially in and near the peninsular ranges, and 
Southwest Arizona, Friday into Saturday.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are expected along portions of the
west-central Baja California coast later this morning through 
this evening, and a hurricane warning is in effect for that area.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of the
Baja California peninsula, and these conditions are expected
to spread northward during the next day or so, where a
Tropical Storm Warning is in effect.
