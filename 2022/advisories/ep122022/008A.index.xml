For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM MDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kay was located
near latitude 17.6 North, longitude 109.6 West. Kay is moving toward
the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this general motion should
continue through tonight.  A turn toward the north-northwest is
expected on Wednesday, and this motion should continue into
Thursday.  On the forecast track, the center of Kay is expected 
move to the west of the southern Baja California peninsula on 
Wednesday, and approach the west-central coast of the Baja 
California peninsula Wednesday night and Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next 36 hours, and Kay 
could become a major hurricane during that time. Weakening is 
forecast to begin by Thursday, but Kay is forecast to remain a 
strong hurricane when it passes near the Baja California peninsula.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175
miles (280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 977 mb (28.85 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Kay can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml.
 
WIND: Tropical-storm-force wind gusts in outer rainbands are likely 
to continue along the coast of southwestern Mexico today. Tropical 
storm conditions are expected within the warning area in the 
southern Baja California peninsula beginning Wednesday morning. 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in the 
southern Baja California peninsula by late Wednesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Kay will continue to affect portions of 
the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next couple of days. 
Large swells are beginning to reach the southern portion of the 
Baja California peninsula and are expected to spread northward and 
into the Gulf of California during the next few days. These swells 
will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. 
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Kay is expected to produce 4 to 8 inches of rainfall,
with isolated storm total amounts of 12 inches, across portions of
western Mexico, including the Baja California peninsula, through
Thursday night.  These rainfall amounts could lead to flash
flooding, including landslides.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Hurricane Kay Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Hurricane Kay Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122022
300 AM MDT Tue Sep 06 2022

The satellite presentation of Kay has improved within the past 
couple of hours.  A curved band with cloud top temperatures below 
-85C has wrapped around the center and has formed a ragged 
banding-type eye in infrared imagery.  The latest subjective and 
objective Dvorak satellite estimates are all around 65 kt, but with 
the earlier reconnaissance data supporting a higher intensity and 
the recent improvement in structure, the initial intensity has been 
raised to 75 kt.  Another Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft 
is scheduled to investigate Kay this afternoon. 

The much-anticipated northwestward turn appears to have occurred, 
and the initial motion estimate is now 310/11 kt.  Kay is forecast 
to move on a northwestward heading during the next 24 to 36 hours 
around a mid-level ridge centered over Mexico.  After that time, 
the hurricane is forecast to turn north-northwestward, bringing the 
core near the west-central coast of the Baja peninsula in 60-72 
hours.  Some of the dynamical track models including the HWRF, 
GFS and GFS ensemble mean, have made a noticeable eastward shift 
over the past few cycles, while the ECMWF has changed little. The 
updated NHC track forecast has been adjusted slightly east of the 
previous advisory out of respect for the aforementioned models, but 
it is not quite as far east as the latest GFS, GFS ensemble mean or 
HFIP corrected consensus. The forecast is a blend of the ECMWF and 
GFS and is just east of the simple consensus aids.   

Kay's outflow remains somewhat constricted over the northeastern 
quadrant due to moderate northeasterly shear.  However, the shear 
is forecast to relax over the next 24 to 36 hours, and given the 
recent improvement in organization, additional strengthening is 
expected during that time.  The NHC forecast has been raised from 
the previous advisory and is near the upper-end of the guidance in 
best agreement with the SHIPS model.  After 36 hours, Kay will be 
moving over decreasing sea surface temperatures and weakening 
should begin.  Although Kay is likely to weaken before it makes 
its closest approach to the west-central coast of the Baja 
peninsula, it is forecast to remain a large and strong hurricane at 
that time.  In addition, winds and rainfall impacts will extend far 
form the center so users should not focus on the exact forecast 
track.
 
The government of Mexico has issued a Tropical Storm Warning for 
the southern portions of the Baja California peninsula.  Additional
tropical storm or hurricane watches or warnings could be necessary
for portions of Baja California later today.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Kay could lead to flash flooding, including 
landslides, across portions of western Mexico, including the Baja 
California peninsula, through Thursday night.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the 
southern Baja California peninsula beginning Wednesday morning, 
where a Tropical Storm Warning is now in effect. 
 
3. While the details of the long-range track and intensity forecasts
remain uncertain, there is increasing risk of significant wind,
surf, and rainfall impacts across the central portion of the Baja
California peninsula later this week.  A tropical storm or hurricane
watch could be issued for that region later today.
