SUMMARY OF 500 PM PDT...0000 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...31.2N 118.4W
ABOUT 130 MI...205 KM SSW OF SAN DIEGO CALIFORNIA
ABOUT 160 MI...260 KM WNW OF PUNTA BAJA MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Cabo San Quintin northward along the west coast of the Baja
California peninsula to the U.S./Mexico border
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests in southern California should monitor the progress of Kay
and consult products from your local weather office.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM PDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Kay was
located near latitude 31.2 North, longitude 118.4 West. Kay is
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). A turn 
to the west is expected on Saturday, and this motion should 
continue to take Kay away from the northern Baja California 
peninsula.
 
Maximum sustained winds are estimated to be near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Weakening is forecast, and Kay is expected to 
degenerate into a remnant low tonight.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
mainly to the east of the center.  There are continued report of
50-70 mph (80-110 km/h) wind gusts in the mountains east and
northeast of San Diego, with occasional gusts to hurricane force.
 
The minimum central pressure is estimated to be 994 mb (29.36 
inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Kay can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml.
 
WIND: Winds are expected to drop below tropical storm force in the 
Tropical Storm Warning area in the northwestern portion of the 
Baja California peninsula during the next couple of hours.
 
Strong winds not directly associated with Kay's core wind field are
occurring across portions of southern California and extreme
southwestern Arizona. For information on this wind hazard, users
should see High Wind Warnings and other products from their local
NWS Weather Forecast Office.
 
RAINFALL: Kay is expected to produce the following rainfall totals:
 
Baja California: Additional rainfall of 2 to 4 inches with isolated
maxima of 6 inches. Event total rainfall 6 to 10 inches, isolated
maxima of 15 inches
 
Western Sonora: Additional rainfall of 1 to 2 inches with isolated
maxima of 4 inches. Event total rainfall 2 to 4 inches, isolated
maxima of 8 inches
 
Southernmost California:  2 to 4 inches with isolated maxima of 6 to
8 inches
 
Sierra Nevada, Arizona, and Southern Nevada: 1 to 2 inches with
isolated maxima of 3 inches
 
These rainfall amounts could lead to flash flooding, with landslides
possible across mountainous areas of Mexico.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Kay will continue to affect the Baja 
California peninsula coast, the Gulf of California, and southern 
California during the next day or so. These swells will likely 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 800 PM PDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Kay Forecast Discussion Number 22</title>

Tropical Storm Kay Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122022
200 PM PDT Fri Sep 09 2022

Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft and 
recent scatterometer data indicate that Kay continues to weaken, 
with maximum winds of about 35 kt that are confined to an area over 
the Pacific east and northeast of the center.  Satellite imagery 
shows no organized central convection, with the remaining 
thunderstorms well to the north of the center over southern 
California.  The initial intensity is reduced to 35 kt based on the 
aircraft and scatterometer data.  However, stronger winds enhanced 
by the mountainous terrain are occuring over portions of southern 
California.

Unless the central convection re-develops, which appears unlikely 
over sea surface temperatures of 21-22C, Kay should decay to a 
remnant low tonight with the maximum winds decreasing below 35 kt.  
The global models are in good agreement that the remnant low will 
dissipate between 72-96 h, and the official forecast follows this.

While Kay is currently moving northwest or 305/10 kt, it is 
starting its expected turn away from land and should move westward 
at a slower forward speed during the next 12-24 h.  After that, a 
low-level ridge to the west of the remnant low should steer the 
system slowly southward and southeastward until it dissipates.  
There was again little change in the track forecast guidance since 
the last advisory, and the new forecast track is similar to the 
previous track.
 
Although Kay's intensity has decreased, wind, surf, and rainfall 
impacts continue to extend far from the center so users should not 
focus on the exact forecast track of Kay.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. As the center of Kay passes just offshore, heavy rainfall will 
likely result in flash flooding, including possible landslides, 
across the Baja California peninsula and portions of mainland 
northwestern Mexico through Saturday morning.  Flash, urban, and 
small stream flooding is likely across Southern California, 
especially in and near the peninsular ranges, and also possible in 
the Sierra Nevada, Arizona, and southern Nevada.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of the 
Pacific coast of the Baja California peninsula, where a Tropical 
Storm Warning is in effect.
 
3. Strong winds not directly associated with Kay's core wind field
are occurring across portions of southern California and extreme
southwestern Arizona. For information on this wind hazard, users
should see High Wind Warnings and other products from their local
NWS Weather Forecast Office.
