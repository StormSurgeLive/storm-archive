DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 AM MDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kay was located
by an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft near latitude 23.9 
North, longitude 113.2 West.  Kay is moving toward the 
north-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h), and this general motion 
should continue into Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Kay is expected to pass to the west of the southern Baja California 
peninsula this morning, and be near or over the west-central coast 
of the Baja California peninsula later today and tonight, and near 
the northwest coast of the Baja California peninsula on Friday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some weakening is expected during the next couple of days.  
However, Kay is expected to remain a large hurricane when it passes 
near the west-central coast of the Baja California peninsula.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230
miles (370 km).  An automated observing station at Puerto Cortes, on
the west coast of the Baja California peninsula, reported a
sustained wind of 46 mph (74 km/h) and a peak gust to 55 mph (89
km/h) during the past couple of hours.

The latest minimum central pressure measured by reconnaissance 
aircraft is 972 mb (28.70 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Kay can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml.

WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the Hurricane Warning
area beginning later today, and are possible within the Hurricane
Watch area today.  Tropical storm conditions are occurring over the 
Tropical Storm Warning area and are forecast to spread northward 
through Friday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible in the 
Tropical Storm Watch area on Friday.

STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal
flooding near where the center passes the coast in areas of onshore
winds, or east of the center if Kay makes landfall along the
western Baja peninsula of Mexico. The surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.

RAINFALL: Kay is expected to produce the following rainfall totals
through Saturday:

Baja California Peninsula: 6 to 10 inches, isolated maxima of 15
inches

Northwest Mainland Mexico:  2 to 4 inches, isolated maxima of 6
inches

Southernmost California:  2 to 4 inches with maxima of 6 inches

Southwest Arizona: 1 to 2 inches with isolated maxima of 4 inches

These rainfall amounts could lead to flash flooding, with landslides
possible across mountainous areas of Mexico.

SURF:  Swells generated by Kay will continue to affect portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next day or so. Large
swells are expected to spread northward along the Baja California
peninsula coast, into the Gulf of California, and to southern
California during the next couple of days. These swells will 
likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  
Please consult products from your local weather office.
