<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center has issued the last advisory on <br/>
Post-Tropical Cyclone Javier located a couple of hundred miles west <br/>
of the central portion of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southwestern Mexico:<br/>
Satellite images indicate that an area of low pressure located about <br/>
200 miles south of Acapulco, Mexico, is becoming better defined and <br/>
showers and thunderstorms continue to show signs of organization.  <br/>
If these trends continue, advisories will likely be initiated on <br/>
this system later today.  The system is forecast to move generally <br/>
west-northwestward or northwestward near the coast of southwestern <br/>
Mexico during the next couple of days, bringing heavy rain to <br/>
portions of that region. Interests in those locations and the Baja <br/>
California peninsula should monitor the progress of this <br/>
disturbance. Additional information on this system, including gale <br/>
warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National <br/>
Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...near 100 percent.<br/>

Post-Tropical Cyclone Javier Advisory Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112022
200 AM PDT Sun Sep 04 2022
 
...JAVIER DEGENERATES INTO A REMNANT LOW...
...THIS IS THE LAST NHC ADVISORY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM PDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...27.2N 118.5W
ABOUT 210 MI...340 KM W OF PUNTA EUGENIA MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1002 MB...29.59 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM PDT (0900 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Javier
was located near latitude 27.2 North, longitude 118.5 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the west-northwest near 15
mph (24 km/h). A slow turn toward the west is expected today. 
The remnant low is then forecast to continue westward through early 
next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Further weakening is expected during 
the next several days and the remnant low will likely dissipate 
toward the end of the week.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Javier will continue to affect portions
of the southern and central Baja California peninsula during the
next day or so. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Javier may produce up to an additional inch of rainfall 
across portions of the Baja California Peninsula today, bringing 
isolated storm total rainfall up to 5 inches.
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on Javier.  For additional information on the remnant low 
please see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather 
Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and 
on the web at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php

Post-Tropical Cyclone Javier Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112022
200 AM PDT Sun Sep 04 2022
 
There has been no significant deep convection associated with
Javier for nearly 16 hours, and it's doubtful that any
organized deep convection will attempt a comeback.  Accordingly,
Javier has become a post-tropical remnant low and this will be the
final NHC advisory on this system.  The initial intensity is
lowered to 30 kt, which is in agreement with subjective satellite
intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB.  The remnant low should 
continue to gradually spin down over cooler sea surface 
temperatures during the next several days, and the deterministic
models indicate that the surface circulation will become a trough
of low pressure toward the end of the week. The NHC intensity 
forecast is similar to the previous one and is close to the 
intensity model consensus.
 
The low continues to move away from the Baja California peninsula 
and the initial motion estimate is 295/13 kt.  The cyclone should 
turn westward soon in the low-level trade flow as a shallow remnant 
low and maintain this general heading until it dissipates in 5 days.
 
This is the final NHC advisory on Javier.  For additional 
information on the remnant low please see High Seas Forecasts 
issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header 
NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php

Twelve-E was located near latitude 14.0 North, longitude 101.4 West.
The depression is moving toward the west near 10 mph (17 km/h) and
a west to west-northwest motion is expected during the next couple 
of days, followed by a turn to the north.  The depression is 
expected to remain south of southwestern Mexico during the next 
couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast, and the depression is expected to become 
a tropical storm later today.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for the depression can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC. 

SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are affecting portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico.  These swells are expected to
reach the southern portion of the Baja California peninsula by
Tuesday, and are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.

RAINFALL:  The depression is expected to produce 1 to 3 inches of 
rainfall, with isolatd storm totals of 5 inches, across coastal 
portions of southwestern Mexico from Guerrero northwestward to

Tropical Depression Twelve-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122022
1000 AM CDT Sun Sep 04 2022

Satellite images indicate that the area of low pressure located a 
couple of hundred miles south of southwestern Mexico has developed 
sufficently organized deep convection and a well-defined center to 
be classified a tropical depression.  Thunderstorm activity, with a 
significant amount of lightning, is strongest in a band on the 
system's west side.  The initial intensity is set at 30 kt based on 
a Dvorak estimate from TAFB.  It should also be noted there are 
likely strong wind gusts to the north of the center where winds 
typically accelerate in these situations near the coast of Mexico.

The initial motion is estimated to be 280/9 kt, but this is somewhat 
uncertain since the system just formed.  This general motion is 
expected to continue for the next couple of days, keeping the core 
of the system south of the coast of southwestern Mexico during that 
time.  Thereafter, the models all show a turn to the northwest and 
then the north.  Although the models agree on this turn, there is 
some spread on where and how sharply the system recurves.  The GFS 
and ECMWF ensemble spreads show solutions as far east as the Gulf of 
California and as far west as a few hundred miles west of the Baja 
California peninsula.  The NHC track forecast follows the consensus 
models, which takes the system very near the Baja peninsula in 4 to 
5 days. 

Overall, the environmental factors appear conducive for the 
depression to intensify during the next few days with the shear 
remaining low to moderate in strength, mid-level moisture very high, 
and SSTs sufficently warm.  However, the large size of the system 
and lack of an inner core should limit rapid intensification in the 
short term.  The intensity guidance show at least steady 
strengthening during the next 72 hours followed by some weakening 
toward the end of the forecast period due to cooler SSTs.  The NHC 
intensity forecast is close to the IVCN guidance, and shows the 
system becoming a tropical storm later today and a significant 
hurricane near Baja in a few days.

KEY MESSAGES:

1. Although the depression is expected to stay offshore, heavy 
rainfall could lead to localized flash flooding in portions of 
southwestern Mexico.

2. Interests in the Baja California peninsula should closely 
monitor the depression as tropical storm or hurricane watches could 
be required tonight.
