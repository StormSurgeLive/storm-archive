DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM PDT (0300 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Kay
was located near latitude 31.3 North, longitude 118.9 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph
(13 km/h).  A turn to the southwest and then the south is expected 
this weekend and early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual weakening is expected during the next couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Strong winds not directly associated with Kay's core wind
field are occurring across portions of southern California and
extreme southwestern Arizona. For information on this wind hazard,
users should see High Wind Warnings and other products from their
local NWS Weather Forecast Office.
 
RAINFALL: Kay is expected to produce the following rainfall totals:
 
Baja California: Additional rainfall of 2 to 4 inches with isolated
maxima of 6 inches. Event total rainfall 6 to 10 inches, isolated
maxima of 15 inches
 
Western Sonora: Additional rainfall of 1 to 2 inches with isolated
maxima of 4 inches. Event total rainfall 2 to 4 inches, isolated
maxima of 8 inches
 
Southernmost California:  2 to 4 inches with isolated maxima of 6 to

Sierra Nevada, Arizona, and Southern Nevada: 1 to 2 inches with
isolated maxima of 3 inches
 
These rainfall amounts could lead to flash flooding, with landslides
possible across mountainous areas of Mexico.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Kay are still affecting the coast of
southern California and the northern Baja California peninsula.
These swells should subside on Saturday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on Kay.  For additional information on the post-tropical 
cyclone please see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National 
Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02

Post-Tropical Cyclone Kay Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122022
800 PM PDT Fri Sep 09 2022
 
Kay has been devoid of deep convection just about all day (about the
past 15 hours), and it no longer meets the organized deep convection
criteria needed for a tropical cyclone.  Therefore, Kay is now
considered a post-tropical cyclone, and since all coastal tropical
storm warnings have been discontinued, this is the last advisory on
this system.  The initial intensity is held at 35 kt.
 
The low has now turned to the west-northwest, and a turn to the
southwest and then the south is expected this weekend and
early next week as the cyclone weakens while moving within the
low-level flow.
 
Even though Kay is no longer a tropical cyclone, this system is
still producing heavy rains across portions of northern Baja
California and southern California.  In addition, strong winds not
directly associated with Kay's core wind field are still occurring
across portions of southern California and extreme southwestern
Arizona. For more information on the wind hazard, see products
from your local NWS Weather Forecast Office.
