Hurricane Kay Advisory Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122022
900 AM MDT Tue Sep 06 2022
 
...KAY PRODUCING ROUGH SURF ACROSS SOUTHWESTERN MEXICO AND SOUTHERN
BAJA CALIFORNIA PENINSULA...
...TROPICAL STORM CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO BEGIN IN SOUTHERN BAJA
WEDNESDAY MORNING...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM MDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.0N 110.0W
ABOUT 340 MI...545 KM S OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...85 MPH...140 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 315 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...977 MB...28.85 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has extended the Tropical Storm Watch
northward on the east coast of the Baja California peninsula from
Loreto to Santa Rosalia.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* San Evaristo southward to Cabo San Lucas
* Cabo San Lucas northward to Cabo San Lazaro
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* North of San Evaristo northward to Santa Rosalia
* North of Cabo San Lazaro northward to Punta Abreojos
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests north of the watch area on the Baja California peninsula
should closely monitor the progress of Kay as hurricane or tropical
storm watches could be required later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kay was located
near latitude 18.0 North, longitude 110.0 West. Kay is moving toward
the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this general motion should
continue through tonight.  A turn toward the north-northwest is
expected on Wednesday, and this motion should continue into
Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of Kay is expected
to pass to the west of the southern Baja California peninsula on
Wednesday, and be near the west-central coast of the Baja
California peninsula Thursday and Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast during the next 36 hours, and Kay
could become a major hurricane during that time. Weakening is
forecast to begin by Thursday, but Kay is forecast to remain a
strong hurricane when it passes near the Baja California peninsula.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 977 mb (28.85 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Kay can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml.
 
WIND: Tropical-storm-force wind gusts in outer rainbands are likely
to continue along the coast of southwestern Mexico today. Tropical
storm conditions are expected within the warning area in the
southern Baja California peninsula beginning Wednesday morning.
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in the
southern Baja California peninsula by late Wednesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Kay will continue to affect portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next couple of days.
Large swells are beginning to reach the southern portion of the
Baja California peninsula and are expected to spread northward and
into the Gulf of California during the next few days. These swells
will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Kay is expected to produce 4 to 8 inches of rainfall,
with isolated storm total amounts of 12 inches, across portions of
western Mexico, including the Baja California peninsula, through
Thursday night.  These rainfall amounts could lead to flash
flooding, including landslides.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1200 PM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 300 PM MDT.

<title>Hurricane Kay Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Hurricane Kay Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122022
900 AM MDT Tue Sep 06 2022
 
Satellite data indicate that Kay has been relatively steady in 
strength during the past several hours.  A ragged eye feature has 
occasionally been apparent, and microwave data show that the eyewall 
and rainbands are most organized on the south side.  The latest 
satellite intensity estimates range from 65 to 77 kt, and based on 
that data, the initial intensity is held at 75 kt.  An Air Force 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate Kay later 
today.  It should be noted that Kay is a fairly large hurricane with 
its tropical-storm-force winds estimated to extend outward up to 175 
miles from the center.  Kay is also producing a large area of high 
seas, with swells currently affecting portions of southwestern 
Mexico and the southern Baja California peninsula.
 
Kay is moving northwestward at 13 kt and it appears to be moving 
along the previous forecast track.  The track models have barely 
changed this cycle and continue to show a northwest to 
north-northwest motion continuing for the next few days as the 
hurricane moves in the flow on the western periphery of a ridge over 
Mexico.  This should take the core of Kay very near the west-central 
Baja California peninsula on Thursday and Friday.  After that time, 
a turn to the left is predicted as the system is steered by a low- 
to mid-level ridge over the western United States.  The NHC track 
forecast is basically the same as the previous one and lies closest 
to the HCCA consensus model.
 
The hurricane is still feeling some effects from moderate northerly 
vertical wind shear, but the models suggest that the shear should 
decrease during the next day or so.  The anticipated more conducive 
upper-level wind pattern combined with warm SSTs and a moist 
environment should allow Kay to strengthen during the next 36 hours, 
and it could become a major hurricane during that time.  Thereafter, 
sharply cooler SSTs and drier air should end the opportunity for 
strengthening and induce steady weakening.  Kay is expected to 
become a post-tropical cyclone in 4 to 5 days when it is forecast 
to be over quite cool SSTs of 21-22 C. The NHC intensity forecast 
lies near the high end of the guidance, especially during the first 
48 hours.
 
Although Kay is likely to weaken before it makes its closest 
approach to the west-central coast of the Baja peninsula, it is 
forecast to remain a large and strong hurricane at that time.  In 
addition, winds, surf, and rainfall impacts will extend far from the 
center so users should not focus on the exact forecast track.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Kay could lead to flash flooding, including
landslides, across portions of western Mexico, including the Baja
California peninsula, through Thursday night.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
southern Baja California peninsula beginning Wednesday morning,
where a Tropical Storm Warning is now in effect.
 
3. While the details of the long-range track and intensity forecasts
remain uncertain, there is increasing risk of significant wind,
surf, and rainfall impacts across the central portion of the Baja
California peninsula later this week.  A tropical storm or hurricane
watch could be issued for that region later today.
