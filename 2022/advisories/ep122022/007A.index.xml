Interests north of the watch area on the Baja California peninsula 
should closely monitor the progress of Kay as hurricane or tropical 
storm watches could be required later today.  Tropical storm 
warnings could also be required for portions of the watch area 
later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products 
issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 AM MDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Kay was located
near latitude 16.6 North, longitude 108.7 West. Kay is moving toward
the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A turn toward the
northwest is expected later this morning, followed by a 
north-northwestward motion tonight through Thursday. On the 
forecast track, the center of Kay is expected to remain southwest 
and west of southwestern Mexico today, then move to the west of the
southern Baja California peninsula on Wednesday and Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and
Kay is expected to be a strong hurricane when it passes near the
Baja California peninsula during the middle of the week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175
miles (280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Kay can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header
WTPZ42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml.
 
WIND: Tropical-storm-force wind gusts in outer rainbands are likely
near the coast of southwestern Mexico today. Tropical storm 
conditions are possible in the watch area in the southern Baja
California peninsula by Wednesday morning.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Kay will affect portions of the coast of 
southwestern Mexico during the next few days. Large swells are 
likely to reach the southern portion of the Baja California
peninsula later this morning and are expected to spread northward 
and into the Gulf of California through midweek. These swells will 
likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. 
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Kay is expected to produce 3 to 6 inches of rainfall,
with isolated storm total amounts of 10 inches, across portions of
the Mexican Riviera and western Mexico through Wednesday night.
These rainfall amounts could lead to flash flooding, including
landslides.

Hurricane Kay Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122022
900 PM MDT Mon Sep 05 2022
 
Kay was upgraded to a hurricane earlier today based on valuable data 
that was received from the Air Force Hurricane Hunters just before 
the previous advisory issuance. The aircraft reported dropsonde data 
that supported a minimum pressure around 980 mb, along with 
flight-level winds of 85 kt at 850 mb and SFMR winds up to 71 kt in 
the eastern portion of the cyclone. There were some earlier hints of 
a ragged eye trying to emerge in visible imagery, but the center is 
still obscured by a small central dense overcast. The inner core 
structure of the cyclone does not appear to have improved much based 
on a couple of recent passive microwave overpasses, as some dry air 
has wrapped into the western and southern portions of the 
circulation. Based on the earlier aircraft data, the intensity of 
Kay is held at 70 kt for this advisory. 

The hurricane is moving west-northwestward at 285/9 kt. The track 
guidance for Kay over the next few days remains in good agreement. 
Kay is expected to turn northwestward on Tuesday and then 
north-northwestward by early Wednesday while moving toward or to the 
west of the Baja California peninsula. While the core of the storm 
is still forecast to remain offshore, the large wind field could 
bring tropical-storm-force winds to the southern portion of Baja 
California by early Wednesday. The hurricane is forecast to make its 
closest approach to the west-central portion of Baja California late 
Thursday into Friday. The official NHC forecast lies very close to 
the HFIP corrected consensus approach (HCCA) and has been nudged 
slightly to the right of the previous one. It is noted that the GFS 
and ECMWF still lie on the eastern edge of the guidance envelope.   

Kay has significantly strengthened today despite some moderate 
northeasterly deep-layer shear diagnosed by the SHIPS guidance over 
the system. This shear is forecast to diminish in a day or so, while 
Kay remains over very warm SSTs and in a moist and unstable 
environment. Thus, more strengthening is anticipated and Kay could 
approach major hurricane strength in 36-48 h. The official NHC 
forecast is very similar to the previous one and lies slightly above 
the IVCN aid and closer to HCCA. By early Thursday, drier air and 
cooler SSTs at higher latitudes will cause Kay to begin weakening. 
The cyclone is forecast to lose its organized convection and become 
a post-tropical low by day 5.

The government of Mexico has extended the Tropical Storm Watch 
northward from Puerto San Andresito to Punta Abreojos. Additional 
tropical storm or hurricane watches or warnings could be necessary 
for portions of Baja California later tonight or on Tuesday.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Gusts to tropical-storm-force and rough surf along the coast of 
southwestern Mexico are expected through Tuesday.  In addition, 
heavy rainfall from Kay could lead to flash flooding, including 
landslides, across portions of the Mexican Riviera and western 
Mexico through Wednesday night.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible across the southern Baja 
California peninsula by early Wednesday, where a Tropical Storm 
Watch has been issued. 
 
3. While the details of the long-range track and intensity forecasts 
remain uncertain, there is increasing risk of significant wind, 
surf, and rainfall impacts across the central portion of the Baja 
California peninsula later this week.  A tropical storm or hurricane 
watch could be issued for that region by Tuesday.
