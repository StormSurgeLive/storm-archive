Hurricane Estelle Advisory Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062022
1000 PM CDT Sat Jul 16 2022
 
...ESTELLE INTENSIFIES RAPIDLY TO A HURRICANE...
...RAPID INTENSIFICATION FORECAST TO CONTINUE THROUGH SUNDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1000 PM CDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.7N 105.0W
ABOUT 300 MI...485 KM S OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...80 MPH...130 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...988 MB...29.18 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Estelle was
located near latitude 14.7 North, longitude 105.0 West.  Estelle is
moving toward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A
west-northwestward motion with some increase in forward speed is
expected through Tuesday.
 
Estelle is rapidly intensifying, and maximum sustained winds have
increased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher gusts.  Continued
rapid intensification is likely through Sunday, and Estelle is
forecast to become a major hurricane by Sunday night.  Some 
weakening is expected to begin on Tuesday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the
center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles
(110 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 988 mb (29.18 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Estelle are affecting portions of the
southwestern coast of Mexico and will spread northward to the coast
of west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California peninsula on
Sunday and Monday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

Hurricane Estelle Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062022
1000 PM CDT Sat Jul 16 2022
 
After taking a breather this afternoon, Estelle's inner-core
convection came back with a vengeance as a burst began around 2100
UTC and continued to organize around the center through the evening.
There have been no microwave images since this morning to help
assess the cyclone's structure, but the 00 UTC Dvorak fix from TAFB 
and the UW-CIMSS ADT support Estelle's upgrade to a hurricane.  The 
ADT ticked up a bit since then with a warm spot developing within 
the Central Dense Overcast, so the advisory intensity is set at 70 
kt.  Either way, Estelle has rapidly intensified by at least 30 kt 
over the past 24 hours.
 
Continued rapid intensification (RI) appears likely during the next
24 hours while Estelle moves over very warm waters of 29-30 degrees
Celsius and benefits from high values of upper-level divergence
and generally low shear.  The conventional RI and DTOPS indices from
the GFS and ECWMF versions of SHIPS are still quite high, ranging
from a 50 to 75 percent chance of another 30-kt increase in
intensity over the next 24 hours.  As a result, the NHC intensity
forecast is near the top end of the guidance and explicit shows
RI, with Estelle expected to reach a peak intensity of 100 kt as
a major hurricane by 36 hours.  Intensification is likely to level
off around that time as environmental conditions become a little
less ideal, and Estelle is expected to begin weakening over colder
waters by day 3.  The NHC forecast remains near the upper end of
the guidance during Estelle's expected weakening phase.
 
The current motion remains west-northwestward at 295/8 kt.  A
mid-level ridge located over the southwestern United States is
expected to strengthen and expand westward over the Pacific Ocean
in the coming days, which should continue steering Estelle toward
the west-northwest at a slightly faster pace.  The track guidance
remains tightly clustered, and the only notable update in this NHC
forecast is that it's a little faster than the afternoon forecast
in order to be more in line with the TVCE and HCCA consensus aids,
as well as the ECWMF solution.
