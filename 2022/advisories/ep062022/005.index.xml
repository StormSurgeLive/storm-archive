...ESTELLE CONTINUES STRENGTHENING...
...EXPECTED TO BECOME A HURRICANE LATER TODAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1000 AM CDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.0N 103.7W
ABOUT 350 MI...560 KM S OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...70 MPH...110 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...994 MB...29.36 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Estelle was
located near latitude 14.0 North, longitude 103.7 West. Estelle is
moving toward the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this
general motion is expected to continue for the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts, and continued strengthening is expected during 
the next day or two. Estelle is likely to become a hurricane later 
today, and it is forecast to become a major hurricane by early 
Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Estelle are beginning to affect portions
of the southwestern coast of Mexico and will spread northward to the
coast of west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California
peninsula on Sunday and Monday.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Estelle Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062022
1000 AM CDT Sat Jul 16 2022
 
Estelle has continued to strengthen this morning. Earlier passive 
microwave imagery indicated the vortex was slightly tilted in the 
vertical, likely due to 10-15 kt of deep-layer northeasterly shear 
over the small cyclone. The mid-level eye feature was still open on 
the upshear side, but recent satellite trends show an expanding 
central dense overcast with -75 to -80 deg C cloud tops spreading 
over its center. The 12 UTC objective and subjective satellite 
estimates were all at 55 kt, but given the recent improved satellite 
presentation and an uptick in the ADT estimates, the advisory 
intensity is set at 60 kt.
 
Further strengthening is expected as Estelle moves within a moist 
and unstable environment over very warm SSTs. Of course, this 
assumes that Estelle is able to close off its inner core to help 
resist the negative effects of continued moderate (10-15 kt) 
deep-layer shear. The latest intensity guidance unanimously supports 
at least steady strengthening over the next 24-36 h, and SHIPS/LGEM 
favor rapid intensification (RI) with some indications that the 
shear could weaken a bit later today. The NHC intensity forecast is 
higher than the previous one and explicitly forecasts RI, generally 
between the multi-model consensus and the most aggressive SHIPS/LGEM 
aids. Estelle is expected to become a hurricane later today, and it 
is forecast to become a major hurricane by early Monday. Later next 
week, increasing shear and decreasing SSTs along its track should 
lead to a weakening trend on days 3-5.
 
Estelle is moving west-northwestward (295 degrees) at 9 kt. A
mid-level ridge entrenched over the southwestern U.S. should keep
steering Estelle west-northwestward during the next several days.
There is increased spread in the track guidance on days 3-5, with
the GFS on the far northern edge of the guidance envelope and the
ECWMF and UKMET faster and much farther south. The NHC track
forecast is nudged just a bit south of the previous one in the
extended range, but still lies slightly to the north of the TVCE and
HCCA aids.
