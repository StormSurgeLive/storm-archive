Tropical Depression Estelle Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062022
800 AM PDT Thu Jul 21 2022
 
Estelle has diminished to a swirl of mostly low- to mid-level 
clouds with very little organized deep convection.  Subjective and 
objective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and UW-CIMSS ADT agree that the 
surface wind speeds are now around 30 kt.  Based on these 
estimates, the system is being downgraded to a tropical depression.  
Estelle should remain over cold water and continue to weaken. Unless 
there is a significant redevelopment of deep convection, the system 
is likely to be designated as a post-tropical cyclone later today.  

Estelle continues to move west-northwestward at 11 kt while being 
steered by the flow on the south side of a low- to mid-level ridge.  
A west-northwestward to westward motion is expected until the 
system opens up into a trough in a couple of days.  The official 
forecast is shifted slightly north of the previous prediction and is 
in line with the new track model consensus.
