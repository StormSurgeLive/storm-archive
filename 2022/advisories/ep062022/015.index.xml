DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM MDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Estelle was
located near latitude 18.3 North, longitude 113.6 West. Estelle is
moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this
motion is expected to continue for the next several days. 
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast over the next day 
or two followed by more pronounced weakening, and Estelle is 
expected to become a post-tropical cyclone towards the end of 
the week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 988 mb (29.18 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Estelle are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico, west-central Mexico, and the southern
Baja California peninsula. These swells are likely to continue for
the next day or so and could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.

Hurricane Estelle Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062022
300 PM MDT Mon Jul 18 2022

Since this morning, the central features of Estelle have become 
more ragged in appearance.  An earlier SSMIS microwave pass from 
1415 UTC showed a tilted vortex structure, suggesting the vertical 
wind shear is preventing the hurricane from strengthening.  The 
objective and subjective Dvorak intensity estimates have changed 
little and the initial intensity remains at 70 kt.

Model guidance indicates Estelle only has a brief period to 
intensify before moving over sea surface temperatures cooler than 25 
C.  However, moderate north-northwesterly wind shear is likely to 
persist through tonight and inhibit significant strengthening.  A 
steady weakening trend is expected to begin in a day or so and 
Estelle is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone within a few 
days.  The NHC intensity forecast is just slightly above the latest 
consensus model guidance.

Estelle continues to move west-northwest at 12 kt.  A mid-level 
ridge associated with a strong high pressure system over the 
southwestern United States should provide the main steering for the 
next few days.  As the cyclone degenerates into a post-tropical 
cyclone/remnant low, it should follow the low-level winds and turn 
more westward.  The official forecast is very close to the latest 
corrected model consensus, HCCA. 
 
Estelle is expected to continue producing rough surf and rip current
conditions along the coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico
as well as the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula during
the next day or so.
