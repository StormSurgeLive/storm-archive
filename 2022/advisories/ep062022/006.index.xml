WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Estelle was 
located near latitude 14.2 North, longitude 104.4 West. Estelle is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue for the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next day or two, and 
Estelle is expected to become a hurricane by this evening and could 
become a major hurricane by early Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 993 mb (29.33 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Estelle are affecting portions of the
southwestern coast of Mexico and will spread northward to the coast
of west-central Mexico and the southern Baja California peninsula on
Sunday and Monday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Estelle Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062022
400 PM CDT Sat Jul 16 2022
 
Estelle does not look quite as impressive as it did this morning in 
conventional satellite imagery. Its structure consists of a small, 
ragged inner core with several curved outer bands that wrap around 
its center. Northeasterly shear continues to impinge on the 
cyclone, which could be importing some drier mid-level air into the 
circulation. The latest subjective and objective satellite estimates 
range from 55-65 kt, and without new microwave data to better assess 
any structural changes, the initial intensity is held at 60 kt.
 
Despite a brief pause in intensification, environmental conditions 
appear generally favorable for more strengthening during the next 
couple of days. Overall, the latest intensity guidance favors steady 
to rapid intensification over the next 24-36 h as Estelle crosses 
very warm SSTs in a moist and unstable environment. The persistent 
moderate deep-layer shear is a concern, but only a small improvement 
in its inner core structure should allow the small cyclone to resume 
strengthening tonight. The NHC intensity forecast remains on the 
higher end of the guidance, closest to SHIPS/LGEM and slightly above 
HCCA, and shows peak intensity as a major hurricane in 36-48 h. 
Then, increasing northerly shear and decreasing SSTs along the 
forecast track should cause Estelle to weaken through the middle of 
next week, as it moves into a drier mid-level environment. 

Estelle is still moving west-northwestward at 295/8 kt. The track 
reasoning has not changed, and the cyclone should generally maintain 
a west-northwestward heading during the next several days as it is 
steered by a mid-level ridge centered over the southwestern United 
States. The NHC track forecast is just slightly left of the previous 
track, in agreement with the latest multi-model consensus aids.
