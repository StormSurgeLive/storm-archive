Tropical Storm Estelle Advisory Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062022
300 AM MDT Tue Jul 19 2022
 
...ESTELLE WEAKENS TO A TROPICAL STORM...
...EXPECTED TO BECOME A REMNANT LOW LATER THIS WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM MDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.6N 114.7W
ABOUT 430 MI...690 KM SW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 280 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...995 MB...29.39 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Estelle was 
located near latitude 18.6 North, longitude 114.7 West. Estelle is 
moving toward the west near 13 mph (20 km/h). A slight turn toward 
the west-northwest is expected later today, and this general motion 
should continue through midweek.
 
Satellite derived wind data indicate that maximum sustained winds 
have decreased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Additional weakening is expected during the next few days, and 
Estelle is forecast to degenerate into a post-tropical remnant low 
on Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center. An automated Mexican Navy weather station on 
Clarion Island recently reported a gust of 44 mph (70 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Estelle will continue to affect portions 
of the coasts of southwestern Mexico, west-central Mexico, and the 
southern Baja California peninsula today. These swells are likely to 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.

Tropical Storm Estelle Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062022
300 AM MDT Tue Jul 19 2022
 
Northerly shear continues to take a toll on Estelle. Its low-level 
center appears to be partially exposed in proxy visible satellite 
imagery, with its associated deep convection limited in coverage and 
confined to the southern and eastern portions of its circulation. 
Estelle is no longer a hurricane, and recent ASCAT-B and -C data 
showed peak derived winds of 45-50 kt in the northeast quadrant of 
the cyclone. After accounting for some undersampling, the initial 
intensity of Estelle is lowered to 55 kt for this advisory.
 
Estelle is expected to continue weakening. Although the deep-layer 
shear is likely to diminish within the next 12-24 h, the cyclone 
will cross the 26 deg C isotherm later today and move over 
progressively cooler SSTs through midweek. The NHC intensity 
forecast follows the multi-model consensus and calls for steady 
weakening over the next few days. Simulated satellite imagery from 
the GFS and ECMWF models indicate the cyclone will struggle to 
generate deep, organized convection later this week as it moves into 
a drier and more stable airmass. Estelle is forecast to degenerate 
into a post-tropical remnant low by Thursday, but it could take a 
couple more days for the low to open into a trough and dissipate.

The initial motion of Estelle is westward at 280/11 kt, but it is 
expected to turn west-northwestward later today as it moves around 
the periphery of a mid-level ridge centered over the southwestern 
United States. This ridge will keep Estelle on a west-northwestward 
heading for the next few days. As the cyclone spins down and becomes 
more vertically shallow, the low-level trade wind flow should steer 
the remnant low more westward on days 4-5. The NHC track forecast is 
very similar to the previous one and remains near the HCCA and TVCE 
consensus aids.
