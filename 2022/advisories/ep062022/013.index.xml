Hurricane Estelle Advisory Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062022
900 AM MDT Mon Jul 18 2022
 
...ESTELLE PASSING JUST SOUTH OF SOCORRO ISLAND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM MDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.0N 111.1W
ABOUT 55 MI...90 KM S OF SOCORRO ISLAND
ABOUT 345 MI...560 KM SSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...80 MPH...130 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...986 MB...29.12 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Estelle was
located near latitude 18.0 North, longitude 111.1 West. Estelle is
moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this
general motion is expected to continue for the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some slight strengthening is possible during the next day or
so, but weakening is expected to begin around the middle of the
week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles
(165 km).  An automated Mexican Navy weather station on Socorro 
Island recently reported sustained winds of 46 mph (74 km/h) and 
gusts to 61 mph (98 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 986 mb (29.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Estelle are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico, west-central Mexico, and the southern
Baja California peninsula. These swells are likely to continue for
another day or so and could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM MDT.

Hurricane Estelle Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062022
300 AM MDT Mon Jul 18 2022
 
Estelle has generally changed little during the past several hours,
but the hurricane is less organized than it was 24 hours ago. The
system continues to produce a concentrated area of deep convection,
but a recent GMI microwave pass showed that northerly shear is
causing a significant asymmetry in the storm's structure. The center
is located near the northern edge of the convection and banding
features are mostly confined to the south of the center. The latest
satellite intensity estimates range from 55 to 77 kt, and the
initial intensity is held at 70 kt for this advisory. An ASCAT pass 
from around 05Z indicated that the 34- and 50-kt wind radii were 
larger than previously estimated.
 
The hurricane is expected to remain over warm water for another
24-36 hours, but north to northeasterly shear of 10-15 kt is
expected to persist during that time period. Given the storm's
current structure and continued shear, only a little strengthening
seems possible during that time period. Beyond 36 hours, Estelle
will be tracking over waters cooler than 26 C and into a drier and
more stable air mass. These conditions should cause a steady
weakening trend, and the system will likely become post-tropical in
3 to 4 days. The NHC intensity forecast is again lower than the
previous one and it lies at the high end of the guidance in the
short term, but falls in line with the HCCA and IVCN consensus
models after 36 hours.
 
Estelle has been moving a little north of the previous forecast with
the latest initial motion estimated to be 305/11 kt. The models
show a mid-level ridge building westward to the north of Estelle,
which should cause the system to move generally west-northwestward
for the next several days. The NHC track forecast is a little to
the north of the previous one, mostly based on the initial motion
and position.
 
Estelle is expected to continue producing rough surf and rip current
conditions along the coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico
as well as the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula during
the next couple of days.
