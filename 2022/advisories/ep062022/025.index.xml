with higher gusts.  Estelle is expected to weaken further and 
degenerate into a post-tropical remnant low later today and 
dissipate this weekend.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).

Tropical Depression Estelle Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062022
800 AM PDT Thu Jul 21 2022
 
Estelle has diminished to a swirl of mostly low- to mid-level 
clouds with very little organized deep convection.  Subjective and 
objective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and UW-CIMSS ADT agree that the 
surface wind speeds are now around 30 kt.  Based on these 
estimates, the system is being downgraded to a tropical depression.  
Estelle should remain over cold water and continue to weaken. Unless 
there is a significant redevelopment of deep convection, the system 
is likely to be designated as a post-tropical cyclone later today.  

Estelle continues to move west-northwestward at 11 kt while being 
steered by the flow on the south side of a low- to mid-level ridge.  
A west-northwestward to westward motion is expected until the 
system opens up into a trough in a couple of days.  The official 
forecast is shifted slightly north of the previous prediction and is 
in line with the new track model consensus.
