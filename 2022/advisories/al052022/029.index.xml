Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Thu Sep 8 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Danielle, located several hundred miles north-northwest of the <br/>
Azores, and on Hurricane Earl, located a few hundred miles south of <br/>
Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic: <br/>
An area of low pressure located almost a thousand miles west of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands continues to produce disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms. Environmental conditions appear conducive for <br/>
additional development of this system, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form within the next day or so while it moves westward to <br/>
west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic.  After that time, upper-level winds are forecast to become <br/>
less conducive for development.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
West Coast of Africa:<br/>
A tropical wave currently located near the west coast of Africa is <br/>
forecast to emerge into the eastern Atlantic later this morning.  <br/>
Environmental conditions appear conducive for some gradual <br/>
development thereafter as the system moves west-northwestward over <br/>
the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Earl was located
by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 
27.7 North, longitude 65.5 West.  Earl is moving toward the north 
near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A turn toward the north-northeast is 
expected later today followed by a turn to the northeast tonight 
with a gradual increase in forward speed.
 
Data from the reconnaissance aircraft indicate that maximum 
sustained winds remain near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher gusts.  
Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and Earl 
is expected to become a major hurricane later today or tonight.
 
Earl's wind field is growing in size.  Hurricane-force winds extend 
outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km).
 
The minimum central pressure reported by the Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 970 mb (28.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Earl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
this afternoon or evening.  Hurricane conditions are possible on 
Bermuda this evening or tonight.
 
RAINFALL:  Earl is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 1 to 2
inches (25 to 50 mm) across Bermuda through Friday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Earl are beginning to reach Bermuda and 
are expected to reach the U.S. east coast later today and tonight.  
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions through the weekend.  Please consult products 
from your local weather office.

<title>Hurricane Earl Forecast Discussion Number 21</title>

Hurricane Earl Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 07 2022
 
Earl has resumed intensifying this evening.  A NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft reported a maximum flight-level wind of 107 kt (which 
reduces to an intensity of about 95 kt), and the central pressure 
has fallen to 970 mb.  Both SFMR and dropsonde data support surface 
winds of 80 kt.  Onboard radar has also confirmed a rather large eye 
of almost 60 miles (90 km) and a fairly symmetric wind field.  The 
initial intensity is increased to 85 kt as a blend of all available 
aircraft data, and considering the drop in pressure.
 
Aircraft center fixes confirm that Earl is still moving northward at 
about 8 kt.  This motion is expected to gradually turn 
north-northeastward and northeastward and accelerate as Earl moves 
between a mid-level ridge to the southeast, and a digging 
mid-latitude trough to the northwest in the next couple of days.  
The trough is forecast to capture Earl, however there is some 
uncertainty in the model guidance to the timing of this interaction 
resulting in a larger spread in the along-track positions beyond 72 
hours.  The official track forecast is very similar to the previous 
forecast and close to the model consensus aids.

The apparent decrease in deep-layer vertical wind shear has likely 
allowed Earl to strengthen.  Global model guidance suggests the 
shear will continue to abate over the next 36 hours and with 
atmospheric conditions remaining conducive, further intensification 
is expected. The NHC intensity forecast now shows a quicker rate of 
strengthening to a peak of 115 kt at 36 hours.  Earl is expected to 
undergo extra-tropical transition in a few days when it moves to 
higher latitudes and interacts with an upper-level trough.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Although Earl's center is forecast to pass southeast of Bermuda,
the wind field is expected to grow, with tropical-storm-force winds
forecast to spread across the island beginning late Thursday and 
continuing through Friday morning.  Hurricane-force winds are 
possible on Bermuda late Thursday or Thursday night if Earl's track 
shifts farther west than is currently forecast.
 
2.  Swells generated by Earl are expected to reach Bermuda by
tonight and the U.S. East Coast shortly thereafter.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions through the weekend.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.

Tropical Storm Danielle Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
900 AM GMT Thu Sep 08 2022
 
Danielle is losing its tropical characteristics. The deep convection 
has completely eroded across the southwestern portion of the 
circulation. There is no longer an eye-like feature as seen 
yesterday, and the system is taking on characteristics more similar 
to the comma-shaped cloud shield of a mid-latitude cyclone. The 
latest Dvorak intensity estimates suggest that Danielle is no longer 
a hurricane, and the initial intensity has been decreased to 60 kt 
for this advisory.
 
The cyclone is expected to quickly complete extratropical transition 
through this morning due to higher shear, interaction with a mid- to 
upper-level trough just to its west, and cool SSTs along its 
forecast track. These conditions are also expected to cause Danielle 
to continue weakening through the remainder of the forecast period. 
The latest NHC intensity forecast was once again tweaked slightly 
lower than the previous one, mainly to adjust for the lower initial 
intensity.
 
Danielle is moving northeastward at 14 kt, and this general motion 
should continue for the next few hours. A slow down and 
counterclockwise loop is expected to occur later today and Friday 
when the cyclone interacts with the trough that is expected to cut 
off. After that time, a faster motion to the southeast is forecast, 
which should take the extratropical cyclone toward western Europe by 
the end of the period. The NHC track forecast was adjusted a little 
to the right after the counterclockwise loop due to an overall shift 
in the model guidance. 
 
Danielle continues to produce a large area of very rough seas over
the central-north Atlantic.  More information can be found in the
High Seas Forecasts issued by the Ocean Prediction Center under
AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php. The UK Met Office also has
information in High Seas Forecasts for the west Central and east
Central sections issued under WMO header FQNT21 EGRR and on the web
at metoffice.gov.uk/weather/specialist-forecasts/coast-and-sea/high-
seas-forecast. Meteo France's High Seas Forecast also includes
information regarding Danielle at http://weather.gmdss.org/II.html.
