<title>Tropical Storm Earl Forecast Discussion Number 2</title>

Tropical Storm Earl Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
500 AM AST Sat Sep 03 2022

Satellite imagery and radar data from Guadeloupe show that Earl 
remains a sheared tropical cyclone, with the low-level center 
located to the west of the main convective mass. Various satellite 
intensity estimates are in the 25-45 kt range and have changed 
little since the last advisory.  Based on this, the initial 
intensity remains 35 kt.  A NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft will 
investigate Earl starting near 1000 UTC.

The initial motion is 285/11.  The track guidance remains in good 
agreement that Earl should move west-northwestward and 
northwestward with a decrease in forward speed for the next couple 
of days as it is steered by the subtropical ridge. There is little 
change in this part of the forecast track from the previous 
advisory.  After that time, a slower motion toward the north and 
eventually north-northeast is expected as a mid- to upper-level 
trough develops over the Atlantic to the west and north of Earl.  
The guidance envelope for the latter part of the forecast track has 
shifted eastward, and while the new forecast track is also nudged 
eastward it is west of the consensus models from 60-120 h.

Earl is feeling the effects of moderate westerly shear, and current 
indications are this will continue for the next 48 h or so.  Thus, 
the intensity forecast calls for modest strengthening during this 
time.  The intensity forecast becomes more uncertain as Earl turns 
northward.  While some shear is likely to continue, the dynamical 
models are in good agreement that the cyclone will strengthen, 
possibly due to a favorable interaction to the aforementioned 
upper-level trough.  However, there is poor agreement between the 
models in the details of this interaction.  Given that, the 
intensity forecast from 72-120 h will show a little more 
strengthening than the previous forecast.  However, the forecast 
intensities are on the low side of the guidance envelope.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds are forecast to remain on the northern
and eastern side of the circulation, and as a result, are not
expected to move across the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, or Puerto Rico.  However, any southward shift of Earl's
center would increase the risk of tropical-storm-force winds in
those areas.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical Storm Earl is forecast to pass near or just to the
north of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico over the weekend.  Gusty winds, especially in squalls,
area possible on those islands over the next day or two.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall from Earl is expected to lead to limited flash, 
urban, and small stream flooding impacts over the Leeward Islands, 
U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico this weekend.   
Rapid rises on rivers are possible in Puerto Rico.

Tropical Storm Danielle Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
900 AM GMT Sat Sep 03 2022

Convection associated with Danielle has continued to decrease this 
morning, with a corresponding decrease in satellite intensity 
estimates.  Based on this decrease, it is estimated that Danielle 
has weakened to a tropical storm with an initial intensity of 60 kt. 
While it is not known why the storm has weakened, one possibility 
is that the slow motion has allowed the cyclone to upwell cold 
water underneath it. 

Danielle is essentially stationary with a 12-h motion of 270/1 kt.  
The cyclone is still caught south of a blocking high over the North 
Atlantic.  This pattern is expected to hold firm for a couple of 
days, with the system forecast to drift westward and then drift 
northward.  After 48-60 h, the block will weaken and allow the 
southern edge of the mid-latitude westerlies to steer Danielle 
generally northeastward at a faster forward speed.  There are no 
significant changes to the forecast track for the first 48-60 h.  
After that, the forecast has been nudged eastward due to a shift 
in the guidance envelope.

The intensity guidance is still calling for Danielle to strengthen 
for 72 h or so.  Given the possibility of upwelling and the 
forecast continued slow motion, the guidance might be a bit 
optimistic on that.  The new intensity forecast calls for little 
change in strength for 12 h or so, followed by slow strengthening 
on the premise that the storm will move over somewhat warmer water. 
After 72 h, the storm is likely to interact with an upper-level 
trough, which could help maintain the intensity even as Danielle 
moves toward much colder water in the North Atlantic.  This trough 
will also start extratropical transition, although this will 
likely not be complete by 120 h.
