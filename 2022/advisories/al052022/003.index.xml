Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Thu Sep 1 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
upgraded Tropical Storm Danielle, located about 950 miles west of <br/>
the Azores.<br/>
<br/>
East of the Leeward Islands:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a broad area of low <br/>
pressure located several hundred miles east of the Leeward Islands <br/>
have recently decreased in coverage. Although environmental <br/>
conditions remain only marginally conducive, any additional <br/>
development of the system over the next few days would lead to the <br/>
formation of a tropical depression.  The disturbance is forecast to <br/>
move slowly west-northwestward, toward the adjacent waters of the <br/>
northern Leeward Islands.  Additional information on this system can <br/>
be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather <br/>
Service. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
Satellite imagery and surface observations show that a broad area <br/>
of low pressure is located over and to the northwest of the Cabo <br/>
Verde Islands.  The associated shower activity has diminished <br/>
through the day. There is still some chance for the system to <br/>
become a short-lived tropical depression within the next day or so <br/>
before environmental conditions become unfavorable for further <br/>
development.  <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Danielle Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
900 PM GMT Thu Sep 01 2022
 
The high-latitude tropical cyclone has had quite the increase in 
organization today.  Recent microwave and visible satellite imagery 
shows decent banding features and convection wrapping around the 
low-level center.  Subjective Dvorak classifications from TAFB and 
SAB both estimate Danielle to be a 45-kt system.  However, since the 
storm has continued to improve in appearance, the initial intensity 
has been increased to 50 kt.
 
Danielle is drifting eastward at 2 kt.  A strong anticyclone over 
the system is creating light and variable steering flow and Danielle 
should continue to meander for the next few days.  In about 4 days, 
the anticyclone is expected to weaken and move eastward and a 
mid-latitude trough should turn and accelerate Danielle to the 
northeast.  The NHC track forecast is shifted slightly westward from 
the previous prediction and is close to the model consensus aids.
 
Atmospheric and oceanic conditions appear to be conducive for
additional strengthening during the next few days.  The tropical
storm is over anomalously warm waters and global model guidance
indicates the vertical wind shear should gradually decrease over the
next few days.  The official intensity forecast has been adjusted
upward based on the recent strengthening trend and now shows a peak
intensity of 85 kt in 60 hours.  Thereafter, when Danielle is 
forecast to turn northward, it is expected to gradually weaken over 
cooler water temperatures and increased vertical wind shear.
