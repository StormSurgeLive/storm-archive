Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Tue Sep 6 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Danielle, located more than 800 miles west-northwest of the Azores, <br/>
and on Tropical Storm Earl, located about 600 miles south of <br/>
Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic: <br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms persist from the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands southwestward several hundred miles in association with a <br/>
broad area of low pressure.  Environmental conditions are conducive <br/>
for some development of this system, and a tropical depression could <br/>
form in a few days while moving westward to west-northwestward at 15 <br/>
to 20 mph over the eastern and central tropical Atlantic.  <br/>
Upper-level winds are likely to become less conducive for <br/>
development late this week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
African Coast:<br/>
A tropical wave currently located over western Africa is forecast to <br/>
emerge offshore into the eastern Atlantic in a day or two. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear generally conducive for some slow <br/>
development thereafter as the system moves west-northwestward <br/>
over the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

<title>Tropical Storm Earl Forecast Discussion Number 14</title>

Tropical Storm Earl Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
500 AM AST Tue Sep 06 2022
 
The deep convective blow-up that occurred last evening and led to 
Earl strengthening just shy of hurricane strength was quickly 
obliterated by strong shear around the issuance of the previous 
advisory.  In fact, after measuring a pressure as low as 991 mb 
early in their flight, the NOAA Hurricane Hunters reported that the 
central pressure had risen to near 998 mb based on the final 
dropsonde released near the center.  Some deep convection continues 
near and to the northeast of the estimated center, but based on the 
degraded structure from earlier, the intensity is estimated to be 55 
kt.  This value agrees with the latest Dvorak Data-T numbers from 
TAFB and SAB.

The remnant cirrus shield is obscuring the low-level center, so the 
initial position is based on interpolation from the previous 
forecast.  Earl is moving just west of due north, or 350/6 kt, and 
it should continue a slow northward path through a break in the 
subtropical ridge during the next 36 hours.  After that time, a 
deep-layer trough sliding off the U.S. east coast is expected to 
impart a faster north-northeastward and then northeastward motion 
into the upcoming weekend.  The updated NHC track forecast lies very 
close to the previous official prediction during the first 3 days, 
situated among the various multi-model consensus aids.  On days 4 
and 5, however, the new forecast is faster and to the east of the 
previous one, following the trend noted in most of the models.

UW-CIMSS and SHIPS analyses indicate that deep-layer shear over 
Earl is from the west-southwest at 30-35 kt.  Although the 
thermodynamic environment is plenty favorable for intensification, 
continued moderate to strong shear could put the breaks on 
significant strengthening until Earl turns and moves in the same 
direction as the shear vector, which should be in 2-3 days.  At 
about the same time, Earl could also benefit from a positive 
interaction with a mid- to upper-level trough located over the 
western Atlantic.  While the intensity forecast is highly 
uncertain, Earl is still expected to become a hurricane during the 
next couple of days, and possibly reach major hurricane strength in 
3-4 days.
 
Earl's center is expected to pass to the southeast of Bermuda in
about 3 days.  However, the size of the wind field of the tropical 
cyclone is expected to increase significantly, and interests on the 
island should continue to monitor the progress of the storm closely.

Hurricane Danielle Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
300 PM GMT Tue Sep 06 2022
 
Danielle's overall appearance has changed little this morning. The 
system remains characterized by fragmented deep convection within a 
symmetrical and vertically stacked circulation. In addition, an eye 
feature has remained generally identifiable in visible satellite 
imagery. The latest Dvorak CI values of 4.0 from TAFB and SAB also 
suggest little change in intensity, and thus the system will be kept 
as a 65-kt hurricane for this advisory.

The hurricane has slowed its forward motion, and over the past 12-h 
the system has been moving east-northeastward at around 5 kt. 
Danielle is expected to accelerate east-northeastward tonight in the 
increasing flow ahead of a digging upper-trough. This trough is 
forecast to spawn a baroclinic system west of Danielle by late this 
week, forcing it to make a cyclonic loop while the two systems merge 
into a larger extratropical low. The merged system is then forecast 
to move east-southeastward to southeastward over the weekend. There 
was little change to the NHC track forecast compared to the previous 
advisory.   

Danielle is forecast to continue over SSTs of about 25 degrees C 
over the next 12-24 h, so little change in strength is indicated 
during that time. However, on Wednesday the cyclone should cross a 
tight SST gradient and begin traversing over waters of 20 degrees C 
or less for the remainder of the forecast period. The combination of 
these cooler waters and the interaction with the baroclinic system 
should cause extratropical transition to complete by Thursday. The 
latest NHC intensity forecast is unchanged from the previous one, 
and is close to the various multi-model consensus and SHIPS values. 

Danielle is producing a large area of very rough seas over the 
central-north Atlantic. Complete information on the High Seas 
Forecasts can be found at the Ocean Prediction Center under AWIPS 
header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php.
