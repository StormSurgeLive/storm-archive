...EARL MOVING SLOWLY NORTHWESTWARD WITH LITTLE CHANGE IN
STRENGTH...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.2N 65.4W
ABOUT 125 MI...205 KM NNW OF ST. THOMAS
ABOUT 835 MI...1345 KM S OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 3 MPH...6 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...998 MB...29.47 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands,
Puerto Rico, and Bermuda should monitor the progress of Earl.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Earl was
located near latitude 20.2 North, longitude 65.4 West.  Earl is
moving toward the northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A turn toward the 
north with some increase in forward speed is expected on Monday, 
followed by a turn toward the north-northeast later this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Slow strengthening is forecast over the next several days, and Earl 
could become a hurricane later this week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.  NOAA data buoy 41043 recently reported a 
sustained wind of 40 mph (65 km/h) with a gust to 49 mph (80 
km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Earl is expected to produce additional rainfall amounts 
of 1 to 4 inches, with isolated storm totals of 8 inches, across 
the Leeward Islands, U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and Puerto 
Rico through Monday.  

Limited flash, urban, and small stream flooding impacts are 
possible.  Rapid rises on rivers and mudslides in areas of steep 
terrain are also possible, especially across the central interior 
region of Puerto Rico.  Locally considerable flood impacts are 
possible in areas that will receive heavier rainfall totals.

WIND:  Gusty winds, especially in squalls, are possible across the
northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico
through tonight.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Earl Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Tropical Storm Earl Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
1100 PM AST Sun Sep 04 2022

Earl continues to produce intense deep convection with tops colder 
than -80 deg C over the eastern portion of its circulation,  
but the system still lacks clear-cut banding features.  A 2306 UTC 
SSMIS microwave image showed that the low-level center is displaced 
to the west-southwest of the main area of convection.  Dvorak 
intensity estimates range from 45 kt to 55 kt, and given that there 
has been no obvious change in organization since the aircraft 
missions earlier today, the current intensity estimate is held at 45 
kt for this advisory.

The storm is still being affected by southwesterly vertical wind 
shear associated with an upper-level trough located several hundred 
miles to the west and northwest.  However, Earl's upper-level 
outflow pattern is gradually becoming better defined, and global 
model predictions suggest a slow relaxation of the shear over the 
next several days as the trough shifts a little to the northwest.  
Since the other environmental factors appear conducive for 
strengthening, gradual intensification is likely.  The official 
intensity forecast is close to both the simple and corrected model 
consensus and also very similar to the previous NHC forecast.  Earl 
could become the first major hurricane of this Atlantic season.

Earl's motion is a somewhat uncertain but slow 305/3 kt.  The storm 
remains in a region of weak steering currents with mid-level 
anticyclones currently located to the west, northwest and east.  By 
tomorrow, however, Earl should begin to move northward into a 
weakness in the subtropical ridge.  Later in the forecast period, 
the cyclone is expected to start coming under the influence of a 
trough in the southern portion of the mid-latitude westerlies and 
turn toward the north-northeast and northeast.  The official track 
forecast is just slightly left of the previous NHC track and close 
to the latest dynamical model consensus.  This is roughly in the 
middle of the rather tightly clustered track guidance model suite.
 
While tropical-storm-force winds are still forecast to stay north of
the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico,
training rainbands are producing heavy rainfall over portions of 
these islands.  Users should refer to products issued by local 
weather offices in these areas.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Heavy rainfall from Earl is expected to lead to limited flash,
urban, and small stream flooding impacts over the Leeward Islands,
U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico today. Rapid rises
on rivers and mudslides in areas of steep terrain are possible in
Puerto Rico.  Considerable flood impacts cannot be ruled out in 
areas that receive heavier rainfall totals.
 
2.  Earl is forecast to remain to the north of the the Virgin 
Islands and Puerto Rico tonight, but gusty winds, especially in 
squalls, remain possible on those islands overnight.

Hurricane Danielle Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
900 AM GMT Mon Sep 05 2022
 
There's been little change in Danielle's cloud pattern during the
past 6 hours, and a clear symmetric warm 13C banding eye feature
has persisted and has intermittently been closing off.  The 
satellite intensity estimates haven't changed, and the initial
intensity is held at 80 kt for this advisory.
 
Little change in strength is forecast through today.  Afterward,
the cyclone should slowly weaken through the entire period as it
moves over cooler water while increasing southwesterly shear
disrupts the upper outflow pattern.  The CMC, UKMET, and the GFS
agree with Danielle to begin an extratropical transition around 36 
hours and complete its change by 72 hours (Thursday).  This cyclone 
transformation timeline is reflected in the NHC forecast, and the 
predicted 5-day intensity closely follows the IVCN and HCCA aids.
 
The hurricane's initial motion is estimated to be 030 at 7 kt, a 
little faster than previously noted.  Danielle should continue to 
accelerate and move north-northeastward to northeastward through 
early Tuesday in response to a mid-latitude baroclinic system 
approaching from the northwest, out of the Canadian Maritimes.  By 
Tuesday night, the cyclone should turn toward the east-northeast 
within the mid-latitude westerly steering flow and continue in 
this general motion for 60 hours.  A turn back toward the northeast 
is forecast as an extratropical cyclone on Thursday.  It's 
worth mentioning that earlier today, there was quite a bit of 
uncertainty (global model cross-track spread) about Danielle's 
trajectory beyond the mid-period.  The GFS and the UKMET predict 
Danielle will turn back toward the northeast Wednesday in the 
southwesterly peripheral flow of a larger baroclinic low 
approaching the cyclone from the northwest Atlantic.  However, the 
ECMWF 12 and 18z runs showed considerably less baroclinic low 
influence while continuing toward the east-northeast, southwest of 
the British Isles.  The latest 00z run, subsequently, has trended 
more toward the GFS/UKMET solution, which has resulted in some 
increase in track forecast confidence.  Accordingly, the NHC 
forecast is again adjusted slightly north of the previous one to 
align more with a consensus (TVCA) of the models mentioned above.
