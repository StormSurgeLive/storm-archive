...EARL NOW A 65-MPH TROPICAL STORM...
...FORECAST TO MOVE SLOWLY NORTHWARD THE NEXT FEW DAYS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.5N 65.3W
ABOUT 215 MI...345 KM N OF ST. THOMAS
ABOUT 745 MI...1200 KM S OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 340 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...998 MB...29.47 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands,
Puerto Rico, and Bermuda should monitor the progress of Earl.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Earl was 
located near latitude 21.5 North, longitude 65.3 West. Earl is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h). A slow motion 
to the north-northwest or north is forecast to continue for the next 
24 to 48 hours followed by a gradual turn to the north-northeast 
thereafter. 

NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft data earlier indicated that the 
maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Some slight additional strengthening is possible later today, 
with little change in strength expected tomorrow. Earl could still 
become a hurricane later this week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Earl is expected to produce additional rainfall amounts of
1 to 4 inches, with isolated storm totals of 8 inches, across the
Leeward Islands, U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico
through Monday.
 
Limited flash, urban, and small stream flooding impacts are
possible.  Rapid rises on rivers and mudslides in areas of steep
terrain are also possible, especially across the central interior
region of Puerto Rico. Locally considerable flood impacts are
possible in areas that will receive heavier rainfall totals.
 
WIND:  Winds are diminishing across the the northern Leeward
Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Tropical Storm Earl Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
1100 AM AST Mon Sep 05 2022
 
Earl is attempting to restructure again this morning. Convection, 
which had been primarily located east of the center, due to 
persistent moderate westerly vertical wind shear, has begun to pivot 
up-shear into the northern quadrant of the storm. A NOAA-P3 mission 
that was in the storm this morning indicated the low-level wind 
field in the northern semicircle of the storm had also intensified, 
with several dropsondes indicating boundary layer mean winds in the 
55-65 kt range and one reported a surface wind gust of 57 kt. These 
values match the twin Doppler radar (TDR) onboard of the aircraft, 
with peak 0.5 km winds above 64 kt. The peak SFMR winds from the 
mission were 58 kt, with 700-mb flight-level winds at 63 kt. The 
satellite presentation this morning though remains somewhat ragged, 
with the low-level circulation partially exposed, though TDR 
analysis suggest the vertical tilt between the low- and mid-level 
centers has decreased compared to yesterday. Based partially on the 
these aircraft observations, the intensity has been set at 55 kt for 
this advisory, which also agrees with the latest TAFB intensity 
estimate.
 
The center of the cyclone may have relocated a bit northeast of the 
previous position, but the mean general motion appears to still be 
to the north-northwest at 340/4 kt. The track model guidance is 
generally in good agreement in the short-term that this slow 
northward motion should continue, as the cyclone moves poleward 
through a weakness in the deep-layer ridging to its north. This 
mid-level ridge is then forecast to continue breaking down as a 
deep-layer trough approaches from the eastern United States. This 
synoptic pattern change should be enough for Earl to begin a 
somewhat faster north-northeastward motion after 72 hours. However, 
after this time, uncertainty in the along-track direction between 
both deterministic and ensemble guidance starts to increase 
dramatically, with the GFS and its ensemble mean faster, and the 
ECWMF and its ensemble mean slower. The latest NHC track forecast is 
a bit further to the east early on, due to the adjustment in the 
initial position, but ends up near, if a bit slower, than the 
previous forecast track by the end of the forecast period. This 
track is close to an average of the latest GFS and ECMWF forecasts. 
Given the large uncertainty observed in the guidance at day 5, 
forecast track confidence in that time frame is lower than normal.
 
While Earl was found to be a bit stronger by the NOAA-P3 aircraft 
this morning, westerly vertical wind shear is still quite evident, 
and both the GFS- and ECMWF-based SHIPS guidance suggests this shear 
could actually increase a bit more over the next 24-36 hours. Thus, 
only a slight additional amount of intensification is forecast 
today, followed by Earl remaining steady over the 24-36 hour period. 
After the cyclone moves poleward of the shear zone induced by a 
nearby tropical upper-tropospheric trough, the shear is expected to 
decrease significantly, allowing more robust intensification. The 
tropical storm wind field is also forecast to increase dramatically 
during this period as a result of the system also undergoing a 
positive upper-level trough interaction. The latest NHC intensity 
forecast still shows a peak intensity of 105 kt by day 5, though 
some regional hurricane models (HWRF, COAMPS-TC) are a bit higher 
than this forecast.

KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Heavy rainfall from Earl is expected to lead to limited flash,
urban, and small stream flooding impacts over the Leeward Islands,
U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico today. Rapid rises
on rivers and mudslides in areas of steep terrain are possible in
Puerto Rico.  Considerable flood impacts cannot be ruled out in
areas that receive heavier rainfall totals.
 
2.  Currently Earl is forecast to track to the southeast of Bermuda. 
However, the wind field of the tropical cyclone is expected to 
increase significantly, and interests on the island should continue 
to monitor the progress of the storm closely.

Hurricane Danielle Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
900 PM GMT Mon Sep 05 2022
 
After a large degradation in Danielle's appearance earlier this 
afternoon, the hurricane appears to be holding more steady now with 
colder cloud tops wrapping further around its center than were noted 
6 hours ago. Dvorak-based intensity estimates still support an 
intensity near 75 kt. The hurricane has moved a little 
faster north-northeastward than anticipated during the last few 
hours, with an initial motion estimate of 030/kt.

A significant adjustment was made to the track forecast at days 4 
and 5, at which time Danielle is forecast to be an extratropical 
cyclone. For the first 3 days of the forecast period, Danielle is 
still forecast to move generally northeastward in the mid-latitude 
flow. After that, it looks like Danielle could occlude and "cut-off" 
from that steering flow, which may cause it to turn abruptly 
northward and then southeastward at days 4-5. This scenario has been 
consistently forecast for a few model cycles of the GFS and other 
global models, so large changes were made to the NHC track forecast 
to bring it closer to the model consensus. Other than a slight 
adjustment northward and faster, no important changes were made to 
the NHC track forecast for the first 72 h. Given the uncertainty at 
the extended portion of the forecast, it should be noted that 
confidence in the track forecast is substantially higher for the 
first 72 h than the later hours. It is worth noting that Danielle 
is forecast to be post-tropical by 96 h, so users should not focus 
on the exact track of the cyclone since the largest impacts could 
be felt far from its center.

Danielle should slowly weaken during the next few days as it moves 
over marginally cool water, but most dynamical guidance suggests it 
will still maintain its tropical characteristics for at least a 
couple more days. Around day 3, SHIPS diagnostics indicate the 
waters below the cyclone will be less than 20 deg C, and it will 
likely complete its extratropical transition around that time. 
The NHC forecast follows accordingly, but it should be noted this 
suggests a slightly later completion to the transition than 
previously forecast. The NHC intensity forecast is near the middle 
of the relatively low-spread intensity guidance envelope.
