Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Thu Sep 1 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Danielle, located about 950 miles west of the Azores.<br/>
<br/>
East of the Leeward Islands:<br/>
Data from both NOAA and Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft <br/>
indicate that the circulation of the area of low pressure located <br/>
several hundred miles east of the Leeward Islands remains broad.  <br/>
The system continues to produce bursts of showers and thunderstorms <br/>
that have changed little in organization over the past 24 hours.  <br/>
Although environmental conditions remain only marginally conducive, <br/>
any additional development of the system over the next few days <br/>
would lead to the formation of a tropical depression.  The <br/>
disturbance is expected to move slowly west-northwestward, toward <br/>
the adjacent waters of the northern Leeward Islands.  Additional <br/>
information on this system can be found in High Seas Forecasts <br/>
issued by the National Weather Service. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
Shower activity associated with a broad area of low pressure <br/>
located just northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands remains limited.  <br/>
This system is moving into an area of less favorable environmental <br/>
conditions, and significant development is not anticipated. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Danielle Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
300 AM GMT Fri Sep 02 2022
 
The overall organization of the tropical cyclone has continued to 
increase since the previous advisory.  The primary convective band 
now wraps nearly completely around the center, and there have been 
occasional hints of a ragged eye.  Earlier microwave imagery also  
revealed the presence of a ragged low- to mid-level eye feature.  
Subjective Dvorak classifications have risen to T3.0 (45 kt) and 
T3.5 (55 kt) from SAB and TAFB, respectively.  Given the continued 
improvement in structure, the intensity has been increased to 55 kt, 
the higher end of those estimates. 

Despite the high latitude of the tropical cyclone, atmospheric and 
oceanic conditions are expected to remain favorable for additional 
strengthening over the next 2-3 days.  As mentioned previously, the 
cyclone is located over anomalously warm waters, and the vertical 
wind shear is forecast to remain generally low through 72 hours.  
As a result, continued steady strengthening is expected, and 
Danielle is forecast to become a hurricane on Friday.  By days 4 and 
5, cooler sea surface temperatures and increasing shear are likely 
to cause some weakening. The NHC wind speed forecast is in good 
agreement with the latest intensity consensus aids, and shows the 
same peak intensity as the previous official forecast. 
 
Danielle continues its slow eastward motion of around 090 degrees 
at 2 kt.  The cyclone is situated within an area of light steering 
flow under an omega block, which is expected to cause Danielle to 
meander during the next few days.  The strong mid-level ridge to 
the north is forecast to weaken and shift eastward early next week.  
By days 4 and 5, an approaching mid-latitude trough should begin to 
lift Danielle northeastward at an increasingly faster forward speed. 
Little change was required to the early portion of the track 
forecast, but the latter part has been adjusted eastward to be in 
better alignment with the GFS and ECMWF ensemble means, and the 
latest multi-model consensus aids.
