Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Thu Sep 1 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on newly formed <br/>
Tropical Depression Five, located about 1000 miles west of the <br/>
Azores.<br/>
<br/>
East of the Leeward Islands:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a broad area of low <br/>
pressure located several hundred miles east of the Leeward Islands <br/>
have changed little this morning. Although environmental conditions <br/>
remain only marginally conducive, any additional development of the <br/>
system over the next few days would lead to the formation of a <br/>
tropical depression.  The disturbance is forecast to move slowly <br/>
west-northwestward, toward the adjacent waters of the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands.  Additional information on this system can be found <br/>
in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
Satellite imagery and surface observations show that a broad area <br/>
of low pressure is located over and to the northwest of the Cabo <br/>
Verde Islands.  While surface observations indicate pressures are <br/>
low in this area, the associated shower activity is currently <br/>
poorly organized. There is still some chance for the system to <br/>
become a short-lived tropical depression within the next day or so <br/>
before environmental conditions become unfavorable for further <br/>
development. Regardless, the system could bring locally heavy <br/>
rainfall to portions of the Cabo Verde Islands today and tonight. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Five Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
500 AM AST Thu Sep 01 2022

Satellite imagery indicates that the low pressure area over the 
North Atlantic west of the Azores has developed a well-defined 
circulation and convective banding in the eastern semicircle.  Based 
on this structure, advisories are being initiated on Tropical 
Depression Five with an initial intensity of 30 kt.

Despite the high latitude, the cyclone is in an area of light 
steering currents on the southeast and south side of an anomalously 
strong mid-level anticyclone.  This should result in a slow motion 
for the next three days or so, with the guidance showing an eastward 
drift followed by a westward drift.  After three days, the 
anticyclone is forecast to move eastward and weaken as the 
mid-latitude westerlies start encroaching on the system.  The 
large-scale models are not in good agreement with how this will 
steer the cyclone, with the GFS and Canadian showing a general 
motion toward the east while the UKMET and ECMWF forecast a more 
northward motion.  The track forecast is close to all of the 
guidance for the first three days, and then calls for a 
northeastward motion between the HFIP Corrected Consensus and the 
other consensus models at days 4 and 5.

The sea surface temperatures in the area are warmer than normal - 
near 27C.  This warm water, combined with a forecast environment of 
light- to moderate westerly shear for the next three days or so, 
should allow steady strengthening.  The intensity forecast calls for 
the system to become a tropical storm later today, a hurricane in 
about two days, and reach a peak intensity of 80 kt in about 4 days. 
It should be noted that this forecast is close to the intensity 
consensus, and there are models forecasting more intensification.  
After four days, motion over cooler water and increasing shear 
should cause the cyclone to weaken.
