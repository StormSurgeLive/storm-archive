<title>Tropical Storm Earl Forecast Discussion Number 2</title>

Tropical Storm Earl Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
500 AM AST Sat Sep 03 2022

Satellite imagery and radar data from Guadeloupe show that Earl 
remains a sheared tropical cyclone, with the low-level center 
located to the west of the main convective mass. Various satellite 
intensity estimates are in the 25-45 kt range and have changed 
little since the last advisory.  Based on this, the initial 
intensity remains 35 kt.  A NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft will 
investigate Earl starting near 1000 UTC.

The initial motion is 285/11.  The track guidance remains in good 
agreement that Earl should move west-northwestward and 
northwestward with a decrease in forward speed for the next couple 
of days as it is steered by the subtropical ridge. There is little 
change in this part of the forecast track from the previous 
advisory.  After that time, a slower motion toward the north and 
eventually north-northeast is expected as a mid- to upper-level 
trough develops over the Atlantic to the west and north of Earl.  
The guidance envelope for the latter part of the forecast track has 
shifted eastward, and while the new forecast track is also nudged 
eastward it is west of the consensus models from 60-120 h.

Earl is feeling the effects of moderate westerly shear, and current 
indications are this will continue for the next 48 h or so.  Thus, 
the intensity forecast calls for modest strengthening during this 
time.  The intensity forecast becomes more uncertain as Earl turns 
northward.  While some shear is likely to continue, the dynamical 
models are in good agreement that the cyclone will strengthen, 
possibly due to a favorable interaction to the aforementioned 
upper-level trough.  However, there is poor agreement between the 
models in the details of this interaction.  Given that, the 
intensity forecast from 72-120 h will show a little more 
strengthening than the previous forecast.  However, the forecast 
intensities are on the low side of the guidance envelope.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds are forecast to remain on the northern
and eastern side of the circulation, and as a result, are not
expected to move across the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, or Puerto Rico.  However, any southward shift of Earl's
center would increase the risk of tropical-storm-force winds in
those areas.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical Storm Earl is forecast to pass near or just to the
north of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico over the weekend.  Gusty winds, especially in squalls,
area possible on those islands over the next day or two.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall from Earl is expected to lead to limited flash, 
urban, and small stream flooding impacts over the Leeward Islands, 
U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico this weekend.   
Rapid rises on rivers are possible in Puerto Rico.

Tropical Storm Danielle Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
300 PM GMT Sat Sep 03 2022
 
Satellite images indicate that Danielle has generally changed little
during the past several hours.  The storm is still producing bands
of deep convection, especially on its north side, but there are dry
slots that have entrained into the south side of the circulation.
The Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB range from 55 to 65 kt, and
based on that data, the initial intensity is held at 60 kt.
 
Danielle has been moving very slowly to the west-northwest at 2 kt
and is back over the same location where it was 24-36 hours ago.  A
continued slow west-northwestward motion is expected through tonight
as the storm remains steered by a blocking ridge to its north.
However, a sharp turn to the north is forecast on Sunday followed by
a faster motion to the northeast after that as a trough currently
over eastern Canada approaches Danielle.  Although the models agree
on the overall scenario, there is a fair amount of spread on where
and how sharply the storm is expected to turn.  The NHC track
forecast is a little to the west of the previous one in the short
term, but ends up near the previous forecast from 48 to 120 h, and
it lies roughly near the middle of the guidance envelope.
 
Danielle has been over its own cool SSTs wake during the past 12-18 
hours, which possibly caused the observed slight weakening.  
However, as the storm pulls away from that area and remains in 
generally favorable atmospheric conditions, Danielle will likely 
restrengthen during the next couple of days.  Beyond that time, 
cooler waters, drier air, and an increase in shear should cause some 
weakening.  Danielle is expected to become an extratropical cyclone 
by the end of the forecast period when it merges with the 
approaching trough and moves over SSTs near 20C.  The NHC intensity 
forecast is just an update of the previous one and in line with the 
HCCA and IVCN consensus aids.
