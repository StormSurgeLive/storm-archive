NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Wed Sep 7 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Danielle, located several hundred miles northwest of the Azores, and <br/>
on Hurricane Earl, located several hundred miles south of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic: <br/>
An area of low pressure located several hundred miles west of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands is producing a large area of disorganized showers <br/>
and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions appear conducive for <br/>
additional development of this system over the next couple of days, <br/>
and a tropical depression could form over this period while it moves <br/>
westward to west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the eastern and <br/>
central tropical Atlantic.  After that time, upper-level winds are <br/>
forecast to become less conducive for development.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
African Coast:<br/>
A tropical wave currently located near the west African coast is <br/>
forecast to emerge offshore into the eastern Atlantic over the next <br/>
day or so. Environmental conditions appear conducive for some <br/>
gradual development thereafter as the system moves <br/>
west-northwestward over the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Earl was located 
near latitude 25.4 North, longitude 65.8 West. Earl is moving toward 
the north near 6 mph (9 km/h), and a continued northward motion is

north-northeast and then northeast with an increase in forward speed 
is expected to begin on Thursday and continue through early 
Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of Earl is expected to 
pass to the southeast of Bermuda late Thursday and Thursday night.
 
Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that maximum 
sustained winds have increased to 85 mph (135 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, 
and Earl is expected to become a major hurricane late Thursday or 
Thursday night.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125
miles (205 km).
 
The minimum central pressure reported by the NOAA Hurricane Hunter
aircraft is 978 mb (28.88 inches).

Hurricane Earl Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
500 AM AST Wed Sep 07 2022
 
Strong westerly shear (analyzed to be around 30 kt) continues to
affect Earl, with the hurricane exhibiting an asymmetric convective
structure in infrared satellite imagery.  A recent Air Force Reserve
Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported that the central pressure has
fallen to 981 mb, however there's been no apparent change in the
maximum winds and the eyewall is open to the south and southeast.  
The plane measured a peak 700-mb flight-level wind of 78 kt and SFMR
winds as high as 71 kt; therefore the maximum sustained winds are
still estimated to be 70 kt.
 
Earl has been moving slowly just west of due north, or 355/5 kt, 
while sandwiched between a mid-level ridge over the central 
Atlantic and high pressure over Florida.  A trough over the eastern 
United States is expected to move offshore during the next couple 
of days, causing Earl to turn northeastward and accelerate through 
day 3.  The track guidance is tightly clustered during the first 3 
days of the forecast, although many of the models have trended a 
little slower during the northeastward turn.  No cross-track 
adjustments to the NHC forecast were needed during that period.  
There has been a marked shift and increase in spread among the 
track models on days 4 and 5, however, with the GFS, ECMWF, and 
COAMPS-TC showing Earl merging with a deep-layer low and turning 
northward or northwestward toward Newfoundland as an extratropical 
low.  For now, the updated NHC forecast shows Earl slowing down 
considerably to the southeast of Newfoundland on days 4 and 5.

GFS- and ECMWF-based SHIPS guidance show the strong shear currently 
affecting Earl decreasing to moderate levels in about 12 hours, and 
even to low levels in about 36 hours.  Combined with very warm 
waters and a possible positive trough interaction during the next 
24 hours, Earl is forecast to strengthen and is likely to become a 
major hurricane in the next 36 to 48 hours while passing to the 
southeast of Bermuda.  Weakening is expected to begin after day 3 
due to colder waters and another increase in shear, and Earl is 
forecast to become extratropical by day 4 while it interacts with 
the aforementioned deep-layer low to the southeast of Atlantic 
Canada.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Although Earl's center is forecast to pass southeast of Bermuda,
the wind field is expected to grow, with tropical-storm-force winds
forecast to spread across the island beginning Thursday afternoon 
and continuing through Friday morning.
 
2.  Swells generated by Earl are expected to reach Bermuda by
tonight.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and 
rip current conditions through Friday.  Please consult products from 
your local weather office.

Hurricane Danielle Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
300 PM GMT Wed Sep 07 2022
 
Danielle is an impressive hurricane for so far north and east in
the Atlantic Ocean, thanks to near-record warm SSTs in the vicinity 
and a high-latitude blocking pattern.  Satellite images show that 
the cyclone has a large eye with a broken eyewall, although
recently the eyewall convection has degraded a bit.  The current
intensity is set to 70 kt, a blend of the recent TAFB/SAB fixes.  A
recent scatterometer pass also show that the hurricane has grown in
size, and this is reflected in the analysis and size forecast. 
Additionally, drifting buoy 41047 has reported 984.7 mb well 
outside of the eye, and the central pressure has been lowered to be 
in better agreement with this data.
 
The hurricane is already showing some signs of extratropical
transition, with the cloud pattern starting to elongate on the
northern side.  This is a harbinger of an incoming trough which, in
combination with cold SSTs, should result in a quick extratropical
transition of Danielle in about 24 hours.  Global and regional
hurricane models are in good agreement on a gradual decline in wind
speeds during the forecast period, and little change was made to
the previous NHC intensity forecast.
 
Danielle is moving northeastward at about 14 kt.  The cyclone is
expected to execute a large counterclockwise loop due to a
mid-latitude trough diving southward from the Canadian Maritimes.
Danielle should merge with this trough and be the dominant feature
as it moves east-southeastward across the north Atlantic.  Only
small changes were made to the last forecast, and the new forecast
is close to the Atlantic tropical cyclone consensus track aid TVCA.
 
The tropical cyclone continues to produce a large area of very
rough seas over the central-north Atlantic.  More information can be
found in the High Seas Forecasts issued by the Ocean Prediction
Center under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and
online at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php.  The UK Met Office
also has information in High Seas Forecasts for the west Central
and east Central sections issued under WMO header FQNT21 EGRR and
on the web at
