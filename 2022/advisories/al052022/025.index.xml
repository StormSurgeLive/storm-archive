Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Wed Sep 7 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Danielle, located several hundred miles west-northwest of the <br/>
Azores, and on recently upgraded Hurricane Earl, located several <br/>
hundred miles south of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic: <br/>
An area of low pressure located several hundred miles west of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands is producing a large area of disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions appear <br/>
conducive for some development of this system, and a tropical <br/>
depression could form in the next day or two while it moves <br/>
westward to west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the eastern and <br/>
central tropical Atlantic.  After that time, upper-level winds are <br/>
forecast to become less conducive for development late this week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
African Coast:<br/>
A tropical wave currently located over western Africa is forecast to <br/>
emerge offshore into the eastern Atlantic by the end of the week. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear conducive for some slow development <br/>
thereafter as the system moves west-northwestward over the eastern <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Earl was located 
by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 
25.0 North, longitude 65.9 West.  Earl is moving toward the north 
near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this motion is expected to continue today 
with a gradual turn to the north-northeast on Thursday.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Earl is expected to pass to the 
southeast of Bermuda by Thursday evening.
 
Preliminary data from the reconnaissance plane indicate that the 
maximum sustained winds remain near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Strengthening is expected over the next couple of days, and 
Earl is forecast to become a major hurricane by Thursday evening.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115
miles (185 km).
 
The minimum central pressure based on aircraft dropsonde data is 
982 mb (29.00 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Earl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
WIND: Tropical Storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning
on Thursday afternoon.
 
RAINFALL: Earl is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 1 to 2
inches or 25 to 50 mm across Bermuda through Friday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Earl are expected to reach Bermuda by
Thursday morning.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions through Friday.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Earl Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
1100 PM AST Tue Sep 06 2022
 
Earl continues to be become better organized this evening.  An 
ongoing NOAA reconnaissance mission measured 700-mb flight-level 
winds as high as 80 kt, which supports an intensity of around 70 kt. 
There were some higher winds measured by the SFMR and dropsondes, 
however, we prefer to remain on the conservative side given the 
fluctuations Earl has been experiencing over the past 24 hours.  
Radar images show the eyewall is still open to the south, and Earl 
is likely is still experiencing the affects of strong shear.

The aircraft fixes indicate that Earl is moving northward at 6 kt.  
A mid-level ridge over the hurricane is expected to continue 
weakening while a trough moves off the coast of the eastern United 
States.  This trough is predicted to steer Earl to the northeast in 
about a day or so and accelerate its forward motion poleward.  Once 
again, the track model guidance has shifted west slightly, and the 
NHC track forecast has moved to the west and is closest to the 
correct consensus model guidance.

Despite the model-analyzed strong westerly deep-layer shear, Earl 
has intensified.  This magnitude of shear is predicted to continue 
for another day or so before weakening briefly in about two days for 
a 24-hour period.  Oceanic conditions under the hurricane are 
expected to be conducive for further intensification for the next 
few days as well.  Therefore, the latest official forecast predicts 
the hurricane will continue to intensify for the next 24 hours, with 
a quicker rate of strengthening between 24 and 72 hours.  Earl is 
expected to make its extratropical transition by day 5.   


KEY MESSAGES: 

1.  Although Earl's center is forecast to pass southeast of Bermuda, 
the wind field is expected to grow, with tropical-storm-force winds 
possibly spreading across the island on Thursday.

2.  Swells generated by Earl are expected to reach Bermuda by
Thursday morning.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions through Friday.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Danielle Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
900 AM GMT Wed Sep 07 2022
 
Danielle's cloud pattern has significantly improved over the past 6 
hours.  The banding eye feature has warmed back up and cleared out, 
and the cloud tops are cooling in two prominent curved bands located 
in the north and south semicircles.  The subjective Dvorak T-numbers 
from TAFB and SAB have increased, and a UW-CIMSS OPEN-AIIR satellite 
intensity analysis yields 70-75 kt.  These data and the earlier 
SAROPS surface wind retrieval support raising the initial intensity 
to 70 kt for this advisory.
 
Danielle should continue moving over marginally warm waters for
just a few more hours, so some fluctuations in strength, similar to 
what the cyclone has just undergone, are still possible. 
Satellite imagery and global model data indicate that a 
favorable position of a polar jet finger associated with the 
approaching baroclinic zone may be dynamically influencing 
Danielle's short-term intensification.  By early Thursday, the 
cyclone is expected to traverse a sharp sea surface temperature 
gradient of 20C or less.  These cooler waters, along with the 
eventual loss of dynamic forcing should cause a gradual weakening 
trend through the early next week.
 
Danielle's initial motion is estimated to be northeastward, or
050/12 kt.  Once again, there is no significant change to the NHC
forecast philosophy.  The hurricane should continue accelerating in
response to a vigorous baroclinic system approaching from the
northwest midway between Newfoundland and Danielle.  Danielle
is forecast to interact and merge with the system mentioned above
late Thursday night into Friday.  Over the weekend, the large
post-tropical storm-force low is expected to slip south back into 
the deep-layer mid-latitude westerlies, turn south-southeastward to 
southeastward, and continue in this general heading through early 
next week.  The NHC forecast is similar to the previous one and is 
close to the various multi-model consensus aids.
 
Danielle is producing a vast area of very rough seas over the
central-north Atlantic. More information can be found in the
High Seas Forecasts issued by the Ocean Prediction Center under
AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php.  The UK Met Office also has 
information in High Seas Forecasts for the west Central and east 
Central sections issued under WMO header FQNT21 EGRR and on the web 
at metoffice.gov.uk/weather/specialist-forecasts/coast-and-sea/high-
