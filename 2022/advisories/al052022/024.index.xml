Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Tue Sep 6 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Danielle, located several hundred miles west-northwest of the <br/>
Azores, and on Tropical Storm Earl, located several hundred miles <br/>
south of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic: <br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue near the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands extending southwestward several hundred miles in association <br/>
with a broad area of low pressure.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
conducive for some development of this system, and a tropical <br/>
depression could form in a few days while it moves westward to <br/>
west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the eastern and central <br/>
tropical Atlantic.  Upper-level winds are forecast to become less <br/>
conducive for development late this week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
African Coast:<br/>
A tropical wave currently located over western Africa is forecast to <br/>
emerge offshore into the eastern Atlantic in a day or two. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear generally conducive for some slow <br/>
development thereafter as the system moves west-northwestward over <br/>
the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Earl was
located by a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 24.4 
North, longitude 65.8 West. Earl is moving toward the north near 6 
mph (9 km/h) and this motion is expected to continue into tomorrow 
with a gradual turn to the north-northeast on Thursday. On the 
forecast track, the center of Earl is expected to pass to the 
southeast of Bermuda by Friday morning.
 
Data from the Hurricane Hunters indicate that the maximum sustained 
winds have increased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Strengthening is expected over the next couple of days and Earl is 
forecast to become a major hurricane by Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles 
(205 km) from the center.

Tropical Storm Earl Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
500 PM AST Tue Sep 06 2022
 
Earl has become somewhat better organized this afternoon. After the 
previous reconnaissance mission concluded, deep convection increased 
closer to the low-level circulation, with evidence of deep 
convection rotating more up-shear on convectional satellite imagery. 
An AMSR2 microwave pass at 1728 UTC also showed this improved 
structure, with a formative inner core with at least 50 percent 
convective coverage, though it was still evident that the mid-level 
center remains displaced to the northeast. This afternoon's Air 
Force Reserve Reconnaissance mission confirmed Earl has strengthened 
from this morning, with peak 850 mb flight level winds of 72 kt and 
SFMR at 63 kt. The second pass through also had a minimum pressure 
of 991 mb. These values support increasing the initial intensity to 
60 kt this advisory.
 
Aircraft fixes indicate that Earl has resumed a northward motion, 
with the latest estimate at 355/6 kt. There is not much change in 
the track reasoning this cycle, as the mid-level ridge over Earl is 
expected to break down further and a positively-tilted deep-layer 
trough moves offshore of the eastern United States. This trough is 
expected to capture the tropical cyclone, helping Earl to recurve to 
the northeast with a faster forward motion after 36 hours. The track 
guidance did shift a bit to the west this cycle and the latest NHC 
track forecast is also bit west of the previous cycle, closest to 
the HCCA consensus aid, which remains slightly east of the latest 
GFS Forecast.
 
Earl seems to be effectively battling some rather hostile westerly 
deep-layer (200-850 mb) vertical wind shear, estimated at 25-30 kt 
in the GFS and ECMWF-based SHIPS. Earl's resiliency is possibly 
related to the shear under this deep-layer being lower in magnitude 
and Earl's vortex column not extending all the way to 200 mb. Given 
the improvement in structure today, the latest intensity forecast 
now shows some slow intensification despite the shear in the next 
12-24 hours. After this period, the shear is forecast to rapidly 
decrease to under 10 kt by 48 hours, as the cyclone continues to 
traverse anomalously warm 29-30 C sea-surface temperatures. The 
majority of the models respond to this favorable environment by 
showing significant deepening. The latest NHC intensity forecast is 
a bit higher than the prior one, now showing a peak of 110 kt in 72 
hours, similar to the latest HCCA guidance. Thereafter, Earl will 
likely begin the process of extratropical transition as it interacts 
with a mid-latitude trough, with this transition likely to complete 
sometime between the 4-5 day time frame when all deep convection is 
stripped away.
 
Earl's center is expected to pass to the southeast of Bermuda in
48-60 hours. However, the size of the wind field of the tropical
cyclone is expected to increase significantly, and the Bermuda
Weather Service has issued a tropical storm watch for the Island of
Bermuda.

Hurricane Danielle Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
300 AM GMT Wed Sep 07 2022
 
This morning's conventional satellite presentation indicates
little change in Danielle's cloud pattern since yesterday morning.
However, a recent SSMI/S microwave image shows a subtle vertical
tilt toward the east.  The initial intensity is held at 65 kt for 
this advisory and is based on a blend of the subjective and AiDT 
objective satellite intensity estimates and an earlier STAR SAR/S1 
surface wind retrieval that indicated winds of 70 kt.  
 
Danielle should remain over marginally warm waters for the next 
12-18 hours. Subsequently, little change in strength is expected 
during that time.  By early Thursday, Danielle will move over a 
sharp surface temperature gradient of 22C or less.  This negative 
oceanic contribution, combined with the loss of dynamic forcing 
after the cyclone merges with the approaching baroclinic system, 
should induce a slow weakening trend through the end of the period.
 
Danielle's initial motion is estimated to be east-northeastward, or
060/11 kt.  There is no significant change to the NHC forecast
philosophy.  Danielle should continue accelerating in response to a 
vigorous baroclinic system approaching from the northwest Atlantic 
east of the Newfoundland coast.  Danielle is forecast to interact 
with the system mentioned above late Thursday night.  On Friday, the 
two systems are predicted to merge and become a larger and strong 
extratropical low with asymmetric deep warm core characteristics 
typical of warm seclusions.  Over the weekend, the large 
post-tropical low is expected to turn east-southeastward and 
maintain this general motion through early next week.
 
Danielle is producing a vast area of very rough seas over the
central-north Atlantic. More information can be found in the
High Seas Forecasts issued by the Ocean Prediction Center under
AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php.
The UK Met Office also has information in High Seas Forecasts for
the west Central and east Central sections issued under WMO header
FQNT21 EGRR and on the web at
metoffice.gov.uk/weather/specialist-forecasts/coast-and-sea/high-
