track, the center of Earl is expected to pass just north of the 
northern Leeward Islands today, and north of the Virgin Islands and 
Puerto Rico tonight and Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Slow strengthening is possible during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km), 
mainly to the north and east of the center.

to 4 inches, with isolated totals of 6 inches, across the Leeward
Islands, U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico this
weekend.
 
Limited flash, urban, and small stream flooding impacts are
possible.  Rapid rises on rivers and mudslides in areas of steep

Tropical Storm Earl Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
1100 AM AST Sat Sep 03 2022
 
Earl is a sheared tropical cyclone this morning, as the low-level 
center is fully exposed to the west of the convective mass. NOAA 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft data indicate the vortex remains tilted 
due to about 15 kt of deep-layer southwesterly shear over the 
cyclone. Recently, a more vigorous burst of convection has developed 
closer to the center. The initial intensity is held at 35 kt based 
on a blend of flight-level, SFMR, and dropsonde data from the 
aircraft. It is noted that the surface pressure near the center has 
fallen a couple of millibars since the previous advisory.

The cyclone remains on a west-northwestward heading as it is being 
steered by the subtropical ridge. The guidance remains in very good 
agreement that Earl will maintain a west-northwestward to 
northwestward motion with a decrease in forward speed over the next 
couple of days. As a weakness develops in the subtropical ridge 
early next week, Earl is forecast to turn slowly northward and then 
northeastward by days 3-5 as a mid- to upper-level trough develops 
over the western Atlantic. Although there is increasing spread in 
the track guidance during this period as to how quickly Earl 
recurves, there is good overall agreement that the cyclone track 
will remain over the open Atlantic waters. The official NHC forecast 
has been adjusted slightly to the right of the previous one during 
the 36-72 h window, based on similar trends noted in the guidance 
consensus aids.

It appears that moderate deep-layer shear will continue to impact 
Earl during the next couple of days. Therefore, only modest 
strengthening is forecast during this time as the cyclone could 
struggle to become vertically aligned and sustain convection near 
its center. The intensity forecast is of lower confidence later in 
the period once Earl begins turning northward. Although the vertical 
shear is expected to persist or even strengthen, the potential for 
favorable interaction with the upper trough should allow for 
additional strengthening during this period, while the wind field of 
the cyclone broadens. Most of the dynamical models support this 
strengthening trend, and the latest NHC intensity forecast has been 
adjusted upward some during this period. However, there remains 
large spread in the intensity guidance at days 3-5, and the NHC 
forecast remains on the lower end of the models.

Tropical-storm-force winds are forecast to remain on the northern 
and eastern side of the circulation, and as a result, are not 
expected to move across the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin 
Islands, or Puerto Rico.  However, gusty winds in squalls are 
possible at these locations over the weekend.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical Storm Earl is forecast to pass near or just to the
north of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico over the weekend.  Gusty winds, especially in squalls,
area possible on those islands over the next day or two.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall from Earl is expected to lead to limited flash, 
urban, and small stream flooding impacts over the Leeward Islands, 
U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico this weekend.   
Rapid rises on rivers and mudslides in areas of steep terrain are 
possible in Puerto Rico.

Tropical Storm Danielle Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
900 PM GMT Sat Sep 03 2022
 
Danielle's cloud pattern has become better organized during the
past several hours with banding features gaining symmetry around
the center.  However, there are still some dry slots disrupting
the system's inner core.  A blend of the latest satellite intensity
estimates still supports an intensity of 60 kt, but Danielle could
become a hurricane again soon.  An ASCAT pass from several
hours ago was helpful in adjusting the initial 34- and 50-kt wind
radii.
 
The storm has been moving a little faster to the west at 5 kt and is
back over the same location where it was on Thursday. A continued
slow westward motion is expected into Sunday as the storm remains
steered by a blocking ridge to its north. However, a sharp turn to
the north is forecast by Sunday night followed by a faster motion to
the northeast after that as a trough currently over eastern Canada
approaches Danielle.  The new NHC track forecast has been adjusted
to the left in the short term, but ends up to the east of the
previous track at 96 and 120 h, trending toward the latest
consensus aids.
 
Danielle is expected to gradually pull away from its own cool SST
wake, and since the atmospheric conditions appear generally
favorable, slow strengthening seems likely during the next day or
two.  Beyond a couple of days, however, sharply cooler SSTs, drier
air, and an increase in vertical wind shear should end the
strengthening trend and induce some weakening.  Danielle is expected
to become fully extratropical by day 5 when it merges with the
approaching trough and moves over SSTs cooler than 20C. The NHC
intensity forecast is again an update of the previous one and
remains in line with the HCCA and IVCN consensus aids.
