...EARL NOW MOVING NORTH-NORTHWESTWARD WITH LITTLE CHANGE IN
STRENGTH...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.9N 65.3W
ABOUT 175 MI...280 KM N OF ST. THOMAS
ABOUT 790 MI...1270 KM S OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 335 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...998 MB...29.47 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands,
Puerto Rico, and Bermuda should monitor the progress of Earl.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Earl was
located near latitude 20.9 North, longitude 65.3 West. Earl is
moving toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h).  A turn 
toward the north at a slightly faster forward speed is expected 
later today, with this motion continuing for the next couple of 
days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Slow strengthening is forecast over the next several days, and Earl
could become a hurricane later this week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.  NOAA data buoy 41043 recently reported a
sustained wind of 43 mph (69 km/h) with a gust to 49 mph          
(79 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).  
NOAA data buoy 41043 recently reported a pressure of 1001.4 mb 
(29.57 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Earl is expected to produce additional rainfall amounts of
1 to 4 inches, with isolated storm totals of 8 inches, across the
Leeward Islands, U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico
through Monday.
 
Limited flash, urban, and small stream flooding impacts are
possible.  Rapid rises on rivers and mudslides in areas of steep
terrain are also possible, especially across the central interior
region of Puerto Rico. Locally considerable flood impacts are
possible in areas that will receive heavier rainfall totals.
 
WIND:  Gusty winds, especially in squalls, are possible across the
northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico
for a few more hours.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Earl Forecast Discussion Number 10</title>

Tropical Storm Earl Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
500 AM AST Mon Sep 05 2022

Satellite imagery this morning shows that Earl continues to produce 
strong convection to the northeast of the center.  However, data 
from the SHIPS model and analyses from CIMSS at the University 
of Wisconsin indicate that there is now 20-25 kt of southwesterly 
vertical shear impacting the cyclone.  As a result, the low-level 
center remains located near or just outside of the southwestern 
edge of the main convective mass.  Satellite intensity estimates 
have changed little since the last advisory, and data from NOAA 
buoy 41043 suggests the central pressure is still in the 998-1000 
mb range.  Based on this, the initial intensity remains 45 kt.  
Earlier scatterometer data showed that the circulation center was 
elongated from northeast to southwest, and recent wind obs suggest 
the northeast end of the elongation is near the NOAA buoy.

Earl is turning more northward, with the initial motion now 335/4 
kt.  For the next three days or so, the storm should move slowly 
northward in the flow between the subtropical ridge to the east and 
a mid- to upper-level trough to the west and northwest.  After 
that, a motion more toward the northeast is expected as Earl 
reaches the southern edge of the mid-latitude westerlies.  The 
large-scale models are in poor agreement on the features in the 
westerlies that Earl will encounter, with the GFS showing stronger 
flow and a faster motion than the UKMET and ECMWF.  The new 
forecast track is changed little through 60 h, then it is nudged a 
little westward based on a shift in the guidance envelope.  The 
track lies close to the various consensus models, and the speed at 
the end is a compromise between the faster GFS and the slower 
UKMET/ECMWF.

The large-scale models suggest that the current shear will persist 
for about the next 48 h.  After 48-60 h, Earl may find a region of 
lighter shear that could allow more significant strengthening.  
The new intensity forecast is a little slower to intensify Earl 
through 48 h based on the shear forecast, and it is possible that 
Earl could strengthen less than forecast during this time.  Later 
on, the new forecast is similar to the previous forecast.  It 
should be noted that if Earl does find a more favorable environment 
later in the forecast period, there are several models with a higher 
120-h forecast intensity than the current official forecast of 105 
kt.
 
While tropical-storm-force winds are still forecast to stay north of
the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico,
training rainbands are producing heavy rainfall over portions of
these islands.  Users should refer to products issued by local
weather offices in these areas.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Heavy rainfall from Earl is expected to lead to limited flash,
urban, and small stream flooding impacts over the Leeward Islands,
U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico today. Rapid rises
on rivers and mudslides in areas of steep terrain are possible in
Puerto Rico.  Considerable flood impacts cannot be ruled out in
areas that receive heavier rainfall totals.
 
2.  Earl is forecast to remain to the north of the the Virgin
Islands and Puerto Rico today, but gusty winds, especially in
squalls, remain possible on those islands for a few more hours.

Hurricane Danielle Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
300 PM GMT Mon Sep 05 2022
 
Danielle's satellite presentation has degraded since this morning. 
Cloud tops have warmed and its eye-like feature is not very well 
defined anymore. The hurricane has reached a relatively cool part 
of the Gulf Stream, which could be a main factor in its apparent 
weakening. Satellite intensity estimates from TAFB, SAB, and 
UW-CIMSS (both ADT and SATCON) have decreased, so the initial 
intensity has been lowered conservatively to 75 kt, which is at the 
high end of the estimates.

The lower initial intensity has also contributed to a lower 
intensity forecast, but the idea is generally the same. Danielle 
should slowly weaken during the next few days as it continues 
northeastward over marginally warm waters. The exact timing of the 
cyclone's upcoming extratropical transition is still uncertain, but 
most models indicate it should complete the process on or by 
Thursday. Further weakening is expected by all global models after 
that time, which continues to be reflected in the NHC forecast.

Negligible change was made to the portion of the track forecast when 
Danielle is expected to be a tropical cyclone. The hurricane is 
forecast to move generally northeastward today and 
east-northeastward through the middle of the week, steered by a 
mid-latitude system approaching from the northwest. At the end of 
the forecast period, most global models now suggest Danielle could 
make a sharp northward turn as an extratropical cyclone. This would 
represent a significant change to the day 4-5 forecast, so I would 
prefer to see if that stays consistent for another cycle of model 
runs before making too big of a change. The official track forecast 
is therefore very close to the multi-model consensus through 72 h, 
but is notably to the south and east of the consensus at days 4 and 
5, That said, it has still been adjusted to the northwest of the 
previous forecast at those times.
