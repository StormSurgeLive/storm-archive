of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico today, and then move away 
from the islands tonight and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Slow strengthening is expected during the next few days.

<title>Tropical Storm Earl Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Earl Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
500 AM AST Sun Sep 04 2022

Satellite imagery, surface observations, and WSR-88D radar data 
from Puerto Rico indicate that Earl remains disorganized due to 
ongoing southwesterly vertical wind shear, and that the center is 
rather tricky to locate.  One vorticity center, associated with a 
fresh convective burst, is located just north of the Virgin 
Islands. However, TAFB and SAB fixed on another cloud area farther 
north, while the radar data suggests another vorticity center in 
the deep convection to the northeast of the Virgin Islands.  The 
advisory position is a mean center between these features and is a 
little north of the new burst.  The satellite intensity estimates 
are unchanged from earlier, so the initial intensity remains 45 kt.

The storm has slowed its forward motion, which is now 285/7 kt.  
The track guidance is in good agreement that a break will form in 
the subtropical ridge as a mid- to upper-level trough develops to 
the northwest of Earl beginning later today.  This should cause the 
cyclone to turn northwestward during the next 12-24 h, with a 
northward motion likely from 24-72 h and a north-northeastward 
motion from 72-120 h.  The track models are in good agreement on 
the general direction of motion.  However, while the GFS is slower 
than its previous forecast it is still faster than the rest of the 
guidance.  The new forecast track is nudged to the right of the 
previous forecast based on the overall shift of the guidance 
envelope.  During the first 72 h, it is in best agreement with the 
GFS and UKMET ensemble means, and after that time it lies close to 
the various consensus models.

The ongoing shear is expected to continue through at least the next 
72 h, and thus only gradual strengthening is likely during this 
time as Earl moves over warm sea surface temperatures in a moist 
environment.  After that time, the cyclone could interact with the 
aforementioned trough in such a way to leave Earl in a more 
favorable environment for intensification, and the dynamical 
models forecast significant strengthening toward the end of the 
forecast period.  The new intensity forecast has only minor 
adjustments from the previous forecast, and for the first 72 h it is 
close to the bulk of the intensity guidance.  After it time, the 
forecast is below that of most of the guidance due to the 
uncertainty of how favorable the environment will be.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds are still forecast to remain on the
northern and eastern side of the circulation, and are not expected
to move across the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, or
Puerto Rico.  However, gusty winds in squalls are possible at these
locations through tonight.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Heavy rainfall from Earl is expected to lead to limited flash, 
urban, and small stream flooding impacts over the Leeward Islands, 
U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico today.  Rapid 
rises on rivers and mudslides in areas of steep terrain are possible 
in Puerto Rico.
 
2.  Earl is forecast to pass to the north of the the Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico today, and gusty winds, especially in squalls, 
area possible on those islands.

Hurricane Danielle Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
500 AM AST Sun Sep 04 2022
 
There has been little overall change in the satellite presentation 
of Danielle overnight. Curved convective bands wrap around the 
center, with a large ragged banded eye-like feature evident at 
times.  There is a large range in the satellite intensity estimates 
this morning with objective estimates much lower than the 
subjective Dvorak T-numbers from TAFB and SAB.  Although the SAB 
Dvorak estimate increased to T4.5 (77 kt) at 06Z, given the general 
steady state of the system's organization since the previous 
advisory, the initial intensity remains 65 kt, which is a blend of 
the various estimates and is in agreement with the latest TAFB 
Dvorak satellite classification. 

Danielle is forecast to remain over SSTs of around 27C and in a low 
shear environment during the next 24 to 36 hours.  As a result, 
most of the intensity guidance calls for some intensification 
during that time, and the NHC forecast follows suit.  After that 
time, gradually decreasing sea surface temperatures along the 
forecast track should cause slow weakening.  By days 4 and 5, 
increasing shear and the system's transition into a post-tropical 
cyclone are likely to cause additional weakening.  The NHC 
intensity forecast is a blend of the IVCN and HFIP corrected 
consensus models. 

The hurricane has been meandering overnight but a slow northward 
motion should begin this morning.  Danielle is forecast to 
gradually accelerate to the northeast beginning on Monday as 
deep-layer trough moves over eastern Canada.  By 72 hours, the 
storm should turn east-northeastward within the mid-latitude 
westerly flow.  The latest dynamical model guidance predicts a 
slightly faster motion over much of the forecast period, and the 
NHC forecast has been adjusted accordingly.  The new forecast is not 
as fast as the TCVA consensus model, therefore future modifications 
regarding the forward speed of the cyclone may be required.
