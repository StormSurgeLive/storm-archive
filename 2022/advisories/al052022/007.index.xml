Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Fri Sep 2 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
upgraded Hurricane Danielle, located about 900 miles west of the <br/>
Azores.<br/>
<br/>
East of the Leeward Islands:<br/>
An area of low pressure located a few hundred miles east of the <br/>
Leeward Islands continues to produce disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms, mainly over the eastern portion of the circulation. <br/>
Environmental conditions remain only marginally conducive, but any <br/>
additional development of the system over the next few days would <br/>
lead to the formation of a tropical depression. The disturbance is <br/>
expected to move slowly west-northwestward, toward the adjacent <br/>
waters of the northern Leeward Islands. Regardless of development, <br/>
locally heavy rains may occur over portions of the Leeward Islands <br/>
during the next couple of days, and interests in that area should <br/>
monitor the progress of the system. An Air Force Reserve Hurricane <br/>
Hunter aircraft is currently investigating the system. Additional <br/>
information on this system can be found in High Seas Forecasts <br/>
issued by the National Weather Service. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
Shower activity associated with a broad area of low pressure located <br/>
northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands has diminished. Significant <br/>
development is not expected as this system moves generally <br/>
west-northwestward into an area of unfavorable environmental <br/>
conditions.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
<br/>

Hurricane Danielle Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
300 PM GMT Fri Sep 02 2022
 
Danielle has continued to strengthen this morning. A ragged eye is 
evident in conventional satellite imagery, and deep convection 
surrounds much of the northern and western portions of the 
circulation. A recent ASCAT-B pass missed the center but caught the 
eastern portion of the circulation.  It showed winds up to 52 kt on 
the inner edge of the swath and tropical-storm-force winds extending 
outward up to 100 n mi in the northeastern quadrant of the cyclone. 
The latest objective and subjective satellite estimates support 
raising the initial intensity to 65 kt, which makes Danielle the 
first Atlantic hurricane of the season.

Atmospheric and oceanic conditions appear generally favorable for 
some additional strengthening during the next couple of days. The 
hurricane will meander over 27C SSTs in an environment of light to 
moderate deep-layer shear. Danielle is a higher-latitude storm, and 
so there is the potential for some mid-level dry air entrainment 
that could briefly disrupt the cyclone's organization. The latest 
intensity guidance consensus still favors some additional 
strengthening through Sunday. The official NHC forecast is similar 
to the previous one and lies slightly above the model consensus. 
After 72 h, weakening is expected to commence as Danielle gains 
latitude and moves over cooler waters while it encounters more 
deep-layer shear within the mid-latitude westerlies.

Although the 12-hr motion of Danielle has been an easterly drift, 
the hurricane appears to have become nearly stationary this 
morning. The cyclone will likely continue to meander over the 
central Atlantic during the next couple of days under the influence 
of a blocking high pressure ridge. This feature is forecast to 
weaken by early next week, which should allow Danielle to begin 
moving northeastward by 72 h and accelerate deeper into the 
mid-latitudes on days 4-5. Once again, it appears Danielle will not 
begin extratropical transition until beyond the end of the forecast 
period. The NHC track forecast generally lies near the center of 
the guidance envelope, close to the reliable consensus aids.
