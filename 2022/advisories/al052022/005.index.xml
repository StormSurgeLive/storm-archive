Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Fri Sep 2 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Danielle, located about 925 miles west of the Azores.<br/>
<br/>
East of the Leeward Islands:<br/>
Satellite imagery indicates there has been little change in the <br/>
organization of the area of low pressure located several hundred <br/>
miles east of the Leeward Islands during the past several hours. <br/>
Although environmental conditions remain only marginally conducive, <br/>
any additional development of the system over the next few days <br/>
would lead to the formation of a tropical depression.  The <br/>
disturbance is expected to move slowly west-northwestward, toward <br/>
the adjacent waters of the northern Leeward Islands.  Regardless of <br/>
development, locally heavy rains may occur over portions of the <br/>
Leeward Islands during the next couple of days, and interests in <br/>
that area should monitor the progress of the system. An Air Force <br/>
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate the <br/>
system this afternoon, if necessary. Additional information on this <br/>
system can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National <br/>
Weather Service. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
Shower activity associated with a broad area of low pressure <br/>
located just northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands has increased <br/>
some over the last several hours, but remains poorly organized. <br/>
This system is moving into an area of less favorable environmental <br/>
conditions, and significant development is not anticipated. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Danielle Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
900 AM GMT Fri Sep 02 2022

Satellite imagery shows that Danielle is continuing to strengthen, 
with convective bands wrapping around the center and attempts at 
eye formation.  The various satellite intensity estimates have a 
wide range from 45-77 kt, and the consensus of the estimates is 
that Danielle is not quite a hurricane yet.  Based on these 
estimates, the initial intensity is increased to a possibly 
conservative 60 kt.

Danielle continues to move slowly eastward, with the initial motion 
100/3 kt.  The cyclone is situated within an area of light steering
flow on the south side of an omega block mid-level anticyclone, and 
this pattern is expected to cause Danielle to meander during the 
next couple of days.  After that, the blocking anticyclone should 
move eastward and weaken, allowing the southern edge of the 
mid-latitude westerlies to become the primary steering mechanism.  
The large-scale models differ in the details of the shortwave 
troughs in the westerlies that could affect Danielle, and due to 
this the track guidance becomes somewhat divergent, with the ECMWF 
calling for a more northward motion than the other guidance.  The 
new forecast track is similar to the previous forecast through 72 
h, then is shifted a little to the north of the previous forecast.

The cyclone should remain over 26-27C sea surface temperatures for 
about 72 h in an environment of light- to moderate westerly shear.  
This should allow continued strengthening, with the main negative 
factor being that the mid-level relative humidities near the 
storm are low.  After 72 h, movement over cooler water and 
increased shear should cause weakening.   However, the large-scale 
models are in good agreement that the cyclone will not undergo 
extratropical transition before the end of the forecast period.  
The new intensity forecast is an update of the previous forecast 
and lies near the intensity consensus.
