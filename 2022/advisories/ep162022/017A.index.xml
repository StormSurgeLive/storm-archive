<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Orlene, which is approaching Las Islas Marias near southwestern <br/>
Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South-Southwest of the Baja California Peninsula:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to show signs of organization <br/>
associated with an area of low pressure located several hundred <br/>
miles south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California <br/>
peninsula. Environmental conditions appear conducive for additional <br/>
development, and a tropical depression is likely to form during the <br/>
next day or two as the system moves slowly northward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of southern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec is producing a disorganized area <br/>
of showers and thunderstorms. Environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to be somewhat conducive for gradual development during <br/>
the next several days.  The low is forecast to move generally <br/>
west-northwestward during the next couple of days, but could turn <br/>
northwestward after midweek. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM MDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Orlene was located
near latitude 20.9 North, longitude 106.8 West. Orlene is moving
toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A turn toward the
north-northeast is expected later tonight.  On the forecast
track, the center of Orlene will pass near or over Las Islas Marias 
tonight, and reach the coast of mainland Mexico within the warning
area on Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Orlene is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Weakening is expected during the next day or
so, however Orlene is forecast to be a strong hurricane when it
passes near or over the Islas Marias, and remain a hurricane when it
reaches southwestern Mexico.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90
miles (150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 972 mb (28.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in Las Islas Marias tonight, 
with tropical storm conditions ongoing.  Hurricane conditions are 
expected in the warning area along the coast of mainland Mexico on 
Monday, with tropical storm conditions beginning late tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread northward in the 
tropical storm warning area through early Monday.  Hurricane 
conditions are possible along the coast of mainland Mexico within 
the hurricane watch area tonight into early Monday.  Tropical storm 
conditions are possible within the tropical storm watch area 
tonight.
 
RAINFALL: Orlene is expected to produce the following rainfall
across portions of southwestern Mexico through Tuesday:
 
* Islas Marias: 6 to 10 inches, with local amounts of 14 inches.
* Nayarit and southern Sinaloa: 3 to 6 inches with local amounts of
10 inches.
* Jalisco, Colima, and southwest Durango: 1 to 3 inches with local
amounts of 5 inches.
 
These rainfall amounts are likely to lead to flash flooding, as
well as possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is likely to cause coastal
flooding in the Islas Marias and along the coast of mainland Mexico
in the warning area in regions of onshore winds.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Orlene are affecting the west coast 
of Mexico and will spread northward to the southern portion of the 
Baja California peninsula and the Gulf of California over the next 
day or so. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf 
and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local 
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 900 PM MDT.

<title>Hurricane Orlene Forecast Discussion Number 17</title>

Hurricane Orlene Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162022
300 PM MDT Sun Oct 02 2022
 
Although the satellite presentation of Orlene is not as impressive 
as it was overnight, the center is still embedded within an area of 
cloud top temperatures of -70 to -80 degrees Celsius.  The eye is 
also not as defined in conventional satellite imagery as earlier 
today, but an Air Force Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft that 
made two passes through the center earlier this afternoon reported 
a closed 22 n-mi-wide eye on its final pass. The aircraft measured 
a peak 700-mb flight-level wind of 96 kt, and SFMR winds of 92 kt.  
Since the plane only made a couple passes through the eastern 
eyewall, the intensity is set at 100 kt, owing to some 
undersampling.
 
It has been difficult to determine if today's weakening was caused 
by an eyewall replacement cycle, the increase in southwesterly 
shear, or a combination of both.  Regardless, southwesterly 
vertical wind shear is forecast to increase during the next 12 to 
24 hours, which is expected to cause an additional reduction in 
wind speed, plus the entrainment of some drier mid-level air to the 
west of Orlene.  Orlene still is forecast to pass near or over the 
Islas Marias as a strong hurricane tonight, and reach the coast of 
mainland Mexico as a hurricane by on Monday. After landfall, rapid 
weakening is expected, and the low-level center should dissipate 
over the mountainous terrain of southwestern Mexico in 48-60 hours.
 
Satellite imagery and fixes from the aircraft show that Orlene is
still moving northward or 005/7 kt. The track forecast philosophy 
is unchanged from before.  Orlene should bend north-northeastward 
tonight as it is steered between a mid-level ridge to its east and 
a broad trough over northwestern Mexico.   The track guidance is in 
much better agreement this cycle, and the NHC forecast was only 
nudged slightly westward to be closer to the various consensus 
aids.

The updated track and wind radii forecast has necessitated the 
issuance of a Tropical Storm Warning along the coast of mainland 
Mexico to the northwest of the Hurricane Warning area.  No other 
changes were made to the existing wind warnings. 
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane conditions are expected in the Islas Marias tonight,
with tropical storm conditions beginning within the next few hours. 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for a portion of west-central 
mainland Mexico, where hurricane conditions are expected on Monday 
with tropical storm conditions beginning late tonight. Preparations 
to protect life and property should be rushed to completion.
 
2. A dangerous storm surge is likely to cause coastal flooding in 
the Islas Marias and along the coast of mainland Mexico in the 
warning area in regions of onshore winds.
 
3. Heavy rainfall from Orlene is expected to lead to flash flooding, 
as well as possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain of 
southwest Mexico through Tuesday.
