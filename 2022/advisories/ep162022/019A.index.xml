Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 AM PDT Mon Oct 3 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Orlene, which is located near the southwest coast of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South-Southwest of the Baja California Peninsula:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure <br/>
located several hundred miles south-southwest of the southern tip of <br/>
the Baja California peninsula have become more concentrated <br/>
overnight.  However, the thunderstorms are currently displaced to <br/>
the southwest of the low-level center.  Only a slight increase in <br/>
organization would result in the formation of a tropical depression <br/>
later today or tonight while the system moves slowly <br/>
northward-northwestward or northward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of southern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
south-southwest of the Gulf of Tehuantepec is producing disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions are forecast to <br/>
be somewhat conducive for gradual development during the next <br/>
several days.  The low is forecast to move generally <br/>
west-northwestward during the next couple of days, but could turn <br/>
northwestward toward the end of the week. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM MDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Orlene was located
near latitude 22.6 North, longitude 106.1 West. Orlene is moving
toward the north near 9 mph (15 km/h), and a general northward to
north-northeastward motion is expected to continue over the next day
or so.  On the forecast track, the center of Orlene will reach the 
coast of mainland Mexico within the warning area this morning. 

Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Little change in strength is expected before Orlene reaches
the coast.  Rapid weakening is forecast after Orlene moves
onshore, and the system should dissipate tonight or Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90
miles (150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 976 mb (28.82 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are expected in the 
warning areas along the coast of mainland Mexico today.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible along the coast of mainland 
Mexico within the hurricane watch area this morning.
 
RAINFALL: Orlene is expected to produce the following rainfall
across portions of southwestern Mexico through Tuesday:
 
* Islas Marias: 6 to 10 inches, with local amounts of 14 inches.
* Nayarit and southern Sinaloa: 3 to 6 inches with local amounts of
10 inches.
* Jalisco, Colima, and southwest Durango: 1 to 3 inches with local
amounts of 5 inches.
 
These rainfall amounts are likely to lead to flash flooding, as
well as possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is likely to cause coastal
flooding in the Islas Marias and along the coast of mainland Mexico
in the warning area in regions of onshore winds.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Orlene will affect the 
southwestern coast of Mexico, southern portions of the Baja 
California peninsula and the Gulf of California over the next day 
or so. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.

Hurricane Orlene Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162022
300 AM MDT Mon Oct 03 2022
 
Orlene's cloud pattern has been becoming less organized, likely due 
to the influence of strong southwesterly shear associated with a 
broad upper-level trough near Baja California. Inner-core 
convection has been gradually diminishing, but there are still some 
strong convective bands around the center.  Upper-level outflow is 
restricted over the western portion of the circulation as a 
result of the shear.  The current intensity estimate is set to 85 
kt based on a blend of subjective and objective Dvorak T-numbers, 
but is more uncertain than usual.

Although the unfavorable shear should continue to affect the 
cyclone, Orlene will moving over very warm waters today which 
should help the system maintain some of its intensity up to 
landfall.  The Decay-SHIPS model guidance indicates that Orlene 
will still be a hurricane when it makes landfall later today, and 
the official forecast shows this as well.  After Orlene makes 
landfall, the small cyclone is likely to quickly weaken over the 
mountainous terrain of Mexico, and it should dissipate within 1-2 
days.   

Orlene continues to move just east of due north with an estimated 
initial motion of 010/8 kt.  There is basically no change to the 
track forecast reasoning.  The system should continue to be steered 
by the flow on the western side of a mid-level ridge until it makes 
landfall on the coast of Mexico within the Hurricane Warning area 
in less than a day.  The official track forecast is similar to the 
previous NHC prediction and is roughly in the middle of the fairly 
tightly clustered dynamical track guidance envelope. 

Key Messages:
 
1. A Hurricane Warning is in effect for a portion of west-central 
mainland Mexico, where hurricane conditions are expected later 
today with tropical storm conditions beginning this morning. 
Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to 
completion.
 
2. A dangerous storm surge is likely to cause flooding along 
the coast of mainland Mexico in the warning area in regions of 
onshore winds.
 
3. Heavy rainfall from Orlene is expected to lead to flash flooding,
as well as possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain of
southwest Mexico through Tuesday.
