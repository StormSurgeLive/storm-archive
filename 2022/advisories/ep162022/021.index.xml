Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 AM PDT Mon Oct 3 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Orlene, which is located inland over southwestern Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South-Southwest of the Baja California Peninsula:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue in association with an area of <br/>
low pressure located several hundred miles south-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.  Although the <br/>
thunderstorm activity is currently displaced to the southwest the <br/>
low-level center, only a slight increase in organization would <br/>
result in the formation of a tropical depression later today or <br/>
tonight.  The system is forecast to move slowly northward or <br/>
northward-northwestward during the next couple of days. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of southern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
south-southwest of the Gulf of Tehuantepec continues to produce <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Any development of this <br/>
system over the next several days is likely to be slow to occur due <br/>
to strong upper-level winds.  The low is forecast to move generally <br/>
west-northwestward during the next couple of days, but could turn <br/>
northwestward toward the end of the week. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Orlene Advisory Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162022
400 PM CDT Mon Oct 03 2022
 
...HEAVY RAINFALL CONTINUES SPREADING INLAND OVER PORTIONS OF
WEST-CENTRAL MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 400 PM CDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...23.6N 105.4W
ABOUT 70 MI...110 KM ENE OF MAZATLAN MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 25 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1006 MB...29.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warning for the southwest coast of Mexico.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Orlene
was located near latitude 23.6 North, longitude 105.4 West. The
depression is moving toward the north-northeast near 9 mph (15 km/h)
and this motion is expected to continue through this evening. On 
the forecast track, the center of Orlene will move farther inland 
over west-central Mexico this evening.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast, and Orlene is 
forecast to dissipate later tonight.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Orlene is expected to produce the following rainfall
across portions of Southwest Mexico through Tuesday:
 
Northern Nayarit and southern Sinaloa: 3 to 6 inches with local
amounts of 10 inches.
 
Southwest Durango: 1 to 3 inches with local amounts of 5 inches.
 
These rainfall amounts should lead to flash flooding, as well as
possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Orlene will affect the
southwestern coast of Mexico, southern portions of the Baja
California peninsula and the Gulf of California through tonight.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.

Tropical Depression Orlene Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162022
400 PM CDT Mon Oct 03 2022
 
Strong west-southwesterly shear and the mountainous terrain of 
southwestern Mexico have taken a toll on Orlene.  The tropical 
cyclone has rapidly weakened, and is now estimated to be a 30-kt 
tropical depression.  A long-loop of one-minute GOES-17 visible 
satellite imagery suggests that the center likely came ashore 
slightly west of the earlier track, but close to the estimated time. 
Additional weakening is expected, and the low-level center is 
likely to dissipate this evening.  A 12-h point is provided for 
continuity but Orlene is not likely to exist as a cyclone by that 
time. 

Orlene is moving north-northeastward or 025/9 kt. The cyclone or 
its remnants should continue to move north-northeastward around the 
northwestern periphery of a mid-level ridge until dissipation 
occurs. 
 
Key Messages:

1. Heavy rainfall from Orlene is expected to lead to flash flooding, 
as well as possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain of 
Southwest Mexico through Tuesday.
