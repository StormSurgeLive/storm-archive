Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 AM PDT Mon Oct 3 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Orlene, which is located near the southwest coast of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South-Southwest of the Baja California Peninsula:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure <br/>
located several hundred miles south-southwest of the southern tip of <br/>
the Baja California peninsula have become more concentrated <br/>
overnight.  However, the thunderstorms are currently displaced to <br/>
the southwest of the low-level center.  Only a slight increase in <br/>
organization would result in the formation of a tropical depression <br/>
later today or tonight while the system moves slowly <br/>
northward-northwestward or northward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of southern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
south-southwest of the Gulf of Tehuantepec is producing disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions are forecast to <br/>
be somewhat conducive for gradual development during the next <br/>
several days.  The low is forecast to move generally <br/>
west-northwestward during the next couple of days, but could turn <br/>
northwestward toward the end of the week. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Orlene was 
located near latitude 23.3 North, longitude 105.5 West. Orlene is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this 
general motion should continue over the next day or so.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Orlene will move farther inland over
west-central Mexico today and tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Rapid weakening is expected through tonight, 
and Orlene is forecast to dissipate tonight or early Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the 
warning area through this afternoon.
 
RAINFALL: Orlene is expected to produce the following rainfall
across portions of Southwest Mexico through Tuesday:
 
Northern Nayarit and southern Sinaloa: 3 to 6 inches with local
amounts of 10 inches.
 
Southwest Durango: 1 to 3 inches with local amounts of 5 inches.
 
These rainfall amounts should lead to flash flooding, as well as
possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Orlene will affect the
southwestern coast of Mexico, southern portions of the Baja
California peninsula and the Gulf of California through tonight. 
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Hurricane Orlene Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162022
1000 AM CDT Mon Oct 03 2022
 
Radar data from Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, showed that the eyewall of 
Orlene moved onshore earlier this morning, but it appears that there 
was some east-northeast to west-southwest tilt between the 
mid-level center seen in the radar imagery and the surface center 
due to moderate to strong west-southwesterly shear.  It is estimated 
that Orlene made landfall around 1345 UTC just north of the border 
of the Mexican states of Nayarit and Sinaloa.  The maximum winds 
and minimum pressure at landfall were estimated at 75 kt and 980 
mb, respectively.  With the center moving farther inland, the 
intensity has been reduced to 65 kt.  Rapid weakening is expected to 
occur today as Orlene interacts with the mountainous terrain of 
southwestern Mexico and moves into an area of even stronger 
west-southwesterly shear.  The cyclone is expected to become a 
tropical depression by this evening, and dissipate tonight or early 
Tuesday. 

Orlene is moving north-northeastward or 020/9 kt. There is again 
no change to the track forecast philosophy.  The cyclone should 
continue to move north-northeastward around the northwestern side 
of a mid-level ridge until dissipation occurs.  The latest NHC 
track forecast has been shifted east of the previous advisory due 
to a more eastward initial position. 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. A Hurricane Warning is in effect for a portion of west-central
mainland Mexico, where hurricane and tropical storm conditions are 
expected to continue through this afternoon. 

2. A dangerous storm surge is likely to cause flooding along
the coast of mainland Mexico in the warning area in regions of
onshore winds.
 
3. Heavy rainfall from Orlene is expected to lead to flash flooding, 
as well as possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain of 
Southwest Mexico through Tuesday.
