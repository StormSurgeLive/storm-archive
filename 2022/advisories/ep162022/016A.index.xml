<br/>
South-Southwest of the Baja California Peninsula:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a broad area of low <br/>
pressure located several hundred miles south-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula continue to show <br/>
signs of organization. Additional development of this system is <br/>
possible, and a tropical depression could form during the next <br/>
couple of days as it moves slowly northeastward or northward. <br/>
Conditions are forecast to become less conducive for development <br/>
late this week.<br/>

South of southern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure has developed several hundred miles <br/>
south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to be somewhat conducive for gradual development during <br/>
the next several days.  The low is forecast to move generally <br/>
west-northwest during the next couple of days, but could turn <br/>
northwestward after midweek. <br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 PM MDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Orlene was
located near latitude 19.9 North, longitude 106.9 West. Orlene is
moving toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A turn toward the
north-northeast is expected later today.  On the forecast track, the
center of Orlene should pass near or over Las Islas Marias tonight
or Monday morning, and reach the coast of mainland Mexico within the
warning area later on Monday or Monday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Orlene is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Weakening is expected during the next day or
so, however Orlene is forecast to be a strong hurricane when it
passes near or over the Islas Marias, and remain a hurricane when it
reaches southwestern Mexico.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70
miles (110 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force 
Reserve reconnaissance aircraft data is 972 mb (28.70 inches).
 
  
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in Las Islas Marias tonight,
with tropical storm conditions beginning later today. Hurricane 
conditions are expected in the warning area along the coast of 
mainland Mexico late Monday, with tropical storm conditions 
beginning early Monday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread northward in the
tropical storm warning area today through early Monday.  Hurricane
conditions are possible along the coast of mainland Mexico within
the hurricane watch area by tonight or early Monday.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible within the tropical storm watch area today.
 
RAINFALL: Orlene is expected to produce the following rainfall
across portions of Southwest Mexico through Tuesday:
 
* Islas Marias: 6 to 10 inches, with local amounts of 14 inches.
* Nayarit and Sinaloa: 3 to 6 inches with local amounts of 10
inches.
* Jalisco and Colima: 1 to 3 inches with local amounts of 5 inches.
 
These rainfall amounts will likely lead to flash flooding, as well
as possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is likely to cause coastal
flooding along the coast of mainland Mexico in the warning area in
regions of onshore winds.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Orlene are affecting the west coast
of Mexico and will spread northward to the southern portion of the
Baja California peninsula and the Gulf of California over the next
couple of days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM MDT.

<title>Hurricane Orlene Forecast Discussion Number 16</title>

Hurricane Orlene Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162022
900 AM MDT Sun Oct 02 2022
 
The satellite presentation of Orlene has degraded since early this 
morning.  It appears that an increase in southwestern shear may 
have begun, as the eye has become cloud filled. Subjective satellite 
classifications from TAFB and SAB were T5.5 (102 kt), and objective 
estimates range from 112 to 120 kt.  Based on the degraded 
satellite presentation, the initial intensity has been reduced to 
110 kt.  An Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft is currently 
en route to investigate the hurricane, and should provide 
additional information on the strength and size of the wind field 
early this afternoon.
 
Orlene has likely peaked in intensity.  Although the sea surface
temperatures remain warm along the forecast track, increasing
southwesterly vertical wind shear during the next 24 to 36 hours
is likely to cause the small hurricane to weaken.  However, Orlene 
is forecast to pass near or over the Islas Marias as a strong 
hurricane late tonight or early Monday, and reach the coast of 
mainland Mexico has a hurricane by late Monday or Monday night. 
After landfall, rapid weakening is expected and the low-level 
center should dissipate over the mountainous terrain of 
southwestern Mexico in 60-72 hours.
 
Orlene has continued to move just east of due north or 005/7 kt.
The hurricane is being steered between a mid-level ridge to its
east and a broad trough over northwestern Mexico.  These steering
currents should cause Orlene to bend north-northeastward later
today and it should then continue on that general heading until
landfall in southwestern Mexico.  The latest NHC track forecast is
slightly west of the previous advisory, and lies close to a blend of
the GFS and ECMWF models (GFEX).  This is a little to the right of 
the other simple and corrected consensus models.  The GFS remains 
significantly farther right and faster than the remainder of the 
guidance. 
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane conditions are expected in the Islas Marias tonight,
with tropical storm conditions beginning today. A Hurricane
Warning is in effect for a portion of west-central mainland Mexico,
where hurricane conditions are expected on Monday with tropical
storm conditions beginning early Monday.  Preparations to protect
life and property should be rushed to completion.
 
2. Heavy rainfall from Orlene is expected to lead to flash flooding,
as well as possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain of
southwestern Mexico into Tuesday.
