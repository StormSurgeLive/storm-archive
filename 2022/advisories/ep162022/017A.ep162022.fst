DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM MDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Orlene was located
near latitude 20.9 North, longitude 106.8 West. Orlene is moving
toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A turn toward the
north-northeast is expected later tonight.  On the forecast
track, the center of Orlene will pass near or over Las Islas Marias 
tonight, and reach the coast of mainland Mexico within the warning
area on Monday.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Orlene is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Weakening is expected during the next day or
so, however Orlene is forecast to be a strong hurricane when it
passes near or over the Islas Marias, and remain a hurricane when it
reaches southwestern Mexico.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90
miles (150 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 972 mb (28.71 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in Las Islas Marias tonight, 
with tropical storm conditions ongoing.  Hurricane conditions are 
expected in the warning area along the coast of mainland Mexico on 
Monday, with tropical storm conditions beginning late tonight.

Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread northward in the 
tropical storm warning area through early Monday.  Hurricane 
conditions are possible along the coast of mainland Mexico within 
the hurricane watch area tonight into early Monday.  Tropical storm 
conditions are possible within the tropical storm watch area 
tonight.

RAINFALL: Orlene is expected to produce the following rainfall
across portions of southwestern Mexico through Tuesday:

* Islas Marias: 6 to 10 inches, with local amounts of 14 inches.
* Nayarit and southern Sinaloa: 3 to 6 inches with local amounts of
10 inches.
* Jalisco, Colima, and southwest Durango: 1 to 3 inches with local
amounts of 5 inches.

These rainfall amounts are likely to lead to flash flooding, as
well as possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain.

STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is likely to cause coastal
flooding in the Islas Marias and along the coast of mainland Mexico
in the warning area in regions of onshore winds.

SURF:  Large swells generated by Orlene are affecting the west coast 
of Mexico and will spread northward to the southern portion of the 
Baja California peninsula and the Gulf of California over the next 
day or so. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf 
and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local 
weather office.
