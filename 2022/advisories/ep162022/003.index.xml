BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Orlene Advisory Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162022
1000 AM CDT Thu Sep 29 2022
 
...ORLENE STRENGTHENS AS IT MOVES WEST-NORTHWESTWARD WHILE 
SOUTHWEST OF THE COAST OF MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1000 AM CDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.1N 105.9W
ABOUT 290 MI...465 KM SSW OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1005 MB...29.68 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests along the coast of western Mexico should monitor the
progress of Orlene.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Orlene was
located near latitude 15.1 North, longitude 105.9 West. Orlene is
moving toward the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h) and this
motion is expected to continue over the next day or so. A turn to
the north is forecast to occur on Friday, and that motion should
continue over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near near 45 mph (75 
km/h) with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast, and 
Orlene is expected to become a hurricane by Friday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Large swells generated by Orlene will affect the coast of
southwestern Mexico, and the extreme southern portion of the Baja
California peninsula by this weekend. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Orlene Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162022
1000 AM CDT Thu Sep 29 2022
 
Satellite imagery this morning shows that Orlene is getting better
organized, with the formation of a small central dense overcast
with an outer convective band in the northwestern semicircle.
Satellite intensity estimates are 35-40 kt, so the initial
intensity is increased to 40 kt.
 
The initial motion is west-northwestward or 295/9 kt.  Orlene is 
being steered by a mid-level ridge over Mexico, and this general 
motion should continue for the next day or so.  After that time, the 
cyclone reaches the western end of the ridge.  The UKMET and ECMWF, 
which forecast less development, take the storm more westward south 
of Baja California, while the GFS and the Canadian, which forecast a 
stronger and more vertically deep storm, forecast Orlene to turn 
northward into the southern Gulf of California toward northwestern 
Mexico.  Give the current trends and the forecast intensities, the 
track forecast leans towards the GFS/Canadian solution and shows 
Orlene turning northward and moving into northwestern Mexico between 
days 4-5.  The new forecast track is similar to the previous 
forecast.

Orlene is forecast to be within an environment of low vertical wind
shear and plenty of atmospheric moisture while over warm waters for
the 72 h or so. The majority of guidance, except the aforementioned 
ECMWF and UKMET, indicate steady strengthening during this time, 
and bring Orlene to hurricane intensity by 36 h.  The intensities 
during the first 72 h have been increased to better match the trend 
of the intensity guidance.  After 72 h, Orlene is likely to 
encounter increasing shear and a drier air mass, which should  
cause weakening.  However, the GFS, HWRF, and HMON models suggest 
the possibility that the cyclone will still be at hurricane 
strength when it reaches the coast of Mexico, and the new intensity 
forecast follows that scenario.
