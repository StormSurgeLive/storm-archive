* Las Islas Marias
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* The coast of mainland Mexico from Playa Perula to San Blas
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* The coast of mainland Mexico from San Blas to Bahia Tempehuaya
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* The coast of mainland Mexico from Manzanillo to Playa Perula
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, generally within 36
hours.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the coast of western and northwestern
Mexico should monitor the progress of Orlene. Additional watches or
warnings will likely be required for portions of these areas later
today or tonight.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM MDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Orlene was located
near latitude 17.9 North, longitude 107.1 West. Orlene is moving
toward the north near 5 mph (7 km/h). A north-northeastward motion
at a slightly faster speed is expected to begin by tonight and
continue through early next week. On the forecast track, the
center of Orlene should pass near or over Las Islas Marias Sunday
night or Monday morning and reach the coast of mainland Mexico later
on Monday or Monday night.
 
Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft
indicate that maximum sustained winds have increased to near 80 mph
(130 km/h) with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast
through Sunday afternoon.  Steady to rapid weakening is expected
starting Sunday night and continuing until landfall.
 
Aircraft and satellite wind data indicate that Orlene remains a
small tropical cyclone. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to
10 miles (20 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds
extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km).
 
The minimum central pressure reported by the Hurricane Hunter
aircraft is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in Las Islas Marias Sunday 
night, with tropical storm conditions beginning late Sunday. 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning 
area by early Sunday. Hurricane conditions are possible along the 
coast of mainland Mexico within the hurricane watch area by Sunday 
night into Monday. Tropical storm conditions are possible along the 
coast of mainland Mexico within the tropical storm watch area 
tonight and Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: Into Monday evening, Orlene is expected to produce 3 to 5
inches of rainfall, with local amounts of 10 inches, for portions of
southwest Mexico.  These rainfall amounts should lead to flash
flooding, as well as possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain.
 
STORM SURGE: Coastal flooding is likely along the coast of Mexico
in the warning area in regions of onshore winds.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Orlene will affect the coast of
southwestern Mexico, and the extreme southern portion of the Baja
California peninsula through this weekend. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 600 PM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 900 PM MDT.

<title>Hurricane Orlene Forecast Discussion Number 12</title>

Hurricane Orlene Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162022
300 PM MDT Sat Oct 01 2022

Orlene has strengthened some since the last advisory.  An Air Force 
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported 700-mb flight-level 
winds of 80 kt in the the northeastern eyewall, and reliable- 
looking surface wind estimates of 69-72 kt from the SFMR. The 
central pressure inside the 16-n mi wide eye was 979 mb.  Based on 
these data, the initial intensity is increased to a possibly 
conservative 70 kt.  Data from the aircraft and a recent 
scatterometer overpass show that Orlene remains a small tropical 
cyclone.
 
Orlene should remain in a generally moist and light-shear 
environment for about the next 18-24 h, and continued steady 
intensification is expected during that time.  The new intensity 
forecast now calls for a peak intensity of 85 kt in about 24 h, a 
slightly higher intensity than the previous forecast.  After that, 
strong southwesterly shear should cause steady to rapid weakening 
until landfall in Mexico.  This should be followed by dissipation 
over the mountains of northwestern Mexico between 72-96 h.  As 
mentioned previously, while it cannot be ruled out that Orlene 
could reach mainland Mexico as a hurricane, the chances of that 
are decreasing based on the guidance and the forecast shear.  The 
new intensity forecast again lies near or at the upper edge of the 
intensity guidance.
 
Orlene is generally moving slowly northward, 360/4 kt, to the 
west of a mid-level ridge. After about 12 h, the cyclone should turn
north-northeastward in the flow between this ridge and an upper- 
level trough seen in water vapor imagery over northwestern Mexico 
and the northern Baja California peninsula.  This motion is forecast 
to continue until Orlene dissipates over mainland Mexico.  The 
track guidance is fairly tightly clustered together, although the 
GFS remains a bit to the right of the other models after 24 h.  The 
guidance envelope has shifted a little westward since the previous 
advisory, and based on this the new forecast track is again nudged a 
little to the west.  However, the new track lies a little east of 
the various consensus models, between them and the GFS.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane conditions are expected in the Islas Marias Sunday
night, with tropical storm conditions beginning late Sunday.
Hurricane conditions are possible over portions of west-central
mainland Mexico starting on Monday.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected within the tropical storm warning area along the
west-central coast of Mexico on Sunday. Tropical storm conditions
are possible over other portions of southwestern and west-central
Mexico in the tropical storm watch area tonight or Sunday.
 
2. Heavy rainfall from Orlene is expected to lead to flash flooding, 
as well as possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain of 
southwest Mexico into Monday evening.
