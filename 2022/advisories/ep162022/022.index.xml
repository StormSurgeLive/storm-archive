Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 PM PDT Mon Oct 3 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
downgraded Tropical Depression Orlene, located inland over <br/>
southwestern Mexico, and on recently formed Tropical Storm Paine, <br/>
located several hundred miles south-southwest of the southern tip of <br/>
the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
South of southern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
south-southwest of the Gulf of Tehuantepec is currently producing a <br/>
limited area of showers and thunderstorms.  Any development of this <br/>
system over the next couple of days is forecast to be slow to occur <br/>
due to strong upper-level winds and nearby dry air, but <br/>
environmental conditions could become more favorable by the end of <br/>
this week.  The low is forecast to move generally west-northwestward <br/>
during the next couple of days, but could turn northwestward toward <br/>
the end of the week. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
Public Advisories on Tropical Storm Paine are issued under WMO <br/>
header WTPZ32 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCPEP2. <br/>

Remnants Of Orlene Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162022
1000 PM CDT Mon Oct 03 2022

Visible satellite imagery indicates that Orlene has dissipated over 
the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico, with no trace of a low-level 
circulation.  Thus, this is the last advisory.  Moisture from 
Orlene could still lead to flash flooding and landslides through 
Tuesday in southwestern Mexico.  
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Lingering rainfall from Orlene could lead to flash flooding, as 
well as possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain of 
southwestern Mexico into Tuesday.

Tropical Storm Paine Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172022
300 PM MDT Mon Oct 03 2022

Satellite imagery indicates that the low pressure system located 
several hundred miles south-southwest of the southern tip of the 
Baja California peninsula has been producing convection for the 
better part of the last 18 to 24 hours, though it has been somewhat 
sheared off to the west of the low-level circulation.  CI numbers 
from TAFB and SAB are 2.0 and 1.5, respectively, and recently the 
convection has built slightly closer to the center.  An earlier 
AMSR2 microwave pass from 03/0913 UTC showed improved banding 
structure compared to yesterday.  A 03/1638 UTC ASCAT-B pass shows a 
well-defined closed circulation, with wind vectors that support 
maximum sustained winds near 35 kt.  On this basis, the disturbance 
is upgraded to Tropical Storm Paine.  The ASCAT data indicates that 
Paine is a small cyclone, with tropical storm force winds extending 
outward only about 30 n mi from the center.

Paine is located in an environment of moderate vertical wind shear 
and warm sea-surface temperatures. However, relatively dry mid-level 
air is present over this portion of the Pacific. The dry air should 
limit significant strengthening over the first 24 to 36 hours, 
while the wind shear remains moderate.  Beyond 36 hours, wind shear 
increases further and the mid-level air becomes even drier.  This 
should lead to weakening, and by 60 hours, Paine is likely to lose 
all of its deep convection and become a remnant low.

The initial motion is 345/5 kt. The cyclone should continue on a 
similar heading for the next couple of days.  A mid-level ridge 
located to the north of Paine after that time should induce a 
gradual turn to the west.  The cyclone will also lose its convection 
at around that time, with the shallow remnant low moving westward 
with the trade wind flow.
