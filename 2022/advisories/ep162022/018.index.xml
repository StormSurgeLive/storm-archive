<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Orlene, which is approaching Las Islas Marias near southwestern <br/>
Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South-Southwest of the Baja California Peninsula:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to show signs of organization <br/>
associated with an area of low pressure located several hundred <br/>
miles south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California <br/>
peninsula. Environmental conditions appear conducive for additional <br/>
development, and a tropical depression is likely to form during the <br/>
next day or two as the system moves slowly northward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of southern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec is producing a disorganized area <br/>
of showers and thunderstorms. Environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to be somewhat conducive for gradual development during <br/>
the next several days.  The low is forecast to move generally <br/>
west-northwestward during the next couple of days, but could turn <br/>
northwestward after midweek. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

within the watch area.
 
Interests elsewhere along the coast of western and northwestern
Mexico should monitor the progress of Orlene.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM MDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Orlene was located
near latitude 21.4 North, longitude 106.5 West. Orlene is moving
toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h), and a general northward to
north-northeastward motion is expected to continue over the next day
or so. On the forecast track, the center of Orlene will is forecast
to move over Las Islas Marias tonight, and reach the coast of
mainland Mexico within the warning area on Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 105 mph (165 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Weakening is expected during the next day or so, 
but Orlene is forecast to be remain a hurricane when it reaches 
southwestern Mexico.  Rapid weakening is forecast after Orlene 
moves onshore, and the system should dissipated on Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 976 mb (28.82 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in Las Islas Marias
overnight.  Hurricane conditions are expected in the warning area
along the coast of mainland Mexico on Monday, with tropical storm
conditions beginning overnight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread northward in the
tropical storm warning area through early Monday.  Hurricane
conditions are possible along the coast of mainland Mexico within
the hurricane watch area tonight into early Monday.  
 
RAINFALL: Orlene is expected to produce the following rainfall
across portions of southwestern Mexico through Tuesday:
 
* Islas Marias: 6 to 10 inches, with local amounts of 14 inches.
* Nayarit and southern Sinaloa: 3 to 6 inches with local amounts of
10 inches.
* Jalisco, Colima, and southwest Durango: 1 to 3 inches with local
amounts of 5 inches.
 
These rainfall amounts are likely to lead to flash flooding, as
well as possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is likely to cause coastal
flooding in the Islas Marias and along the coast of mainland Mexico
in the warning area in regions of onshore winds.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Orlene are affecting the west coast
of Mexico and will spread northward to the southern portion of the
Baja California peninsula and the Gulf of California over the next
day or so. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1200 AM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 300 AM MDT.

<title>Hurricane Orlene Forecast Discussion Number 17</title>

Hurricane Orlene Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162022
300 PM MDT Sun Oct 02 2022
 
Although the satellite presentation of Orlene is not as impressive 
as it was overnight, the center is still embedded within an area of 
cloud top temperatures of -70 to -80 degrees Celsius.  The eye is 
also not as defined in conventional satellite imagery as earlier 
today, but an Air Force Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft that 
made two passes through the center earlier this afternoon reported 
a closed 22 n-mi-wide eye on its final pass. The aircraft measured 
a peak 700-mb flight-level wind of 96 kt, and SFMR winds of 92 kt.  
Since the plane only made a couple passes through the eastern 
eyewall, the intensity is set at 100 kt, owing to some 
undersampling.
 
It has been difficult to determine if today's weakening was caused 
by an eyewall replacement cycle, the increase in southwesterly 
shear, or a combination of both.  Regardless, southwesterly 
vertical wind shear is forecast to increase during the next 12 to 
24 hours, which is expected to cause an additional reduction in 
wind speed, plus the entrainment of some drier mid-level air to the 
west of Orlene.  Orlene still is forecast to pass near or over the 
Islas Marias as a strong hurricane tonight, and reach the coast of 
mainland Mexico as a hurricane by on Monday. After landfall, rapid 
weakening is expected, and the low-level center should dissipate 
over the mountainous terrain of southwestern Mexico in 48-60 hours.
 
Satellite imagery and fixes from the aircraft show that Orlene is
still moving northward or 005/7 kt. The track forecast philosophy 
is unchanged from before.  Orlene should bend north-northeastward 
tonight as it is steered between a mid-level ridge to its east and 
a broad trough over northwestern Mexico.   The track guidance is in 
much better agreement this cycle, and the NHC forecast was only 
nudged slightly westward to be closer to the various consensus 
aids.

The updated track and wind radii forecast has necessitated the 
issuance of a Tropical Storm Warning along the coast of mainland 
Mexico to the northwest of the Hurricane Warning area.  No other 
changes were made to the existing wind warnings. 
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane conditions are expected in the Islas Marias tonight,
with tropical storm conditions beginning within the next few hours. 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for a portion of west-central 
mainland Mexico, where hurricane conditions are expected on Monday 
with tropical storm conditions beginning late tonight. Preparations 
to protect life and property should be rushed to completion.
 
2. A dangerous storm surge is likely to cause coastal flooding in 
the Islas Marias and along the coast of mainland Mexico in the 
warning area in regions of onshore winds.
 
3. Heavy rainfall from Orlene is expected to lead to flash flooding, 
as well as possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain of 
southwest Mexico through Tuesday.
