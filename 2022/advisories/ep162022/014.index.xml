WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has issued a Hurricane Warning for the
coast of mainland Mexico from San Blas northward to Mazatlan, and
issued a Hurricane Watch south of San Blas to Playa Perula.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Las Islas Marias
* The coast of mainland Mexico from San Blas to Mazatlan
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* The coast of mainland Mexico from Playa Perula to San Blas
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* The coast of mainland Mexico from Playa Perula to San Blas

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* The coast of mainland Mexico from Manzanillo to Playa Perula
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, generally within 36
hours.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the coast of western and northwestern
Mexico should monitor the progress of Orlene. Additional watches or
warnings could be required for portions of these areas later
tonight or on Sunday.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM MDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Orlene was located
near latitude 18.4 North, longitude 106.9 West. Orlene is moving
toward the north near 5 mph (7 km/h). A turn toward the
north-northeast with a slight increase in forward speed is expected
on Sunday and Monday. On the forecast track, the center of Orlene
should pass near or over Las Islas Marias Sunday night or Monday
morning and reach the coast of mainland Mexico within the warning
area later on Monday or Monday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 110 mph (175 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is forecast
through early Sunday, followed by weakening beginning later on
Sunday and continuing until landfall.
 
Orlene is a small tropical cyclone. Hurricane-force winds extend
outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the center and
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 966 mb (28.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in Las Islas Marias Sunday
night, with tropical storm conditions beginning late Sunday.
Hurricane conditions are expected in the warning area along the
coast of mainland Mexico late Monday, with tropical storm conditions
beginning early Monday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area by early Sunday. Hurricane conditions are possible along the
coast of mainland Mexico within the hurricane watch area by Sunday
night or early Monday. Tropical storm conditions are possible within
the tropical storm watch area on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: Into Tuesday, Orlene is expected to produce 3 to 5 inches
of rainfall, with local amounts of 10 inches, across portions of
southwestern Mexico. These rainfall amounts should lead to flash
flooding, as well as possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is likely to cause coastal
flooding along the coast of mainland Mexico in the warning area in
regions of onshore winds.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Orlene are affecting the west coast
of Mexico and will spread northward to the southern portion of the
Baja California peninsula and the Gulf of California through this
weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next intermediate advisory at 1200 AM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 300 AM MDT.

<title>Hurricane Orlene Forecast Discussion Number 14</title>

Hurricane Orlene Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162022
900 PM MDT Sat Oct 01 2022
 
Orlene is a rapidly strengthening hurricane. The intensity of the
cyclone has increased by 35 kt in the past 18 h, and the satellite
presentation of Orlene has continued to improve this evening. A warm
and well-defined eye with a diameter of 10-15 n mi is evident in
GOES-17 satellite imagery, and the eyewall is comprised of a solid
ring of deep convection with cloud top temperatures colder than -70
degrees Celsius. The subjective current intensity estimates have
rapidly increased this evening, and SAB and TAFB provided consensus
T5.0/90 kt Dvorak estimates at 00 UTC. Objective satellite estimates
have continued to rise since then, and the initial intensity is set
at 95 kt for this advisory.
 
The environmental conditions appear conducive for additional
strengthening during the next 12 h or so, while the hurricane moves
within a low deep-layer shear environment and over very warm SSTs.
The latest NHC intensity forecast shows Orlene peaking as a major
hurricane on Sunday. Then, the southwesterly shear is expected
to increase over Orlene, and the small hurricane should be 
especially susceptible to the negative effects of the increasing 
shear.  Therefore, the forecast shows steady weakening beginning 
Sunday night and continuing through landfall. It appears that Orlene
will be at or near hurricane strength when it reaches the coast of
mainland Mexico by late Monday, but it should quickly weaken
after landfall as it moves over the mountainous terrain.
 
The hurricane is moving just east of due north (005 degrees) at 4
kt. The track forecast reasoning is unchanged, as an upper-level
trough over northwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula is
expected to cause Orlene to move north-northeastward during the next
couple of days as it approaches the coast of mainland Mexico. The
GFS remains on the right side of the guidance envelope, but this
solution appears reasonable given the stronger hurricane is more
likely to feel the steering effects of the deep-layer trough.
Therefore, the NHC track forecast has been nudged slightly eastward
this cycle, and it generally lies to the east of the multi-model
consensus aids.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane conditions are expected in the Islas Marias Sunday
night, with tropical storm conditions beginning late Sunday. A
Hurricane Warning has been issued for a portion of west-central
mainland Mexico, where hurricane conditions are expected on Monday
with tropical storm conditions beginning early Monday. Preparations
to protect life and property should be rushed to completion. A
Hurricane Watch has been extended southward along the west-central
coast of Mexico, where hurricane conditions are possible late Sunday
or early Monday.
 
2. Heavy rainfall from Orlene is expected to lead to flash flooding,
as well as possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain of
southwestern Mexico into Tuesday.
