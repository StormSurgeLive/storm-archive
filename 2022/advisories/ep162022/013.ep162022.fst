DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM MDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Orlene was located 
near latitude 18.2 North, longitude 107.1 West. Orlene is moving 
toward the north near 6 mph (9 km/h). A north-northeastward motion 
at a slightly faster speed is expected to begin by tonight and 
continue through early next week. On the forecast track, the center 
of Orlene should pass near or over Las Islas Marias Sunday night or 
Monday morning and reach the coast of mainland Mexico later on 
Monday or Monday night.

Satellite intensity estimates indicate that maximum sustained winds
have increased to near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher gusts.  Some
additional strengthening is forecast through Sunday afternoon,
followed by weakening starting on Sunday night and continuing until
landfall.

Orlene is a small tropical cyclone. Hurricane-force winds extend
outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the center and
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 970 mb (28.65 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in Las Islas Marias Sunday
night, with tropical storm conditions beginning late Sunday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area by early Sunday. Hurricane conditions are possible along the
coast of mainland Mexico within the hurricane watch area by Sunday
night into Monday. Tropical storm conditions are possible along the
coast of mainland Mexico within the tropical storm watch area
tonight and Sunday.

RAINFALL: Into Monday evening, Orlene is expected to produce 3 to 5
inches of rainfall, with local amounts of 10 inches, for portions of
southwest Mexico.  These rainfall amounts should lead to flash
flooding, as well as possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain.

STORM SURGE: Coastal flooding is likely along the coast of Mexico
in the warning area in regions of onshore winds.

SURF:  Large swells generated by Orlene will affect the coast of
southwestern Mexico, and the extreme southern portion of the Baja
California peninsula through this weekend. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
