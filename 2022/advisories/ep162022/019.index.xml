<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Orlene, which is near Las Islas Marias near southwestern <br/>
Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South-Southwest of the Baja California Peninsula:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to become better organized in <br/>
association with an area of low pressure located several hundred <br/>
miles south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California <br/>
peninsula.  Satellite imagery also indicates that the surface <br/>
circulation has become better defined.  If these trends continue, a <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form Monday or Monday night while <br/>
the system moves slowly northward during the next couple of days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of southern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec is producing a disorganized area <br/>
of showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to be somewhat conducive for gradual development during <br/>
the next several days.  The low is forecast to move generally <br/>
west-northwestward during the next couple of days, but could turn <br/>
northwestward toward the end of the week. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Las Islas Marias
* The coast of mainland Mexico from San Blas to Mazatlan
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* The coast of mainland Mexico from Playa Perula to San Blas

and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, generally within 36
hours.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.
 
Interests elsewhere along the coast of western and northwestern
Mexico should monitor the progress of Orlene.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Orlene was located
near latitude 22.1 North, longitude 106.4 West. Orlene is moving
toward the north near 9 mph (15 km/h), and a general northward to
north-northeastward motion is expected to continue over the next day
or so.  On the forecast track, the center of Orlene will continue to 
move away from Las Islas Marias this morning, and reach the coast of
mainland Mexico within the warning area later today or tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 100 mph (155 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Weakening is expected during the next day or 
so, but Orlene is forecast to remain as hurricane when it reaches 
southwestern Mexico.  Rapid weakening is forecast after Orlene moves 
onshore, and the system should dissipate on Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 976 mb (28.82 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the warning area along
the coast of mainland Mexico today, with tropical storm conditions
beginning this morning.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread northward in the
tropical storm warning area through early today.  Hurricane
conditions are possible along the coast of mainland Mexico within
the hurricane watch area early today.
 
RAINFALL: Orlene is expected to produce the following rainfall
across portions of southwestern Mexico through Tuesday:
 
* Islas Marias: 6 to 10 inches, with local amounts of 14 inches.
* Nayarit and southern Sinaloa: 3 to 6 inches with local amounts of
10 inches.
* Jalisco, Colima, and southwest Durango: 1 to 3 inches with local
amounts of 5 inches.
 
These rainfall amounts are likely to lead to flash flooding, as
well as possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is likely to cause coastal
flooding in the Islas Marias and along the coast of mainland Mexico
in the warning area in regions of onshore winds.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Orlene are affecting the west coast
of Mexico and will spread northward to the southern portion of the
Baja California peninsula and the Gulf of California over the next
day or so. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 600 AM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.

<title>Hurricane Orlene Forecast Discussion Number 18</title>

Hurricane Orlene Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162022
900 PM MDT Sun Oct 02 2022
 
Orlene appears to be slowly weakening this evening. 1-minute GOES-17 
IR satellite imagery shows persistent bursting cloud tops below -80 
C in the northern semicircle of the hurricane, likely still 
associated with its eyewall. A 0116 UTC F-17 SSMIS microwave pass 
also showed an eyewall fragment remains in connection to these very 
cold cloud tops, though comparing microwave with geostationary 
satellite suggests the hurricane is starting to become more tilted. 
There are also subtle hints that upper-level westerly flow is 
beginning to undercut the cirrus on the western side of the 
convective plume. The subjective Dvorak intensity estimates were CI 
5.5/102-kt from TAFB and CI 5.0/90-kt from SAB. However, the Final 
T-numbers have been slowly decreasing and the initial intensity was 
set to 90 kt for this advisory.
 
The intensity forecast is somewhat tricky for Orlene over the next 
day or so. Deep-layer (200-850 mb) southwesterly vertical wind shear 
is steadily increasing over Orlene and is now over 20-kt in both the 
latest GFS- and ECMWF-based SHIPS guidance. This shear is expected 
to increase to 30-kt in the next 12-24 h, and will likely play a 
role in helping to import drier mid-level air into the core of the 
small hurricane. However, during this period, Orlene will also be 
traversing over very warm sea-surface temperatures, above 30 degrees 
Celsius, which could help the deep convection to remain quite 
vigorous, especially during the diurnal max period. Thus, while 
weakening appears likely, the rate of weakening has a higher than 
normal uncertainty. The intensity guidance this cycle has a faster 
rate of weakening, and the latest NHC intensity forecast was 
shifted in that direction, though not quite as dramatic. Orlene is 
still forecast to be a hurricane as it makes landfall in mainland 
Mexico sometime on Monday. After landfall, the small system should 
quickly weaken over the higher terrain of Mexico, with dissipation 
likely by 48 hours.
 
The hurricane appears to be moving a little more east of due north 
tonight, with the estimated motion at 010/7 kt. Orlene should 
continue this general heading for the next 12 to 24 hours, remaining 
steered by a mid-level ridge to its east, until the hurricane makes 
landfall at some point on Monday along the southwestern coast of 
Mexico. The track guidance this cycle has made a shift to the west, 
likely due to some of the guidance (GFS, HWRF) showing the tropical 
cyclone de-coupling from the deep convection in the immediate 
short-term. Since that process has not yet occurred, the track 
forecast this cycle was only shifted slightly west of the prior 
track, though is notably slower with the speed of Orlene shortly 
after the system makes landfall.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane conditions are likely ongoing near Islas Marias
tonight. A Hurricane Warning is in effect for a portion of
west-central mainland Mexico, where hurricane conditions are
expected on Monday with tropical storm conditions beginning
overnight. Preparations to protect life and property should be
rushed to completion.
 
2. A dangerous storm surge is likely to cause coastal flooding in
the Islas Marias and along the coast of mainland Mexico in the
warning area in regions of onshore winds.
 
3. Heavy rainfall from Orlene is expected to lead to flash flooding,
as well as possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain of
southwest Mexico through Tuesday.
