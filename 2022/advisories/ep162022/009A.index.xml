A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* The coast of mainland Mexico from Playa Perula to San Blas
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Las Islas Marias
* The coast of mainland Mexico from San Blas to Bahia Tempehuaya

dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the coast of western and northwestern
Mexico should monitor the progress of Orlene. Additional watches
or warnings will likely be required for portions of these areas
later this morning.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 AM MDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Orlene was 
located near latitude 17.1 North, longitude 107.2 West. Orlene is 
moving toward the north near 5 mph (7 km/h).  Orlene is forecast to 
have a slight increase in forward speed later this morning and turn 
toward the north-northeast by tonight. This north-northeastward 
motion is expected to continue into early next week. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Steady to rapid strengthening is expected through tonight, 
and Orlene is forecast to become a hurricane later today.
 
Orlene remains a small tropical cyclone.  Tropical-storm-force
winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible in Las Islas Marias on
Sunday, with tropical storm conditions possible tonight and
Sunday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area
by early Sunday. Tropical storm conditions are possible along the
coast of mainland Mexico within the tropical storm watch area 
tonight and Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: Into Monday evening, Orlene is expected to produce 3 to 5
inches of rainfall, with local amounts of 10 inches, for portions of
southwestern Mexico.  These rainfall amounts should lead to flash
flooding, as well as possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain.
 
STORM SURGE: Coastal flooding is likely along the coast of Mexico
in the warning area in regions of onshore winds.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Orlene will affect the coast of 
southwestern Mexico, and the extreme southern portion of the Baja 
California peninsula through this weekend. These swells are likely 
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 300 AM MDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Orlene Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Tropical Storm Orlene Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162022
900 PM MDT Fri Sep 30 2022
 
Orlene had another burst of deep convection in the past few hours. 
Earlier microwave imagery from SSMI/S still showed a small inner 
core with a curved band to the south.  Subjective and objective 
satellite Dvorak classifications continue to range between 45 to 65 
kt.  Therefore, the initial intensity remains at 55 kt to represent 
a blend of these estimates.
 
The storm is embedded in an environment conducive for further 
intensification.  Global models suggest the vertical wind shear is 
low and the surrounding mid-level humidities are relatively moist 
and should remain this way for the next day or so.  These 
conditions, combined with warm sea surface temperatures, create the 
potential for steady to rapid intensification.  In fact, 
statistical guidance indicates there is a higher than average 
probability of rapid intensification in the upcoming 24 hours.  The 
official forecast still shows Orlene steadily strengthening to peak 
near 85 kt in 36 hours and little changes have been made since the 
previous advisory.  Beyond this period, the vertical wind shear is 
expected to increase and induce weakening until landfall.  It should 
be noted that the NHC intensity forecast is on the high end of the 
guidance to account for the possibility of rapid intensification.
 
The cyclone is moving along the periphery of a ridge over central 
Mexico.  In the next day, Orlene is expected to turn 
north-northeastward in the flow between the ridge and an upper-level 
trough over northwestern Mexico and the northern Baja California 
peninsula and continue this trajectory until landfall.  The latest 
NHC track prediction is slightly east of the previous track forecast 
and a little faster than the consensus model aids. This forecast 
favors the GFS track solution over the ECMWF.    
 
Based on the the forecast track and wind radii, the Government of 
Mexico has issued a Tropical Storm Warning and a Hurricane Watch for 
portions of mainland Mexico.  Additional watches and warnings will 
likely be required in the coming day.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane conditions are possible in the Islas Marias on Sunday, 
where a hurricane watch has been issued.  Tropical storm conditions 
are expected within the tropical storm warning area from Playa 
Perula to San Blas within the next 36 h. Tropical storm conditions 
are possible over other portions of southwestern and west-central 
Mexico in the tropical storm watch area.
 
2. Heavy rainfall from Orlene is expected to lead to flash flooding,
as well as possible landslides in areas of mountainous terrain of
Southwest Mexico into Monday afternoon.
