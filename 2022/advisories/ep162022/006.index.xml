BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Orlene Advisory Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162022
300 AM MDT Fri Sep 30 2022
 
...ORLENE STRENGTHENS AS IT TURNS NORTHWESTWARD...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM MDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.9N 106.9W
ABOUT 275 MI...440 KM SW OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 320 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests along the coast of western Mexico should monitor the
progress of Orlene. Watches may be required later this morning for
a portion of the western Mexico coastline.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Orlene was 
located near latitude 15.9 North, longitude 106.9 West. Orlene is 
moving toward the northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h). A turn toward the 
north is expected by tonight along with a slight increase in 
forward speed.  Orlene is then forecast to turn toward the 
north-northeast by Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Steady to rapid strengthening is expected during the next couple of 
days, and Orlene is forecast to become a hurricane tonight or 
Saturday.
 
Orlene is a small tropical cyclone. Tropical-storm-force winds 
extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Large swells generated by Orlene will affect the coast of
southwestern Mexico, and the extreme southern portion of the Baja
California peninsula by this weekend. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Orlene Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Orlene Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162022
300 AM MDT Fri Sep 30 2022
 
Orlene continues to gain strength.  An earlier microwave overpass 
revealed a well-defined curved band wrapping into a developing inner 
core.  Persistent deep convection is over the estimated low-level 
center location, with cloud tops near -80 degrees Celsius. The 
UW-CIMSS ADT objective Dvorak estimate as well as the Data-T number 
from SAB have increased from the previous advisory, and therefore 
the initial intensity has been nudged up to 50 kt.  

The storm has turned northwestward and is heading 320/4 kt as it 
begins to slowly round the western periphery of a mid-level ridge 
located over Mexico.  A turn to the north should occur by tonight 
followed by a turn to the north-northeast along with a slight 
increase in forward speed, as Orlene rounds the ridge and gets 
caught in the flow between the ridge and an upper trough to its 
west.  The consensus track guidance has shifted slightly eastward 
this cycle, partially due to the ECMWF track coming into better 
agreement with the rest of the global models.  The NHC track 
forecast was also adjusted a little to the right, but remains just 
west of the consensus. Based on the trends in the track forecast, 
there is an increasing probability that Orlene may affect the coast 
of the Mexican state of Jalisco as it passes just to the west of 
that location in 2-3 days. Therefore, watches may be required for a 
portion of that coastline later this morning. 

Orlene is within an environment favorable for strengthening, with 
plenty of atmospheric moisture, low vertical wind shear, and water 
temperatures of 29 degrees C.  The cyclone's forecast path should 
keep it within these conditions for the next 36-48 h.  With there 
now being evidence of an inner core, Orlene's rate of strengthening 
should increase soon.  After 48 h, strong southwesterly shear is 
forecast to begin impacting the cyclone and should entrain dry 
mid-tropospheric air into its circulation.  This should cause 
Orlene to weaken before it reaches the coast of Mexico early next 
week.  Based on the small size of the cyclone, fairly rapid changes 
in its intensity are possible, both while strengthening and 
weakening.  The NHC forecast is a little higher that the previous 
one and is very near the various multi-model consensus solutions.
