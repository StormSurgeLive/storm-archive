500 PM PDT Wed Sep 28 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
South of the Southwestern Coast of Mexico: <br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure <br/>
south of the southern coast of Mexico continue to show signs of <br/>
organization. Further development is anticipated and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form as soon as tonight. The system is <br/>
forecast to move west-northwestward off the coast of southwestern <br/>
Mexico for the next couple of days, and then could turn northward <br/>
over the weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western East Pacific:<br/>
The remnants of Newton are located about 1,200 miles west-southwest <br/>
of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
Satellite-derived wind data indicate that the low has weakened <br/>
today. Shower and thunderstorm activity associated with the low has <br/>
also decreased and become less organized during the past several <br/>
hours. Some slight development is still possible tonight or tomorrow <br/>
while the system moves slowly westward over the far western portion <br/>
of the eastern North Pacific. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Sixteen-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162022
1000 PM CDT Wed Sep 28 2022
 
The area of low pressure located south of the southwestern coast of 
Mexico has steadily gained organization throughout the day. Recent 
microwave imagery indicated the formation of convective banding and 
an earlier partial ASCAT pass suggested the system likely has a 
well-defined center. Recent Dvorak classifications from TAFB and SAB 
were both 2.0, another sign that the system has become better 
organized. Collectively these data support classifying the system as 
a tropical cyclone, and advisories have been initiated on Tropical 
Depression Sixteen.
 
For the next 48 to 60 h, the forecast is fairly straightforward with 
high confidence. The depression is moving toward the west-northwest 
near 9 kt, and that general motion should continue as the system is 
steered by a mid-level ridge centered over Mexico. Environmental 
conditions appear conducive for strengthening, and all of the 
intensity models suggest it will become a tropical storm quickly, 
and continue strengthening to hurricane intensity a day or two after 
that.
 
The main concern with the forecast is what happens beyond 60 h, when 
confidence in the forecast decreases considerably. There is a clear 
bifurcation in the track guidance at that point that appears to be 
linked to the intensity and vertical extent of the cyclone. If the 
cyclone is relatively deep at that point, which is shown by all of 
the normally reliable intensity guidance, it will likely turn 
northward or north-northeastward as it interacts with a mid- to 
upper-level trough. However, some models like the ECMWF forecast a 
shallower cyclone that takes a drastically different path slowly 
westward, steered primarily by lower-level winds. The result is a 
massive spread in the track guidance, with most of the consensus 
aids caught somewhat between those two scenarios. Although the ECMWF 
solution can not be dismissed entirely, the more skillful intensity 
guidance (supported by the favorable environment) suggest that the 
eastern solution toward Mexico may be more likely. The NHC forecast 
therefore favors the northeastern solution and shows the cyclone 
moving toward the coast of Mexico by 72-96 h. Strong upper-level 
winds associated with the aforementioned trough and a drier 
surrounding environment should cause the cyclone to weaken as it 
moves closer to the coast, and it will likely quickly dissipate if 
it moves inland. The NHC intensity forecast is close to the 
intensity consensus throughout the forecast, except at 96 h to 
reflect that the official forecast position is still over water at 
that time.
