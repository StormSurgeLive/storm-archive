ABOUT 315 MI...505 KM S OF LAS ISLAS MARIAS MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 360 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...994 MB...29.36 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Government of Mexico has issued a Tropical Storm Warning for
the coast of mainland Mexico from Playa Perula to San Blas, and a
Hurricane Watch from San Blas to Bahia Tempehuaya.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* The coast of mainland Mexico from Playa Perula to San Blas
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Las Islas Marias
* The coast of mainland Mexico from San Blas to Bahia Tempehuaya
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* The coast of mainland Mexico from Manzanillo to Playa Perula
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, generally within 36
hours.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the coast of western and northwestern
Mexico should monitor the progress of Orlene. Additional watches
or warnings will likely be required for portions of these areas
overnight or Saturday.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM MDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Orlene was
located near latitude 17.0 North, longitude 107.2 West. Orlene is
moving toward the north near 5 mph (7 km/h).  Orlene is forecast to 
have a slight increase in forward speed overnight and move toward 
the north-northeast on Saturday and Saturday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Steady to rapid strengthening is expected through Saturday 
night, and Orlene is forecast to become a hurricane overnight or 
Saturday.
 
Orlene remains a small tropical cyclone.  Tropical-storm-force winds 
extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible in Las Islas Marias on 
Sunday, with tropical storm conditions possible Saturday night and 
Sunday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area 
by early Sunday. Tropical storm conditions are possible along the 
coast of mainland Mexico Saturday night and Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: Into Monday evening, Orlene is expected to produce 3 to 5
inches of rainfall, with local amounts of 10 inches, for portions of
southwestern Mexico.  These rainfall amounts should lead to flash
flooding, as well as possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain.
 
STORM SURGE: Coastal flooding is likely along the coast of Mexico
in the warning area in regions of onshore winds.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Orlene will affect the coast of
southwestern Mexico, and the extreme southern portion of the Baja
California peninsula by this weekend. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next intermediate advisory at 1200 AM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 300 AM MDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Orlene Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Tropical Storm Orlene Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162022
300 PM MDT Fri Sep 30 2022

Orlene has become a little better organized since the last advisory, 
with the central convection becoming a little more concentrated.  
Satellite intensity estimates are now in the 45-65 kt range, and 
based on these the initial intensity is nudged upward to 55 kt.  
Although the organization has increased, the cyclone still looks a 
bit ragged, perhaps because the current easterly shear is a little 
stronger than the analyzed 5-10 kt.
 
As noted in the last advisory, Orlene is forecast to be in a moist, 
low-shear environment and over warm sea surface temperatures for the 
next 24-36 h.  These conducive conditions, combined with the small 
storm size, should allow steady to rapid strengthening as the core 
convection becomes more symmetric and concentrated.  Indeed, the 
rapid intensification indices of the SHIPS model show around a 50 
percent chance of 25-30 kt of strengthening during the next 24.  
Based this and other guidance, the new intensity forecast calls for 
Orlene to reach a peak intensity of 85 kt in 36 h.  After that, the 
global models remain in excellent agreement that the cyclone should 
encounter strong southwesterly shear that should result in quick 
weakening.  The official forecast during the weakening phase, 
including the 60-kt landfall intensity, is at the upper edge of the 
intensity guidance. However, there is still a chance that Orlene 
could be a hurricane at landfall if the shear is lighter than 
expected or the storm moves faster than currently forecast.
 
The initial motion is now north-northwestward or 335/4 kt.  Orlene 
is on the southwest side of a mid- to upper-level ridge over central 
Mexico, and water vapor imagery shows a developing mid- to 
upper-level trough over northwestern Mexico and the northern Baja 
California peninsula. Orlene should turn northward and north- 
northeastward between these features during the next day or so, with 
this general motion continuing for the rest of the forecast period.  
The new forecast track, which again is similar to the previous 
forecast, calls for the system to pass west of Cabo Corrientes and 
near the Islas Marias in about 48 h and then make landfall on the 
mainland coast of Mexico near 96 h.  This forecast is close to the 
consensus models, but is still slower than the GFS model. As seen 
earlier, some of the ensemble guidance still forecasts the 
possibility that Orlene will get so strongly sheared that the 
northward motion will slow over the southern Gulf of California and 
keep the center offshore through 120 h.
 
The forecast track and wind radii require a Hurricane Watch for Las 
Islas Marias and a Tropical Storm Watch for a potion of mainland 
Mexico at this time.  Additional watches and warnings will likely 
be required tonight or on Saturday.

Key Messages:

1. Hurricane conditions are possible in the Islas Marias on Sunday, 
where a hurricane watch has been issued.  Tropical storm conditions 
are possible over portions of southwestern and west-central Mexico 
in the tropical storm watch area.

2. Heavy rainfall from Orlene is expected to lead to flash flooding, 
as well as possible landslides in areas of mountainous terrain of 
Southwest Mexico into Monday afternoon.
