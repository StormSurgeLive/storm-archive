Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Tue Oct 4 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on newly formed <br/>
Tropical Depression Twelve, located a few hundred miles west of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands.<br/>
<br/>
East of the Windward Islands:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located just east of the Windward <br/>
Islands continues to produce a large area of showers and <br/>
thunderstorms. Earlier data from the Air Force Reserve Hurricane <br/>
Hunters indicated that the system did not yet possess a well-defined <br/>
circulation center, with the majority of the shower and thunderstorm <br/>
activity displaced to the southeast of the broader rotation. <br/>
However, upper-level winds are forecast to become more conducive for <br/>
development, and a tropical depression is likely to form over the <br/>
next several days if the system remains over open waters while <br/>
moving westward at about 15 mph through the Windward Islands and <br/>
into the Caribbean Sea. Another Air Force Reconnaissance mission is <br/>
scheduled to investigate this system tomorrow morning, if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of development, heavy rainfall with localized flooding, <br/>
as well as gusty winds, are expected over portions of the Windward <br/>
Islands, northern portions of South America, and the ABC Islands <br/>
during the next couple of days.  Interests in those locations, in <br/>
addition to those in Central America, should continue to monitor <br/>
the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
Key messages for the disturbance east of the Windward Islands can be <br/>
found on the National Hurricane Center website at www.hurricanes.gov<br/>
<br/>
Public Advisories on Tropical Depression Twelve are issued under <br/>
WMO header WTNT32 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCPAT2.<br/>

Tropical Depression Twelve Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122022
500 PM AST Tue Oct 04 2022
 
A fairly concentrated area of deep convection has persisted near an 
area of low pressure that NHC has monitoring a few hundred miles 
west of the Cabo Verde Islands, and Dvorak classifications from TAFB 
and SAB are now a consensus T2.0/30 kt.  It hadn't been clear 
previously how well-defined the system was, but an ASCAT-C 
scatterometer pass from this morning suggested that a small 
circulation, with a well-defined center, had formed within the 
broader trough located over the eastern Atlantic.  Therefore, 
advisories are being initiated on Tropical Depression Twelve with 
maximum sustained winds of 30 kt.

The depression is located along the southwestern periphery of a 
mid-level high centered over northwestern Africa, and to the south 
of a prominent mid- to upper-level low.  This pattern should steer 
the cyclone northwestward or north-northwestward during the next 
couple of days.  The HWRF model is somewhat of an outlier to the 
northeast and is therefore pulling the track model consensus aids in 
that direction.  The NHC track is near or to the west of the 
consensus aids, more closely following the GFS and ECWMF global 
models.

Deep-layer southwesterly shear is already beginning to increase over 
the depression, and is likely to reach values of 30 to 35 kt in the 
next 36 to 48 hours.  The system has some potential to strengthen 
slightly and reach tropical storm strength tonight or on Wednesday, 
but for the most part the cyclone is expected to be short-lived.  
Global models show the system opening up into a trough in a few 
days, and the NHC forecast shows dissipation by 60 hours, which 
could be a little generous.
