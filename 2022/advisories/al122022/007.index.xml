Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Thu Oct 6 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Twelve, located several hundred miles west-northwest of <br/>
the Cabo Verde Islands.<br/>
<br/>
Southeastern Caribbean Sea:<br/>
An area of low pressure located over the far southeastern Caribbean <br/>
Sea is producing a large area of showers and thunderstorms over the <br/>
southern Windward Islands, northern South America, and adjacent <br/>
waters.  Satellite-derived wind data indicate that this system does <br/>
not yet have a well-defined center of circulation.  While land <br/>
interaction with the northern coast of South America may hinder <br/>
significant development during the next day or so, environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to be mostly conducive for development as <br/>
the system moves generally westward, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form in the next couple of days by the time the system <br/>
enters the south-central Caribbean Sea.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of development, heavy rainfall with localized flooding, <br/>
as well as gusty winds to gale force, are expected over portions of <br/>
the Windward Islands, northern portions of Venezuela including <br/>
Isla Margarita, and the ABC Islands during the next day or two.  <br/>
Interests in those locations, in addition to those in Central <br/>
America, should continue to monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
Key messages for the disturbance over the far southeastern Caribbean <br/>
Sea can be found on the National Hurricane Center website at <br/>

Tropical Depression Twelve Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122022
500 AM AST Thu Oct 06 2022
 
Once again, the low-level circulation of the depression has 
separated from the deep convection, which is located over 50 miles 
to the east-northeast of the center.  Subjective satellite intensity 
estimates have held steady and the initial intensity remains at 30 
kt.  The already strong west-southwesterly vertical wind shear is 
forecast to increase further in the next day or so and will likely 
cause the cyclone to weaken quickly.  Most of the global models 
suggest the system will open into a trough within a day or two.  The 
official forecast now shows the depression becoming a post-tropical 
remnant low in 12 hours and dissipated by 36 hours.

The depression is moving west-northwestward at about 11 kt.  This 
general motion is expected to continue for the next day or so while 
the system follows the low-level flow around a ridge to the north.  
The NHC track forecast has shifted south from the previous forecast 
possibly due to the more westward initial position and is on the 
northern edge of the guidance envelope.
