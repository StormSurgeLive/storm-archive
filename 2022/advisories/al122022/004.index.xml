Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Wed Oct 5 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Twelve, located several hundred miles west of the Cabo <br/>
Verde Islands.<br/>
<br/>
East of the Windward Islands:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located near the southern Windward <br/>
Islands continues to produce a large area of disorganized showers <br/>
and thunderstorms.  Radar imagery from Barbados and surface <br/>
observations indicate that the system has not become any better <br/>
organized since yesterday.  However, upper-level winds are forecast <br/>
to become more conducive for development, and a tropical depression <br/>
is likely to form over the next several days if the system remains <br/>
over water while moving generally westward at about 15 mph over <br/>
the southeastern and southern Caribbean Sea.  An Air Force <br/>
reconnaissance mission is currently en route to investigate the <br/>
system this morning. <br/>
<br/>
Regardless of development, heavy rainfall with localized flooding, <br/>
as well as gusty winds to gale force, are expected over portions of <br/>
the Windward Islands, northern portions of South America, and the <br/>
ABC Islands during the next couple of days.  Interests in those <br/>
locations, in addition to those in Central America, should continue <br/>
to monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
Key messages for the disturbance east of the Windward Islands can be <br/>
found on the National Hurricane Center website at www.hurricanes.gov<br/>
<br/>
Public Advisories on Tropical Depression Twelve are issued under <br/>
WMO header WTNT32 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCPAT2.<br/>

Tropical Depression Twelve Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122022
1100 AM AST Wed Oct 05 2022
 
The depression continues to lose organization. Visible satellite 
imagery reveals an exposed low-level swirl displaced nearly 90 n mi 
west of its associated deep convection due to strong 
west-southwesterly vertical wind shear. The initial advisory 
intensity of 30 kt may be a little generous, and is based off a 
blend of the latest Dvorak intensity estimates. The shear affecting 
the depression is forecast to increase further, while the system 
ingests dry air to its west. This should disrupt significant deep 
convection from reforming near its low-level center. In fact, 
simulated satellite imagery from the GFS and ECMWF suggest that the 
deep convection will not return and the system should become a 
remnant low within the next 24 h. The latest NHC intensity forecast 
is unchanged from the previous one. However, the forecast now 
indicates that the depression will become a remnant low by 24 h.

The 12 h motion of the depression is about 295/8 kt. However, the 
low-level center has been moving nearly westward over the past 
several hours.  Most of the model guidance indicates a 
west-northwestward track to the south-southwest of a mid-level ridge 
over the next couple days until dissipation. The NHC track forecast 
has been adjusted to the left of the previous one and is on the 
left side of the guidance envelope, as it is assumed that the 
shallow low-level circulation is going to be steered more by the 
low-level flow than the models indicate.
