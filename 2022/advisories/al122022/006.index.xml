Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Wed Oct 5 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Twelve, located several hundred miles west of the Cabo <br/>
Verde Islands.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Caribbean Sea:<br/>
An area of low pressure located over the far southeastern Caribbean <br/>
Sea is producing a large area of showers and thunderstorms over the <br/>
southern Windward Islands, northern South America, and adjacent <br/>
waters. While surface observations do suggest broad rotation <br/>
and pressures are lower than 24 hours ago, there currently is no <br/>
definitive proof that a well-defined circulation exists. While land <br/>
interaction with the northern coast of South America may hinder <br/>
significant development during the next day or so, environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to be generally favorable for development as <br/>
the system moves westward, and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form in the next couple of days by the time the system enters the <br/>
south-central Caribbean Sea.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of development, heavy rainfall with localized flooding, <br/>
as well as gusty winds to gale force, are expected over portions of <br/>
the Windward Islands, northern portions of South America, and the <br/>
ABC Islands during the next day or two.  Interests in those <br/>
locations, in addition to those in Central America, should continue <br/>
to monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
Key messages for the disturbance over the far southeastern Caribbean <br/>
Sea can be found on the National Hurricane Center website at <br/>

Tropical Depression Twelve Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122022
1100 PM AST Wed Oct 05 2022
 
Occasional pulses of deep convection with cloud top temperatures 
below -70 C continue to occur near and to the northeast of the 
center of the tropical depression. We finally were able to receive 
some scatterometer data near the system, with the highest 
non-flagged wind retrievals of 28 and 32 kts from both ASCAT-B/C 
passes. Subjective and objective Dvorak T-numbers have been 
decreasing, but in deference to the higher scatterometer data, the 
initial intensity was held at 30 kt for this advisory. The 
southwesterly vertical wind shear over the depression is now above 
30 kts, and is expected to increase further over the next 24 hours. 
This highly unfavorable environment should ultimately lead to the 
system's demise as the remaining deep convection is stripped 
completely away from the low-level circulation. The intensity 
forecast still shows the depression becoming a remnant low in 24 
hours and then opening up into a trough in 48 hours, though this 
could occur as soon as tomorrow morning.
 
The depression has made a northward jog this evening, but smoothing
out the 12 hour motion results in a northwest heading at 320/11 kt.
A northwest to west-northwest motion is expected to continue until
the system becomes a remnant low or dissipates in 24-48 hours. The
NHC track has been adjusted a bit northward due to the initial
position, but ends up near the previous forecast track in about 48
hours, following along with the consensus aids.
