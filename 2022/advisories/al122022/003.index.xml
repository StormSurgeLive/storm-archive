Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Wed Oct 5 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Twelve, located several hundred miles west of the Cabo <br/>
Verde Islands.<br/>
<br/>
East of the Windward Islands:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located near the southern Windward <br/>
Islands continues to produce a large area of disorganized showers <br/>
and thunderstorms.  Radar imagery from Barbados and surface <br/>
observations indicate that the system has not become any better <br/>
organized since yesterday.  However, upper-level winds are forecast <br/>
to become more conducive for development, and a tropical depression <br/>
is likely to form over the next several days if the system remains <br/>
over water while moving generally westward at about 15 mph over <br/>
the southeastern and southern Caribbean Sea.  An Air Force <br/>
reconnaissance mission is currently en route to investigate the <br/>
system this morning. <br/>
<br/>
Regardless of development, heavy rainfall with localized flooding, <br/>
as well as gusty winds to gale force, are expected over portions of <br/>
the Windward Islands, northern portions of South America, and the <br/>
ABC Islands during the next couple of days.  Interests in those <br/>
locations, in addition to those in Central America, should continue <br/>
to monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
Key messages for the disturbance east of the Windward Islands can be <br/>
found on the National Hurricane Center website at www.hurricanes.gov<br/>
<br/>
Public Advisories on Tropical Depression Twelve are issued under <br/>
WMO header WTNT32 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCPAT2.<br/>

Tropical Depression Twelve Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122022
500 AM AST Wed Oct 05 2022

The depression is a sheared tropical cyclone, with the low-level 
center displaced about 40 n mi to the west-southwest of the main 
area of deep convection.  Overall, the system is quite 
ragged-looking and elongated from south to north, with little 
evidence of banding.  The current intensity estimate is held at 30 
kt in agreement with Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB, although 
this may be generous.

Southwesterly flow associated with a large upper-level low 
centered about 700 n mi to the north of the depression is imparting 
strong shear on the system.  Global model guidance indicates that 
this shear will continue, and increase, over the next 48 hours or 
so while the tropical cyclone moves over waters of diminishing 
oceanic heat content.  These negative environmental factors should 
result in the system dissipating in a couple of days.  This is in 
general agreement with the latest LGEM intensity guidance, and with 
the global model guidance that shows the system opening up into a 
trough by late Thursday.

The depression is moving somewhat to the left of previous estimates 
with an initial motion of 320/7 kt.  Over the next day or two, the 
system is expected to move along the southwestern side of a 
mid-level ridge over the eastern Atlantic.  The official track 
forecast is a little to the left of the previous one, but to the 
right of the model consensus.  This is close to the latest ECMWF 
track prediction.

As noted earlier, some of the model guidance, notably the ECMWF, 
and its ensemble, hints that the system could make a comeback after 
5 days over the subtropical Atlantic.  Given the uncertainties, 
this will not be shown in the official forecast at this time.
