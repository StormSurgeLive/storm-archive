Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Wed Oct 5 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Twelve, located several hundred miles west of the Cabo <br/>
Verde Islands.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Caribbean Sea:<br/>
Surface observations and data from an Air Force Reserve <br/>
reconnaissance aircraft mission this morning indicate that the <br/>
broad area of low pressure located over the far southeastern <br/>
Caribbean Sea does not have a well-defined center.  Although the <br/>
system is producing a large area of showers and thunderstorms over <br/>
the southern Windward Islands and adjacent waters, satellite and <br/>
radar imagery from Barbados show that it is not well organized.  <br/>
The system is forecast to move generally westward near the northern <br/>
coast of South America, and interaction with land is likely to <br/>
hinder significant development during the next day or so.  After <br/>
that time, environmental conditions are expected to become more <br/>
conducive for development, and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form within the next two to three days when the system is over the <br/>
south-central Caribbean Sea.  <br/>
<br/>
Regardless of development, heavy rainfall with localized flooding, <br/>
as well as gusty winds to gale force, are expected over portions of <br/>
the Windward Islands, northern portions of South America, and the <br/>
ABC Islands during the next day or two.  Interests in those <br/>
locations, in addition to those in Central America, should continue <br/>
to monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
Key messages for the disturbance east of the Windward Islands can be <br/>
found on the National Hurricane Center website at www.hurricanes.gov<br/>
<br/>
Public Advisories on Tropical Depression Twelve are issued under <br/>
WMO header WTNT32 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCPAT2.<br/>

Tropical Depression Twelve Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122022
500 PM AST Wed Oct 05 2022
 
Deep convection had been stripped away well to the northeast of the 
depression's low-level center for much of the morning. Just 
recently, there has been a small burst of convection occurring 
nearer to the center. The Dvorak intensity estimates have changed 
little from the previous advisory. Therefore, the initial advisory 
remains 30 kt. Persistent, strong southwesterly shear and dry air 
entrainment should cause the depression to struggle to maintain 
organized deep convection, and the system is forecast to become a 
remnant low on Thursday. Based on some of the global model pressure 
fields, it is possible that the surface low may become ill-defined 
by Thursday as well, if not shortly thereafter. There was no change 
to the NHC intensity forecast from the previous one. 

After wobbling westward for a few hours this morning, the depression 
has resumed a west-northwestward motion, or 300/9 kt. This general 
motion is expected to continue until the system dissipates in a 
couple of days as it remains to the south-southwest of a subtropical 
ridge. The latest NHC track forecast was little changed from the 
previous one.
