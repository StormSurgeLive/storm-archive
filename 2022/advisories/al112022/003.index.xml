Tropical Depression Eleven Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112022
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 28 2022
 

There's been little change of note with the depression this 
evening. All of its deep convection is displaced well to the 
northeast of its center of circulation. In the absence of recent 
ASCAT data, the intensity is based on the subjective Dvorak 
classifications from TAFB and SAB which suggest an intensity of 
25-30 kt. Conservatively the advisory intensity was held at 30 kt, 
but this may be generous.

There was a slight westward adjustment to the position of the 
depression at 00Z, which resulted in an adjustment of the track 
forecast in that direction. Otherwise there's no change to any 
thinking behind the forecast. The depression should continue 
heading generally northwestward or north-northwestward for a day 
or two. The environment around the cyclone is forecast to quickly 
get very hostile, which should prevent strengthening and should 
cause it to dissipate within a few days, as indicated by all 
dynamical models. The NHC track and intensity forecasts remain near 
the various consensus aids.

center of Ian is expected to move across central Florida tonight and
Thursday morning and emerge over the western Atlantic by late
Thursday.  Ian is forecast to turn northward on Friday and approach
the northeastern Florida, Georgia and South Carolina coasts.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 115 mph (185 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Ian is a category 3 hurricane on the
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Further weakening is expected
for the next day or so, but Ian could be near hurricane strength 
when it moves over the Florida East coast tomorrow, and when it 
approaches the northeastern Florida, Georgia and South Carolina 
coasts on Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 50 miles (85 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles 
(280 km). A University of Florida Coastal Monitoring Program wind 
tower near Punta Gorda recently reported sustained winds of 54 mph 
(87 km/h) with a gust to 91 mph (146 km/h). A private weather 
station in Joshua recently measured a wind gust to 89 mph (143 
km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 960 mb (28.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
* Englewood to Bonita Beach, including Charlotte Harbor...12-18 ft
* Middle of Longboat Key to Englewood...6-10 ft
* Bonita Beach to Chokoloskee...8-12 ft
* Chokoloskee to East Cape Sable...5-8 ft
* Anclote River to Middle of Longboat Key, including Tampa Bay...4-6
ft
* Flagler/Volusia County Line to Altamaha Sound...4-6 ft
* Altamaha Sound to South Santee River...3-5 ft
* Suwannee River to Anclote River...3-5 ft
* St. Johns River north of Julington...3-5 ft
* St. Johns River south of Julington...2-4 ft
* East Cape Sable to Card Sound Bridge...2-4 ft
* South Santee River to Little River Inlet...2-4 ft
* Patrick Air Force Base to Flagler/Volusia County Line...1-3 ft
* East of Little River Inlet to Cape Lookout...1-3 ft
* Dry Tortugas and Florida Keys...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Catastrophic wind damage is likely near the core of Ian.
Hurricane conditions are ongoing within the Hurricane Warning area
now and will slowly spread northeastward through the night.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected to begin along the east coast of
Florida in the Hurricane Warning area starting early Thursday.
Hurricane conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch area on
Thursday through late Friday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are occuring in parts of the warning area
on the east coast of Florida and should spread northward through
the northeast Florida, Georgia and South Carolina coasts tonight
and Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible in the
Tropical Storm Watch area starting on Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall:
 
* Florida Keys and South Florida: 6 to 8 inches, with local maxima
up to 12 inches.
* Central and Northeast Florida: 12 to 20 inches, with local
maxima up to 30 inches.
* Coastal Georgia and Lowcountry of South Carolina: 4 to 8 inches,
with local maxima of 12 inches.
* Eastern Georgia and Coastal South Carolina: 3 to 6 inches, with
local maxima of 8 inches across western North Carolina
 
Widespread, life-threatening catastrophic flash and urban flooding,
with major to record flooding along rivers, is expected to continue
across central Florida.  Widespread considerable flash, urban, and
river flooding is expected across portions of northeast Florida,
southeastern Georgia, and eastern South Carolina later this week
through the weekend.  Locally considerable flash flooding, urban,
and river flooding is possible this weekend across portions of the
southern Appalachians with limited flooding possible across portions
of southern Mid-Atlantic.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible this evening into tonight
across east central Florida.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting the northern coast
of Cuba, the northeastern coast of the Yucatan peninsula and
west coast of Florida. Swells will increase along the east coast of
Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina tonight and Thursday.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Hurricane Ian Forecast Discussion Number 25</title>

Hurricane Ian Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
500 PM EDT Wed Sep 28 2022
 
An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft provided the last
fix on Ian just before the hurricane made landfall at Cayo Costa,
Florida, with the landfall time near at 305 pm EDT.  The
minimum pressure had risen to about 940 mb at landfall, suggesting
that the winds had come down slightly, and the landfall intensity
was estimated near 130 kt.  While there hasn't been much in situ
data recently, satellite images show that the eye has become more
cloud filled, and Tampa Doppler radar data is indicating a gradual
reduction in winds.  The initial intensity is set to 120 kt on this
advisory.
 
Further weakening is forecast while Ian moves over central Florida
during the next day and emerges into the western Atlantic later on
Thursday.  While there is a lot of vertical wind shear in the
environment there, a favorable trough interaction from a trough in
the southern United States is expected to counteract the shear,
resulting in Ian staying a strong tropical storm through landfall 
on the southeast U.S. coast.  Little change was made to the 
intensity forecast, which is near or somewhat above the consensus 
guidance.
 
The hurricane is moving to the north-northeast at about 8 kt.  The
aforementioned trough is likely to cause Ian to turn northward over
the western Atlantic and to the north-northwest by the weekend.
Model guidance is just a bit faster to the north-northeast than the
last cycle, and the new forecast is nudged in that direction.  The 
trough will probably cause Ian to transition to an extratropical
cyclone in a few days over the southeastern United States, and this
new forecast reflects this likelihood.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Catastrophic storm surge inundation of 12 to 18 feet above ground
level along with destructive waves is ongoing along the southwest
Florida coastline from Englewood to Bonita Beach, including
Charlotte Harbor.
 
2. Catastrophic wind damage is occurring along the southwestern
coast of Florida in areas near the eyewall of Ian. Hurricane-force
winds, especially in gusts, are expected to spread inland to central
Florida near the core of Ian through early Thursday. Hurricane
conditions are expected along the east-central Florida coast
overnight through early Thursday.
 
3. Heavy rainfall will spread across the Florida peninsula through
Thursday and reach portions of the Southeast U.S. later this week
and this weekend.  Widespread, life-threatening catastrophic
flooding, with major to record river flooding, are expected to
continue across portions of central Florida with considerable
flooding in northern Florida, southeastern Georgia and eastern South
Carolina.
 
4.  There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge on Thursday
and Friday along the coasts of northeast Florida, Georgia, and South
Carolina, with hurricane conditions possible. Residents in these
areas should follow any advice given by local officials.
