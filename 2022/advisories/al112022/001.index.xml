Tropical Depression Eleven Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112022
1100 AM AST Wed Sep 28 2022

Over the past 24 hours, convection has been gradually increasing in 
organization with the well-defined area of low pressure located 
several hundred miles to the west of the Cabo Verde islands. 
Overnight, we received Metop-B and C scatterometer data that 
confirmed a closed cyclonic circulation, with peak winds up to at 
least 30 kt in the deeper convection to the east of the center 
location. There were even a few higher wind retrievals, but these 
may have been rain contaminated in the intense convection. Since 
that time, the convection has remained persistent, and TAFB has been 
providing a subjective intensity estimate of T2.0/30-kt for the last 
12-18 hours. A more recent scatterometer pass also indicates the 
circulation remains closed and well-defined. Thus, the system can be 
considered a tropical depression, and the maximum sustained winds 
will be set at 30-kt for this advisory. 

After meandering in the same location for the last 2-4 days, the 
depression now appears to be finally gaining some latitude with the 
estimated motion at 350/8-kt. The very slow motion over the past few 
days was related to a large weakness in the steering flow due to a 
broad and expansive upper-level trough to the north. Low to 
mid-level ridging is finally starting to nose in from the east over 
the past 24 hours, and the ongoing northward motion is expected to 
continue with a gradual turn more north-northwestward. The guidance 
is in fairly good agreement with this solution, and the initial NHC 
forecast track follows closely with the reliable consensus aids TVCN 
and HFIP corrected consensus approach (HCCA). 

The depression has a short window to intensify a bit more in the 
short-term, while the vertical wind shear remains under 10 kt for 
the next 12-18 hours. However, as the storm gains latitude, it will 
quickly become highly sheared from the aforementioned upper-level 
trough that lies along its track. Thus, only slight strengthening is 
shown in the 12-h forecast followed by a steady state or weakening 
tropical cyclone in the 24-48 hour forecast period. The system is 
expected to open up into a trough by 72 hours as it succumbs to the 
highly unfavorable environment, and this could occur sooner than 
forecasted. The NHC intensity forecast is in good agreement with the 
majority of the guidance, and also lies near the HCCA aid.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Ian was located
near latitude 26.3 North, longitude 82.5 West. Ian is moving toward
the north-northeast near 9 mph (15 km/h). This general motion with a
reduction in forward speed is forecast today, followed by a turn
toward the northeast on Thursday. On the forecast track, the center
of Ian is expected to move onshore within the hurricane warning area
in a few hours, move over central Florida tonight and Thursday
morning and emerge over the western Atlantic by late Thursday.  Ian
is forecast to turn northward on Friday and approach the 
northeastern Florida, Georgia and South Carolina coasts late 
Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 155 mph (250 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Ian is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Ian is forecast to make landfall on the west 
coast of Florida as a catastrophic hurricane.  Weakening is expected 
after landfall, but Ian could be near hurricane strength when it 
moves over the Florida East coast tomorrow, and when it approaches 
the northeastern Florida, Georgia and South Carolina coasts late 
Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles 
(280 km).  A Weatherflow station on Sanibel Island recently reported 
sustained winds of 58 mph (93 km/h) with a gust to 75 mph 
(121 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 937 mb (27.67 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
* Englewood to Bonita Beach, including Charlotte Harbor...12-18 ft
* Middle of Longboat Key to Englewood...6-10 ft
* Bonita Beach to Chokoloskee...8-12 ft
* Chokoloskee to East Cape Sable...5-8 ft
* Anclote River to Middle of Longboat Key, including Tampa Bay...4-6
ft
* Suwannee River to Anclote River...3-5 ft
* Lower Keys from Key West to Big Pine Key, including the
Dry Tortugas...3-5 ft
* Flagler/Volusia County Line to South Santee River including St. 
Johns River...3-5 ft
* St. Johns River south of Julington...2-4 ft
* East Cape Sable to Card Sound Bridge...2-4 ft
* Florida Keys east of Big Pine Key...2-4 ft
* Patrick Air Force Base to Flagler/Volusia County Line...1-3 ft
* North of South Santee River to Surf City NC...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Catastrophic wind damage is likely where the core of Ian
moves onshore.  Hurricane conditions will begin along the west
coast of Florida within the Hurricane Warning area shortly, with 
tropical storm conditions ongoing.

Hurricane conditions are expected to begin along the east coast of 
Florida in the Hurricane Warning area starting overnight.  Hurricane 
conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch area on Thursday 
through late Friday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are occurring in the warning area in the 
Florida Keys, and will continue this morning.  Tropical storm 
conditions are occuring in parts of the warning area on the east 
coast currently, and should spread up northward through the Georgia 
and South Carolina coasts tonight and Thursday.  Tropical storm 
conditions are expected within the warning area in Cuba for the next 
few hours.
 
RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall:
 
* Florida Keys and South Florida: 6 to 8 inches, with local maxima
up to 12 inches.
* Central and Northeast Florida: 12 to 18 inches, with local
maxima up to 24 inches.
* Eastern Georgia and Coastal South Carolina: 4 to 8 inches, with
local maxima of 12 inches.
 
Widespread, life-threatening catastrophic flash, urban, and river 
flooding is expected across central Florida.  Widespread 
considerable flash, urban, and river flooding is expected across 
portions of southern Florida through Wednesday, and northeast 
Florida, southeastern Georgia, and coastal South Carolina later this 
week through the weekend.  Limited flash, urban, and river flooding 
is possible over portions of the Southeast and southern Mid-Atlantic 
U.S. later this week through the weekend.
 
TORNADOES: Tornadoes are possible today and tonight, especially 
across east central Florida.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting the northern coast
of Cuba, the northeastern coast of the Yucatan peninsula and
west coast of Florida. Swells will increase along the east coast of
Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina tonight and Thursday.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Hurricane Ian Forecast Discussion Number 24</title>

Hurricane Ian Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
1100 AM EDT Wed Sep 28 2022
 
Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunter data was absolutely
critical this morning in diagnosing the rapid intensification of
Ian, despite both planes undergoing multiple eyewall penetrations
experiencing severe turbulence.  That data supported an intensity of 
about 135 kt a few hours ago.  Since that time, high-resolution
Tampa Doppler radar data has been sampling the eyewall near 10,000 
ft with winds up to 155 kt, indicating that Ian is on the threshold 
of category 5 status.  The maximum winds are set to 135 kt on this 
advisory.
 
Ian is expected to make landfall in southwestern Florida in the next 
few hours as a catastrophic hurricane.  No changes were made to the 
track forecast near Florida, except to be faster to come into line 
with the latest consensus aids.   One important change is that Ian 
is likely to remain more intact as it crosses the Florida peninsula 
(due to both its stronger initial wind speed and its faster forecast 
forward speed), and this now increases the threat of hurricane-force 
winds on the east coast of Florida.  This necessitates the issuance 
of a Hurricane Warning on the east coast of central Florida.  While 
significant re-strengthening of Ian might not occur over the 
Atlantic Ocean, model guidance has been catching up with a 
trough interaction from a shortwave over the southern United 
States, and are stronger than yesterday on Ian's intensity with 
more baroclinic forcing.  Thus, a Hurricane Watch has been issued 
from northeastern Florida northward up the coast through most of 
coastal South Carolina.   The new intensity forecast is raised from 
the previous one, near the latest statistical-dynamical guidance.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Catastrophic storm surge inundation of 12 to 18 feet above ground 
level along with destructive waves are expected somewhere along the 
southwest Florida coastline from Englewood to Bonita Beach, 
including Charlotte Harbor. Residents in these areas should urgently 
follow any evacuation orders in effect. 

2. Catastrophic wind damage is beginning along the southwestern 
coast of Florida today near the landfall location.  Hurricane-force 
winds are expected to extend well inland along near the core of Ian. 
Preparations to protect life and property should be urgently rushed 
to completion. 

3. Heavy rainfall will spread across the Florida peninsula through 
Thursday and reach portions of the Southeast U.S. later this week 
and this weekend.  Widespread, life-threatening catastrophic
flooding is expected across portions of central Florida with 
considerable flooding in southern Florida, northern Florida, 
southeastern Georgia and coastal South Carolina. Widespread, 
prolonged major and record river flooding is expected across 
central Florida.

4. Hurricane conditions are expected along the east-central Florida 
coast overnight, where a Hurricane Warning has been issued.  
Hurricane conditions are possible from northeastern Florida to 
portions of South Carolina on Thursday and Friday, and a Hurricane 
Watch has been issued for that area.
