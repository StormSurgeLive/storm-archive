Tropical Depression Eleven Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112022
500 PM AST Wed Sep 28 2022

The depression has not become any better organized this afternoon, 
and in fact, the low-level center is now mostly exposed to the west 
of the deepest convective activity, which is relatively meager. 
Satellite estimates are either unchanged or have even decreased a 
little this afternoon, and the latest initial intensity was held at 
30 kt for this advisory. 

Tropical Depression Eleven has been moving to the north-northwest 
this afternoon a bit faster than earlier, estimated at 345/9-kt. A 
low- to mid-level ridge located to the east is steering the storm 
currently, and this ridge will stay put while the weakness 
associated with a large upper-level trough should allow the 
depression to turn northward in the subtropical Atlantic basin. The 
guidance this cycle is a shade further west early on, but actually 
ends up a bit east of the previous track in 48-60 hours. The NHC 
track forecast also was nudged a bit west earlier on, and a bit east 
by the 60 h, in good agreement with the consensus aids. 

The window of favorable upper-level winds is quickly closing, as the 
current 5-10 kt of vertical wind shear is expected to increase to 
over 20 kt in 24 hours. In addition, the depression is embedded in a 
fairly dry mid-level air environment, which is likely playing a role 
in the limited convective activity currently. The latest intensity 
forecast still gives an opportunity for the depression to become a 
short-lived tropical storm during the typical diurnal max in 
convection tonight, but now shows earlier weakening, making the 
system a remnant low in 60-h and dissipated shortly thereafter. This 
intensity forecast is in fairly good agreement with the consensus 
aids which have also trended downward form earlier today.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Ian was located by an 
Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft and Tampa radar data 
near latitude 26.6 North, longitude 82.3 West. Ian is moving toward 
the north-northeast near 9 mph (15 km/h). This general motion with a 
reduction in forward speed is forecast today, followed by a turn 
toward the northeast on Thursday. On the forecast track, the center 
of Ian is expected to move onshore soon, move over central Florida 
tonight and Thursday morning and emerge over the western Atlantic by 
late Thursday.  Ian is forecast to turn northward on Friday and 
approach the northeastern Florida coast in addition to the Georgia 
and South Carolina coasts late Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 155 mph (250 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Ian is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Ian is forecast to make landfall on the west
coast of Florida as a catastrophic hurricane soon.  Weakening is 
expected after landfall, but Ian could be near hurricane strength 
when it moves over the Florida East coast tomorrow, and when it 
approaches the northeastern Florida, Georgia and South Carolina 
coasts late Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175
miles (280 km).  A River, Estuary, and Coastal Network station at 
Redfish Pass, Florida, recently reported sustained winds of 94 mph 
(151 km/h) and a wind gust of 126 mph (203 km/h), A Weatherflow 
station at Tarpon Point recently reported sustained winds of 83 mph 
(134 km/h) with a gust to 101 mph (163 km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure is 937 mb (27.67 inches) based on Air 
Force Reserve dropsonde data.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
* Englewood to Bonita Beach, including Charlotte Harbor...12-18 ft
* Middle of Longboat Key to Englewood...6-10 ft
* Bonita Beach to Chokoloskee...8-12 ft
* Chokoloskee to East Cape Sable...5-8 ft
* Anclote River to Middle of Longboat Key, including Tampa Bay...4-6
ft
* Suwannee River to Anclote River...3-5 ft
* Lower Keys from Key West to Big Pine Key...3-5 ft
* Flagler/Volusia County Line to Altamaha Sound...4-6 ft
* Altamaha Sound to South Santee River ...3-5 ft
* St. Johns River north of Julington...3-5 ft
* St. Johns River south of Julington...2-4 ft
* East Cape Sable to Card Sound Bridge...2-4 ft
* Florida Keys east of Big Pine Key...2-4 ft
* Patrick Air Force Base to Flagler/Volusia County Line...1-3 ft
* North of South Santee River to Surf City NC...1-3 ft
* Dry Tortugas...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Catastrophic wind damage is likely where the core of Ian
moves onshore.  Hurricane conditions are ongoing within the 
Hurricane Warning area now and will slowly spread northeastward 
through the day.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected to begin along the east coast of
Florida in the Hurricane Warning area starting early Thursday.  
Hurricane conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch area on 
Thursday through late Friday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are occurring in the warning area in the
Florida Keys, and will continue for a few more hours.  Tropical 
storm conditions are occuring in parts of the warning area on the 
east coast and should spread northward through the Georgia
and South Carolina coasts tonight and Thursday.  
 
RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall:
 
* Florida Keys and South Florida: 6 to 8 inches, with local maxima
up to 12 inches.
* Central and Northeast Florida: 12 to 18 inches, with local
maxima up to 24 inches.
* Eastern Georgia and Coastal South Carolina: 4 to 8 inches, with
local maxima of 12 inches.
 
Widespread, life-threatening catastrophic flash, urban, and river
flooding is expected across central Florida.  Widespread
considerable flash, urban, and river flooding is expected across
portions of southern Florida through Wednesday, and northeast
Florida, southeastern Georgia, and coastal South Carolina later this
week through the weekend.  Limited flash, urban, and river flooding
is possible over portions of the Southeast and southern Mid-Atlantic
U.S. later this week through the weekend.
 
TORNADOES: Tornadoes are possible today and tonight, especially
across east central Florida.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting the northern coast
of Cuba, the northeastern coast of the Yucatan peninsula and
west coast of Florida. Swells will increase along the east coast of
Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina tonight and Thursday.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Ian Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
1100 AM EDT Wed Sep 28 2022
 
Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunter data was absolutely
critical this morning in diagnosing the rapid intensification of
Ian, despite both planes undergoing multiple eyewall penetrations
experiencing severe turbulence.  That data supported an intensity of 
about 135 kt a few hours ago.  Since that time, high-resolution
Tampa Doppler radar data has been sampling the eyewall near 10,000 
ft with winds up to 155 kt, indicating that Ian is on the threshold 
of category 5 status.  The maximum winds are set to 135 kt on this 
advisory.
 
Ian is expected to make landfall in southwestern Florida in the next 
few hours as a catastrophic hurricane.  No changes were made to the 
track forecast near Florida, except to be faster to come into line 
with the latest consensus aids.   One important change is that Ian 
is likely to remain more intact as it crosses the Florida peninsula 
(due to both its stronger initial wind speed and its faster forecast 
forward speed), and this now increases the threat of hurricane-force 
winds on the east coast of Florida.  This necessitates the issuance 
of a Hurricane Warning on the east coast of central Florida.  While 
significant re-strengthening of Ian might not occur over the 
Atlantic Ocean, model guidance has been catching up with a 
trough interaction from a shortwave over the southern United 
States, and are stronger than yesterday on Ian's intensity with 
more baroclinic forcing.  Thus, a Hurricane Watch has been issued 
from northeastern Florida northward up the coast through most of 
coastal South Carolina.   The new intensity forecast is raised from 
the previous one, near the latest statistical-dynamical guidance.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Catastrophic storm surge inundation of 12 to 18 feet above ground 
level along with destructive waves are expected somewhere along the 
southwest Florida coastline from Englewood to Bonita Beach, 
including Charlotte Harbor. Residents in these areas should urgently 
follow any evacuation orders in effect. 

2. Catastrophic wind damage is beginning along the southwestern 
coast of Florida today near the landfall location.  Hurricane-force 
winds are expected to extend well inland along near the core of Ian. 
Preparations to protect life and property should be urgently rushed 
to completion. 

3. Heavy rainfall will spread across the Florida peninsula through 
Thursday and reach portions of the Southeast U.S. later this week 
and this weekend.  Widespread, life-threatening catastrophic
flooding is expected across portions of central Florida with 
considerable flooding in southern Florida, northern Florida, 
southeastern Georgia and coastal South Carolina. Widespread, 
prolonged major and record river flooding is expected across 
central Florida.

4. Hurricane conditions are expected along the east-central Florida 
coast overnight, where a Hurricane Warning has been issued.  
Hurricane conditions are possible from northeastern Florida to 
portions of South Carolina on Thursday and Friday, and a Hurricane 
Watch has been issued for that area.
