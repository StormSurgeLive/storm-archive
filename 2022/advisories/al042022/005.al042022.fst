HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone Four can be found in
the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC.

WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to occur in the warning
area during the next several hours.

RAINFALL:  The disturbance is expected to produce total rainfall 
amounts of 1 to 3 inches, with isolated totals of 5 inches, along 
the northeastern coast of Mexico across the state of Tamaulipas 
today. These rains could produce isolated flash flooding across 
coastal northeast Mexico.  Rainfall amounts of less than an inch are 
expected farther to the north across far South Texas.

STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Mouth of Rio Grande to Port Mansfield TX... up to 1 ft

Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.

Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast of northeastern Mexico
near and to the north of where the center makes landfall.

SURF: Swells generated by this system are forecast to affect eastern
Mexico and southern Texas through early Sunday. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
