...DISTURBANCE HEADING TOWARD THE TAMAULIPAS MEXICO COAST...
...HEAVY RAINS COULD CAUSE FLASH FLOODS ACROSS PORTIONS OF SOUTH 
TEXAS AND NORTHEASTERN MEXICO THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 400 AM CDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...22.8N 95.8W
ABOUT 230 MI...370 KM SSE OF MOUTH OF THE RIO GRANDE
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 320 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1010 MB...29.83 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* The Gulf coast of Mexico from Boca de Catan northward to the
Mouth of the Rio Grande
* The Lower Texas coast from Port Mansfield southward to the Mouth
of the Rio Grande
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within
the next 12 to 24 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United States, 
including possible inland watches and warnings, please monitor 
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast 
office. For storm information specific to your area outside of the 
United States, please monitor products issued by your national 
meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the disturbance was centered near latitude
22.8 North, longitude 95.8 West.  The system is moving toward the
northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A northwestward to 
north-northwestward motion at a similar forward speed is expected 
through Sunday.  On the forecast track, the disturbance is 
expected to reach the coast of northeastern Mexico late this 
afternoon and then move across the Rio Grande Valley tonight and 
Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
The disturbance could still strengthen slightly and become a 
tropical storm today before reaching the coast of northeastern 
Mexico.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1010 mb (29.83 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone Four can be found in
the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to occur in the warning
area beginning this afternoon or evening.
 
RAINFALL: The disturbance is expected to produce total rainfall 
amounts of 1 to 3 inches, with isolated totals of 5 inches, along 
the eastern coast of Mexico from the northern portions of the state 
of Veracruz across the state of Tamaulipas to Nuevo Leon through 
today.  Rainfall of 1 to 3 inches will be possible in South Texas 
through Sunday morning, with continuing uncertainty in how far north 
and west these amounts will be realized.  The potential exists for 
flash flooding elsewhere along the track of the disturbance.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Mouth of Rio Grande to Port Mansfield TX...1-2 ft
 
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 2 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast of northeastern Mexico
near and to the north of where the center makes landfall.
 
SURF: Swells generated by this system are forecast to affect eastern
Mexico and southern Texas this weekend. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 AM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

<title>Potential Tropical Cyclone Four Forecast Discussion Number 3</title>
<description>Issued at 400 AM CDT Sat Aug 20 2022  <![CDATA[<pre>
ZCZC MIATCDAT4 ALL
TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM
 
Potential Tropical Cyclone Four Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042022
400 AM CDT Sat Aug 20 2022
 
We have a much better view of the low clouds on the western side 
of the disturbance in proxy-visible satellite imagery than we did 
last evening when they were obscured by high-level cirrus, and the 
low clouds' south-to-north motion just off the coast of Mexico 
suggests that the disturbance still does not have a closed surface 
circulation.  However, a mid-level circulation remains evident and 
is the focus of a recent resurgence in deep convection.  It is 
assumed that the maximum winds in the system are still 30 kt, but 
an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance flight scheduled for later this 
morning should give us a better idea of the disturbance's structure 
and intensity.

The disturbance continues to move northwestward at 12 kt, and model 
guidance is in fairly good agreement that a steady northwestward or 
north-northwestward motion should continue for the next 24 hours or 
so.  This trajectory should bring the system inland near or just 
south of the mouth of the Rio Grande late this afternoon or evening, 
which is the same scenario that has been indicated in previous 
advisories.

There remains uncertainty if the disturbance will be able to 
develop a closed surface circulation--and become a tropical 
cyclone--before it reaches the coast later today.  At best, the 
global models are resolving a well-defined vorticity maximum at 
about 5000 ft above the surface and perhaps a surface trough near 
the coast of Mexico, but none of them explicitly show the 
development of a well-defined surface circulation.  As long as deep 
convection continues, however, it could spur the development of a 
surface center before reaching the coast.  That said, the new NHC 
forecast now only shows the system reaching a peak intensity of 35 
kt, which is still above all of the guidance.  A remnant low 
position is provided at 36 hours for continuity, but it's more 
likely that the system will have dissipated by then--if it even 
forms at all.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected across portions of
northeastern Mexico and southern Texas this afternoon and evening, 
where a Tropical Storm Warning is in effect.
 
2. Rains from the disturbance may begin to affect the eastern coast 
of Mexico, from northern Veracruz across parts of Tamaulipas and 
Nuevo Leon, today.  This rainfall may produce flash flooding.  
Heavy rain may also move to the far south Texas coast through Sunday 
morning, producing local flash, urban, and small stream flood 
impacts.
