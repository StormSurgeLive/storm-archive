HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Four can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.

WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to occur in the
warning area beginning Saturday afternoon or evening.

RAINFALL: The Potential Tropical Cyclone is expected to produce
total rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated totals of 8
inches, along the eastern coast of Mexico from the northern
portions of the state of Veracruz across the state of Tamaulipas.
Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches with isolated higher amounts
possible across far south Texas.

STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Mouth of Rio Grande to Port Mansfield TX...1-2 ft

Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.

Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 2 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast of
northeastern Mexico near and to the north of where the center makes
landfall.

SURF: Swells generated by this system are forecast to affect eastern
Mexico and southern Texas this weekend. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
