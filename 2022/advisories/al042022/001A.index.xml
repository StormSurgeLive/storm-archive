Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Fri Aug 19 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
Satellite imagery indicates that showers and thunderstorms <br/>
associated with the broad low pressure area over the southwestern <br/>
Gulf of Mexico and the Bay of Campeche continue to become better <br/>
organized.  Environmental conditions appear favorable for <br/>
additional development, and a tropical depression could form later <br/>
today, tonight, or on Saturday while the system moves northwestward <br/>
across the southwestern and western Gulf of Mexico.  However, by <br/>
Saturday night, the system is expected to move inland over <br/>
northeastern Mexico, which will end its chances of development. An <br/>
Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is currently enroute to <br/>
investigate the system.  Interests along the northeastern coast of <br/>
Mexico and the lower Texas coast should monitor the progress of <br/>
this system.  Regardless of development, this system could bring <br/>
locally heavy rains to portions of northeastern Mexico and southern <br/>
Texas over the weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area
outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by
your national meteorological service.

on Saturday and make landfall there Saturday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Slow strengthening is expected through landfall, and the 
disturbance is forecast to become a tropical storm tonight or 
Saturday.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.
* Formation chance through 5 days...high ...80 percent.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1009 mb (29.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Four can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to occur in the
warning area beginning Saturday afternoon or evening.
 
RAINFALL: The Potential Tropical Cyclone is expected to produce
total rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated totals of 8
inches, along the eastern coast of Mexico from the northern
portions of the state of Veracruz across the state of Tamaulipas.
Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches with isolated higher amounts
possible across far south Texas.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Mouth of Rio Grande to Port Mansfield TX...1-2 ft
 
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 2 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast of
northeastern Mexico near and to the north of where the center makes
landfall.
 
SURF: Swells generated by this system are forecast to affect eastern
Mexico and southern Texas this weekend. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Potential Tropical Cyclone Four Forecast Discussion Number 1</title>

Potential Tropical Cyclone Four Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042022
400 PM CDT Fri Aug 19 2022

Showers and thunderstorms associated with the broad low pressure 
area in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico have become better 
organized during the last 24 h, and reports from an Air Force 
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate winds near 30 kt.  
However, both the aircraft and scatterometer data show that 
the disturbance does not yet have a well-defined circulation 
center.  Since the system is likely to develop further and make 
landfall as a tropical storm in less than 36 h, advisories are 
being initiated on Potential Tropical Cyclone Four with Tropical 
Storm Warnings being issued for portions of the coasts of 
northeastern Mexico and south Texas.

The initial motion is a somewhat uncertain 315/12.  The disturbance 
is on the southwest side of a subtropical ridge, and a general 
northwest motion should continue until the system moves inland over 
northeastern Mexico.  The track guidance is tightly clustered, and 
the forecast track lies close to the various consensus models.

The disturbance is in an environment of light westerly vertical 
shear, and this should continue until landfall.  This should allow 
continued development until the system reaches the coast, and the 
official intensity forecast calls for a peak intensity of 40 kt 
near landfall.  It should be noted, though, that the global models 
do not develop the system significantly before landfall, and if 
they are correct any development could be slower than currently 
forecast.  The system will weaken after landfall, and by 60 h it 
is forecast to be absorbed into a larger low pressure area forming 
over western and northern Texas.


KEY MESSAGES:

1. Tropical storm conditions are expected across portions of 
northeastern Mexico and southern Texas on Saturday, where a Tropical 
Storm Warning has been issued.

2. Rains from the system may begin to affect the eastern coast of 
Mexico from northern Veracruz into southern Tamaulipas tonight into 
early Saturday.  This rainfall may produce life threatening flash 
flooding and mudslides.  Rain from this system may move into far 
south Texas during the day on Saturday.
