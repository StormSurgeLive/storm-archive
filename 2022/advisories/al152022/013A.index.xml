Hurricane Martin Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162022
500 PM AST Wed Nov 02 2022

Martin is an impressive high-latitude hurricane for November.  
Satellite imagery shows that the eye continues to become better 
defined with warmer temperatures in the center, along with a mostly 
solid eyewall.  Dvorak estimates from both TAFB and SAB have 
increased to T4.5 or 77 kt, and the initial wind speed is set to 75 
kt based on that data.  

The hurricane should begin extratropical transition overnight, with 
almost all of the guidance indicating strengthening.  The high- 
resolution hurricane models and most of the global models are still
showing a sting-jet-like feature, with winds of 90 kt or more 
expected tomorrow morning in the southern semicircle.  
Additionally, at about the same time, Martin should grow 
substantially due to a favorable mid-latitude trough 
interaction. Gradual weakening should start by tomorrow afternoon 
as the baroclinic forcing decreases, but Martin should be a
very large and strong extratropical cyclone for several days over
the far North Atlantic.  Little change was made to the previous 
forecast, and Martin should become an extratropical low by 18 
UTC on Thursday.
 
Martin has turned northeastward and continues to pick up 
speed, now 27 kt.  The hurricane should move faster to the 
north-northeast and north as it becomes drawn into the strong 
deep-layer trough to its northwest during the next day or two. This 
same trough will ultimately fully capture Martin, causing the now 
merged extratropical cyclone to slow down and eventually move 
eastward in the mid-latitude westerlies toward the British Isles.  
The new forecast was shifted eastward at long range, with only 
small modifications otherwise.

...LISA BRINGING WIND, RAIN, AND STORM SURGE TO BELIZE...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 700 PM CDT...0000 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.5N 88.5W
ABOUT 20 MI...30 KM W OF BELIZE CITY
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Guatemala has discontinued the Tropical Storm 
Warning for the north coast of Guatemala.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* The coast of Belize
* Chetumal to Puerto Costa Maya, Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Puerto Costa Maya to Punta Allen, Mexico
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests elsewhere in Central America and the Yucatan Peninsula of
Mexico should monitor the progress of Lisa.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lisa was located
inland near latitude 17.5 North, longitude 88.5 West. Lisa is 
moving toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h).  This general motion 
is expected to continue for the next day or so, bringing the center 
of Lisa across Belize, northern Guatemala, and southeastern Mexico. 
After that time, a turn to the northwest and a decrease in forward 
speed are expected as Lisa moves over the Bay of Campeche.
 
Maximum sustained winds are estimated to be near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Rapid weakening will continue while the center 
of Lisa moves farther inland.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70
miles (110 km).  An observation station at the port of Belize City 
reported a sustained wind of 68 mph (109 km/h) with a wind gust of 
86 mph (138 km/h) within the past couple of hours.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.24 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected along the coast of Belize
and the southeastern Yucatan peninsula during the next hour or two.
Tropical storm conditions are expected through tonight in portions
of the southern Yucatan Peninsula in the Tropical Storm Warning 
area.
 
RAINFALL: Lisa is expected to produce rainfall amounts of:
 
4 to 6 inches with local amounts to 10 inches across Belize,
northern Guatemala, the southern portion of the Mexican state of
Quintana Roo. southern Campeche, Tabasco, northern Chiapas, and far
eastern Veracruz.
 
2 to 4 inches with local amounts to 6 inches across the far
southeastern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula, the Bay Islands of
Honduras, central Guatemala and south-central Campeche.
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding conditions, primarily
across Belize into northern Guatemala, the far southeast portion of
the Yucatan peninsula, the southern portion of the Mexican state of
Campeche, Tabasco, northern Chiapas and far eastern Veracruz.
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will likely raise water levels by as
much as 4 to 7 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore 
flow near and to the north of the center of Lisa along the coast of 
Belize and extreme southeastern portions of the Yucatan Peninsula.  
Elsewhere, a storm surge of 1 to 3 feet is possible within the 
Tropical Storm Warning area in eastern Yucatan and up to 1 foot for 
the Bay Islands of Honduras. Near the coast, the surge will be 
accompanied by large and damaging waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lisa are expected to affect portions of
Central America during the next day or two. These swells could
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Lisa Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
400 PM CDT Wed Nov 02 2022
 
The hurricane is about to make landfall in Belize.  Satellite and
radar images show the small core of Lisa moving across Belize's
barrier islands and the eye is getting very close to Belize City.
The Air Force Hurricane Hunters have been investigating Lisa during
the past few hours and a combination of the flight-level winds and
improvement in structure in radar images support increasing the
initial intensity to 75 kt. Hurricane-force winds only extend about
15 n mi from the center, and those conditions will likely move
across Belize City during the next couple of hours.
 
Lisa is expected to track westward across Belize, northern
Guatemala, and southern Mexico during the next 24 to 36 hours.
After that time, a turn to the northwest and a decrease in forward
speed are expected when Lisa moves over the Bay of Campeche.  Over
the weekend, Lisa is expected to stall before drifting southward
in the low-level flow.  Little change was made to the previous
track forecast, and this prediction lies close to the various
consensus models.
 
After the core of Lisa moves inland, rapid weakening is forecast
due to land interaction.  Lisa is expected to become a tropical
storm this evening and weaken to a tropical depression on Thursday.
Although the storm is forecast to emerge back over water in the Bay
of Campeche, strong southerly shear should prevent strengthening.
The NHC intensity forecast now shows Lisa dissipating by the end of
the forecast period.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Life-threatening storm surge is possible near Belize City during
the next few hours.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are expected along the coast of Belize and
the southeastern Yucatan peninsula during the next few hours.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
coast of Guatemala, and over the eastern Yucatan Peninsula in the
Tropical Storm Warning areas through this evening.
 
4. Localized flash flooding is expected across portions of Belize,
northern Guatemala and portions of southeastern Mexico.
