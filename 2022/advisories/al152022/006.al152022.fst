products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lisa was
located near latitude 15.6 North, longitude 79.1 West. Lisa is
moving toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this motion is
expected to continue during the next few days. On the forecast
track, the center will pass south of the Cayman Islands on Tuesday,
move near or over the Bay Islands of Honduras early on Wednesday,
and approach Belize later on Wednesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is expected, and Lisa is forecast to become a
hurricane by early Wednesday over the northwestern Caribbean Sea.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible in the Bay Islands of
Honduras beginning early Wednesday and are possible along the coast
of Belize Wednesday afternoon. Tropical storm conditions are
possible along the coast of Honduras Tuesday night through
Wednesday. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the Tropical
Storm Watch area in Mexico, Honduras, and Guatemala Wednesday
afternoon.

RAINFALL: Through Thursday evening, Lisa is expected to produce
rainfall amounts of:

* 3 to 5 inches with local amounts to 8 inches across portions
of Belize and the Bay Islands of Honduras.
* 2 to 4 inches with local amounts to 6 inches across portions
of Northern Honduras, Jamaica, Guatemala and the eastern Yucatan
peninsula.
* 1 inch with local amounts to 2 inches across portions of the
Cayman Islands, eastern Nicaragua.

This rainfall could produce flash floods from northern Honduras
northward to the eastern Yucatan Peninsula.

STORM SURGE:  A storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3
to 5 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast of
Belize in areas of onshore winds and 1 to 3 feet for the Bay Islands
of Honduras. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large
and damaging waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lisa are expected to affect Jamaica and
the Cayman Islands during the next day or so, and will begin to
affect Central America on Tuesday. These swells could cause life-
threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
