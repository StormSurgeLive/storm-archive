Tropical Storm Martin Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162022
1100 AM AST Tue Nov 01 2022
 
The occluded low over the central North Atlantic has developed deep
convection over its center, while the frontal boundaries have
become displaced a long distance to its east and north.  At
the same time, FSU Cyclone Phase Space analyses suggest that the
system has developed a non-frontal warm core.  Given these changes,
the system has evolved into a tropical cyclone. The ASCAT
scatterometer just observed the system and indicated that the
intensity is currently at 45 kt with a large area of
35 kt-plus winds. Thus the system is now a tropical storm and given
the name Martin.
 
The system is moving toward the east-northeast around 8 kt, as it
is embedded in the mid-latitude westerlies in a split in the jet
stream with faster westerlies both poleward and equatorward of the
system.  Martin should turn toward the northeast at an increasingly
rapid forward speed during the next two days.  The official track
forecast is based upon the consensus (TVCN and HCCA) of the tightly
clustered global and hurricane dynamical models. In about three
days, Martin should decelerate as it merges with a developing
extratropical low to its north.
 
For the intensity, even though the SSTs are a lukewarm 25C, the
upper-level temperatures are quite cold given that Martin is
embedded within a deep and vertically stacked cyclone. This
vertical temperature structure should enable deep convection
to continue, even while the mid-level moisture is only marginally
ample.  The vertical shear is 20-25 kt out of the southwest, but
the effects of this moderate shear are tempered by Martin moving in
the same direction as the shear vector.  Bottom line is that
despite the month being November, Martin is expected to develop into
a hurricane at high latitudes.  The official intensity prediction
steadily strengthens the system through 48 hr, which matches a
consensus of the statistical, global, and hurricane dynamical
models.  Around 48 hr, Martin should transition into a powerful
extratropical low as a cold front reaches near the center of the
system.  In about three days, post-tropical Martin should be
merging with an developing extratropical system to its north but
still be containing hurricane-force winds.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lisa was
located by satellite imagery near latitude 16.5 North, longitude 
82.5 West. Lisa is moving toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h). 
This general motion with some decrease in forward speed is forecast 
during the next couple of days. On the forecast track, the center 
of Lisa will move near or over the Bay Islands of Honduras early
Wednesday, and move near Belize late on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Strengthening is expected, and Lisa is forecast to become a
hurricane overnight over the northwestern Caribbean Sea and continue
to intensify on Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the Bay Islands of
Honduras beginning early Wednesday and along the coast of Belize 
Wednesday afternoon. Tropical storm conditions are expected to 
begin along the northern coast of Honduras within the Tropical 
Storm Warning area tonight and in Guatemala and Yucatan on 
Wednesday. Hurricane conditions are possible in eastern Yucatan on 
Wednesday afternoon.
 
RAINFALL: Through Thursday evening, Lisa is expected to produce
rainfall amounts of:
 
* 4 to 6 inches with local amounts to 10 inches across Belize, the
Bay Islands of Honduras, northern Guatemala and the southeast
portion of the Mexican state of Chiapas.
* 2 to 4 inches with local amounts to 6 inches across the far
southeastern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula, Northern Honduras,
and central Guatemala
* 1 inch with local amounts to 2 inches across portions of the
Cayman Islands and eastern Nicaragua.
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding conditions primarily
across Belize into northern Guatemala, the southeast portion of the
Mexican state of Chiapas and the far southeast portion of the
Yucatan peninsula.
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will likely raise water levels by as
much as 4 to 7 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate
coast of Belize in areas of onshore winds, with 2 to 4 feet
possible within the Hurricane Watch area in eastern Yucatan and 1
to 3 feet for the Bay Islands of Honduras. Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and damaging waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lisa are expected to affect Jamaica,
the Cayman Islands and Central America for next day or two. These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Lisa Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>
<description>Issued at 1100 AM EDT Tue Nov 01 2022  <![CDATA[<pre>

Tropical Storm Lisa Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
1100 AM EDT Tue Nov 01 2022
 
An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft has provided
critical data with Lisa this morning, showing that the storm has
started to intensify.  Flight-level winds have increased to
55 kt, with SFMR winds of 50-55 kt, and surface-reduced dropsonde 
data of about 50 kt.  Thus, the initial wind speed is set to 50 kt 
as a blend of these data, above the latest satellite 
classifications. 

Further intensification is likely with Lisa now having a small 
radius-of-maximum winds in light vertical wind shear, along with 
the deep warm waters of the northwestern Caribbean providing ample 
fuel.  The NHC intensity forecast calls for steady strengthening 
and shows Lisa becoming a hurricane in less than a day when it is 
near the Bay Islands of Honduras, and Lisa should intensify as it 
approaches Belize.  For now, rapid intensification is not forecast, 
but since the percentage chances of this occurrence from SHIPS are 
increasing, this possibility must be mentioned and the new forecast 
is higher than the bulk of the guidance.  After landfall, rapid 
weakening is expected and Lisa is forecast to degenerate to a 
post-tropical remnant low by 72 hours and dissipate shortly 
thereafter.
 
Lisa continues moving just north of due west or 280/12 kt.  No 
significant changes were made to the track forecast.  A strong low- 
to mid-level ridge located to the north of Lisa should keep the 
tropical cyclone on a generally westward track during the next 
couple of days.  This motion is expected to bring the core of the 
cyclone near the Bay Islands of Honduras by early Wednesday, and 
across the coast of Belize by late Wednesday.  The dynamical models 
remain in relatively good agreement, and the NHC track is near the 
middle of the guidance envelope.  
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane conditions are expected in the Bay Islands of Honduras
early Wednesday and possible along the coast of Belize by
Wednesday afternoon.  Hurricane conditions are possible in eastern 
Yucatan in the Hurricane Watch area Wednesday afternoon.

2.  There is potential for a life-threatening storm surge near where 
the center of Lisa crosses the coast of Belize and for the southern 
portions of the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
north coast of Honduras and Guatemala beginning tonight into 
Wednesday, and over the eastern Yucatan Peninsula in the Tropical 
Storm Warning areas beginning Wednesday afternoon.
 
4. Localized flash flooding is expected across portions of Belize, 
the Bay Islands of Honduras, northern Guatemala and the southeast  
portion of the Mexican state of Chiapas starting tonight through 
Thursday.
