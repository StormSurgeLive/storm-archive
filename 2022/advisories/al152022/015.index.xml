Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Thu Nov 3 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems: <br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
downgraded Tropical Storm Lisa, located inland over northeastern <br/>
Guatemala, and on Hurricane Martin, located over the central North <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Atlantic:<br/>
A non-tropical area of low pressure is currently located several <br/>
hundred miles to the east-northeast of Bermuda. This system is <br/>
currently associated with a limited area of disorganized showers, <br/>
and environmental conditions are only marginally favorable for some <br/>
gradual subtropical or tropical development of this system as it <br/>
begins to move more westward by this weekend. By early next week, <br/>
this system is likely to be absorbed by a larger system developing <br/>
to its southwest. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
Another non-tropical, but complex area of low pressure is expected <br/>
to develop this weekend over the northeastern Caribbean Sea or the <br/>
southwestern Atlantic. Some slow subtropical or tropical development <br/>
of this system is possible afterward while it moves generally <br/>
northward to northwestward through early next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Martin Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162022
300 AM GMT Thu Nov 03 2022
 
Martin remains in impressive high-latitude late-season hurricane.
Recent infrared satellite imagery shows deep convection wrapping
around a ragged eye.  The hurricane's cloud shield has begun
expanding over the northern and northwestern portions of the storm
suggesting that the system's extratropical transition is beginning.
Subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB range from
65 to 77 kt, and the initial wind speed will remain on the higher
end of those estimates at 75 kt.
 
The global model guidance indicates that Martin will strengthen
tonight and early Thursday as it transforms into an extratropical
cyclone.  That transition is expected to be complete by about
1800 UTC on Thursday.  The guidance continues to depict a very
strong sting-jet-like feature around the southern and southwestern
portions of the storm, and the NHC forecast therefore calls for
some strengthening during the next 12 hours or so.  Martin's wind
field is also forecast to rapidly expand in size during the next
day or so, and this is reflected in the wind radii forecast.  The
baroclinic forcing should begin to decrease by late tomorrow, with
gradual weakening occurring after that time, however Martin is
forecast to remain a very large and powerful cyclone over the North
Atlantic for the next several days.
 
Martin continues to accelerate, and it is now moving northeastward
at about 34 kt. A faster north-northeastward motion is expected
overnight, followed by northward turn on Thursday as Martin moves
around the eastern side of a strong deep-layer trough.  The trough
is forecast to capture Martin by 36 hours, and the merged system is
expected to slow down considerably, and then turn eastward in the
mid-latitude flow.  The updated track forecast is slightly faster
during the first 24 hours, but little change was required
thereafter.  The forecast is a blend of mostly the GFS and ECMWF
global model guidance.

Interests in Central America and the Yucatan Peninsula, and
southeastern Mexico should continue to monitor the progress of Lisa.
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lisa was
located near latitude 17.8 North, longitude 90.1 West. Lisa is
moving toward the west near 10 mph (17 km/h). This general motion
is expected to continue for the next day or so, bringing the center
of Lisa across northern Guatemala and southeastern Mexico. After
that time, a turn to the northwest and a decrease in forward speed
are expected as Lisa moves over the Bay of Campeche.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast while the 
center remains over land, and Lisa is expected to weaken to a 
tropical depression later today.  Lisa is not expected to 
re-intensify once the center reaches the Bay of Campeche.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread inland
during the next several hours over portions of northern Guatemala
and the southern Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico.
 
RAINFALL: Lisa is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 4 to 6
inches with local amounts to 10 inches across Belize, northern
Guatemala, the southern portion of the Mexican state of Quintana
Roo, southern and central Campeche, Tabasco, northern Chiapas, and
far eastern Veracruz.
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding conditions.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lisa are expected to affect portions of
Central America today before subsiding. These swells could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 AM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

Tropical Storm Lisa Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
400 AM CDT Thu Nov 03 2022

Lisa has continued to move farther inland during the last several 
hours, with the center now located over extreme northern Guatemala. 
The organization of the storm has continued to decrease in both 
satellite imagery and radar data, and the initial intensity is 
reduced to a somewhat uncertain 40 kt.

The initial motion is 280/9 kt.  This general motion should continue 
for the next 24 h or so, followed by a turn toward the northwest as 
Lisa moves over the Bay of Campeche.  Starting near 48 h, the 
cyclone should slow its forward motion and make a looping turn 
toward the southeast, with this motion continuing until the cyclone 
dissipates.  The track guidance after 24 h has shifted a bit 
westward since the previous advisory, and the new forecast track for 
those time periods is nudged westward as well.

Lisa should continue to weaken while the center stays inland, and 
it is forecast to be below tropical-storm strength in about 12 h.  
Unfavorable upper-level winds and dry air entrainment are likely to 
prevent re-intensification over the Bay of Campeche, and these 
conditions should cause the cyclone to degenerate to a remnant low 
over water by 72 h.  The global models are in good agreement that 
the system will dissipate by 96 h, and the new intensity forecast 
follows that scenario.


Key Messages:
 
1. Localized flash flooding is expected across portions of Belize, 
northern Guatemala, and portions of southeast Mexico.

2. Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread inland over 
northern Guatemala and the southern portions of the Yucatan 
peninsula of Mexico during the next several hours, though all 
coastal warnings have been discontinued. 
 
3. Elevated Water levels along the coast of Belize should 
diminish today.
