Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Fri Nov 4 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems: <br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Lisa, located over the Bay of Campeche.<br/>
<br/>
East-Southeast of Bermuda:<br/>
A weak non-tropical area of low pressure located several hundred <br/>
miles east-southeast of Bermuda continues to produce an area of <br/>
showers and thunderstorms, mostly well to the east of its center.  <br/>
Any tropical or subtropical development of this disturbance should <br/>
be slow to occur during the next day or so while it moves little <br/>
through today and then turns westward over the weekend. The system <br/>
is forecast to interact with a larger low pressure area developing <br/>
to its southwest and will encounter stronger upper level winds on <br/>
Saturday, so further development is not anticipated beyond that <br/>
time.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
A large non-tropical low pressure system is expected to develop <br/>
across the northeastern Caribbean Sea and southwestern Atlantic <br/>
during the next day or two. The system is initially expected be very <br/>
broad and disorganized, but it could begin to acquire subtropical or <br/>
tropical characteristics by the end of the weekend. Environmental <br/>
conditions could support additional gradual development early next <br/>
week and a subtropical or tropical depression could form while the <br/>
disturbance moves generally northwestward or westward over the <br/>
southwestern Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>

SUMMARY OF 1000 AM CDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.1N 94.6W
ABOUT 185 MI...300 KM W OF CIUDAD DEL CARMEN MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1008 MB...29.77 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in eastern Mexico should continue to monitor the progress
of Lisa.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Lisa
was located near latitude 19.1 North, longitude 94.6 West. The
depression is moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h). A 
gradual turn toward the north at a slower forward speed is expected 
by Saturday morning. Lisa or its remnants are then forecast to 
stall and move very little through the remainder of the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Slight strengthening is possible today. Lisa is forecast to 
begin weakening by Saturday morning and will likely become a 
post-tropical remnant low by Saturday night.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  The rainfall threat associated with Lisa is expected to
continue to diminish.  Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches
are possible across portions of southeastern Mexico through this
afternoon.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Depression Lisa Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
1000 AM CDT Fri Nov 04 2022
 
Lisa has been over water for most of this morning, and deep 
convection associated with the tropical depression has increased. 
However, strong upper-level southerly winds appear to be limiting 
the majority of that convection to the north of the cyclone's 
surface center. Data from a couple of Mexican buoys located east of 
Lisa's center have not shown any signs of increasing winds, however 
we don't have any recent observations closer to the center of the 
depression. The 30 kt initial intensity was therefore based on a 
blend of TAFB and SAB Dvorak fixes. An Air Force Reserve hurricane 
hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate Lisa this afternoon and 
should provide more information about its winds and structure.

It's possible that Lisa could briefly re-attain tropical storm 
status this afternoon before an expected increase in the 
aforementioned wind shear and intrusions of dry air bring an end to 
the window for strengthening tonight. Lisa is forecast to lose its 
organized deep convection within about 36 h and dissipate about a 
day later, based on the latest dynamical hurricane and global model 
guidance. 

The depression has turned toward the northwest and is still 
forecast to slow down and begin to meander over the western Bay of 
Campeche by tomorrow. Exactly how far north Lisa gets will likely 
be determined in part by how long it remains a tropical cyclone 
since most of the northward steering flow is coming from the 
upper-levels, which won't affect Lisa's motion when it becomes a 
shallow remnant low. The NHC track forecast has been nudged 
northward at most forecast times, and lies between the previous 
official forecast and the latest multi-model consensus.
