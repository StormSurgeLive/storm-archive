Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Thu Nov 3 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems: <br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Lisa, located inland over southeastern Mexico, and on <br/>
Hurricane Martin, located over the central North Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
East of Bermuda:<br/>
A weak non-tropical area of low pressure located a few hundred <br/>
miles east of Bermuda continues to produce a few disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms. Any tropical or subtropical development <br/>
of this disturbance should be slow to occur during the next few days <br/>
as it moves slowly southward today and then turns westward by the <br/>
weekend. The system is forecast to merge with a larger low pressure <br/>
area developing to its southwest by the end of the weekend and <br/>
further development is not anticipated at that time.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
A large non-tropical low pressure system is expected to develop this <br/>
weekend across the northeastern Caribbean sea and southwestern <br/>
Atlantic. The system is expected to initially be very broad and <br/>
disorganized, but environmental conditions could support gradual <br/>
subtropical or tropical development beginning early next week while <br/>
it moves generally northwestward or westward over the southwestern <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

BULLETIN
Post-Tropical Cyclone Martin Advisory Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162022
900 PM GMT Thu Nov 03 2022
 
...POST-TROPICAL MARTIN CAUSING STRONG WINDS AND HAZARDOUS SEAS
ACROSS A LARGE PORTION OF THE CENTRAL NORTH ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM GMT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...50.5N 34.5W
ABOUT 940 MI...1510 KM NNW OF THE AZORES
ABOUT 885 MI...1425 KM ENE OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...80 MPH...130 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 20 DEGREES AT 58 MPH...93 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...950 MB...28.06 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Martin
was located near latitude 50.5 North, longitude 34.5 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the north-northeast near 58
mph (93 km/h). A slower northward to north-northwestward motion is 
expected tonight, followed by a much slower turn toward the east on 
Friday. An eastward to east-southeastward motion is then 
anticipated into the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Martin's peak sustained winds will slowly decrease over the 
next few days, but it will continue to produce strong winds over a 
very large area well into the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 520
miles (835 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 950 mb (28.06 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by post-tropical Martin will likely spread 
across a large portion of the high-latitude North Atlantic basin, 
affecting portions of Atlantic Canada, the Azores, and the Atlantic 
coast of Europe by the weekend. These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Martin Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162022
900 PM GMT Thu Nov 03 2022
 
ASCAT-C data that was not available until after the issuance of the 
last advisory, but was valid at 1317 UTC, showed that Martin likely 
became frontal earlier today and the system no longer has a 
well-defined circulation. In addition, both TAFB and SAB evaluated 
the system as extratropical at 1800 UTC. Therefore, Martin is now 
classified as post-tropical and this will be the last NHC advisory.
 
While Martin does not currently appear to have a well-defined 
center, the powerful post-tropical cyclone is expected to redevelop 
a well-defined center as it occludes over the next 12 to 24 h. 
Martin is moving at a remarkable clip of 50 kt, but should begin to 
slow down soon and turn north-northwestward during the next few 
hours. After that, the cyclone is forecast to move relatively slowly 
on Friday before picking up speed toward the east-southeast or east 
through the early weekend. Martin's maximum winds are still forecast 
to slowly decrease over the next few days, however the combination 
of Martin and other non-tropical low pressure systems are still 
expected to produce hazardous wind and seas over a very wide area of 
the North Atlantic for the next couple of days. 

Additional information on marine hazards can be found in High Seas 
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, the UK Met 
Office, and Meteo France. Links to each product are provided below.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Lisa was 
located near latitude 18.1 North, longitude 92.2 West. The 
depression is moving toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue through tonight followed by a 
turn toward the northwest on Friday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Lisa will continue to move over southeastern Mexico 
tonight, and move into the Bay of Campeche on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 30 mph (45 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast during the 
next day or two.  Lisa is not expected to re-intensify when the 
center reaches the Bay of Campeche.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  The rainfall threat associated with Lisa is expected to
continue to diminish through tonight.  Additional rainfall amounts
of 1 to 3 inches are possible across portions of southeastern
Mexico through tonight.

Tropical Depression Lisa Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
400 PM CDT Thu Nov 03 2022

Deep convection associated with Lisa has been diminishing on 
infrared satellite images, although the system still has nearly a 
closed ring of precipitation on the Sabancuy, Mexico, radar.  
Assuming that at least some weakening has occurred during the day, 
the current intensity estimate is set at 25 kt, which is above the 
few available surface observations.

Center position estimates from visible satellite images and radar 
indicate that Lisa continues to move generally westward, or at 
about 280/10 kt.  During the next day or two, the cyclone should 
gradually turn toward the northwest and north while moving along 
the southwestern and western side of a mid-level high pressure area. 
Around 48 hours and beyond, the shallow vortex is likely to move 
slowly and erratically with the near-surface environmental flow.  
The official track forecast remains close to the dynamical model 
consensus.

Strong south-southwesterly upper-level winds are expected to 
prevail across most of the Gulf of Mexico over the next few days.  
Therefore, even though the center of Lisa is forecast to soon move 
over the waters of the Bay of Campeche, high vertical shear is 
likely to prevent re-strengthening of the system.  The consensus of 
the numerical intensity guidance calls for weakening through 48 
hours, and the official forecast shows Lisa becoming a remnant low 
in a couple of days.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Isolated flash flooding is possible across portions of 
southeastern Mexico.
