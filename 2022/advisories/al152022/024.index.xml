Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Sat Nov 5 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems: <br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Lisa, located over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
A trough of low pressure located over the eastern Caribbean Sea is <br/>
forecast to move northward over the southwest Atlantic on Sunday <br/>
where a broad area of low pressure is expected to form north of <br/>
Hispaniola.  The system is initially expected to be very broad and <br/>
disorganized. However, it could begin to acquire subtropical or <br/>
tropical characteristics, and a subtropical or tropical depression <br/>
could form during the early to middle portion of next week while <br/>
the system moves generally westward to west-northwestward over the <br/>
southwestern Atlantic.  Regardless of development, there is an <br/>
increasing risk of coastal flooding, gale-force winds, heavy <br/>
rainfall, rough surf, and beach erosion along much of the <br/>
southeastern United States coast, the Florida east coast, and <br/>
portions of the central and northwestern Bahamas during the early <br/>
to middle part of next week.  The disturbance is also expected to <br/>
bring locally heavy rainfall to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands <br/>
this weekend.    <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic:<br/>
Showers and a few thunderstorms located several hundred miles east <br/>
of Bermuda are associated with a non-tropical area of low <br/>
pressure.  The circulation of the low has become better defined <br/>
since yesterday, and addition slow tropical or subtropical <br/>
development of this disturbance is possible during the next two to <br/>
three days.  After that time, the system is forecast to encounter <br/>
stronger upper-level winds and further development is not <br/>
anticipated.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

Remnants Of Lisa Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
1000 AM CDT Sat Nov 05 2022
 
Although the system continues to produce some limited bursts of
convection, visible satellite imagery shows that the circulation has
become weak and ill defined.  The system lacks a well-defined
center and has not had any significant organized deep convection
in about 24 hours, therefore this will be final advisory on Lisa.
The remnants are forecast to meander over the southwestern Gulf of
Mexico during the next day or two, but strong vertical wind shear
and dry mid-level air are expected to prevent any resurgence.
