DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lisa was
located near latitude 17.8 North, longitude 90.1 West. Lisa is
moving toward the west near 10 mph (17 km/h). This general motion
is expected to continue for the next day or so, bringing the center
of Lisa across northern Guatemala and southeastern Mexico. After
that time, a turn to the northwest and a decrease in forward speed
are expected as Lisa moves over the Bay of Campeche.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast while the 
center remains over land, and Lisa is expected to weaken to a 
tropical depression later today.  Lisa is not expected to 
re-intensify once the center reaches the Bay of Campeche.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread inland
during the next several hours over portions of northern Guatemala
and the southern Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico.

RAINFALL: Lisa is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 4 to 6
inches with local amounts to 10 inches across Belize, northern
Guatemala, the southern portion of the Mexican state of Quintana
Roo, southern and central Campeche, Tabasco, northern Chiapas, and
far eastern Veracruz.

This rainfall could lead to flash flooding conditions.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lisa are expected to affect portions of
Central America today before subsiding. These swells could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
