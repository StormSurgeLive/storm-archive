Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Thu Nov 3 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems: <br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Lisa, located inland over southeastern Mexico, and has <br/>
issued the last advisory on Post-Tropical Cyclone Martin, located <br/>
over the North Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
East-Southeast of Bermuda:<br/>
A weak non-tropical area of low pressure located several hundred <br/>
miles east-southeast of Bermuda is producing a few disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms well to the east of its center. Any <br/>
tropical or subtropical development of this disturbance should be <br/>
slow to occur during the next couple of days while it moves little <br/>
through Friday and then turns westward over the weekend. The system <br/>
is forecast to merge with a larger low pressure area developing to <br/>
its southwest by the end of the weekend, and further development is <br/>
not anticipated once this occurs.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
A large non-tropical low pressure system is expected to develop this <br/>
weekend across the northeastern Caribbean Sea and southwestern <br/>
Atlantic. The system is expected to initially be very broad and <br/>
disorganized, but environmental conditions could support gradual <br/>
subtropical or tropical development beginning early next week while <br/>
it moves generally northwestward or westward over the southwestern <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

BULLETIN
Post-Tropical Cyclone Martin Advisory Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162022
900 PM GMT Thu Nov 03 2022
 
...POST-TROPICAL MARTIN CAUSING STRONG WINDS AND HAZARDOUS SEAS
ACROSS A LARGE PORTION OF THE CENTRAL NORTH ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM GMT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...50.5N 34.5W
ABOUT 940 MI...1510 KM NNW OF THE AZORES
ABOUT 885 MI...1425 KM ENE OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...80 MPH...130 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 20 DEGREES AT 58 MPH...93 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...950 MB...28.06 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Martin
was located near latitude 50.5 North, longitude 34.5 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the north-northeast near 58
mph (93 km/h). A slower northward to north-northwestward motion is 
expected tonight, followed by a much slower turn toward the east on 
Friday. An eastward to east-southeastward motion is then 
anticipated into the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Martin's peak sustained winds will slowly decrease over the 
next few days, but it will continue to produce strong winds over a 
very large area well into the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 520
miles (835 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 950 mb (28.06 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by post-tropical Martin will likely spread 
across a large portion of the high-latitude North Atlantic basin, 
affecting portions of Atlantic Canada, the Azores, and the Atlantic 
coast of Europe by the weekend. These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Martin Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162022
900 PM GMT Thu Nov 03 2022
 
ASCAT-C data that was not available until after the issuance of the 
last advisory, but was valid at 1317 UTC, showed that Martin likely 
became frontal earlier today and the system no longer has a 
well-defined circulation. In addition, both TAFB and SAB evaluated 
the system as extratropical at 1800 UTC. Therefore, Martin is now 
classified as post-tropical and this will be the last NHC advisory.
 
While Martin does not currently appear to have a well-defined 
center, the powerful post-tropical cyclone is expected to redevelop 
a well-defined center as it occludes over the next 12 to 24 h. 
Martin is moving at a remarkable clip of 50 kt, but should begin to 
slow down soon and turn north-northwestward during the next few 
hours. After that, the cyclone is forecast to move relatively slowly 
on Friday before picking up speed toward the east-southeast or east 
through the early weekend. Martin's maximum winds are still forecast 
to slowly decrease over the next few days, however the combination 
of Martin and other non-tropical low pressure systems are still 
expected to produce hazardous wind and seas over a very wide area of 
the North Atlantic for the next couple of days. 

Additional information on marine hazards can be found in High Seas 
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, the UK Met 
Office, and Meteo France. Links to each product are provided below.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in eastern Mexico should continue to monitor the progress
of Lisa.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Lisa 
was located near latitude 18.1 North, longitude 93.1 West. The 
depression is moving toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h). A turn 
toward the west-northwest and northwest with a decrease in forward 
speed is expected on Friday and Friday night, and the depression is 
forecast to become nearly stationary and meander on Saturday and 
Saturday night. On the forecast track, the center of Lisa will move 
over the Bay of Campeche early Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Little change in strength is expected during the next couple of 
days, and Lisa is forecast to degenerate to a post-tropical remnant 
low on Saturday night and dissipate by Sunday night.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1009 mb (29.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  The rainfall threat associated with Lisa is expected to
continue to diminish. Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches
are possible across portions of southeastern Mexico through tonight.

Tropical Depression Lisa Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
1000 PM CDT Thu Nov 03 2022
 
Satellite imagery, radar data, and surface observations indicate the
center of Lisa is still inland over southeastern Mexico. The
precipitation associated with the depression has maintained some
organization in radar data from Sabancuy tonight. Showers and
thunderstorms wrap most of the way around the center, with some
fragmented outer bands noted around the northern portion of the
circulation offshore of southeastern Mexico. A couple of Pemex buoys
in this region have reported sustained winds of 20 kt or so during
the past few hours, and the initial intensity of the depression is
held at 25 kt for this advisory.
 
Lisa is still moving westward at 275/10 kt. A west-northwestward to
northwestward motion is expected on Friday and Friday night as
the cyclone moves around a low- to mid-level ridge. Then, the
models indicate the shallow vortex will likely stall and meander
within the weak low-level environmental flow over the southwestern
Gulf. The NHC track forecast is similar to the previous one and
remains near the multi-model consensus aids.
 
Although Lisa is forecast to emerge over the warm waters of the Bay 
of Campeche early Friday, strong south-southwesterly upper-level 
winds and drier mid-level air should inhibit any significant 
development. In fact, model-simulated satellite imagery from the GFS 
and ECMWF show all convection being stripped away from the center 
during the next 24-48 h by 25-30 kt of deep-layer shear. Therefore, 
the official intensity forecast keeps Lisa a depression, and it 
calls for the cyclone to become a remnant low in 48 h and dissipate 
on Sunday night.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Isolated flash flooding is possible across portions of 
southeastern Mexico.
