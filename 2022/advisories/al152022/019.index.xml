Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Fri Nov 4 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems: <br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Lisa, located inland over southeastern Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
East-Southeast of Bermuda:<br/>
A weak non-tropical area of low pressure located several hundred <br/>
miles east-southeast of Bermuda is producing a few disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms well to the east of its center. Any <br/>
tropical or subtropical development of this disturbance should be <br/>
slow to occur during the next couple of days while it moves little <br/>
through today and then turns westward over the weekend. The system <br/>
is forecast to merge with a larger low pressure area developing to <br/>
its southwest by the end of the weekend, and further development is <br/>
not anticipated once this occurs.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
A large non-tropical low pressure system is expected to develop this <br/>
weekend across the northeastern Caribbean Sea and southwestern <br/>
Atlantic. The system is expected to initially be very broad and <br/>
disorganized, but environmental conditions could support gradual <br/>
subtropical or tropical development beginning early next week while <br/>
it moves generally northwestward or westward over the southwestern <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.7N 94.0W
ABOUT 145 MI...230 KM W OF CIUDAD DEL CARMEN MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...30 MPH...45 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1008 MB...29.77 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in eastern Mexico should continue to monitor the progress
of Lisa.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Lisa was
located near latitude 18.7 North, longitude 94.0 West. The
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 10 mph       
(17 km/h). A turn toward the northwest with a decrease in forward 
speed is expected later today and tonight, and the depression is
forecast to become nearly stationary and meander on Saturday and
Saturday night. On the forecast track, the center of Lisa will move 
away from the coast of Mexico today.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Slight strengthening is possible during the next 24 hours.  
After that, Lisa is forecast to weaken and to degenerate into a 
remnant low pressure area by Sunday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  The rainfall threat associated with Lisa is expected to 
continue to diminish.  Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches 
are possible across portions of southeastern Mexico through early 
Friday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Depression Lisa Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
400 AM CDT Fri Nov 04 2022

Radar and satellite data indicates that the center of Lisa is now 
over water in the Bay of Campeche.  Satellite imagery shows that 
the convection has increased over the past several hours, 
particularly in a band just northeast of the center.  The initial 
intensity is held at 25 kt based mainly on data from a Mexican buoy 
to the northeast of the center.

The initial motion is now 290/9.  A turn toward the northwest is 
expected later today as the cyclone moves around a low- to 
mid-level ridge.  After that, the models indicate the shallow 
vortex will likely stall and meander southeastward within the weak 
low-level environmental flow over the southwestern Gulf.  There is 
little change to either the track guidance or the track forecast 
since the last advisory.

Although the center of Lisa is now over water, the cyclone is 
experiencing 20-25 kt of southerly shear.  The upper-level winds 
should become even less favorable during the next 48-72 h, and the 
cyclone is also expected to entrain some dry air.  Due to the 
current strong convection, some strengthening is forecast during 
the next 12 h, and it is not impossible for Lisa to regain 
tropical-storm strength during that time.  Thereafter, the 
upper-level winds and dry air should cause the system to weaken, 
with Lisa forecast to degenerate to a remnant low pressure area 
by 48 h and dissipate completely by 72 h.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Isolated flash flooding is possible across portions of 
southeastern Mexico.
