Tropical Storm Martin Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162022
500 PM AST Tue Nov 01 2022
 
Martin has a tight low-level center with a small central dense
overcast and some outer banding.  However, the deep convection
remains somewhat fragmentary, and the system may still have some
hybrid characteristics remaining. The subjective Dvorak estimates
from SAB and TAFB came in at a 3.0, or around 45 kt. Fortunately,
there's also some in-situ data from drifting buoy 44018, which just
reported a 993 mb surface pressure value close to the system's
center.  Based upon this, the central pressure is assessed at 991
mb and intensity is boosted slightly to 50 kt.
 
The tropical storm is moving a bit faster - 11 kt - toward the
east, as it is embedded in the mid-latitude westerlies in a split
in the jet stream with faster westerlies both poleward and
equatorward of the system.  Martin should turn toward the northeast
at an increasingly rapid forward speed during the next two days.
The official track forecast is based upon the consensus (TVCN and
HCCA) of the tightly clustered global and hurricane dynamical
models, and slightly to the right - eastward - of the previous
advisory at 60-72 hr. From days three to five, Martin should
decelerate as it interacts with a developing extratropical low to
its north.
 
For the intensity, the SSTs are a lukewarm 25-26C, which is a couple 
of degrees warmer than usual for this latitude.  This anomalous 
surface warmth along with quite cold upper-level temperatures should 
provide an unstable atmosphere. The mid-level moisture that Martin 
is currently embedded within is quite dry, but is expected to 
moisten up by tomorrow. The vertical shear is 20-25 kt out of the 
southwest, but the effects of this moderate shear are tempered by 
Martin moving in roughly the same direction as the shear vector. 
Within these generally conducive conditions, the system is expected 
to steadily intensify. The official intensity forecast is similar 
to that previously issued, and is based on a consensus of the 
statistical, global, and hurricane dynamical models.  Around 48 hr, 
Martin should transition into an extratropical low as a cold front 
reaches near the center of the system.  A significant change to the 
official forecast has Martin continuing now for five days as the 
new global models suggest that Martin will remain the dominant 
vortex and not be absorbed. It is expected that Martin will be a 
large and powerful extratropical system threatening the North 
Atlantic shipping lanes through days four and five.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lisa was
located near latitude 16.7 North, longitude 84.0 West. Lisa is
moving toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h). This general motion
with some decrease in forward speed is forecast during the next
couple of days. On the forecast track, the center of Lisa will move
near or over the Bay Islands of Honduras early Wednesday, move near
Belize late on Wednesday and over southeastern Mexico on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Further strengthening is expected, and Lisa is forecast to 
become a hurricane overnight over the northwestern Caribbean Sea and 
continue to intensify on Wednesday as it approaches Belize.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure of 996 mb (29.41 inches) is based on 
data from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the Bay Islands of
Honduras beginning early Wednesday and along the coast of Belize
Wednesday afternoon. Tropical storm conditions are expected to
begin along the northern coast of Honduras within the Tropical
Storm Warning area tonight and in Guatemala and Yucatan on
Wednesday. Hurricane conditions are possible in eastern Yucatan on
Wednesday afternoon.
 
RAINFALL: Through Thursday evening, Lisa is expected to produce
rainfall amounts of:
 
* 4 to 6 inches with local amounts to 10 inches across Belize, the
Bay Islands of Honduras, northern Guatemala and the southeast
portion of the Mexican state of Chiapas.
* 2 to 4 inches with local amounts to 6 inches across the far
southeastern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula, Northern Honduras,
and central Guatemala
* 1 inch with local amounts to 2 inches across portions of the
Cayman Islands and eastern Nicaragua.
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding conditions primarily
across Belize into northern Guatemala, the southeast portion of the
Mexican state of Chiapas and the far southeast portion of the
Yucatan peninsula.
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will likely raise water levels by as
much as 4 to 7 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate
coast of Belize in areas of onshore winds, with 2 to 4 feet
possible within the Hurricane Watch area in eastern Yucatan and 1
to 3 feet for the Bay Islands of Honduras. Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and damaging waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lisa are expected to affect Jamaica,
the Cayman Islands, and portions of Central America during the next 
couple of days. These swells could cause life-threatening surf and 
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local 
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Tropical Storm Lisa Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Tropical Storm Lisa Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
500 PM EDT Tue Nov 01 2022
 
Satellite images indicate that Lisa continues to become better 
organized with a central dense overcast feature forming along with 
more curved banding features.  Dvorak estimates have increased as 
well, and the current wind speed is set to 55 kt, closest to the 
TAFB fix and near an average of the available values.  Two Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft, an Air Force C-130 and a NOAA P-3, should be 
investigating Lisa this evening to get more in situ data. 

Conditions look ripe for continued intensification.  Other than some 
lingering dry air, Lisa is moving over very warm waters, in low 
shear, and has a small radius-of-maximum winds and an expanding 
outflow pattern.  These factors suggest a pretty notable chance of 
rapid intensification, and the SHIPS index shows basically a coin 
flip chance of a 25-kt wind speed increase within 24 hours.  
Additionally, the regional hurricane models HWRF and HMON show Lisa 
becoming a category 2 hurricane before landfall.  The new NHC 
forecast is similar to those models (note that further 
intensification is possible between the 24h forecast and Belize 
landfall) and a bit higher than the corrected-consensus guidance.  
 
Lisa continues moving just north of due west or 280/13 kt.  This 
westward track with some reduction in forward speed is anticipated 
due to the storm staying south of a ridge over the Gulf of Mexico.  
While the synoptic pattern is about the same as before, a 
vertically deeper Lisa is more likely to feel upper-level 
southeasterly flow and will probably not lose any latitude near 
landfall.  Thus, the latest forecast has been adjusted about 15-20 
n mi north of the previous one with the model guidance nudging in 
that direction.  

With the northward adjustment and a stronger cyclone in the 
forecast, more of the models are showing Lisa making it across 
Central America and Mexico as a weak tropical cyclone into the 
extreme southern Bay of Campeche on Friday.  Although the new NHC 
forecast now indicates this likelihood, Lisa isn't expected to 
be a significant event there due to stronger shear, and 
re-intensification is not indicated in the official forecast.  
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. There is potential for a life-threatening storm surge near where
the center of Lisa crosses the coast of Belize and for the southern
portions of the Yucatan Peninsula starting Wednesday afternoon.

2. Hurricane conditions are expected in the Bay Islands of Honduras
early Wednesday and along the coast of Belize by Wednesday 
afternoon.  Hurricane conditions are possible in eastern
Yucatan in the Hurricane Watch area Wednesday afternoon.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
north coast of Honduras and Guatemala beginning tonight into
Wednesday, and over the eastern Yucatan Peninsula in the Tropical
Storm Warning areas beginning Wednesday afternoon.
 
4. Localized flash flooding is expected across portions of Belize,
the Bay Islands of Honduras, northern Guatemala and the southeast
portion of the Mexican state of Chiapas starting tonight through
Thursday.
