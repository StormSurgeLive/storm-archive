* Grand Cayman Island
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the coast of Central America, especially
Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, should monitor the
progress of this system. Additional watches or warnings will likely
be required early this week.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the disturbance was centered near latitude
15.8 North, longitude 76.1 West.  The system is moving toward the
west near 12 mph (19 km/h), and a westward to west-northwestward
motion is expected over the next few days.  On the forecast track, 
the center will pass south of Jamaica and the Cayman Islands today 
and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
The system is expected to become a tropical storm later today.  
Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days and 
the system could be near hurricane strength by Wednesday.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch

RAINFALL: Through Thursday morning, the system is expected to
produce rainfall amounts of 1 inch, with local amounts to 2 inches
across portions of Hispaniola, the Cayman Islands, northern
Honduras, and eastern Nicaragua.  For Jamaica and Belize, rainfall
amounts of 2 to 4 inches are expected, with localized totals of 6
inches in Belize.  This rainfall could lead to flash flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the system are expected to affect
Jamaica and the Cayman Islands during the next couple of days.
These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.

Potential Tropical Cyclone Fifteen Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
500 AM EDT Mon Oct 31 2022

The system has changed little in organization overnight.  Deep 
convection is not very extensive at this time and convective banding 
features are rather limited, as evidenced by a Dvorak classification 
of T1.0 from TAFB.  Thus, the disturbance still lacks sufficient 
organized convection to be classified as a tropical cyclone.  
Observations from an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft and 
scatterometer data indicate that the circulation is somewhat 
elongated from south to north, and the maximum winds are 30-35 kt.  
Satellite images show that the broad center is located just to the 
west of the main area of deep convection.

The disturbance continues moving generally westward, or around 
270/10 kt.  A mid-level anticyclone to the north of the system 
should maintain a westward to west-northwestward track for the next 
48 hours or so.  Then, as the high shifts westward, the system is 
forecast to turn west-southwestward  when it nears the coast of 
Belize or eastern Yucatan.  The official track forecast is close to 
the model consensus and not much different from the previous NHC 
prediction.  It should be noted, however, that the the forecast
track could undergo some additional adjustments until the
circulation center becomes better defined.
 
It is expected that the system will acquire sufficient convective 
organization to make the transition to a tropical cyclone in 12 
hours or so.  During the next couple of days, the system/tropical 
cyclone will be traversing very warm waters and moving through a 
fairly moist air mass.  Also, the upper-level winds are forecast by 
the global models to become increasingly anticyclonic which should 
enhance the outflow over the area.  Therefore strengthening appears 
likely and the official forecast continues to call for hurricane 
status before landfall in Belize or the eastern Yucatan Peninsula.  
This is near or above the latest intensity consensus guidance.  


Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are possible within the Tropical Storm
Watch areas beginning today for Jamaica and on Tuesday for Grand
Cayman Island.
 
2. Interests along the coast of Central America, especially near
Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, should monitor the
progress of this system. Additional watches and warnings will
likely be required early this week.
