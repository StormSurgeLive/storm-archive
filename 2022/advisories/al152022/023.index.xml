Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Sat Nov 5 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems: <br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Lisa, located over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic:<br/>
A broad area of showers and a few thunderstorms located several <br/>
hundred miles east of Bermuda is associated with an non-tropical <br/>
area of low pressure.  Recent satellite wind data shows that the <br/>
circulation has become somewhat better defined, and addition slow <br/>
tropical or subtropical development of this disturbance is possible <br/>
during the next two to three days.  After that time, the system is <br/>
forecast to encounter stronger upper-level winds and further <br/>
development is not anticipated.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
A large non-tropical low pressure system is expected to develop <br/>
across the northeastern Caribbean Sea and southwestern Atlantic by <br/>
the latter part of the weekend. The system is initially expected to <br/>
be very broad and disorganized. However, it could begin to acquire <br/>
subtropical or tropical characteristics during the early part of <br/>
next week, and a subtropical or tropical depression could form <br/>
during the early to middle portion of next week while the system <br/>
moves generally westward to west-northwestward over the southwestern <br/>
Atlantic. Regardless of development, there is an increasing risk of <br/>
coastal flooding, gale-force winds, heavy rainfall, rough surf, and <br/>
beach erosion along much of the southeastern United States coast, <br/>
the Florida east coast, and portions of the central and northwestern <br/>
Bahamas during the early to middle part of next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Lisa Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
1000 PM CDT Fri Nov 04 2022
 
Lisa continues to barely hang on to tropical cyclone status this 
evening.  The broadening low-level circulation has a single burst of 
deep convection displaced well to the northeast of the center by 
strong south-southwesterly vertical wind shear.  The subjective 
satellite intensity estimates support an initial intensity of 25 kt. 
Environmental conditions are not expected to improve in the next 
couple of days. The global models forecast the mid-level environment 
to become drier and the vertical wind shear to strengthen further.  
Simulated satellite imagery shows the little remaining convection 
should collapse in less than 12 hours.  Therefore, the official 
intensity forecast now predicts Lisa will become a post-tropical 
cyclone by Saturday morning.
 
The depression appears to be moving slowly to the north at 3 kt. 
This decrease in forward motion seems to indicate that Lisa will not 
make as much northward progress before the low-level circulation 
stalls and drifts southward in about 12 hours or so.  The new track 
forecast now shows a turn to the south occurring sooner, similar to 
the corrected consensus aid guidance.
