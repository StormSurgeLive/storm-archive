SUMMARY OF 200 AM EDT...0600 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.8N 75.5W
ABOUT 175 MI...280 KM SSE OF KINGSTON JAMAICA
ABOUT 445 MI...720 KM ESE OF GRAND CAYMAN
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 270 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Jamaica
* Grand Cayman Island
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the coast of Central America, especially
Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, should monitor the
progress of this system. Additional watches or warnings will likely
be required early this week.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the disturbance was centered near latitude
15.8 North, longitude 75.5 West.  The system is moving toward the
west near 12 mph (19 km/h) and a westward to west-northwestward
motion is expected during the next several days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Slow strengthening is expected, and the system could become a 
tropical storm later today.  A faster rate of strengthening is 
expected starting tonight, and the system could be near hurricane 
strength Tuesday night or Wednesday.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent. 
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.  

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft observations is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area in Jamaica beginning this afternoon and are possible on Grand
Cayman Island on Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL:  Through Wednesday evening, the system is expected to
produce rainfall amounts of 1 inch, with local amounts to 2 inches
across portions of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola,
the Cayman Islands, northern Honduras, eastern Nicaragua, and
Belize.  For Jamaica, rainfall amounts of 2 inches with local
amounts of 4 inches are expected.  This degree of rainfall could
lead to flash flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the system are expected to affect
Jamaica and the Cayman Islands during the next couple of days.
These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM EDT.

<title>Potential Tropical Cyclone Fifteen Forecast Discussion Number 2</title>

Potential Tropical Cyclone Fifteen Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
1100 PM EDT Sun Oct 30 2022

Satellite imagery and data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate there has been little change in the structure of the 
disturbance this evening.  Satellite imagery shows that the 
low-level center is apparent in satellite imagery between two areas 
of disorganized convection to the northwest of a loosely-curved 
convective band.  The aircraft data shows that the circulation at 
460 mb is located to the southeast of the surface center and is not 
well defined at that level.  Dropsondes to the northeast of the 
center showed surface winds of 30 kt, and drops near the center 
suggest the central pressure is near 1005 mb.  Based on these data, 
the initial intensity remains 35 kt. 

The estimated initial motion is a little to the left of the 
previous advisory, 280/10 kt.  A general westward to 
west-northwestward motion is expected during the next 48 h or so 
due to the presence of a westward moving mid-level ridge north of 
the center.  After that time, the ridge should build a little 
faster toward the west and southwest, resulting in a south of west 
motion as the system approaches Belize or the Yucatan Peninsula of 
Mexico just after 72 h.  The forecast guidance has shifted 
southward through 60 h, and the new forecast track is nudged in 
that direction.  However, the new track lies to the north of the 
various consensus models.  It should be noted that the the forecast 
track could undergo some additional adjustments until the 
circulation center becomes better defined.

A combination of the current disorganized structure, moderate 
west-northwesterly shear, and weakly convergent upper-level flow 
should limit intensification for the next 12-24 h.  However, the 
system is still expected to become a tropical storm in about 12 h 
when the convection increases during the diurnal maximum.  After 24 
h, increased upper-level divergence, decreased shear, and better 
organization should allow a faster development rate, and the system 
is expected to steadily strengthen.  The new intensity forecast 
follows the previous forecast in calling for the system to become a 
hurricane before landfall in Belize or the Yucatan Peninsula, with a
forecast peak intensity of 70 kt being near the upper edge of the 
intensity guidance.

No changes to the current watches are required at this time.  A 
Tropical Storm Warning may be necessary for Jamaica Monday morning 
depending on the evolution of the track and the 34-kt wind radii.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are possible within the Tropical Storm
Watch areas beginning Monday for Jamaica and on Tuesday for Grand
Cayman Island.
 
2. Interests along the coast of Central America, especially near
Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, should monitor the 
progress of this system. Additional watches and warnings will 
likely be required early this week.
