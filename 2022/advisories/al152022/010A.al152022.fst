DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lisa was
located near latitude 17.1 North, longitude 85.4 West. Lisa is
moving toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h).  This general motion
with some decrease in forward speed is forecast during the next
couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of Lisa will move
near or over the Bay Islands of Honduras this morning, move near
Belize later today and over southeastern Mexico on Thursday.

Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Strengthening is expected, and Lisa is forecast 
to become a hurricane during the next several hours over the 
northwestern Caribbean Sea and continue to intensify today as it 
approaches Belize.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.

The minimum central pressure estimated from the Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft data is 994 mb (29.35 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the Bay Islands of
Honduras beginning this morning and along the coast of Belize and
the southeastern Yucatan this afternoon. Tropical storm conditions 
are expected to begin along the northern coast of Honduras within 
the Tropical Storm Warning this morning and in Guatemala and 
Yucatan later today.

RAINFALL: Lisa is expected to produce rainfall amounts of:

* 4 to 6 inches with local amounts to 10 inches across Belize, the
Bay Islands of Honduras, northern Guatemala and the eastern portion
of the Mexican state of Chiapas, and the Mexican state of Tabasco.
* 2 to 4 inches with local amounts to 6 inches across the far
southeastern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula, northern Honduras,
and central Guatemala.
* 1 inch with local amounts to 2 inches across portions of the
Cayman Islands and eastern Nicaragua.

This rainfall could lead to flash flooding conditions, primarily
across Belize into northern Guatemala, the far southeast portion of
the Yucatan peninsula, the eastern portion of the Mexican state of
Chiapas, and the Mexican state of Tabasco.

STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will likely raise water levels by as
much as 4 to 7 feet above normal tide levels near and to the north
of where the center of Lisa crosses the coast of Belize and
extreme southeastern portions of the Yucatan Peninsula.  Elsewhere,
a storm surge of 2 to 4 feet is possible within the Tropical Storm
Warning area in eastern Yucatan and 1 to 3 feet for the Bay Islands
of Honduras. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large
and damaging waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lisa are expected to affect Jamaica,
the Cayman Islands, and portions of Central America during the next
couple of days. These swells could cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
