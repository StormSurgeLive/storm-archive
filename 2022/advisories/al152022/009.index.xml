Tropical Storm Martin Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162022
1100 AM AST Tue Nov 01 2022
 
The occluded low over the central North Atlantic has developed deep
convection over its center, while the frontal boundaries have
become displaced a long distance to its east and north.  At
the same time, FSU Cyclone Phase Space analyses suggest that the
system has developed a non-frontal warm core.  Given these changes,
the system has evolved into a tropical cyclone. The ASCAT
scatterometer just observed the system and indicated that the
intensity is currently at 45 kt with a large area of
35 kt-plus winds. Thus the system is now a tropical storm and given
the name Martin.
 
The system is moving toward the east-northeast around 8 kt, as it
is embedded in the mid-latitude westerlies in a split in the jet
stream with faster westerlies both poleward and equatorward of the
system.  Martin should turn toward the northeast at an increasingly
rapid forward speed during the next two days.  The official track
forecast is based upon the consensus (TVCN and HCCA) of the tightly
clustered global and hurricane dynamical models. In about three
days, Martin should decelerate as it merges with a developing
extratropical low to its north.
 
For the intensity, even though the SSTs are a lukewarm 25C, the
upper-level temperatures are quite cold given that Martin is
embedded within a deep and vertically stacked cyclone. This
vertical temperature structure should enable deep convection
to continue, even while the mid-level moisture is only marginally
ample.  The vertical shear is 20-25 kt out of the southwest, but
the effects of this moderate shear are tempered by Martin moving in
the same direction as the shear vector.  Bottom line is that
despite the month being November, Martin is expected to develop into
a hurricane at high latitudes.  The official intensity prediction
steadily strengthens the system through 48 hr, which matches a
consensus of the statistical, global, and hurricane dynamical
models.  Around 48 hr, Martin should transition into a powerful
extratropical low as a cold front reaches near the center of the
system.  In about three days, post-tropical Martin should be
merging with an developing extratropical system to its north but
still be containing hurricane-force winds.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lisa was
located near latitude 16.7 North, longitude 83.3 West. Lisa is
moving toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h). This general motion 
with some decrease in forward speed is forecast during the next 
couple of days. On the forecast track, the center of Lisa will move 
near or over the Bay Islands of Honduras early Wednesday, move 
near Belize late on Wednesday and over southeastern Mexico on 
Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Further strengthening is expected, and Lisa is 
forecast to become a hurricane overnight over the northwestern 
Caribbean Sea and continue to intensify on Wednesday as it 
approaches Belize.  
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the Bay Islands of
Honduras beginning early Wednesday and along the coast of Belize
Wednesday afternoon. Tropical storm conditions are expected to
begin along the northern coast of Honduras within the Tropical
Storm Warning area tonight and in Guatemala and Yucatan on
Wednesday. Hurricane conditions are possible in eastern Yucatan on
Wednesday afternoon.
 
RAINFALL: Through Thursday evening, Lisa is expected to produce
rainfall amounts of:
 
* 4 to 6 inches with local amounts to 10 inches across Belize, the
Bay Islands of Honduras, northern Guatemala and the southeast
portion of the Mexican state of Chiapas.
* 2 to 4 inches with local amounts to 6 inches across the far
southeastern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula, Northern Honduras,
and central Guatemala
* 1 inch with local amounts to 2 inches across portions of the
Cayman Islands and eastern Nicaragua.
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding conditions primarily
across Belize into northern Guatemala, the southeast portion of the
Mexican state of Chiapas and the far southeast portion of the
Yucatan peninsula.
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will likely raise water levels by as
much as 4 to 7 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate
coast of Belize in areas of onshore winds, with 2 to 4 feet
possible within the Hurricane Watch area in eastern Yucatan and 1
to 3 feet for the Bay Islands of Honduras. Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and damaging waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lisa are expected to affect Jamaica,
the Cayman Islands and Central America during the next couple of 
days. These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Tropical Storm Lisa Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Tropical Storm Lisa Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
500 PM EDT Tue Nov 01 2022
 
Satellite images indicate that Lisa continues to become better 
organized with a central dense overcast feature forming along with 
more curved banding features.  Dvorak estimates have increased as 
well, and the current wind speed is set to 55 kt, closest to the 
TAFB fix and near an average of the available values.  Two Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft, an Air Force C-130 and a NOAA P-3, should be 
investigating Lisa this evening to get more in situ data. 

Conditions look ripe for continued intensification.  Other than some 
lingering dry air, Lisa is moving over very warm waters, in low 
shear, and has a small radius-of-maximum winds and an expanding 
outflow pattern.  These factors suggest a pretty notable chance of 
rapid intensification, and the SHIPS index shows basically a coin 
flip chance of a 25-kt wind speed increase within 24 hours.  
Additionally, the regional hurricane models HWRF and HMON show Lisa 
becoming a category 2 hurricane before landfall.  The new NHC 
forecast is similar to those models (note that further 
intensification is possible between the 24h forecast and Belize 
landfall) and a bit higher than the corrected-consensus guidance.  
 
Lisa continues moving just north of due west or 280/13 kt.  This 
westward track with some reduction in forward speed is anticipated 
due to the storm staying south of a ridge over the Gulf of Mexico.  
While the synoptic pattern is about the same as before, a 
vertically deeper Lisa is more likely to feel upper-level 
southeasterly flow and will probably not lose any latitude near 
landfall.  Thus, the latest forecast has been adjusted about 15-20 
n mi north of the previous one with the model guidance nudging in 
that direction.  

With the northward adjustment and a stronger cyclone in the 
forecast, more of the models are showing Lisa making it across 
Central America and Mexico as a weak tropical cyclone into the 
extreme southern Bay of Campeche on Friday.  Although the new NHC 
forecast now indicates this likelihood, Lisa isn't expected to 
be a significant event there due to stronger shear, and 
re-intensification is not indicated in the official forecast.  
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. There is potential for a life-threatening storm surge near where
the center of Lisa crosses the coast of Belize and for the southern
portions of the Yucatan Peninsula starting Wednesday afternoon.

2. Hurricane conditions are expected in the Bay Islands of Honduras
early Wednesday and along the coast of Belize by Wednesday 
afternoon.  Hurricane conditions are possible in eastern
Yucatan in the Hurricane Watch area Wednesday afternoon.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
north coast of Honduras and Guatemala beginning tonight into
Wednesday, and over the eastern Yucatan Peninsula in the Tropical
Storm Warning areas beginning Wednesday afternoon.
 
4. Localized flash flooding is expected across portions of Belize,
the Bay Islands of Honduras, northern Guatemala and the southeast
portion of the Mexican state of Chiapas starting tonight through
Thursday.
