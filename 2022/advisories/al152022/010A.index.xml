Tropical Storm Martin Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162022
1100 PM AST Tue Nov 01 2022
 
Deep convection is gradually increasing near the center of Martin 
and banding features are becoming better established on the system's 
north side. Even though the core of Martin looks tropical in nature, 
the storm still has some subtropical characteristics with frontal 
features nearby. The latest Dvorak estimates were unchanged from 
earlier, so the initial wind speed remains 50 kt for this advisory.
 
Martin is moving just south of due east, with the latest initial 
motion estimated to be 100/9 kt. The storm should begin to turn 
northeastward on Wednesday as a mid- to upper-level trough currently 
off the northeast U.S. approaches the system. A stronger mid- to 
upper-level trough near Atlantic Canada should help accelerate 
Martin northeastward by Wednesday night and Thursday before this 
trough interacts and merges with the storm Thursday night and 
Friday. After the two systems merge, Martin will likely slow down 
and move eastward over the northeastern Atlantic. Little change was 
made to the previous track forecast during the first 72 hours, but 
notable eastward adjustments were made at days 4 and 5 to be in 
better agreement with the latest model guidance.
 
Although Martin is over relatively cool 25 degree C waters and 
headed over even cooler SSTs during the next couple of days, 
unstable conditions and upper-level diffluence along with 
non-tropical forcing should cause significant strengthening during 
the next day or two. Martin is forecast to become a powerful 
extratropical low in about 36 hours when it merges with the strong 
trough off Atlantic Canada. After that time, the models show a slow 
weakening trend. The NHC intensity forecast is in line with the 
majority of the guidance and is fairly similar to the previous 
forecast.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lisa was
located near latitude 17.1 North, longitude 85.4 West. Lisa is
moving toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h).  This general motion
with some decrease in forward speed is forecast during the next
couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of Lisa will move
near or over the Bay Islands of Honduras this morning, move near
Belize later today and over southeastern Mexico on Thursday.
 
Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Strengthening is expected, and Lisa is forecast 
to become a hurricane during the next several hours over the 
northwestern Caribbean Sea and continue to intensify today as it 
approaches Belize.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from the Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft data is 994 mb (29.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the Bay Islands of
Honduras beginning this morning and along the coast of Belize and
the southeastern Yucatan this afternoon. Tropical storm conditions 
are expected to begin along the northern coast of Honduras within 
the Tropical Storm Warning this morning and in Guatemala and 
Yucatan later today.
 
RAINFALL: Lisa is expected to produce rainfall amounts of:
 
* 4 to 6 inches with local amounts to 10 inches across Belize, the
Bay Islands of Honduras, northern Guatemala and the eastern portion
of the Mexican state of Chiapas, and the Mexican state of Tabasco.
* 2 to 4 inches with local amounts to 6 inches across the far
southeastern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula, northern Honduras,
and central Guatemala.
* 1 inch with local amounts to 2 inches across portions of the
Cayman Islands and eastern Nicaragua.
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding conditions, primarily
across Belize into northern Guatemala, the far southeast portion of
the Yucatan peninsula, the eastern portion of the Mexican state of
Chiapas, and the Mexican state of Tabasco.
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will likely raise water levels by as
much as 4 to 7 feet above normal tide levels near and to the north
of where the center of Lisa crosses the coast of Belize and
extreme southeastern portions of the Yucatan Peninsula.  Elsewhere,
a storm surge of 2 to 4 feet is possible within the Tropical Storm
Warning area in eastern Yucatan and 1 to 3 feet for the Bay Islands
of Honduras. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large
and damaging waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lisa are expected to affect Jamaica,
the Cayman Islands, and portions of Central America during the next
couple of days. These swells could cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.

Tropical Storm Lisa Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
1100 PM EDT Tue Nov 01 2022
 
Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunters have found that Lisa is 
strengthening this evening.  Lisa is a small storm, with 
tropical-storm-force winds only extending out to 60 n mi from the 
center.  The minimum central pressure continues to fall, and the 
latest estimate from the dropsonde observations is 993 mb.  Data 
from the SFMR and Tail Doppler Radar show that surface or 
near-surface winds range between 55 to 60 kt, and the initial 
intensity is increased to 60 kt.

Lisa is on a strengthening trend.  Models suggest atmospheric and 
oceanic conditions should be conducive for additional 
intensification until the storm makes landfall in Belize within 24 
hours.  Therefore, steady to rapid intensification is still 
possible.  The official forecast shows a peak of 75 kt in 12 hours, 
however the true peak intensity will likely occur between 12 and 24 
hours and could be higher. Rapid weakening is expected after the 
storm moves inland, and Lisa is forecast to be a tropical depression 
in the Bay of Campeche in 72 to 96 hours and weaken to a remnant low 
by the end of the forecast period.

The storm is moving just north of west at 280/13 kt.  The track 
reasoning is unchanged.  A ridge to the north will continue to steer 
Lisa westward at a slightly reduced forward speed through landfall 
on Wednesday evening.  The storm is expected to follow the flow 
around the low-to-mid level ridge into the Bay of Campeche in 3 days 
or so.  The cyclone is then expected to turn southward in the 
low-level flow.  The NHC track forecast is shifted slightly 
northward from the previous advisory in the short term, and the 
Hurricane and Tropical Storm Warnings have been adjusted northward 
to account for this shift.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. There is potential for a life-threatening storm surge near where
the center of Lisa crosses the coast of Belize and extreme 
southeastern portions of the Yucatan Peninsula starting 
Wednesday afternoon.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are expected in the Bay Islands of Honduras
early Wednesday and along the coast of Belize and southeastern 
Yucatan by Wednesday afternoon.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
north coast of Honduras and Guatemala beginning early Wednesday, 
and over the eastern Yucatan Peninsula in the Tropical
Storm Warning areas beginning Wednesday afternoon.
 
4. Localized flash flooding is expected across portions of Belize, 
the Bay Islands of Honduras, northern Guatemala, the southeastern 
portion of the Mexican state of Chiapas, and the Mexican state of 
Tabasco.
