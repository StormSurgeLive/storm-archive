Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Fri Nov 4 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems: <br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Lisa, located over the Bay of Campeche.<br/>
<br/>
East-Southeast of Bermuda:<br/>
A weak non-tropical area of low pressure located several hundred <br/>
miles east-southeast of Bermuda continues to produce an area of <br/>
showers and thunderstorms, mostly well to the east of its center.  <br/>
Any tropical or subtropical development of this disturbance should <br/>
be slow to occur during the next day or so while it moves westward <br/>
or west-northwestward over the weekend. The system is forecast to <br/>
interact with a larger low pressure area developing to its southwest <br/>
and will encounter stronger upper level winds on Saturday, so <br/>
further development is not anticipated beyond that time.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
A large non-tropical low pressure system is expected to develop <br/>
across the northeastern Caribbean Sea and southwestern Atlantic by <br/>
the latter part of the weekend. The system is initially expected be <br/>
very broad and disorganized, but it could begin to acquire <br/>
subtropical or tropical characteristics during the early part next <br/>
week. Environmental conditions could support additional gradual <br/>
development and a subtropical or tropical depression could form <br/>
during the early to middle portion of next week while the system <br/>
moves generally northwestward or westward over the southwestern <br/>
Atlantic.  Regardless of development, there is an increasing risk of <br/>
coastal flooding, gale-force winds, heavy rainfall, rough surf, and <br/>
beach erosion along much of the southeastern United States coast, <br/>
the Florida east coast, and portions of the central and <br/>
northwestern Bahamas during the early to middle part of next <br/>
week. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Lisa Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
400 PM CDT Fri Nov 04 2022
 
Deep convection that was associated with Lisa this morning has 
quickly weakened and become displaced well to the northeast of the 
center due strong south-southwesterly vertical wind shear.  Earlier 
satellite wind data and more recent observations from an Air Force 
Reserve reconnaissance aircraft indicate that the overnight and 
morning convective burst did not result in any increase in strength. 
 Data from the aircraft and the scatterometer instrument suggest 
that Lisa's maximum winds are around 25 kt.  Since the shear is 
forecast to increase further and the mid-level humidity near the 
cyclone is expected to decrease, additional weakening is 
anticipated.  It is possible that some additional bursts of 
convection will occur in association with Lisa tonight and early 
Saturday, but those bursts are not likely to result in a return of 
organized deep convection.  Therefore, Lisa is forecast to become a 
post-tropical remnant low within 24 hours, but this could occur as 
early as tonight if convection does not re-develop soon. 

Lisa was located a bit farther north and west of the previous 
estimates, which has resulted in an adjustment to the initial 
position and short-term forecast.  Now that Lisa has become 
vertically shallow it is expected to move slowly northward 
tonight.  It should then stall and begin a southward drift over 
the weekend before dissipation occurs. The new track forecast is 
west of the previous track and is a blend of the latest GFS and 
ECMWF model forecasts.
