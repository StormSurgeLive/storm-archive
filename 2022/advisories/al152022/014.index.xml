At 300 AM GMT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Martin was located 
near latitude 39.4 North, longitude 44.9 West. Martin is moving 
toward the northeast near 39 mph (63 km/h).  A turn to the north

Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Martin should get larger and stronger tonight and Thursday 
when it transitions to large and powerful post-tropical cyclone. 
After that time, the cyclone is forecast to gradually lose strength 
through the weekend, but remain very large.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles

Hurricane Martin Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162022
300 AM GMT Thu Nov 03 2022
 
Martin remains in impressive high-latitude late-season hurricane.
Recent infrared satellite imagery shows deep convection wrapping
around a ragged eye.  The hurricane's cloud shield has begun
expanding over the northern and northwestern portions of the storm
suggesting that the system's extratropical transition is beginning.
Subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB range from
65 to 77 kt, and the initial wind speed will remain on the higher
end of those estimates at 75 kt.
 
The global model guidance indicates that Martin will strengthen
tonight and early Thursday as it transforms into an extratropical
cyclone.  That transition is expected to be complete by about
1800 UTC on Thursday.  The guidance continues to depict a very
strong sting-jet-like feature around the southern and southwestern
portions of the storm, and the NHC forecast therefore calls for
some strengthening during the next 12 hours or so.  Martin's wind
field is also forecast to rapidly expand in size during the next
day or so, and this is reflected in the wind radii forecast.  The
baroclinic forcing should begin to decrease by late tomorrow, with
gradual weakening occurring after that time, however Martin is
forecast to remain a very large and powerful cyclone over the North
Atlantic for the next several days.
 
Martin continues to accelerate, and it is now moving northeastward
at about 34 kt. A faster north-northeastward motion is expected
overnight, followed by northward turn on Thursday as Martin moves
around the eastern side of a strong deep-layer trough.  The trough
is forecast to capture Martin by 36 hours, and the merged system is
expected to slow down considerably, and then turn eastward in the
mid-latitude flow.  The updated track forecast is slightly faster
during the first 24 hours, but little change was required
thereafter.  The forecast is a blend of mostly the GFS and ECMWF
global model guidance.

BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Lisa Advisory Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
1000 PM CDT Wed Nov 02 2022
 
...LISA BRINGING HEAVY RAIN AND GUSTY WINDS TO BELIZE,
NORTHERN GUATEMALA, AND SOUTHEASTERN MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1000 PM CDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.6N 89.1W
ABOUT 60 MI...95 KM W OF BELIZE CITY
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 280 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...995 MB...29.38 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has changed the Hurricane Warning to a
Tropical Storm Warning from Chetumal to Puerto Costa Maya, and
discontinued the Tropical Storm Warning north of Puerto Costa 
Maya.  

The government of Belize has changed the Hurricane Warning to a 
Tropical Storm Warning for the coast of Belize.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* The coast of Belize
* Chetumal to Puerto Costa Maya, Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests elsewhere in Central America and the Yucatan Peninsula of
Mexico should monitor the progress of Lisa.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lisa was
located inland near latitude 17.6 North, longitude 89.1 West. Lisa 
is moving toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h). This general motion
is expected to continue for the next day or so, bringing the center
of Lisa across Belize, northern Guatemala, and southeastern Mexico.
After that time, a turn to the northwest and a decrease in forward
speed are expected as Lisa moves over the Bay of Campeche.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Rapid weakening will continue while the center
of Lisa moves farther inland.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.38 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread inland 
through tonight over portions of Belize, northern Guatemala, and 
the southern Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. 
 
RAINFALL: Lisa is expected to produce rainfall amounts of:
 
4 to 6 inches with local amounts to 10 inches across Belize,
northern Guatemala, the southern portion of the Mexican state of
Quintana Roo, southern Campeche, Tabasco, northern Chiapas, and far
eastern Veracruz.
 
2 to 4 inches with local amounts to 6 inches across the far
southeastern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula, the Bay Islands of
Honduras, central Guatemala and south-central Campeche.
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding conditions, primarily
across Belize into northern Guatemala, the far southeast portion of
the Yucatan peninsula, the southern portion of the Mexican state of
Campeche, Tabasco, northern Chiapas and far eastern Veracruz.
 
STORM SURGE:  Water levels along the coast of Belize may remain 
elevated by as much as 1 to 3 feet above normal tide levels 
through the night in areas of onshore winds within the Tropical 
Storm Warning area.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lisa are expected to affect portions of
Central America during the next day or so. These swells could
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 AM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

Tropical Storm Lisa Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
1000 PM CDT Wed Nov 02 2022
 
Satellite and radar imagery showed Lisa made landfall earlier 
this evening around 2120 UTC southwest of Belize City.  The maximum 
sustained winds and minimum central pressure were estimated to be 
75 kt and 990 mb, respectively.  The storm has moved farther inland 
and the initial intensity has been reduced to 50 kt based on a
standard inland decay rate.  Rapid weakening is expected to 
continue overnight and into tomorrow due to land interaction and 
Lisa is forecast to be a tropical depression on Thursday.  Even 
though the cyclone is expected to emerge over the Bay of Campeche 
in a couple of days, strong southwesterly vertical wind shear will 
likely prevent intensification.  The NHC intensity forecast remains 
largely unchanged from the previous advisory and still shows Lisa 
dissipating by the end of the forecast period.

Lisa is moving westward at an estimated 10 kt.  This general motion 
is expected to continue for the next day or so until the storm 
crosses over the Bay of Campeche.  The cyclone is then forecast to 
turn to the northwest and slow in forward speed, eventually 
stalling between 60 to 72 hours until the low-level flow turns 
Lisa southward.  The official track forecast is very similar to the 
previous advisory and close to the various consensus aids.

Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall and flash flooding is expected across portions 
of Belize, northern Guatemala, and portions of southeastern Mexico 
during the next day or so. 

2. Water levels are likely to remain elevated in areas of onshore 
flow along the coast of Belize overnight.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread inland over 
Belize, northern Guatemala, southern portions of the Yucatan 
peninsula of Mexico overnight.
