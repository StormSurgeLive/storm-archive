DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lisa was located
near latitude 17.3 North, longitude 87.7 West.  Lisa is moving
toward the west near 14 mph (22 km/h).  This general motion with a
gradual turn toward the west-northwest and some decrease in forward
speed is forecast during the next couple of days.  On the forecast
track, the center of Lisa will make landfall in Belize later this 
afternoon, and then cross northern Guatemala and move into 
southeastern Mexico by Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Some strengthening is still possible before landfall.
Rapid weakening will occur after the center of Lisa moves inland.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70
miles (110 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected along the coast of Belize
and the southeastern Yucatan peninsula later this afternoon.  
Tropical storm conditions are expected during the next few hours 
over portions of the Bay Islands and along the northern coast 
of Honduras within the Tropical Storm Warning area, and in portions 
of Guatemala and Yucatan later this afternoon.

RAINFALL: Lisa is expected to produce rainfall amounts of:

4 to 6 inches with local amounts to 10 inches across Belize,
northern Guatemala, the southern portion of the Mexican state of
Quintana Roo. southern Campeche, Tabasco, northern Chiapas, and far
eastern Veracruz.

2 to 4 inches with local amounts to 6 inches across the far
southeastern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula, the Bay Islands of
Honduras, central Guatemala and south-central Campeche.

This rainfall could lead to flash flooding conditions, primarily
across Belize into northern Guatemala, the far southeast portion of
the Yucatan peninsula, the southern portion of the Mexican state of
Campeche, Tabasco, northern Chiapas and far eastern Veracruz.

STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will likely raise water levels by as
much as 4 to 7 feet above normal tide levels near and to the north
of where the center of Lisa crosses the coast of Belize and
extreme southeastern portions of the Yucatan Peninsula.  Elsewhere,
a storm surge of 1 to 3 feet is possible within the Tropical Storm
Warning area in eastern Yucatan and up to 1 foot for the Bay 
Islands of Honduras. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied 
by large and damaging waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lisa are expected to affect portions of 
Central America during the next day or two. These swells could 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
