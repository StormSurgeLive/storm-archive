<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems: <br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
upgraded Tropical Storm Lisa, located over the central Caribbean <br/>
Sea.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic:<br/>
A non-tropical area of low pressure is located about 300 miles <br/>
northeast of Bermuda. Recent satellite wind data indicates that the <br/>
low, while it is attached to a frontal boundary to the north, also <br/>
has a small core with gale-force winds and a concentrated area of <br/>
showers and thunderstorms near the center. This system has a small <br/>
window for some additional subtropical or tropical development <br/>
before it is forecast to be absorbed by a larger extratropical low <br/>
in 2-3 days while it moves east-northeastward. For more information <br/>
on this system, including Gale Warnings, see High Seas Forecasts <br/>
issued by the National Weather Service.  <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Honduras has issued a Hurricane Watch and a 
Tropical Storm Warning for the Bay Islands of Honduras, plus a 
Tropical Storm Watch for the entire north coast of the country.
 
The government of Belize has issued a Hurricane Watch for the
entire coast of Belize from north of Puerto Barrios Guatemala
northward to south of Chetumal Mexico.
 
The government of Guatemala has issued a Tropical Storm Watch for 
the Caribbean coast of Guatemala from the border with Honduras 
westward to Puerto Barrios.
 
The government of Mexico has issued a Tropical Storm Watch for
Mexico from Chetumal to Punta Herrero.
 
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Bay Islands
* Belize coast from north of Puerto Barrios to south of Chetumal
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bay Islands
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Jamaica
* Entire north coast of Honduras
* Guatemala from border with Honduras to Puerto Barrios
* Mexico from Chetumal to Punta Herrero.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Central America and the Yucatan Peninsula of
Mexico should monitor the progress of Lisa.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lisa was 
located near latitude 15.5 North, longitude 78.4 West. Lisa is 
moving toward the west near 14 mph (22 km/h), and a westward to 
west-northwestward motion is expected over the next few days.  On 
the forecast track, the center will pass south of Jamaica today, 
south of the Cayman Islands tomorrow, then move near or over the Bay 
Islands of Honduras early on Wednesday and approach Belize later on 
Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Slow strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and 
Lisa is forecast to become a hurricane on Wednesday over the 
northwestern Caribbean Sea.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible in the Bay Islands of 
Honduras beginning early Wednesday and are possible along the coast 
of Belize on Wednesday afternoon.  Tropical storm conditions are 
possible on Jamaica today.  Tropical storm conditions are possible 
on the coast of Honduras beginning Tuesday night through Wednesday. 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the Tropical Storm Watch 
area in Mexico, Honduras, and Guatemala Wednesday afternoon. 
 
RAINFALL: Through Thursday evening, Lisa is expected to produce 
rainfall amounts of:

* 3 to 5 inches with local amounts to 8 inches across portions 
of Belize and the Bay Islands of Honduras.  
* 2 to 4 inches with local amounts to 6 inches across portions 
of Northern Honduras, Jamaica, Guatemala and the eastern Yucatan 
peninsula.
* 1 inch with local amounts to 2 inches across portions of the 
Cayman Islands, eastern Nicaragua.

This rainfall could produce flash floods from northern Honduras 
northward to the eastern Yucatan Peninsula.
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3 
to 5 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast of 
Belize in areas of onshore winds and 1 to 3 feet for the Bay Islands 
of Honduras. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large 
and damaging waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lisa are expected to affect Jamaica and
the Cayman Islands during the next couple of days, and begin to
affect Central America tomorrow. These swells could cause life-
threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM EDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Lisa Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>
<description>Issued at 1100 AM EDT Mon Oct 31 2022  <![CDATA[<pre>

Tropical Storm Lisa Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
1100 AM EDT Mon Oct 31 2022
 
GOES-16 1-minute visible imagery indicates that the low-level 
circulation of the system has closed off again, although the system 
is still a bit elongated north-to-south.  Westerly shear has caused 
the center to be exposed to the west and north of the primary 
convective banding features.  NOAA Hurricane Hunter tail Doppler 
radar data also show that the low is tilted southeastward with 
height, a reflection of the current shear.  Still, the plane had 
numerous SFMR values of around 35 kt, and dropsonde data showed the 
pressure has dropped to 1003 mb.  These values are sufficient to 
call the system a tropical storm with an initial wind speed of 35 
kt.
 
After a dip southward overnight, Lisa is moving westward again at
about 12 kt.  The storm should move westward to west-northwestward
for the next day or two under a mid-level ridge to the north.  As
the ridge intensifies in a few days, Lisa is likely to move
westward, or possibly a little south-of-west, while it approaches
Belize.  Model guidance remains in very good agreement, and 
only a small southward adjustment was made to the previous forecast.
 
Lisa should encounter more conducive atmospheric and oceanic 
conditions for the next few days, with increasing mid-level 
humidities and generally lower shear.  The storm will likely still 
have some bouts with drier air infiltrating in the northwestern 
quadrant of the circulation, but the diminishing shear should lessen 
the impact of this factor.  Thus slow intensification is shown for 
the next few days, consistent with the interpolated previous 
forecast.  It should be noted that the new NHC forecast is on the 
high side of the guidance for this cycle, with a notable decrease of 
the forecast intensity in many of the models.  The official 
forecast is lower than the previous one, owing to the model trend, 
but it is preferable to wait another cycle to make any larger 
changes after the model suite ingests the plentiful aircraft data 
for the 12 UTC suite.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Jamaica today.
 
2. Interests along the coast of Central America, especially near
Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, should monitor the
progress of this system. Additional watches and warnings will
likely be required by late today.
