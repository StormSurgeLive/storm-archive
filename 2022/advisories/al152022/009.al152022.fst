DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lisa was
located near latitude 16.7 North, longitude 83.3 West. Lisa is
moving toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h). This general motion 
with some decrease in forward speed is forecast during the next 
couple of days. On the forecast track, the center of Lisa will move 
near or over the Bay Islands of Honduras early Wednesday, move 
near Belize late on Wednesday and over southeastern Mexico on 
Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Further strengthening is expected, and Lisa is 
forecast to become a hurricane overnight over the northwestern 
Caribbean Sea and continue to intensify on Wednesday as it 
approaches Belize.  

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the Bay Islands of
Honduras beginning early Wednesday and along the coast of Belize
Wednesday afternoon. Tropical storm conditions are expected to
begin along the northern coast of Honduras within the Tropical
Storm Warning area tonight and in Guatemala and Yucatan on
Wednesday. Hurricane conditions are possible in eastern Yucatan on
Wednesday afternoon.

RAINFALL: Through Thursday evening, Lisa is expected to produce
rainfall amounts of:

* 4 to 6 inches with local amounts to 10 inches across Belize, the
Bay Islands of Honduras, northern Guatemala and the southeast
portion of the Mexican state of Chiapas.
* 2 to 4 inches with local amounts to 6 inches across the far
southeastern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula, Northern Honduras,
and central Guatemala
* 1 inch with local amounts to 2 inches across portions of the
Cayman Islands and eastern Nicaragua.

This rainfall could lead to flash flooding conditions primarily
across Belize into northern Guatemala, the southeast portion of the
Mexican state of Chiapas and the far southeast portion of the
Yucatan peninsula.

STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will likely raise water levels by as
much as 4 to 7 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate
coast of Belize in areas of onshore winds, with 2 to 4 feet
possible within the Hurricane Watch area in eastern Yucatan and 1
to 3 feet for the Bay Islands of Honduras. Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and damaging waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lisa are expected to affect Jamaica,
the Cayman Islands and Central America during the next couple of 
days. These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
