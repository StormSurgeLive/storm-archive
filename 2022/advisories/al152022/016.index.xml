Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Thu Nov 3 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems: <br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Lisa, located inland over southeastern Mexico, and on <br/>
Hurricane Martin, located over the central North Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Atlantic:<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms are associated with a weak <br/>
non-tropical area of low pressure located a few hundred miles east <br/>
of Bermuda. Environmental conditions are expected to be marginally <br/>
conducive for slow subtropical or tropical development of this <br/>
system during the next few days as it moves slowly southward today <br/>
and then turns westward by the weekend. The disturbance is expected <br/>
to merge with a larger system developing to its southwest by the <br/>
end of the weekend and further development is not anticipated at <br/>
that time.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
A large non-tropical low pressure system is expected to develop this <br/>
weekend over the northeastern Caribbean sea and southwestern <br/>
Atlantic. The system is expected to initially be very broad and <br/>
disorganized, but environmental conditions could support gradual <br/>
subtropical or tropical development beginning early next week while <br/>
it moves generally northward or northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162022
300 PM GMT Thu Nov 03 2022
 
...LARGE AND POWERFUL MARTIN FORECAST TO BECOME POST-TROPICAL OVER
THE CENTRAL NORTH ATLANTIC WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM GMT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...45.6N 37.9W
ABOUT 765 MI...1235 KM NW OF THE AZORES
ABOUT 730 MI...1175 KM E OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...85 MPH...140 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 35 DEGREES AT 48 MPH...78 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...960 MB...28.35 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Martin was located
near latitude 45.6 North, longitude 37.9 West. Martin is moving
toward the northeast near 48 mph (78 km/h). A turn toward the north 
at a slightly slower forward speed is expected this evening. 
Martin's forward motion is forecast to slow down substantially on 
Friday. A general east to east-southeastward motion is then 
forecast by Friday night, which will likely continue through the 
weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts. Martin is forecast to become a very powerful post-tropical 
cyclone within the next few hours. Martin's peak sustained winds 
will likely begin to decrease on Friday, but it will continue to 
produce strong winds over a very large area well into the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 520
miles (835 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 960 mb (28.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Martin when it become a post-tropical
cyclone will likely spread across a large portion of the
high-latitude North Atlantic basin, affecting portions of Atlantic
Canada, the Azores, and the Atlantic coast of Europe by the weekend.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products form your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM GMT.

Hurricane Martin Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162022
300 PM GMT Thu Nov 03 2022
 
Martin is nearing the completion of its extratropical transition,
which will likely conclude in the next few hours. Although the
cyclone has maintained some inner-core convection, satellite
imagery indicates that its center is beginning to get stretched out
as it becomes a frontal cyclone. There is also no longer any
indication of an eye-like feature in recent microwave or infrared
imagery. Martin's hybrid structure adds uncertainty to the
intensity estimate, since techniques like Dvorak weren't
designed for cyclones that are becoming frontal. Therefore, even
though most of the satellite-based intensity estimates have
decreased over the past 6 hours, the estimated maximum winds are
held at 75 kt since baroclinic processes are believed to be
supporting the maintenance of intensity of the cyclone at this time.
 
Martin is moving at a remarkably fast forward speed, with an 
initial motion of 035/42 kt. Once it is post-tropical, Martin is 
forecast to take a northward turn and begin slowing down as it 
interacts with another non-tropical system to its northwest. Martin 
is expected to become a very large and powerful extratropical 
cyclone during this time, with most global models forecasting a 
minimum pressure between the high 920s and mid 930s (mb). After a 
day of relatively slow movement, an occluded and slowly weakening 
post-tropical Martin should begin to move eastward on Saturday. By 
Sunday or Sunday night, the cyclone is forecast to have weakened 
enough to open into a trough embedded within a broad low over the 
far north Atlantic. The track and intensity forecasts are heavily 
based on a blend of the GFS and ECMWF global models, but it's worth 
noting that other models like the HWRF and UKMET support the same 
general evolution of Martin through the weekend.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Lisa
was located inland near latitude 18.0 North, longitude 91.0 West. 
The depression is moving toward the west near 10 mph (17 km/h), and 
this general motion is expected to continue through tonight followed 
by a turn toward the northwest.  On the forecast track, the center 
of Lisa will continue to move over southeastern Mexico today and
tonight, and move into the Bay of Campeche on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast, and Lisa is
not expected to re-intensify when the center reaches the Bay of
Campeche.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Lisa is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 4 to 6
inches with local amounts to 10 inches across the Mexican states of
Tabasco, northwestern Chiapas, and far eastern Veracruz.  Rainfall
is expected to continue to diminish across Belize, northern
Guatemala and the Yucatan Peninsula today.  Additional rainfall
totals of 1 to 2 inches are possible across these areas.
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding conditions, especially
across portions of southeastern Mexico
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Tropical Depression Lisa Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
1000 AM CDT Thu Nov 03 2022
 
Lisa has been inland for about 18 hours, and there are no
observations of tropical-storm-force winds.  Also, using a standard
rate of decay over land shows the cyclone weakening below tropical
storm intensity by now.  Therefore the system is being downgraded
to a tropical depression on this advisory.
 
Satellite fixes and observations from the Sabancuy, Mexico, radar
indicate that the cyclone continues moving mainly westward and
the initial motion estimate is 280/9 kt.  Over the next couple of
days, Lisa should gradually turn to the northwest and north while
moving along the southwestern periphery of a mid-level high.  In
2-3 days, the increasingly shallow cyclone is expected to meander
over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico within a weak low-level flow.
The official track forecast is similar to the previous one and
follows the multi-model consensus guidance, TVCA.
 
Lisa is forecast to move over the waters of the Bay of Campeche in
24 hours.  Global models show strong southerly to
south-southwesterly upper-level winds across most of the Gulf of
Mexico during the next few days.  The associated strong vertical
shear should prevent re-intensification.  Global model simulations
also show Lisa's mid- to upper-level vorticity maximum being sheared
north-northeastward into the northern Gulf while the low-level
circulation remains over the Bay of Campeche.  The official
intensity forecast, like the previous ones, shows the system
degenerating into a remnant low in 3 days.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Localized flash flooding is expected across portions of southeast
Mexico.
