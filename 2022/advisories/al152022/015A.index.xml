Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Thu Nov 3 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems: <br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
downgraded Tropical Storm Lisa, located inland over northeastern <br/>
Guatemala, and on Hurricane Martin, located over the central North <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Atlantic:<br/>
A non-tropical area of low pressure is currently located several <br/>
hundred miles to the east-northeast of Bermuda. This system is <br/>
currently associated with a limited area of disorganized showers, <br/>
and environmental conditions are only marginally favorable for some <br/>
gradual subtropical or tropical development of this system as it <br/>
begins to move more westward by this weekend. By early next week, <br/>
this system is likely to be absorbed by a larger system developing <br/>
to its southwest. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic:<br/>
Another non-tropical, but complex area of low pressure is expected <br/>
to develop this weekend over the northeastern Caribbean Sea or the <br/>
southwestern Atlantic. Some slow subtropical or tropical development <br/>
of this system is possible afterward while it moves generally <br/>
northward to northwestward through early next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

900 AM GMT Thu Nov 03 2022
 
...MARTIN RACING NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD...
...EXPECTED TO BECOME A LARGE AND POWERFUL POST-TROPICAL CYCLONE
LATER TODAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM GMT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...41.9N 41.4W
ABOUT 805 MI...1300 KM WNW OF THE AZORES
ABOUT 665 MI...1070 KM ESE OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...85 MPH...140 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 30 DEGREES AT 46 MPH...74 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...968 MB...28.59 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM GMT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Martin was located 
near latitude 41.9 North, longitude 41.4 West. Martin is moving 
rapidly toward the north-northeast near 46 mph (74 km/h). A turn to 
the north is expected to occur later today taking Martin over the 
far North Atlantic. A reduction in forward speed and a turn to the 
east or east-southeast is then forecast on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts. Martin should continue to grow larger and slightly stronger
today when it transitions into a large and powerful post-tropical
cyclone. After that time, the cyclone is forecast to gradually lose
strength through the weekend, but remain very large.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 50 miles (85 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275 miles
(445 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 968 mb (28.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Martin when it become a post-tropical 
cyclone will likely spread across a large portion of the 
high-latitude North Atlantic basin, affecting portions of Atlantic 
Canada, the Azores, and the Atlantic coast of Europe by the weekend. 
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions. Please consult products form your local weather 
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM GMT.

Hurricane Martin Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162022
900 AM GMT Thu Nov 03 2022
 
Martin has maintained an impressive presentation overnight, with
an eye feature appearing on and off in satellite imagery. However,
recent images suggests a baroclinic zone is already starting to 
run under Martin's cirrus canopy from the northwest. This front has 
yet to infiltrate the core, per recent microwave imagery, and thus 
Martin currently remains a tropical cyclone. The latest Dvorak 
estimates remain unchanged, so Martin's intensity is held at 75 kt.
 
Acceleration continues with Martin, but the latest heading is
just a bit more poleward than before at a very brisk 030/40-kt. No
drastic changes were made from the prior cycle, with Martin
accelerating further and turning north over the next 6-12 hours as
it becomes captured by an intense high-latitude trough from
Atlantic Canada. After the phasing between Martin and this potent
deep-layer trough completes, the combined system is forecast to
slow down substantially as it occludes, followed by a faster 
eastward or east-southeastward motion as the large extratropical 
cyclone gradually weakens. The latest track forecast is quite 
similar to the prior forecast, continuing to favor a blend of the 
GFS and ECMWF global model guidance.
 
Any additional intensification of Martin's maximum sustained winds 
will likely be of the non-tropical variety, as interaction with the 
trough will likely wrap some cool descending air along the 
southwestern side of Martin, potentially resulting a string-jet-like 
development that causes some strengthening. For this reason, a peak 
intensity of 80-kt is still shown in 12 hours as Martin becomes 
post-Tropical. With that said, the most important evolution with the 
cyclone over the next couple of days will be the dramatic expansion 
of its 34- and 50-kt wind field as the system becomes an 
exceptionally large and dangerous warm-seclusion-type extratropical 
low. In fact, the forecast tropical-storm-force wind radii and 
high-seas of the resulting extratropical cyclone are so large in 36 
hours that it takes up a large chunk of the entire north Atlantic 
poleward of 50 degrees. After this time period, the extratropical 
cyclone should completely occlude and gradually start to decay as it 
loses its baroclinicity. However, Martin should remain a large and 
powerful extratropical cyclone into the weekend.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lisa was 
located near latitude 17.9 North, longitude 90.6 West.  Lisa is 
moving toward the west near 10 mph (17 km/h).  This general motion 
is expected to continue for the next day or so, bringing the center 
of Lisa across southeastern Mexico.  A turn to the northwest and a 
decrease in forward speed are expected on Friday, moving Lisa over 
the Bay of Campeche.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast while the
center remains over land, and Lisa is expected to weaken to a
tropical depression later today.  Lisa is not expected to
re-intensify when the center reaches the Bay of Campeche.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected inland near the path 
of the center over portions of the southern Yucatan Peninsula of 
Mexico and northern Guatemala for the next few hours.
 
RAINFALL: Lisa is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 4 to 6
inches with local amounts to 10 inches across Belize, northern
Guatemala, the southern portion of the Mexican state of Quintana
Roo, southern and central Campeche, Tabasco, northern Chiapas, and
far eastern Veracruz.
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding conditions.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

Tropical Storm Lisa Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152022
400 AM CDT Thu Nov 03 2022

Lisa has continued to move farther inland during the last several 
hours, with the center now located over extreme northern Guatemala. 
The organization of the storm has continued to decrease in both 
satellite imagery and radar data, and the initial intensity is 
reduced to a somewhat uncertain 40 kt.

The initial motion is 280/9 kt.  This general motion should continue 
for the next 24 h or so, followed by a turn toward the northwest as 
Lisa moves over the Bay of Campeche.  Starting near 48 h, the 
cyclone should slow its forward motion and make a looping turn 
toward the southeast, with this motion continuing until the cyclone 
dissipates.  The track guidance after 24 h has shifted a bit 
westward since the previous advisory, and the new forecast track for 
those time periods is nudged westward as well.

Lisa should continue to weaken while the center stays inland, and 
it is forecast to be below tropical-storm strength in about 12 h.  
Unfavorable upper-level winds and dry air entrainment are likely to 
prevent re-intensification over the Bay of Campeche, and these 
conditions should cause the cyclone to degenerate to a remnant low 
over water by 72 h.  The global models are in good agreement that 
the system will dissipate by 96 h, and the new intensity forecast 
follows that scenario.


Key Messages:
 
1. Localized flash flooding is expected across portions of Belize, 
northern Guatemala, and portions of southeast Mexico.

2. Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread inland over 
northern Guatemala and the southern portions of the Yucatan 
peninsula of Mexico during the next several hours, though all 
coastal warnings have been discontinued. 
 
3. Elevated Water levels along the coast of Belize should 
diminish today.
