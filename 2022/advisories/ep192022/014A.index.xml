within the watch area.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM MDT (1200 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Roslyn was located
near latitude 22.1 North, longitude 105.5 West. Roslyn is moving
toward the north-northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h).  This general
motion with some increase in forward speed is expected today. On the
forecast track, Roslyn will move farther inland over west-central 
Mexico today.

Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Roslyn is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Now that Roslyn has made landfall, rapid 
weakening is expected as the hurricane moves farther inland.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80
miles (130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 960 mb (28.35 inches). 


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions will continue to 
spread inland within the warning area today.  Wind speeds atop hills 
and mountains are often up to 30 percent stronger than the 
near-surface winds indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated 
locations could be even greater.  
 
Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area 
this morning.

RAINFALL: Roslyn is expected to produce the following rainfall
totals across coastal areas of southwestern and west-central
Mexico:
 
Jalisco: 4 to 8 inches with maximum amounts of 10 inches along the
northern coast.
 
Upper coast of Colima, western Nayarit including Islas Marias, and
southeastern Sinaloa: 4 to 6 inches with maximum amounts of 8
inches.
 
Southern Durango into western Zacatecas: 1 to 3 inches with maximum
amounts of 5 inches.
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding and landslides in areas
of rugged terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  Roslyn is expected to produce a life-threatening storm 
surge with significant coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds 
through today.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by 
large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Roslyn are affecting portions of the 
coast of southwestern Mexico, west-central Mexico, and the southern 
portion of the Baja California peninsula through tonight.  These 
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.

Hurricane Roslyn Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192022
300 AM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Roslyn is nearing west-central Mexico this morning, with a cloud 
pattern that is becoming a little less organized with a more 
obscured eye.  An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft has 
provided valuable data this evening, despite severe turbulence, 
showing that the hurricane hasn't lost much strength, with 
flight-level and SFMR winds both supporting a current intensity of 
110 kt.  This intensity also matches a slightly higher central 
pressure of about 958 mb, up just a few mb since the last 
reconnaissance mission.  

Fixes from the aircraft and satellite imagery show that Roslyn has 
turned to the north-northeast and is moving faster, at about 14 kt. 
The hurricane should continue to accelerate and make landfall in 
the next several hours, likely in northern Nayarit, similar to the 
track models.  There isn't much time left for any increase in shear 
to affect Roslyn, and the hurricane is expected to make landfall 
at about its current strength.  Rapid weakening will occur over the 
mountainous terrain of western Mexico later this morning, and Roslyn 
should lose its circulation this evening. No significant changes 
were made to the previous forecast.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Roslyn is forecast to be a major hurricane when it makes landfall 
along the west-central coast of Mexico within the next several 
hours, accompanied by damaging winds and a life-threatening storm 
surge.  Preparations within the Hurricane Warning area along the 
west-central coast of Mexico should be rushed to completion.
 
2. Heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding and possible
landslides in areas of rugged terrain over coastal southwestern and
west-central Mexico.
