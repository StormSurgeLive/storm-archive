SUMMARY OF 700 PM CDT...0000 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.6N 103.4W
ABOUT 245 MI...390 KM SSE OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 280 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H

--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* The Pacific coast of Mexico from Manzanillo to Cabo Corrientes
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the coast of southwestern and west-central 
Mexico and the Islas Marias should monitor the progress of this 
system. Additional watches or warnings will likely be required for 
portions of these areas later tonight or on Friday.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Roslyn was 
located near latitude 15.6 North, longitude 103.4 West. Roslyn is 
moving toward the west near 7 mph (11 km/h). A turn toward the 
west-northwest and northwest is expected later tonight and Friday, 
followed by a north-northwestward and northward motion on Saturday 
and Saturday night. On the forecast track, Roslyn is expected to 
move parallel to the southwestern coast of Mexico through Saturday, 
then approach the west-central coast of Mexico on Saturday night and 
Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Strengthening is forecast during the next few days, and Roslyn is 
expected to become a hurricane by Friday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
mainly to the northeast of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area on
Saturday.
 
RAINFALL:  The outer rainbands of Roslyn may produce rainfall totals 
of 1 to 3 inches along coastal areas of Guerrero and Michoac√°n and 2 
to 4 inches with maximum amounts of 6 inches along coastal areas of 
Colima and Jalisco. Roslyn is also forecast to bring locally heavy 
rainfall to coastal areas of Nayarit including Islas Marias, and 
southeastern Sinaloa. This rainfall could lead to flash flooding and 
landslides in areas of rugged terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Roslyn are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico and will spread northward to the coast
of west-central Mexico on Friday. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Roslyn Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>

Tropical Storm Roslyn Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192022
400 PM CDT Thu Oct 20 2022

Satellite imagery shows that Roslyn has become a little more 
organized this afternoon, with the formation of a curved convective 
band near the center in the eastern semicircle.  The various 
subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates have 
increased a little since the last advisory, and the initial 
intensity is increased to 40 kt in best agreement with the CIMSS 
satellite consensus.  It should be noted that Roslyn looks a little 
sheared, with the center near the western edge of the convection 
and a lot of curved low cloud lines apparent west of the 
convection.  It is uncertain why the cyclone looks this way since 
the analyzed vertical wind shear is less than 10 kt.
 
The initial motion is now 280/6 kt.  A mid- to upper-level ridge is 
located over Mexico north and northwest of Roslyn, while a 
deep-layer low pressure area is located several hundred miles 
southwest of the coast of southern California.  The large-scale 
models forecast both of these features to move eastward, with Roslyn 
expected to recurve to the north and northeast between them. While 
the track guidance is in good agreement with this general scenario, 
there is a significant spread in the guidance regarding how far west 
the cyclone will move before recurvature.  The GFS is on the right 
side of the envelope, bringing the center near Cabo Corrientes in 
roughly 60 h and inland over mainland Mexico thereafter.  On the 
other hand, the ECMWF and UKMET are about 150 n mi west of the GFS 
at that time, keeping the center farther offshore and showing a 
more northerly landfall point in mainland Mexico.  Overall, the 
guidance envelope has shifted a little to the west since the last 
advisory.  The new forecast track is also shifted west of the 
previous track, but it lies to the east of the consensus models out 
of deference to the previous forecast and the GFS.
 
Roslyn remains over warm sea surface temperatures in a moist, 
light-shear environment.  These conditions are likely to persist 
for the next 60-72 h, and they should allow Roslyn to steadily 
intensify.  After that time, the intensity forecast becomes more 
uncertain due to a forecast increase in shear, the possibility of 
dry air entrainment, and the uncertainty of how much land 
interaction will occur.  The new intensity forecast is again 
similar to the previous forecast and calls for a peak intensity of 
85 kt before landfall in mainland Mexico.  After landfall, rapid 
weakening is expected, with the cyclone dissipating over the 
mountains of Mexico between 96-120 h.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Roslyn is forecast to become a hurricane before it passes near
or over the west-central coast of Mexico late Saturday and Sunday,
accompanied by strong winds and a potentially dangerous storm surge.
Interests along the coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico
should closely monitor the progress of this system.  A tropical 
storm watch has been issued for part of this area, and additional 
hurricane or tropical storm watches could be required tonight or 
on Friday.
 
2. Heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding and possible 
landslides in areas of rugged terrain over coastal southwestern 
Mexico.
