BULLETIN
Tropical Depression Nineteen-E Advisory Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192022
400 AM CDT Thu Oct 20 2022
 
...DEPRESSION CRAWLING WESTWARD...
...EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN AND PRODUCE HEAVY RAINS AND FLOODING 
ALONG PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWESTERN AND WEST-CENTRAL COAST OF 
MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 400 AM CDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.1N 101.5W
ABOUT 180 MI...290 KM S OF ZIHUATANEJO MEXICO
ABOUT 325 MI...525 KM SE OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 275 DEGREES AT 3 MPH...6 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1007 MB...29.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests along the coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico
should monitor the progress of this system.  Watches could be 
required for portions of the coast later today.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression
Nineteen-E was located near latitude 15.1 North, longitude 101.5
West.  The depression is moving toward the west near 3 mph (6 km/h),
and this general motion is expected to continue today.  A turn 
toward the west-northwest and northwest is expected Friday and 
Friday night, followed by a northward motion by Saturday night.  On 
the forecast track, the system is expected to move parallel to the 
southwestern coast of Mexico through Saturday and then pass near or 
over the west-central coast of Mexico Saturday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Strengthening is forecast during the next few days.  The depression 
is expected to become a tropical storm later today and then become 
a hurricane by late Friday or Friday night.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Tropical Depression Nineteen-E's outer rainbands may 
produce heavy rainfall of 1 to 4 inches along coastal areas of 
Guerrero and Michoacan. This rainfall could lead to flash flooding 
as well as possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain.

The system is then forecast to turn north and northeast this weekend 
and may bring locally heavy rainfall to coastal areas of Jalisco, 
Nayarit including Islas Marias, and southeastern Sinaloa. This 
rainfall could lead to flash flooding and landslides in areas of 
rugged terrain.

SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are affecting portions of
the coast of southwestern Mexico and will spread northward to the
coast of west-central Mexico by Friday.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

<title>Tropical Depression Nineteen-E Forecast Discussion Number 2</title>

Tropical Depression Nineteen-E Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192022
400 AM CDT Thu Oct 20 2022
 
The circulation associated with the cyclone does not appear to have 
tightened up yet, and the center is estimated to be located between 
two primary clusters of deep convection.  Dvorak classifications 
are T2.5/35 kt from TAFB and T1.5/25 kt from SAB, and the objective 
ADT estimate from UW-CIMSS is just below tropical storm intensity.  
Therefore, the system remains a depression with maximum winds 
estimated to be 30 kt.

TAFB and SAB center fixes suggest the depression isn't moving very 
fast.  The initial motion is westward, or 275/3 kt, with the system 
just beginning to move along the southern edge of a mid-tropospheric 
high centered near the mouth of the Gulf of California.  This high 
is expected to slide eastward across Mexico during the next 3 days, 
while a deep-layer area of low pressure moves very little well to 
the west of the Baja California peninsula.  The cyclone should 
slowly recurve around the western periphery of the high, eventually 
moving northward near the west-central coast of Mexico by Saturday 
night and then accelerating north-northeastward over Mexico on 
Sunday.  There is a typical amount of spread among the track models 
for this forecast, with most of the discrepancies related to how 
wide and fast a turn the cyclone makes while recurving around the 
high.  The NHC official forecast favors a more intense cyclone that 
makes a tighter, faster turn, and it lies closest to the solutions 
of the GFS, COAMPS-TC, and HCCA consensus aid.  This forecast 
essentially lies on top of the previous NHC prediction.

An environment of negligible deep-layer shear, very warm ocean 
temperatures, and sufficient atmospheric moisture should support 
steady strengthening in the coming days.  The cyclone's peak 
intensity will likely be dictated by exactly how long the system 
will be over water before reaching land, and it could also be 
modulated by some increase in shear in about 3 days.  For 
continuity's sake, the NHC intensity forecast is mostly unchanged 
from the previous prediction, and it most closely follows the HCCA 
intensity solution, which is near the upper end of the guidance 
envelope.  After the system moves inland, rapid weakening is 
expected, and the low-level circulation is forecast to dissipate 
over the mountainous terrain of Mexico by early Monday.  Global 
model fields indicate that the mid-level remnants will continue 
northeastward across northern Mexico on Monday.
 
 
Key Messages:

1. The depression is forecast to become a hurricane before it passes 
near or over the west-central coast of Mexico late Saturday and 
Sunday, accompanied by strong winds and a potentially dangerous 
storm surge.  Interests along the coast of southwestern and 
west-central Mexico should closely monitor the progress of this 
system, and hurricane or tropical storm watches could be required 
for portions of this coastline later today.

2. Heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding and possible 
landslides in areas of rugged terrain over coastal southwestern 
Mexico.
