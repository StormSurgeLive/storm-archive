DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM MDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Roslyn was located
near latitude 19.5 North, longitude 106.7 West.  Roslyn is moving
toward the north near 10 mph (17 km/h).  This general motion should 
continue tonight, followed by a faster motion toward the 
north-northeast on Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Roslyn will approach the coast of west-central Mexico, likely making 
landfall along the coast of the Mexican state of Nayarit Sunday 
morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Roslyn is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Although some weakening could occur tonight, 
Roslyn is expected to be at or near major hurricane strength when 
it makes landfall on Sunday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80
miles (130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 954 mb (28.17 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within
the hurricane warning area by tonight and early Sunday.  Winds
are expected to first reach tropical storm strength during the
next few hours, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous. 
Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to 
completion.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area
on Sunday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical storm
warning area south of Playa Perula this evening or tonight, and
within the warning area north of Escuinapa on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: Roslyn is expected to produce the following rainfall
totals across coastal areas of southwestern and west-central
Mexico:
 
Michoac√°n and the lower coast of Colima: 1 to 3 inches
 
Jalisco: 4 to 8 inches with maximum amounts of 10 inches along the
northern coast.
 
Upper coast of Colima, western Nayarit including Islas Marias, and
southeastern Sinaloa: 4 to 6 inches with maximum amounts of 8
inches.
 
Southern Durango into western Zacatecas: 1 to 3 inches with maximum
amounts of 5 inches.
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding and landslides in areas
of rugged terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the east of where the
center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Roslyn are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico and will spread northward to the coast
of west-central Mexico and the southern portion of the Baja
California peninsula through the weekend.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 900 PM MDT.

<title>Hurricane Roslyn Forecast Discussion Number 12</title>

Hurricane Roslyn Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192022
300 PM MDT Sat Oct 22 2022
 
An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigating Roslyn
found 700-mb flight-level winds of 124 kt in the northeastern
eyewall and a central pressure of 954 mb. These data, combined with
multiple satellite intensity estimates near 115 kt, support keeping
the initial intensity at 115 kt.  That make Roslyn a Category 4
hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.
 
The initial motion is now north-northwestward, or 340/8 kt.  Roslyn
should turn northward during the next few hours, followed by a
north-northeastward motion as it moves around the western periphery
of a mid-level high centered over Mexico.  The track guidance
continues to indicate that the hurricane will pass just offshore of
Cabo Corrientes, Mexico, tonight, and then accelerate north-
northeastward on Sunday, likely making landfall on the coast of the
Mexican state of Nayarit.  After landfall, Roslyn or its remnants
are expected to accelerate toward the northeast over northern
Mexico until the cyclone dissipates.  The new forecast track is a
little to the left of the previous track through 12 h based on a
more westward initial position.  However, after that time it is
similar to the previous forecast.
 
Roslyn is likely near peak intensity, as it is moving into an area
of increasing southwesterly vertical wind shear.  Due to this and
the trend in the guidance, the new intensity forecast shows slight
weakening before landfall.  However, Roslyn is still expected to be
at or near major hurricane strength when it makes landfall on
Sunday.  Rapid weakening is expected after landfall as Roslyn moves
through the mountains of the Sierra Madre Occidental, and the new
intensity forecast now calls for the cyclone to dissipate between
36-48 h.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Roslyn is forecast to be at or near major hurricane strength
when it passes near and makes landfall along the west-central coast
of Mexico tonight and Sunday, accompanied by damaging winds and a
dangerous storm surge.  Preparations within the Hurricane Warning
area along the west-central coast of Mexico should be rushed to
completion.
 
2. Heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding and possible
landslides in areas of rugged terrain over coastal southwestern and
west-central Mexico.
