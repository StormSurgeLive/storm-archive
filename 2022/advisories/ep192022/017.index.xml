BULLETIN
Remnants Of Roslyn Advisory Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192022
1000 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022
 
...ROSLYN DISSIPATES OVER EAST-CENTRAL MEXICO...
...THIS IS THE LAST ADVISORY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1000 PM CDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...26.0N 101.0W
ABOUT 50 MI...80 KM WNW OF MONTERREY MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...30 MPH...45 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 40 DEGREES AT 22 MPH...35 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1005 MB...29.68 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the remnants of Roslyn were located near
latitude 26.0 North, longitude 101.0 West.  The remnants are moving
toward the northeast near 22 mph (35 km/h) and this general motion 
is expected to continue tonight.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 30 mph (45 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Further weakening is likely overnight 
while the remnants lose their identity.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Roslyn's remnants are expected to produce up to an
additional inch of rain across northeastern Mexico and an additional
1 to 2 inches of rain across portions of coastal and west-central
Mexico.  This rainfall could lead to flash flooding and landslides
in areas of rugged terrain.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system.

Remnants Of Roslyn Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192022
1000 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022
 
Surface observations and satellite images indicate that the 
low-level circulation of Roslyn has dissipated over east-central 
Mexico.  The system is now primarily a lower-tropospheric vorticity 
maximum, which should continue to weaken overnight and ultimately 
be absorbed into a frontal boundary over Texas tomorrow.

Roslyn's remnants are moving quickly northeastward, at about 040/19 
kt.  This general motion should continue into early Monday.  
Although a 12-hour forecast position is provided for continuity, it 
is likely that the system will have lost its identity by that time. 

This is the last advisory on Roslyn.


Key Messages:
 
1. Lingering heavy rainfall from the remnants of Roslyn could lead 
to flash flooding and possible landslides in areas of rugged 
terrain over coastal west-central Mexico.
