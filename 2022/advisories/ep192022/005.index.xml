BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Roslyn Advisory Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192022
1000 PM CDT Thu Oct 20 2022
 
...ROSLYN STRENGTHENS...
...HURRICANE WATCHES ISSUED FOR PORTIONS OF THE COAST OF MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1000 PM CDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.7N 103.6W
ABOUT 230 MI...375 KM SSE OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 285 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has issued a Hurricane Watch for the
Pacific coast of Mexico from Playa Perula northward to San Blas.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* The Pacific coast of Mexico from Playa Perula to San Blas
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* The Pacific coast of Mexico south of Playa Perula to Manzanillo
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area. A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the coast of southwestern and west-central
Mexico and the Islas Marias should monitor the progress of this
system. Additional watches or warnings will likely be required for
portions of these areas on Friday.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Roslyn was 
located near latitude 15.7 North, longitude 103.6 West. Roslyn is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A turn toward 
the northwest is expected on Friday, followed by a 
north-northwestward motion on Saturday and a northward motion 
Saturday night into Sunday. On the forecast track, Roslyn is 
expected to move parallel to the southwestern coast of Mexico 
through Saturday, then approach the west-central coast of Mexico on 
Saturday night and Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of 
days or so, and Roslyn is expected to become a hurricane by late 
Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch
area along the coast of mainland Mexico by Saturday evening, with
tropical storm conditions possible on Saturday. Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the tropical storm watch area on
Saturday.
 
RAINFALL:  The outer rainbands of Roslyn may produce rainfall totals
of 1 to 3 inches along coastal areas of Guerrero and Michoac√°n and
2 to 4 inches with maximum amounts of 6 inches along coastal areas 
of Colima and Jalisco. Roslyn is also forecast to bring locally 
heavy rainfall to coastal areas of Nayarit including Islas Marias, 
and southeastern Sinaloa. This rainfall could lead to flash flooding 
and landslides in areas of rugged terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Roslyn are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico and will spread northward to the coast
of west-central Mexico and the southern portion of the Baja
California peninsula through the weekend. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 AM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Roslyn Forecast Discussion Number 5</title>

Tropical Storm Roslyn Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192022
1000 PM CDT Thu Oct 20 2022
 
Roslyn looks better organized on satellite imagery this evening. 
Deep convection has increased near and over the estimated center 
position, and the expanding dense convective overcast has cloud tops 
colder than -75 to -80 deg C. The objective UW-CIMSS ADT and SATCON 
estimates have increased to 40-45 kt, and SAB and TAFB provided 
consensus T3.0/45 kt Dvorak estimates at 00 UTC. Based on these 
data, the initial intensity is raised to 45 kt for this advisory.

Roslyn is moving west-northwestward at 285/7 kt, steered by a 
mid-level ridge to the north and northwest of the cyclone. As this 
ridge shifts eastward during the next couple of days, the cyclone 
will become steered by the flow between the ridge and a deep-layer 
trough to the northwest, well offshore of southern California. This 
should induce a turn toward the north and north-northeast this 
weekend, eventually bringing the center of Roslyn inland along the 
coast of west-central Mexico. There is still a large spread in the 
track guidance beyond 48 h regarding how sharply the cyclone 
recurves and how fast it moves inland. The GFS remains on the right 
side of the guidance envelope and brings Roslyn inland early Sunday, 
while several other models show a slower and more gradual 
recurvature with landfall later in the day. Overall, little change 
was made to the NHC track forecast, which still lies slightly east 
of the TVCE and HCCA aids.
 
The cyclone will move over warm sea surface temperatures within a 
weak deep-layer shear environment during the next couple of days or 
so. This is expected to support strengthening, and Roslyn is 
forecast to become a hurricane by late Friday with continued 
intensification over the weekend. Given the favorable environmental 
conditions, the NHC intensity forecast lies on the high end of the 
guidance, generally between the IVCN and HCCA aids. While rapid 
intensification is not explicitly forecast, the GFS-based DTOPS 
guidance shows a 44 percent chance of a 25-kt increase in intensity 
during the next 24 h. Beyond 48 h, the intensity will be dependent 
on the cyclone's track and whether it remains far enough offshore to 
avoid the negative influences of land. The official forecast shows 
Roslyn inland and rapidly weakening by 72 h, with dissipation soon 
thereafter over the mountains of western Mexico.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Roslyn is forecast to become a hurricane before it passes near or 
over the west-central coast of Mexico late Saturday and Sunday, 
accompanied by strong winds and a potentially dangerous storm surge. 
A Hurricane Watch has been issued for the coast of mainland Mexico 
from Playa Perula northward to San Blas, and additional watches or 
warnings will likely be required on Friday.
 
2. Heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding and possible 
landslides in areas of rugged terrain over coastal southwestern and 
west-central Mexico.
