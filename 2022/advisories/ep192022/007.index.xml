WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Government of Mexico has issued a Hurricane Warning for the
coast of Mexico from Cabo Corrientes to Punta Mita.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Playa Perula to Punta Mita
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* North of Cabo Corrientes to El Roblito
* Las Islas Marias
 
A Tropical Storm Warnings is in effect for...
* South of Playa Perula to Manzanillo
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the coast of southwestern and west-central
Mexico should monitor the progress of Roslyn.  Additional watches
or warnings will likely be required for portions of these areas
later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Roslyn was
located near latitude 16.4 North, longitude 104.4 West. Roslyn is
moving toward the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this
general motion is expected to continue today.  A turn toward the
northwest and north-northwest is forecast tonight and Saturday,
followed by a northward and then north-northeastward motion Saturday
night and Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Roslyn will
move parallel to the southwestern coast of Mexico today and tonight,
then approach the coast of west-central Mexico, making landfall
along this coastline Saturday night or Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Rapid strengthening is expected during the next day or so,
and Roslyn is forecast to become a hurricane later today. Roslyn is
expected to still be a hurricane when it reaches the coast of
west-central Mexico on Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within 
the hurricane warning area by late Saturday.  Winds are expected to 
first reach tropical storm strength by midday Saturday, making 
outside preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to 
protect life and property should be rushed to completion.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area 
beginning Saturday night or early Sunday, with tropical storm 
conditions possible by Saturday evening.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical storm
warning area on Saturday.
 
RAINFALL:  Roslyn is expected to produce the following rainfall
totals across coastal areas of southwestern and west-central
Mexico:
 
Guerrero and Michoac√°n and the lower coast of Colima: 1 to 3 inches
Upper coast of Colima, Jalisco, western Nayarit including Islas
Marias and southeastern Sinaloa: 4 to 6 inches with maximum amounts
of 8 inches
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding and landslides in areas
of rugged terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce 
significant coastal flooding near and to the east of where the 
center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be 
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Roslyn are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico and will spread northward to the coast
of west-central Mexico and the southern portion of the Baja
California peninsula through the weekend.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Roslyn Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Tropical Storm Roslyn Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192022
1000 AM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Visible satellite imagery suggests that Roslyn is getting better 
organized, with the formation of a central dense overcast with 
overshooting tops near the center.  A recent GMI overpass indicates 
these tops are related to a partial eyewall that has formed under 
the overcast.  The various subjective and objective satellite 
intensity estimates remain near 55 kt, and based on these data the 
initial intensity is unchanged from the previous advisory.  One note 
is that there seem to be a tongue of dry air wrapping cyclonically 
around the CDO from the northwest to southeast.  It should be noted 
that the Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter mission scheduled for 
this afternoon has been canceled due to mechanical issues.

The recent satellite data suggest that the center is a little south 
of the previous track, and the initial motion is a somewhat 
uncertain 300/6 kt.  Despite this shift, there is little change in 
the track forecast philosophy from the previous advisory, as Roslyn 
is still expected to recurve around the western edge of a mid-level 
ridge that will migrate eastward across Mexico during the next 
couple of days.  This will lead to the center passing near or a 
little west of Cabo Corrientes in about 36 h, followed by landfall 
in mainland Mexico.  There is little change to either the forecast 
guidance or the official forecast track since the last advisory, 
and the new track lies near or just east of the various consensus 
models.

Since Roslyn is developing a better defined inner core, its current 
environment of light shear and warm sea surface temperatures could 
allow for rapid intensification. One obstacle to that, though, is 
the dry air currently near the core.  The GFS, HRWF, and HMON models 
forecast this dry air to get mixed out during the next 12-24 h, and 
based on this premise, the new intensity forecast will follow the 
previous forecast in showing rapid strengthening to a peak intensity 
of 95 kt before landfall.  After landfall, Roslyn is expected to 
rapidly weaken over the mountains of Mexico, and although the 
official forecast shows a remnant low over northern Mexico in 72 
hours for continuity, Roslyn will likely dissipate before then.

The new forecast requires a northward extension of the hurricane 
warning along the coast of Mexico.  Additional watches and warnings 
will likely be required on the next advisory.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Roslyn is forecast to be a hurricane when it passes near and
makes landfall along the west-central coast of Mexico late Saturday
and Sunday, accompanied by strong winds and a potentially dangerous
storm surge.  A Hurricane Warning is now in effect for a portion of
the west-central coast of Mexico and will likely be extended
northward later today.
 
2. Heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding and possible 
landslides in areas of rugged terrain over coastal southwestern and 
west-central Mexico.
