WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has extended the Hurricane Warning along
the west-central coast of Mexico north of San Blas to El Roblito.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Playa Perula to El Roblito
* Las Islas Marias
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* North of El Roblito to Mazatlan
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* South of Playa Perula to Manzanillo
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the coast of southwestern and west-central
Mexico should monitor the progress of Roslyn.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Roslyn was
located near latitude 16.7 North, longitude 105.6 West. Roslyn is
moving toward the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and a turn
toward the northwest and north-northwest is expected overnight,
followed by turn to the north on Saturday and a north-northeastward
motion at a faster forward speed Saturday night and Sunday.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Roslyn will move parallel to the 
southwestern coast of Mexico tonight and early Saturday, then 
approach the coast of west-central Mexico, making landfall along 
this coastline Saturday night or Sunday morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Steady to possibly rapid strengthening is 
forecast during the next day or so, and Roslyn could be near 
major hurricane intensity when it nears the coast of Mexico.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles
(110 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 982 mb (29.00 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within 
the hurricane warning area by late Saturday or early Sunday.  Winds 
are expected to first reach tropical storm strength by midday 
Saturday, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous. 
Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to 
completion.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area
beginning Saturday night or early Sunday, with tropical storm
conditions possible by Saturday evening.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical storm
warning area on Saturday or Saturday night.
 
RAINFALL:  Roslyn is expected to produce the following rainfall 
totals across coastal areas of southwestern and west-central 
Mexico: 

Guerrero and Michoac√°n and the lower coast of Colima: 1 to 3 inches

Upper coast of Colima, Jalisco, western Nayarit including Islas 
Marias, and southeastern Sinaloa: 4 to 6 inches with maximum amounts 
of 8 inches.

Southern Durango into western Zacatecas: 1 to 3 inches with maximum 
amounts of 5 inches.

This rainfall could lead to flash flooding and landslides in areas 
of rugged terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the east of where the
center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Roslyn are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico and will spread northward to the coast
of west-central Mexico and the southern portion of the Baja
California peninsula through the weekend.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 AM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

<title>Hurricane Roslyn Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Hurricane Roslyn Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192022
1000 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Roslyn has become even better organized on satellite images.  The 
system has a fairly symmetrical central dense overcast (CDO) 
containing extremely deep convection with cloud tops colder than -80 
deg C.  There are a number of convective bands surrounding the CDO, 
and the upper-level outflow pattern is well-defined.  Subjective 
Dvorak intensity estimates from both TAFB and SAB are now at 77 kt, 
so the advisory intensity is increased to 75 kt, making the cyclone 
a hurricane.  Objective Dvorak estimates are somewhat lower at this 
time, but these will likely catch up to the subjective intensity 
values soon.  Roslyn is a rather compact hurricane, with its 
inner-core region covering an area about 30 n mi in diameter.

Center fixes from geostationary and microwave imagery indicate that 
the motion continues to be west-northwestward, or about 295/6 kt. 
The track forecast scenario is basically unchanged from the previous 
advisory package.  A mid-level anticyclone to the north of the 
hurricane is shifting eastward as a broad trough approaches the Baja 
California peninsula.  This evolution of the steering pattern should 
result in Roslyn turning northward and north-northeastward over the 
next 36 hours.  The official track forecast is about the same as the 
previous one and is near the eastern side of the model guidance 
suite.  This is also very close to the latest corrected model 
consensus, HCCA, prediction.

Roslyn is expected to remain within a low vertical shear environment 
into Saturday, with some increase in shear beginning in 24 hours or 
so.  Further strengthening seems likely during the next 12 to 24 
hours.  The SHIPS Rapid Intensification index shows a 40 percent 
chance for a 25-kt intensity increase in 24 hours.  Therefore the 
official intensity forecast, although it is above the deterministic 
guidance, may be conservative and it is certainly possible that 
Roslyn could become a major hurricane before landfall.


Key Messages:
 
1. Roslyn is forecast to be near major hurricane strength when it 
passes near and makes landfall along the west-central coast of 
Mexico late Saturday and Sunday, accompanied by strong winds and a 
potentially dangerous storm surge.  A Hurricane Warning is in effect 
for a portion of the west-central coast of Mexico.
 
2. Heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding and possible
landslides in areas of rugged terrain over coastal southwestern and
west-central Mexico.
