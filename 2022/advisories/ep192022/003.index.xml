BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Roslyn Advisory Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192022
1000 AM CDT Thu Oct 20 2022
 
...DEPRESSION BECOMES TROPICAL STORM ROSLYN...
...EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN MORE AND PRODUCE HEAVY RAINS AND FLOODING
ALONG PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWESTERN AND WEST-CENTRAL COAST OF
MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1000 AM CDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.2N 102.0W
ABOUT 175 MI...280 KM S OF ZIHUATANEJO MEXICO
ABOUT 305 MI...490 KM SSE OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 275 DEGREES AT 6 MPH...9 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1006 MB...29.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests along the coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico
should monitor the progress of this system.  Watches will likely be
required for portions of the coast later today.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Roslyn was
located near latitude 15.2 North, longitude 102.0 West. Roslyn is
moving toward the west near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this general motion 
is expected to continue today.  A turn toward the west-northwest 
and northwest is expected tonight and Friday, followed by a 
northward motion by Saturday night.  On the forecast track, the 
system is expected to move parallel to the southwestern coast of 
Mexico through Saturday and then pass near or over the west-central 
coast of Mexico Saturday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast during the 
next few days, and Roslyn is expected to become a hurricane by late 
Friday or Friday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Tropical Storm Roslyn outer rainbands may produce
rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches along coastal areas of Guerrero
and Michoac√°n and 2 to 4 inches with maximum amounts of 6 inches
along coastal areas of Colima and Jalisco. This rainfall could
lead to flash flooding as well as possible landslides in areas of
rugged terrain.
 
Roslyn is then forecast to turn north and northeast this weekend
and may bring locally heavy rainfall to coastal areas of Nayarit
including Islas Marias, and southeastern Sinaloa. This rainfall
could lead to flash flooding and landslides in areas of rugged
terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Roslyn are affecting portions of the 
coast of southwestern Mexico and will spread northward to the coast 
of west-central Mexico by Friday.  These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Roslyn Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192022
1000 AM CDT Thu Oct 20 2022

Convection associated with the cyclone has become a bit better 
organized since the last advisory, with a strong cluster having 
developed near the center.  Various subjective and objective 
satellite intensity estimates are now near 35 kt, and based on this 
the depression is upgraded to Tropical Storm Roslyn with an initial 
intensity of 35 kt.  Although the system has strengthened, recent 
microwave and conventional satellite imagery suggests that multiple 
low-level swirls are present near the center, indicating that the 
inner core has not yet tightened up.

The initial motion is now 275/5 kt along the southern edge of a 
mid-level ridge to the north and northwest of the storm.  In 
addition, a deep-layer low pressure area is currently located 
southwest of California, and west of the ridge.  These features are 
forecast to move slowly eastward during the next few days, with the 
deep-layer steering flow near Roslyn changing from easterly to 
southeasterly to southerly and eventually to southwesterly.  This 
evolution should cause the storm to recurve between the ridge and 
the low and make landfall in western Mexico.  The track guidance is 
generally in good agreement with this scenario.  However, there is 
some spread regarding how quickly Roslyn will recurve.  The GFS is 
on the right side of the guidance envelope with the center passing 
near Cabo Corrientes, while the UKMET and ECMWF are farther west.  
The new forecast track is similar to the previous forecast and 
calls for the center to pass just west of Cabo Corrientes in about 
72 h, followed by landfall in mainland Mexico before 96 h.  The new 
forecast track is near or a little to the east of the consensus 
models. 

Roslyn is currently over warm sea surface temperatures in a moist 
environment with light vertical wind shear.  These conditions are 
likely to persist for the next 72 h or so, and they should allow 
Roslyn to steadily intensify.  After 72 h, the intensity forecast 
becomes more uncertain due to a forecast increase in shear, the 
possibility of dry air entrainment, and the possibility of land 
interaction.  The new NHC forecast is generally similar to the 
previous forecast, although it has a slightly lower peak intensity 
before landfall in mainland Mexico due to a downward trend in the 
guidance.  After landfall, rapid weakening is expected, with the 
cyclone dissipating over the mountains of Mexico between 96-120 h. 
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Roslyn is forecast to become a hurricane before it passes near 
or over the west-central coast of Mexico late Saturday and Sunday, 
accompanied by strong winds and a potentially dangerous storm surge. 
Interests along the coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico 
should closely monitor the progress of this system, and hurricane 
or tropical storm watches could be required for portions of this 
coastline later today.
 
2. Heavy rainfall from Roslyn could lead to flash flooding and 
possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain over coastal 
southwestern Mexico.
