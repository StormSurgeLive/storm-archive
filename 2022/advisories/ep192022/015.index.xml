A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* North of Escuinapa to Mazatlan
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Roslyn was
located near latitude 22.8 North, longitude 105.0 West. Roslyn is
moving toward the north-northeast near 20 mph (31 km/h).  This
general motion with some increase in forward speed is expected
today. On the forecast track, Roslyn will move farther inland over
west-central Mexico today.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 90 mph (150 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Rapid weakening is expected as the hurricane
moves farther inland.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles 
(110 km).  An observing site at Marismas Nacionales near Felipe 
Angeles in the state of Nayarit reported sustained winds of 82 mph 
(132 km/h) and a gust to 124 mph (200 km/h) within the past hour or 
so.  
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 978 mb (28.88 inches). 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions will continue to spread inland along
the track of Roslyn into this afternoon.
 
Tropical storm conditions will continue to spread inland through
portions of west-central Mexico through late afternoon or early
evening.
 
Wind speeds atop hills and mountains are often up to 30 percent
stronger than the near-surface winds indicated in this advisory, and
in some elevated locations could be even greater.
 
RAINFALL: Roslyn is expected to produce the following rainfall
totals across coastal areas of west-central Mexico:
 
Upper coast of Jalisco, Nayarit including Islas Marias: 4 to 8
inches with maximum amounts of 10 inches.
 
Southeastern Sinaloa, southern Durango into southwestern Zacatecas:
4 to 6 inches with maximum amounts of 8 inches.
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding and landslides in areas
of rugged terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  Roslyn is expected to produce a life-threatening storm
surge with significant coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds
through today.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Roslyn are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico, west-central Mexico, and the southern
portion of the Baja California peninsula through tonight.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

<title>Hurricane Roslyn Forecast Discussion Number 14</title>

Hurricane Roslyn Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192022
300 AM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Roslyn is nearing west-central Mexico this morning, with a cloud 
pattern that is becoming a little less organized with a more 
obscured eye.  An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft has 
provided valuable data this evening, despite severe turbulence, 
showing that the hurricane hasn't lost much strength, with 
flight-level and SFMR winds both supporting a current intensity of 
110 kt.  This intensity also matches a slightly higher central 
pressure of about 958 mb, up just a few mb since the last 
reconnaissance mission.  

Fixes from the aircraft and satellite imagery show that Roslyn has 
turned to the north-northeast and is moving faster, at about 14 kt. 
The hurricane should continue to accelerate and make landfall in 
the next several hours, likely in northern Nayarit, similar to the 
track models.  There isn't much time left for any increase in shear 
to affect Roslyn, and the hurricane is expected to make landfall 
at about its current strength.  Rapid weakening will occur over the 
mountainous terrain of western Mexico later this morning, and Roslyn 
should lose its circulation this evening. No significant changes 
were made to the previous forecast.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Roslyn is forecast to be a major hurricane when it makes landfall 
along the west-central coast of Mexico within the next several 
hours, accompanied by damaging winds and a life-threatening storm 
surge.  Preparations within the Hurricane Warning area along the 
west-central coast of Mexico should be rushed to completion.
 
2. Heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding and possible
landslides in areas of rugged terrain over coastal southwestern and
west-central Mexico.
