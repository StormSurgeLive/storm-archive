DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM MDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Roslyn was located
near latitude 17.6 North, longitude 106.3 West.  Roslyn is moving
toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A turn toward the
north-northwest and north is expected later today and tonight,
followed by a faster motion toward the north-northeast on Sunday. On
the forecast track, the center of Roslyn will move parallel to the
southwestern coast of Mexico through midday today, then approach the
coast of west-central Mexico, likely making landfall along the coast
of the Mexican state of Nayarit Sunday morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Roslyn is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Strengthening is forecast today.  Although 
some weakening is possible beginning tonight, Roslyn is expected to 
still be near or at major hurricane strength when it makes landfall 
on Sunday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80
miles (130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 960 mb (28.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within
the hurricane warning area by tonight and early Sunday.  Winds
are expected to first reach tropical storm strength by this
afternoon, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to
completion.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area
on Sunday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical storm
warning area south of Playa Perula today or tonight, and within the
warning area north of El Roblito on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  Roslyn is expected to produce the following rainfall
totals across coastal areas of southwestern and west-central
Mexico:
 
Guerrero and Michoac√°n and the lower coast of Colima: 1 to 3 inches
 
Upper coast of Colima, Jalisco, western Nayarit including Islas
Marias and southeastern Sinaloa: 4 to 6 inches with maximum amounts
of 8 inches
 
Southern Durango into western Zacatecas:  1 to 3 inches with maximum
amounts of 5 inches
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding and landslides in areas
of rugged terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the east of where the
center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Roslyn are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico and will spread northward to the coast
of west-central Mexico and the southern portion of the Baja
California peninsula through the weekend.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.

<title>Hurricane Roslyn Forecast Discussion Number 10</title>

Hurricane Roslyn Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192022
300 AM MDT Sat Oct 22 2022
 
Roslyn has intensified rapidly during the past 24 hours.  A
well-defined eye has formed in infrared satellite imagery since the
time of the previous advisory, with cloud tops in the surrounding
central dense overcast (CDO) as cold as -80 degrees Celsius.  The
satellite presentation has improved significantly enough to yield
Dvorak data-T numbers of 5.5 (102 kt) from TAFB and SAB at 06 UTC.
Since Roslyn's structure has improved a bit since that time, the
initial intensity is set at 105 kt.
 
The initial motion is now northwestward, or 315/6 kt.  Roslyn is
expected to continue recurving around the western periphery of a
mid-level high centered over Mexico during the next 36 hours.  The
bulk of the track models indicate that the hurricane will pass just
offshore of Cabo Corrientes, Mexico, by tonight, and then
accelerate north-northeastward on Sunday, likely making landfall
on the coast of the Mexican state of Nayarit.  After landfall,
Roslyn's remnants are expected to accelerate toward the northeast
over northern Mexico.  The updated NHC track forecast shows a
slightly wider recurvature than the previous forecast during
the first 24 hours, following the tightly clustered model
solutions, but the expected landfall ends up in the same general
location as before.
 
Roslyn has roughly another 12 hours before deep-layer southwesterly
shear increases to moderate levels.  But before that happens, the
environment appears conducive for additional strengthening,
possibly still at a rapid rate.  SHIPS Rapid Intensification
indices indicate there is a 50/50 chance of a 20-kt increase in
winds over the next 12 hours, and given the short-term satellite
trends, the NHC intensity forecast now shows Roslyn reaching
category 4 intensity later today.  The increase in shear should
induce some weakening in the last few hours while Roslyn approaches
the coast of Mexico, but the storm could still be at or near major
hurricane strength around the time of landfall on Sunday.  After
landfall, the 5000- to 8000-ft mountains of the Sierra Madre
Occidentals are expected to significantly disrupt Rosalyn's
circulation, and even though a remnant low is shown in the forecast
over the Mexican Plateau at 48 hours, it's likely that Rosalyn will
have dissipated by that time.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Roslyn is forecast to be near or at major hurricane strength
when it passes near and makes landfall along the west-central coast
of Mexico Saturday night and Sunday, accompanied by damaging winds
and a dangerous storm surge.  Preparations within the Hurricane
Warning area along the west-central coast of Mexico should be
rushed to completion.
 
2. Heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding and possible
landslides in areas of rugged terrain over coastal southwestern and
west-central Mexico.
