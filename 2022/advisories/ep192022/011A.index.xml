DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 PM MDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Roslyn was
located near latitude 18.4 North, longitude 106.6 West. Roslyn is
moving toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A turn
toward the north is expected later today and tonight, followed by a
faster motion toward the north-northeast on Sunday. On the forecast
track, the center of Roslyn will move parallel to the southwestern
coast of Mexico through midday today, then approach the coast of
west-central Mexico, likely making landfall along the coast of the
Mexican state of Nayarit Sunday morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Roslyn is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some strengthening is forecast this 
afternoon.  Although some weakening is possible beginning tonight, 
Roslyn is expected to still be near or at major hurricane strength 
when it makes landfall on Sunday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80
miles (130 km). 
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter data is 955 mb (28.20 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within
the hurricane warning area by tonight and early Sunday.  Winds
are expected to first reach tropical storm strength by this
afternoon, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to
completion.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area
on Sunday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical storm
warning area south of Playa Perula today or tonight, and within the
warning area north of El Roblito on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: Roslyn is expected to produce the following rainfall
totals across coastal areas of southwestern and west-central
Mexico:
 
Michoac√°n and the lower coast of Colima: 1 to 3 inches
 
Jalisco:  4 to 8 inches with maximum amounts of 10 inches along the
northern coast.
 
Upper coast of Colima, western Nayarit including Islas Marias and
southeastern Sinaloa: 4 to 6 inches with maximum amounts of 8 inches
 
Southern Durango into western Zacatecas:  1 to 3 inches with maximum
amounts of 5 inches.
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding and landslides in areas
of rugged terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the east of where the
center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Roslyn are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico and will spread northward to the coast
of west-central Mexico and the southern portion of the Baja
California peninsula through the weekend.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 300 PM MDT.

<title>Hurricane Roslyn Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Hurricane Roslyn Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192022
900 AM MDT Sat Oct 22 2022
 
Roslyn has intensified further during the past several hours, as
the hurricane continues to show a small well-defined eye inside of
a cold central dense overcast.  Given the rate of intensification,
the actual intensity is a bit of a moving target.  However, the
latest subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates are
currently in the 105-115 kt range, and based on the latest CIMSS 
Advanced Dvorak Technique estimate the initial intensity is 
increased to 115 kt.  An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft is currently enroute to investigate Roslyn.
 
The initial motion is now north-northwestward, or 330/7 kt.  The
track forecast philosophy is unchanged from the previous advisory.
Roslyn is expected to continue recurving around the western
periphery of a mid-level high centered over Mexico during the next
36 hours.  The track guidance continues to indicate that the
hurricane will pass just offshore of Cabo Corrientes, Mexico,
tonight, and then accelerate north-northeastward on Sunday, likely
making landfall on the coast of the Mexican state of Nayarit.  After
landfall, Roslyn or its remnants are expected to accelerate toward
the northeast over northern Mexico.  The new forecast track has
mainly noise-level adjustments from the previous forecast, and it
lies near the various consensus models.
 
Conditions appear favorable for continued strengthening during the
next 6-12 h, and the new intensity forecast calls for Roslyn to
strengthen some more during that time.  After that, increasing 
southwesterly vertical shear and land interaction should cause some 
weakening before landfall.  However, Roslyn is still expected to be 
at or near major hurricane strength when it makes landfall on 
Sunday.  Rapid weakening is expected after landfall as Roslyn moves 
through the mountains of the Sierra Madre Occidentals.  The 
intensity forecast calls for the system to become a remnant low by 
48 h and dissipate soon thereafter.  However, both of these could 
occur earlier than currently forecast.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Roslyn is forecast to be near or at major hurricane strength
when it passes near and makes landfall along the west-central coast
of Mexico Saturday night and Sunday, accompanied by damaging winds
and a dangerous storm surge.  Preparations within the Hurricane
Warning area along the west-central coast of Mexico should be
rushed to completion.
 
2. Heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding and possible
landslides in areas of rugged terrain over coastal southwestern and
west-central Mexico.
