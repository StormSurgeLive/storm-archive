DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 AM MDT (0600 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Roslyn was located 
by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 
20.5 North, longitude 106.4 West.  Roslyn is moving toward the 
north near 12 mph (19 km/h), and a faster motion toward the 
north-northeast is expected today.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Roslyn will approach the coast of west-central Mexico, 
likely making landfall along the coast of the Mexican state
of Nayarit this morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Roslyn is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Although some weakening is possible early 
today, Roslyn is expected to be at or near major hurricane intensity 
when it makes landfall.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80
miles (130 km).
 
The minimum central pressure reported from Air Force Hurricane 
Hunter dropsonde data is 958 mb (28.29 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within
the hurricane warning area within the next few hours.  Preparations 
to protect life and property should be rushed to completion.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area
today.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical storm
warning area south of Playa Perula through this morning and within 
the warning area north of Escuinapa later today.
 
RAINFALL: Roslyn is expected to produce the following rainfall
totals across coastal areas of southwestern and west-central
Mexico:
 
Michoac√°n and the lower coast of Colima: 1 to 3 inches.
 
Jalisco: 4 to 8 inches with maximum amounts of 10 inches along the
northern coast.
 
Upper coast of Colima, western Nayarit including Islas Marias, and
southeastern Sinaloa: 4 to 6 inches with maximum amounts of 8
inches.
 
Southern Durango into western Zacatecas: 1 to 3 inches with maximum
amounts of 5 inches.
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding and landslides in areas
of rugged terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  Roslyn is expected to produce a life-threatening 
storm surge with significant coastal flooding near and to the east 
of where the center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will 
be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Roslyn are affecting portions of the 
coast of southwestern Mexico, west-central Mexico, and the southern 
portion of the Baja California peninsula.  These swells are likely 
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 300 AM MDT.

<title>Hurricane Roslyn Forecast Discussion Number 13</title>

Hurricane Roslyn Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192022
900 PM MDT Sat Oct 22 2022
 
Roslyn remains a formidable hurricane with a symmetrical Central
Dense Overcast containing very intense, deep convection.  An eye has
been occasionally evident on the enhanced IR imagery.  Convective
banding features are most prevalent over the eastern and
southeastern portions of the circulation.  Upper-level outflow is
well-defined over the northern semicircle of the system.  The
current intensity is held at 115 kt in accordance with subjective
Dvorak CI numbers from SAB and TAFB.
 
The hurricane has made its expected turn to the north and the
initial motion is now near 360/10 kt.  The expected steering regime
through Sunday remains about the same as before.  Roslyn should move
around the western periphery of a mid-tropospheric high, and to the
east of a broad trough near the Baja California peninsula. The track
guidance is in good agreement on a north-northeastward motion with
further acceleration, bringing the system ashore over the Mexican
state of Nayarit on Sunday.  The official track forecast is just
slightly to the left of, but not significantly different than, the
previous NHC prediction.  This is also very close to the latest
dynamical model consensus and in between the GFS and ECMWF tracks
which have come into better agreement.
 
Prior to landfall, some increase in southwesterly shear over Roslyn
is predicted by the global models.  Therefore, slight weakening is
possible during the next 12 hours.  Nonetheless, given the conducive
thermodynamic environment including very warm ocean waters with SSTs
of 29 deg C or higher, it is expected that Roslyn will still be near
major hurricane intensity when its center crosses the coastline.
After landfall, rapid weakening will occur over the mountainous
terrain of western Mexico.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Roslyn is forecast to be at or near major hurricane strength
when it passes near and makes landfall along the west-central coast
of Mexico tonight and Sunday, accompanied by damaging winds and a
dangerous storm surge.  Preparations within the Hurricane Warning
area along the west-central coast of Mexico should be rushed to
completion.
 
2. Heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding and possible
landslides in areas of rugged terrain over coastal southwestern and
west-central Mexico.
