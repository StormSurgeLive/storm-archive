A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected 
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued  
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of 
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside 
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life 
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the coast of southwestern and west-central
Mexico should monitor the progress of Roslyn.  Additional watches
or warnings will likely be required for portions of these areas
later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Roslyn was 
located near latitude 16.4 North, longitude 104.1 West.  Roslyn is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue today.  A turn toward the 
northwest and north-northwest is forecast tonight and Saturday, 
followed by a northward and then north-northeastward motion Saturday 
night and Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Roslyn will 
move parallel to the southwestern coast of Mexico today and tonight, 
then approach the coast of west-central Mexico, making landfall 
along this coastline between Saturday night and Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Rapid strengthening is expected during the next day or so, 
and Roslyn is forecast to become a hurricane later today. Roslyn is 
expected to still be a hurricane when it reaches the coast of 
west-central Mexico on Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast
within the hurricane warning area by late Saturday.  Winds are
expected to first reach tropical storm strength by midday Saturday,
making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to
protect life and property should be rushed to completion.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area
beginning Saturday night or early Sunday, with tropical storm
conditions possible by Saturday evening.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical storm
warning area on Saturday.
 
RAINFALL:  Roslyn is expected to produce the following rainfall
totals across coastal areas of southwestern and west-central
Mexico:
 
Guerrero and Michoacan: 1 to 3 inches
Colima and Jalisco: 2 to 4 inches with maximum amounts of 6 inches
Nayarit including Islas Marias and southeastern Sinaloa: 4 to 6
inches with maximum amounts of 8 inches
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding and landslides in areas
of rugged terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the east of where the
center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Roslyn are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico and will spread northward to the coast
of west-central Mexico and the southern portion of the Baja
California peninsula through the weekend.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Tropical Storm Roslyn Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Roslyn Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192022
400 AM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022
 
Roslyn's structure has evolved since the previous advisory.  A more 
distinct core of deep convection appears to be developing, and 
infrared satellite images have even shown hints of an eye feature 
during the past few hours.  An elongated convective band now 
extends around the northeastern and southeastern quadrants of the 
circulation.  Based on consensus Dvorak estimates of T3.5 from TAFB 
and SAB, and a CI number of 3.4 from the UW-CIMSS ADT, Roslyn is 
now estimated to have maximum winds of 55 kt.

Recent scatterometer data and conventional satellite images 
indicate that Roslyn's center is a bit to the northeast of where it 
was estimated to be last evening, and the initial motion is 
west-northwestward, or 300/6 kt.  The track forecast reasoning has 
not changed.  Roslyn is expected to recurve around the western edge 
of a mid-level area of high pressure that will migrate eastward 
across Mexico during the next couple of days.  In 2 to 3 days, 
Roslyn and its remnants are then expected to accelerate 
north-northeastward in the flow ahead of an approaching deep-layer 
mid-latitude trough.  With the exception of the UKMET model (which 
is a western outlier), there is very little cross-track spread 
among the other track models, and most of the differences are in 
the forward speeds after 36 hours.  The biggest change in this 
forecast package is that with the northeastward adjustment of 
Roslyn's center, the entire official track forecast has been 
shifted east of the previous prediction, and lies close to the 
updated TVCE and HCCA consensus aids.

If Roslyn is indeed developing a better-defined core, environmental 
conditions could support rapid intensification (RI).  The SHIPS RI 
indices are now showing a 50 to 60 percent chance of a 30-kt 
increase in intensity over the next 24 hours, and the HWRF, 
COAMPS-TC, and HCCA consensus aids are all showing RI.  RI is 
therefore now explicitly forecast, and Roslyn should reach 
hurricane strength later today.  In 36 to 48 hours, an increase in 
southwesterly shear could induce some weakening, but regardless, 
Roslyn is expected to reach the coast of west-central Mexico as a 
hurricane.  Rapid weakening is expected after landfall, and 
although the official forecast shows a remnant low over northern 
Mexico in 72 hours for continuity, Roslyn is likely to have 
dissipated by that time. 
 
Given the relocation of Roslyn's center and the updates to the 
forecast, hurricane and tropical storm warnings are now in effect 
for portions of the west-central coast of Mexico.  Hurricane 
watches have also been extended northward along the coast.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Roslyn is forecast to be a hurricane when it passes near and 
makes landfall along the west-central coast of Mexico late Saturday 
and Sunday, accompanied by strong winds and a potentially dangerous 
storm surge.  A Hurricane Warning is now in effect for a portion of 
the west-central coast of Mexico and will likely be extended 
northward later today.
 
2. Heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding and possible 
landslides in areas of rugged terrain over coastal southwestern and 
west-central Mexico.
