DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Roslyn was
located near latitude 15.2 North, longitude 102.0 West. Roslyn is
moving toward the west near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this general motion 
is expected to continue today.  A turn toward the west-northwest 
and northwest is expected tonight and Friday, followed by a 
northward motion by Saturday night.  On the forecast track, the 
system is expected to move parallel to the southwestern coast of 
Mexico through Saturday and then pass near or over the west-central 
coast of Mexico Saturday night.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast during the 
next few days, and Roslyn is expected to become a hurricane by late 
Friday or Friday night.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Tropical Storm Roslyn outer rainbands may produce
rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches along coastal areas of Guerrero
and Michoac√°n and 2 to 4 inches with maximum amounts of 6 inches
along coastal areas of Colima and Jalisco. This rainfall could
lead to flash flooding as well as possible landslides in areas of
rugged terrain.

Roslyn is then forecast to turn north and northeast this weekend
and may bring locally heavy rainfall to coastal areas of Nayarit
including Islas Marias, and southeastern Sinaloa. This rainfall
could lead to flash flooding and landslides in areas of rugged
terrain.

SURF:  Swells generated by Roslyn are affecting portions of the 
coast of southwestern Mexico and will spread northward to the coast 
of west-central Mexico by Friday.  These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
