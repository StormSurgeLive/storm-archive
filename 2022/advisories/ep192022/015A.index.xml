BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Roslyn Intermediate Advisory Number 15A
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192022
100 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022
 
...HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLASH FLOODING SPREADING INLAND ACROSS 
PORTIONS OF WEST-CENTRAL MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 100 PM CDT...1800 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...23.8N 104.4W
ABOUT 55 MI...90 KM SSE OF THE CITY OF DURANGO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...70 MPH...110 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 30 DEGREES AT 20 MPH...31 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...988 MB...29.18 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has discontinued all warnings south of San 
Blas.  The Hurricane Warning from San Blas to Escuinapa has been 
changed to a Tropical Storm Warning. 
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* San Blas to Mazatlan
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Roslyn was 
located near latitude 23.8 North, longitude 104.4 West. Roslyn is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 20 mph (31 km/h).  This 
general motion with some increase in forward speed is expected 
today. On the forecast track, Roslyn will move farther inland over 
west-central Mexico through this evening.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Rapid weakening is expected to continue, and 
Roslyn is forecast to become a tropical depression by this evening 
and dissipate tonight or early Monday. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km).  
An observing site at Marismas Nacionales near Felipe Angeles in the 
state of Nayarit reported sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) and a 
gust to 67 mph (107 km/h) within the past hour or so.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 988 mb (29.18 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue to spread inland 
through portions of west-central Mexico through late afternoon or 
early evening.  Wind speeds atop hills and mountains are often up 
to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds indicated in 
this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be even greater.
 
RAINFALL: Roslyn is expected to produce the following rainfall
totals across coastal areas of west-central Mexico:
 
Upper coast of Jalisco, Nayarit including Islas Marias: 4 to 8
inches with maximum amounts of 10 inches.
 
Southeastern Sinaloa, southern Durango into southwestern Zacatecas:
4 to 6 inches with maximum amounts of 8 inches.
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding and landslides in areas
of rugged terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  Water levels along the coast of Mexico within the 
warning area should gradually subside this afternoon.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Roslyn will affect portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico, west-central Mexico, and the southern
portion of the Baja California peninsula through tonight.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Hurricane Roslyn Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192022
1000 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022
 
Satellite imagery indicated that Roslyn made landfall earlier this
morning around 1120 UTC near Santa Cruz in the Mexican state of
Nayarit.  The maximum sustained winds and minimum central pressure
were estimated to be 105 kt and 958 mb, respectively.  An observing
site at Marismas Nacionales near Felipe Angeles in the state of
Nayarit reported sustained winds of 71 kt and a gust of 108 kt
within the past hour or so.  The hurricane has moved farther inland
and the initial intensity has been reduced to 80 kt based on a
standard inland decay rate.  Rapid weakening is expected to continue
to occur today as Roslyn interacts with the mountainous terrain of
west-central Mexico and encounters strengthening vertical wind
shear.  The cyclone is expected to become a tropical storm this
afternoon and dissipate tonight or early Monday, if not sooner.
 
Roslyn is moving north-northeastward at 17 kt.  The track forecast
reasoning has not changed.  The hurricane should continue to
accelerate across west-central Mexico towards the north-northeast
for the next day or so along the northwest periphery of a mid-level
ridge until dissipation occurs.  A 24 hour position has been
forecast for the sake of continuity, though it is expected that
the low-level circulation will have dissipated by then.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Damaging winds will spread inland along the track of Roslyn over
west-central mainland Mexico through late this afternoon.
 
2. Heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding and possible
landslides in areas of rugged terrain over coastal west-central
Mexico.
