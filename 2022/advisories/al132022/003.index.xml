Tropical Depression Twelve Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122022
500 PM AST Thu Oct 06 2022
 
By definition, the depression may no longer be considered a tropical 
cyclone.  The current convection can not really be considered 
organized, and consists of a couple of updrafts with an enhanced 
cirrus canopy due to about 40 kt of west-southwesterly shear.  This 
lack of organized deep convection with the depression has persisted 
since around 10 UTC this morning. An earlier scatterometer overpass 
showed winds no higher than 25 kt near the circulation.  Between 
this data and the latest Dvorak intensity estimates, the initial 
advisory intensity has been lowered to 25 kt.  The very strong shear 
is expected to continue to impact the depression for the foreseeable 
future while the environmental relative humidity continues to 
decrease.  Therefore, the system should be able to be declared a 
remnant low tonight, if there is no evidence that the system has 
opened up into a trough before that time.  The NHC intensity 
forecast was lowered due to the weaker initial intensity.

The depression is moving west-northwestward at about 13 kt.  A turn 
to the west is expected by tonight while the system moves in the 
low-level flow to the south a subtropical ridge.  The NHC track 
forecast is essentially unchanged from the previous one and is near 
the multi-model consensus tracks.

ABOUT 120 MI...195 KM ESE OF NTHRN TIP OF GUAJIRA PNSULA COLOMBIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 280 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1004 MB...29.65 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* San Andres, Providencia, and Santa Catalina Islands Colombia
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Coast of Colombia from Riohacha eastward to the Colombia/Venezuela
border
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within
the next 12 to 24 hours.
 
Interests along the coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras should monitor
the progress of the disturbance.  Additional watches or warnings
will likely be required on Friday.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression
Thirteen was located near latitude 11.9 North, longitude 69.8 West.
The depression is moving toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h), and 
a generally westward motion is expected to continue through Sunday. 
On the forecast track, the cyclone is expected to move near the 
ABC Islands, the coast of northwestern Venezuela, and the Guajira 
Peninsula of Colombia tonight through Friday morning.  The system 
is then forecast to move across the southwestern Caribbean Sea, 
moving near San Andres and Providencia Islands Saturday night, and 
approaching the coast of Nicaragua on Sunday morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is expected for the next 12-24 hours, and the 
depression is expected to become a tropical storm by Friday morning. 
After that, a faster rate of strengthening is likely, with the 
system expected to become a hurricane by Saturday night as it 
approaches San Andres and Providencia Islands.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible on the Colombian islands of
San Andres, Providencia, and Santa Catalina Saturday night, with
tropical storm conditions possible by Saturday afternoon.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected along the coast of Colombia
within the warning area by early Friday.  Gusts to tropical
storm force are also possible across the ABC Islands and the
northwestern coast of Venezuela tonight.
 
RAINFALL:  The tropical depression is expected to produce the
following rain accumulations through early Monday:
 
Northern Coastal Venezuela...3 to 6 inches, isolated 10 inches.
Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao...3 to 6 inches
Guajira Peninsula...3 to 6 inches, isolated 10 inches.
San Andres and Providencia...6 to 12 inches
Eastern Nicaragua...6 to 10 inches, isolated 16 inches.
Central Nicaragua...3 to 6 inches, isolated 10 inches.
Southwest Costa Rica and Southwestern Panama...4 to 8 inches,
isolated 12 inches
 
This rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods.  There is
also the potential for life-threatening mudslides across portions of
Central America this weekend.
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge could raise water levels by as much as
1 to 3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in
areas of onshore winds on San Andres, Providencia, and Santa
Catalina Islands.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and damaging waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the cyclone will affect the ABC Islands
and portions of the coasts of northwestern Venezuela and the Guajira
Peninsula of Colombia through Friday.  Swells could reach Jamaica,
Providencia, and San Andres on Saturday, and portions of the coast
of Central America on Sunday.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

<title>Tropical Depression Thirteen Forecast Discussion Number 3</title>

Tropical Depression Thirteen Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132022
1100 PM AST Thu Oct 06 2022

Earlier satellite imagery and radar data from Curacao indicated 
that the disturbance was developing a better-defined center between 
the ABC Islands and the coast of Venezuela.  Since that time, a 
large convective burst has formed near and just south of the 
center, and there has been an increase in banding in the Curacao 
radar data.  Based on these developments, the disturbance now has 
sufficient circulation and organized convection to be designated a 
tropical depression.  Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft surveying the system showed 25-30 kt winds north of 
the center, so the initial intensity is set at 30 kt.
 
The track forecast remains straightforward.  The depression is 
moving westward or 280/13 kt due to a strong low- to mid-level 
ridge stretching across the western Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.  
This feature should maintain the system on a general westward 
heading for the next 72 h across the southwestern Caribbean Sea, 
with some slowing of the forward motion expected by 60-72 h as the 
cyclone moves over Nicaragua and nears the western end of the ridge. 
A subsequent turn toward the west-northwest across Central America 
is forecast by 96 h.  The new track forecast is basically an update 
of the previous forecast and lies very close to the tightly 
clustered consensus models.

While the system has developed a better-defined circulation, the 
strongest winds are currently well to the north of the center.  
Given this and an environment of light northerly shear, the 
intensity forecast shows gradual strengthening for the next 12 h, 
with the cyclone becoming a tropical storm as it passes near the 
Guajira Peninsula of Colombia.  After that, a faster rate of 
development is expected as the cyclone's structure improves and the 
shear gradually decreases.  The new intensity forecast calls for 
the system to become a hurricane by 48 h and to reach a peak 
intensity of 75 kt just before landfall in Nicaragua.  This could 
be conservative, as the rapid intensification indices of the SHIPS 
model show a significant chance of rapid intensification after 48 
h. As mentioned in the last advisory, after landfall the system is 
unlikely to survive the forecasted trek across the terrain of 
Central America, and dissipation is therefore shown by 120 h.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected across portions of the
Guajira Peninsula of Colombia later tonight and Friday morning, 
where a Tropical Storm Warning has been issued.  Gusts to tropical 
storm force are possible across portions of northern Venezuela, 
Aruba, Curacao, and Bonaire through early Friday.
 
2. The system is expected to strengthen when it moves over the
southwestern Caribbean Sea, and a Hurricane Watch is in effect for
San Andres, Providencia, and Santa Catalina Islands.  Interests in
Nicaragua and Honduras should also monitor the system's progress, 
and additional watches or warnings are likely to be required for
portions of these areas on Friday.
 
3. Heavy rainfall could cause life-threatening flash flooding over 
portions of the Guajira Peninsula, northern Venezuela, and the 
island chain of Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao during the next day or 
two.  The potential for flash flooding and mudslides is expected to 
spread to portions of Central America this weekend.
