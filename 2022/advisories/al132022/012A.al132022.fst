DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Julia was located
inland over Nicaragua near latitude 12.4 North, longitude 84.6 
West. Julia is moving toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h). This 
general motion is expected to continue through tonight, followed by 
a slight turn to the west-northwest on Monday. On the forecast 
track, the center of Julia is expected to continue moving across 
Nicaragua today and emerge over the eastern Pacific by tonight. 
Julia is then forecast to move near or along the Pacific coasts of 
Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala on Monday and Monday night.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional weakening is expected today as Julia 
moves over Nicaragua, but it is still forecast to be a tropical 
storm when it emerges off the Pacific coast of Nicaragua by tonight. 
Julia is forecast to weaken to a tropical depression on Monday night 
and dissipate by Tuesday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115
miles (185 km). The Bluefields International Airport in Nicaragua
reported a sustained wind of 81 mph (130 km/h) a few hours ago a 
little after Julia had made landfall.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 989 mb (29.20 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Julia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions will continue near Julia's center 
and along the coast of Nicaragua within the warning area this 
morning.  Hurricane conditions are possible along the coast of 
Nicaragua within the hurricane watch area this morning.

Tropical storm conditions will continue along the Caribbean coast of
Nicaragua within the tropical storm warning areas through this
morning.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the coast of
Honduras within the watch area through this morning.

Tropical storm conditions are expected along the Pacific coasts of
Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador within the warning area
beginning this afternoon into tonight. Tropical storm conditions are
possible along the Pacific coast of Guatemala within the watch area
on Monday.

RAINFALL:  Julia is expected to produce the following rainfall
accumulations through early Tuesday:

Nicaragua and El Salvador...5 to 10 inches, isolated 15 inches.
Honduras, Belize, northern Guatemala, and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec
in Mexico...3 to 6 inches, isolated 10 inches.
San Andres, Providencia, and Panama...an additional 2 to 4 inches,
isolated 12 inch storm total amounts.
Southern Guatemala and Costa Rica...4 to 8 inches, isolated 12
inches.

This rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides
across Central America today and Monday. Flash flooding is
anticipated across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico early this
week.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is likely still occurring 
along the coast of Nicaragua in areas of onshore winds, but water 
levels should subside today.  Large and damaging waves will likely 
accompany the storm surge near the coast.

SURF:  Swells generated by Julia are affecting Jamaica, Providencia,
and San Andres, and the coast of Central America.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
