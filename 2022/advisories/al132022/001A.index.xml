Tropical Depression Twelve Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122022
1100 AM AST Thu Oct 06 2022
 
Deep convection redeveloped near the low-level center early this 
morning. However, since that time the convection has become sheared 
off to the east-northeast of the center and is dissipating. A recent 
partial scatterometer overpass showed some 25-30 kt wind vectors 
near the decaying convection. Therefore, the initial advisory 
intensity is set at 30 kt. Strong west-southwesterly shear is 
expected to increase further while the surrounding thermodynamic 
environment continues to dry out over the next couple of days. 
Therefore, it is still anticipated that the depression will 
degenerate into a remnant low soon, and dissipate in a day or so. 
The NHC intensity forecast is unchanged from the previous one.
 
The depression is moving west-northwestward at about 10 kt.  A turn 
to the west is expected by tonight while the system moves in the 
low-level flow around a ridge to the north. The NHC track forecast 
is little changed from the previous one and is near the multi-model 
consensus tracks.

PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 270 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1005 MB...29.68 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Colombia has issued a Hurricane Watch for San 
Andres, Providencia, and Santa Catalina Islands.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* San Andres, Providencia, and Santa Catalina Islands Colombia
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Coast of Colombia from Riohacha eastward to the Colombia/Venezuela 
border
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within
the next 24 hours.
 
Interests along the coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras should monitor 
the progress of the disturbance.  Additional watches or warnings 
could be required tonight or on Friday.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products 
issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the disturbance was centered near latitude
11.5 North, longitude 67.7 West.  The system is moving toward the
west near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this general motion is expected to
continue through Sunday.  On the forecast track, the system is
expected to move near the ABC Islands, the coast of northwestern
Venezuela, and the Guajira Peninsula of Colombia through Friday
morning.  The system is then forecast to move across the
southwestern Caribbean Sea, moving near San Andres and Providencia 
Islands Saturday night, and approaching the coast of Nicaragua on
Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next few days.  The
system could become a tropical depression by tonight, and is
forecast to become a tropical storm on Friday.  The system is then
expected to become a hurricane by Sunday as it approaches the coast
of Nicaragua.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...near 100 percent.
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...near 100 percent.  

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches) 
based on observations from Bonaire.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible on the Colombian islands of 
San Andres, Providencia, and Santa Catalina Saturday night, with 
tropical storm conditions possible by late Saturday.

Tropical storm conditions are expected along the coast of
Colombia within the warning area by early Friday.  Gusts to tropical
storm force are also possible across the ABC Islands and the
northwestern coast of Venezuela today and tonight.
 
RAINFALL:  Potential Tropical Cyclone Thirteen is expected to
produce the following rain accumulations through early Monday:
 
Northern Coastal Venezuela...3 to 6 inches, isolated 10 inches.
Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao...3 to 6 inches
Guajira Peninsula of Colombia...3 to 6 inches, isolated 10 inches.
San Andres and Providencia...6 to 12 inches
Eastern Nicaragua...6 to 10 inches, isolated 16 inches.
Central Nicaragua...3 to 6 inches, isolated 10 inches.
 
This rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods.

STORM SURGE:  A storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 
1 to 3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in 
areas of onshore winds on San Andres, Providencia, and Santa 
Catalina Islands.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by 
large and damaging waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by disturbance will affect the ABC Islands
and portions of the coasts of northwestern Venezuela and the Guajira
Peninsula of Colombia through Friday.  Swells could reach Jamaica,
Providencia, and San Andres on Saturday, and portions of the coast
of Central America on Sunday.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

<title>Potential Tropical Cyclone Thirteen Forecast Discussion Number 1</title>

Potential Tropical Cyclone Thirteen Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132022
1100 AM AST Thu Oct 06 2022
 
A broad area of low pressure continues to move westward across the 
far southeastern Caribbean Sea, with an expansive area of deep 
convection stretching across northern South America and the 
adjacent waters.  The system does not appear to have a well-defined 
center and therefore cannot yet be designated as a tropical 
depression.  However, the risk of tropical storm force winds has 
increased for portions of the northern coast of South America, and 
advisories are therefore being initiated on Potential Tropical 
Cyclone Thirteen.  The initial intensity is 30 kt based on ASCAT 
data from last evening.

With the low remaining broad, the center is difficult to locate.  
It's estimated to be over water just north of Venezuela based on 
extrapolation, although it should be noted that stronger turning is 
becoming evident in the cloud pattern a little farther south over 
land.  The track forecast reasoning is straightforward.  Strong low- 
to mid-level ridging over the western Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico is 
expected to steer the disturbance westward along the northern coast 
of South American and then across the southwestern Caribbean Sea 
during the next 3 day or so, likely reaching the coast of Central 
America sometime on Sunday.  The track guidance is tightly clustered 
during that period, with a little bit of speed differences, and the 
official forecast track lies close to the TVCN and HCCA consensus 
aids.

Land interaction will likely modulate the system's development over 
the next 24 hours or so, both its designation as a tropical cyclone 
and potential intensification.  Intensity guidance is in fairly 
good agreement that a well-defined center could form by tonight, 
assuming the system is still over water, with winds potentially 
increasing to tropical storm force by Friday morning.  Once the 
system clears land on Friday, low to moderate shear and warm waters 
of 29 to 30 degrees Celsius should foster more significant 
development, with the system forecast to become a hurricane before 
it reaches the coast of Central America on Sunday.  The NHC 
intensity forecast is near a blend of the IVCN and HCCA consensus 
aids, although it's important to note that some intensity models, 
including HWRF and the ECMWF-based SHIPS, are as much as 15 kt 
higher at 72 hours.

Key Messages:

1. Tropical storm conditions are expected across portions of the 
Guajira Peninsula of Colombia tonight and early Friday, where a 
Tropical Storm Warning has been issued.  Gusts to tropical storm 
force are possible across portions of northern Venezuela, Aruba, 
Curacao, and Bonaire through early Friday.

2. The system is expected to strengthen when it moves over the 
southwestern Caribbean Sea, and interests in San Andres, 
Providencia, and portions of Central America should closely monitor 
its progress.  Watches could be required for portions of that area 
later today or tonight.

3. Heavy rainfall could cause life-threatening flash flooding in 
portions of the Guajira Peninsula of Colombia, northern Venezuela, 
Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao during the next day or so.  Heavy 
rains, and the potential for flash flooding and mudslides, are 
expected to spread to portions of Central America this weekend.
