DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Julia was located
near latitude 12.5 North, longitude 82.7 West. Julia is moving
toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h).  A continued westward motion
with some decrease in forward speed is expected during the next
couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of Julia is
expected to make landfall on the coast of Nicaragua during the 
next several hours, move across Nicaragua on Sunday, and then move 
near or along the Pacific coasts of Honduras, El Salvador, and 
Guatemala through Monday and Monday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is expected until the center makes landfall 
in Nicaragua.  Weakening is expected once Julia moves inland, but 
it is forecast to still be a tropical storm when it moves off the 
Pacific coast of Nicaragua late Sunday or Sunday night.  Julia 
should weaken to a tropical depression on Monday and dissipate by 
Monday night or Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft data is 988 mb (29.18 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Julia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions on the Colombian islands of San Andres,
Providencia, and Santa Catalina should end in the next few hours.
Hurricane conditions are expected along the coast of Nicaragua
within the hurricane warning area starting in the next few hours
and continuing into Sunday morning. Hurricane conditions are
possible along the coast of Nicaragua within the hurricane watch
area early Sunday morning.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected along the Caribbean coast of
Nicaragua within the tropical storm warning areas tonight and early 
Sunday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the coast of 
Honduras within the watch area tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected along the Pacific coasts of
Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador Sunday afternoon into Sunday
night.
 
RAINFALL:  Julia is expected to produce the following rainfall
accumulations through early Tuesday:
 
San Andres and Providencia...6 to 12 inches.
Nicaragua...5 to 10 inches, isolated 15 inches.
Remainder of Central America...4 to 8 inches, isolated 12 inches.
Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico...2 to 4 inches, isolated 6 inches.
 
This rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides
through this weekend.  Flash flooding is possible across the Isthmus
of Tehuantepec in Mexico early next week.
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge is likely to raise water levels by as
much as 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate
coast in areas of onshore winds on San Andres, Providencia, and
Santa Catalina Islands. Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and damaging waves.
 
A storm surge is likely to raise water levels by as much as 4
to 6 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast of
Nicaragua in areas of onshore winds. Large and damaging waves will
likely accompany the storm surge near the coast.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Julia are affecting Jamaica, Providencia,
and San Andres, and will reach portions of the coast of Central
America this evening into Sunday.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Julia Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132022
1100 PM EDT Sat Oct 08 2022

Reports from NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that Julia became a hurricane near 08/23Z.  NOAA measured 
700-mb flight-level winds of 73 kt and estimated surface winds of 
67 kt on the SFMR, while the Air Force measured 850-mb flight-level 
winds of 75 kt.  The central pressure fell to near 988 mb while the 
planes were in the cyclone.  Based on these data, the initial 
intensity is set at 65 kt.

The initial motion is still westward or 270/14 kt.  Strong 
deep-layer ridging to the north of the hurricane should steer Julia 
generally westward during the next couple of days with a gradual 
decrease in forward speed.  This motion should bring the center 
across the coast of Nicaragua during the next several hours, then 
across Nicaragua on Sunday before emerging into the Pacific late 
Sunday or Sunday night.  After that, Julia, or its remnants, are 
expected to continue moving generally westward until the system 
dissipates.  The new official forecast track is very similar to the 
previous track and lies close to the various consensus models.

Julia has only a few more hours before landfall in Nicaragua.  
However, infrared and microwave satellite imagery shows that the 
convective structure has become much better organized, and the 
hurricane would likely undergo rapid intensification if it wasn't 
about to make landfall.  While not explicitly shown in the 
intensity forecast, maximum sustained winds could reach 70-75 kt 
before landfall.  A quick weakening is expected after landfall, but 
Julia is forecast to be at or near tropical storm strength when it 
emerges off the Pacific coast of Nicaragua.  The intensity forecast 
still calls for Julia to weaken over the Pacific and dissipate 
after 48 h as it becomes absorbed by a broader area of low pressure 
associated with a Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind event, a scenario 
supported by the GFS, ECMWF, and Canadian models.  However, the 
UKMET maintains some uncertainty about this, as it shows Julia 
surviving and movingly slowly westward into the Pacific during the 
next several days.
 
Regardless of Julia's track and existence as a tropical cyclone,  
the evolving weather pattern is likely to lead to heavy rains   
over Central America for several days, which could cause 
life-threatening flash floods and mudslides, especially in areas  
of mountainous terrain.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Julia is expected to reach the coast of Nicaragua as a hurricane 
within the next several hours.  Hurricane-force winds and a 
dangerous storm surge will continue in portions of Providencia and 
San Andres islands during the next few hours, and are expected near 
the core of the hurricane when it moves onshore in Nicaragua. 
 
2. Life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides are expected across
portions of Central America this weekend.  Flash flooding is
possible across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico early next
week.
 
3. Julia is forecast to remain as a tropical storm while it moves
across Central America to the adjacent Pacific waters, and tropical
storm warnings are in effect along the Pacific coasts of Nicaragua,
Honduras, and El Salvador to account for the possibility of
tropical-storm-force winds in those areas late Sunday and Sunday
night.
