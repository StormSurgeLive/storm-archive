tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras
should monitor the progress of Julia.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Julia was 
located near latitude 12.7 North, longitude 77.2 West. Julia is 
moving toward the west near 18 mph (30 km/h). This general motion 
should continue through tonight, with a westward motion at a slower 
forward speed expected on Sunday and Sunday night. On the forecast 
track, the center of Julia is expected to pass near or over San 
Andres and Providencia Islands this evening and then reach the coast 
of Nicaragua on Sunday morning. Julia or its remnants will then turn 
west-northwestward over Central America by Monday.
 
Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft data indicate that 
maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Steady to possibly rapid strengthening is forecast 
while Julia moves across the southwestern Caribbean Sea during the 
next day or so, and the system is expected to become a hurricane by 
the time it passes near or over San Andres and Providencia Islands 
and reaches the coast of Nicaragua. Quick weakening is anticipated 
after Julia moves inland on Sunday, and it is likely to become a 
remnant low or dissipate by Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km),
mainly to the northeast of the center.
 
The minimum central pressure based on the Hurricane Hunter aircraft
data is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Julia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC 
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected on the Colombian islands of 
San Andres, Providencia, and Santa Catalina by this evening, with 
tropical storm conditions beginning this afternoon. Hurricane 
conditions are expected along the coast of Nicaragua within the 
hurricane warning area by Sunday morning, with tropical storm 
conditions beginning by tonight. Hurricane conditions are possible 
along the coast of Nicaragua within the hurricane watch areas Sunday 
morning.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected along the coast of Nicaragua 
within the tropical storm warning areas by tonight or early Sunday. 
Tropical storm conditions are possible along the coast of Honduras 
within the watch area on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  Julia is expected to produce the following rainfall
accumulations through early Monday:
 
San Andres and Providencia...6 to 12 inches.
Eastern Nicaragua...5 to 10 inches, isolated 15 inches.
The rest of Nicaragua, southern Honduras, eastern El Salvador...
4 to 8 inches, isolated 12 inches.
Pacific basins of Costa Rica and western Panama...3 to 6 inches,
isolated 10 inches.
Northern Honduras, southern Belize, central Guatemala...4 to 7
inches, isolated 12 inches.
 
This rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides
through this weekend.
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge is likely to raise water levels by as
much as 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate
coast in areas of onshore winds on San Andres, Providencia, and
Santa Catalina Islands. Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and damaging waves.
 
A storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet
above normal tide levels along the immediate coast of Nicaragua in
areas of onshore winds. Large and damaging waves will likely
accompany the storm surge near the coast.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Julia are affecting Jamaica and are 
expected to reach Providencia and San Andres Islands today, and 
portions of the coast of Central America later today into Sunday. 
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather 
office.

<title>Tropical Storm Julia Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Tropical Storm Julia Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132022
1100 PM EDT Fri Oct 07 2022

Satellite imagery indicates Julia has become somewhat better 
organized during the past several hours, with the development of a 
central convective burst with cloud top temperatures colder than 
-80C and several outer bands appearing.  Reports from NOAA and Air 
Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft show this has resulted in 
some strengthening, with the maximum sustained winds near 40 kt and 
the minimum pressure near 999 mb.  However, the aircraft data show 
that Julia is still disorganized.  The 850-mb circulation is weak 
in the southwestern quadrant, and the 700-mb center is notably 
south of the 850-mb and surface centers.

The surface center is a little to the south of the previous advisory 
position, possibly due to reformation caused by the convective 
burst.  The initial motion is westward or 270/15 kt.  The guidance 
suggests that a quick westward motion should persist for the next 
24-36 h or so as the storm is steered by a strong low- to mid-level 
ridge to the north.  This motion should bring the center near San 
Andres and Providencia Islands in about 24 h and to the coast of 
Nicaragua in about 36 h.  A slower westward motion is expected after 
landfall, followed by a turn toward the west-northwest starting at 
about 48 h.  This motion should continue until the system 
dissipates.  The new official track forecast is a little to the 
south of the previous forecast based mainly on the current initial 
position, and it lies near the various consensus models.

The vertical wind shear over Julia is decreasing, and the 
environment is becoming favorable for steady to rapid 
intensification once the cyclone becomes organized enough to take 
advantage of it. Based on the trend of the intensity guidance and 
the SHIPS rapid intensification indices, the new intensity forecast 
calls for Julia to be near hurricane strength when it passes near 
San Andres and Providencia, and for it to reach a peak intensity of 
70 kt at landfall in Nicaragua.  After landfall, the cyclone is 
expected to rapidly weaken over the rugged terrain of Central 
America, with the surface center dissipating between 72-96 h.
 
Although Julia is expected to dissipate over Central America by 
Monday night, various model solutions depict Julia's leftover 
vorticity moving over the eastern Pacific waters, over the Bay of 
Campeche, or both after that time.  However, it is still unclear at 
this time if that will lead to genesis of a new tropical cyclone.  
We'll continue to monitor model trends and update the forecast as 
needed.  Regardless of new development, the set up is likely to lead 
to heavy rains over Central America for several days, which could 
cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides, especially in 
areas of mountainous terrain.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Julia is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane by Saturday
evening or Saturday night while it moves over the southwestern
Caribbean Sea, and a Hurricane Warning is in effect for portions of
the Nicaragua coast and the offshore Colombian islands.
Hurricane-force winds and a dangerous storm surge are expected in
areas where the core of the system crosses the islands and moves
onshore in Nicaragua.
 
2. Life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides are expected across
portions of Central America this weekend.
