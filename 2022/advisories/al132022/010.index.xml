DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Julia was
located near latitude 12.6 North, longitude 81.3 West.  Julia is
moving toward the west near 17 mph (28 km/h).  A continued westward 
motion with some decrease in forward speed is expected during the 
next couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of Julia is 
expected to reach the coast of Nicaragua overnight, move across 
Nicaragua on Sunday, and then move near or along the Pacific coasts 
of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala through Monday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some additional strengthening is forecast this evening and 
tonight, and Julia could become a hurricane while passing near San 
Andres and Providencia Islands this evening.  Julia is also 
expected to be a hurricane when it reaches the coast of Nicaragua 
overnight.  Weakening is expected once Julia moves inland, but it is 
forecast to still be a tropical storm when it moves off the Pacific 
coast of Nicaragua late Sunday.  Julia should weaken to a tropical 
depression on Monday and dissipate by Monday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Julia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring on the Colombian
islands of San Andres, Providencia, and Santa Catalina, and
hurricane conditions are expected this evening.  Hurricane
conditions are expected along the coast of Nicaragua within the
hurricane warning area overnight and early Sunday morning, with
tropical storm conditions beginning by this evening.  Hurricane
conditions are possible along the coast of Nicaragua within the
hurricane watch area early Sunday morning.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected along the Caribbean coast of
Nicaragua within the tropical storm warning areas by tonight or
early Sunday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the
coast of Honduras within the watch area on Sunday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected along the Pacific coasts of
Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador Sunday afternoon into Sunday
night.
 
RAINFALL:  Julia is expected to produce the following rainfall
accumulations through early Tuesday:
 
San Andres and Providencia...6 to 12 inches.
Nicaragua...5 to 10 inches, isolated 15 inches.
Remainder of Central America...4 to 8 inches, isolated 12 inches.
Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico...2 to 4 inches, isolated 6 inches.
 
This rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides
through this weekend.  Flash flooding is possible across the Isthmus
of Tehuantepec in Mexico early next week.
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge is likely to raise water levels by as
much as 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate
coast in areas of onshore winds on San Andres, Providencia, and
Santa Catalina Islands. Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and damaging waves.
 
A storm surge is likely to raise water levels by as much as 4
to 6 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast of
Nicaragua in areas of onshore winds. Large and damaging waves will
likely accompany the storm surge near the coast.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Julia are affecting Jamaica, Providencia,
and San Andres, and will reach portions of the coast of Central
America this evening into Sunday.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Julia Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Tropical Storm Julia Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132022
1100 AM EDT Sat Oct 08 2022
 
Air Force Reserve reconnaissance data indicate that Julia is not a
vertically stacked tropical cyclone.  The plane first made an
initial center fix to the north of the main area of deep convection
and found that the central pressure had fallen to 994 mb.  About an
hour later, a second center fix was made three tenths of a degree
farther south near the deep convection, although the lowest
pressure there was only about 998 mb.  The center has been placed
in between the two fixes, hedging toward the lower pressure to the
north.  Julia's initial intensity is set at 55 kt based on the
lowering of the central pressure and unanimous satellite
classifications of T3.5.  So far, the aircraft has measured peak
850-mb flight-level winds of 50 kt and reliable SFMR winds around
45 kt, so it's assumed the plane has not directly sampled the area
of highest winds.
 
Despite the uncertainty in Julia's initial position, it's clear
that the storm continues to move quickly westward with an estimated
motion of 270/18 kt.  With strong ridging to the north, a continued
fast westward trajectory is expected during the next couple of
days, which should bring Julia's center inland over Nicaragua by
early Sunday morning.  If Julia's center survives the passage over
Central America, it could move just offshore of or along the
Pacific coasts of Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador Sunday night
and Monday.
 
It still appears that there is about 15 kt of northwesterly or
northerly shear affecting Julia, but model guidance indicates this
should abate and then turn out of the east-northeast later today and
tonight.  Therefore, further strengthening is anticipated, and Julia
is forecast to become a hurricane later today.  It's important to
keep in mind that Julia could have a higher intensity when it
reaches the coast of Nicaragua than what is explicitly shown, since
in this forecast landfall would occur between the 12- and 24-hour
forecast times.  In fact, SHIPS guidance suggests the intensity
could be in the 75-80 kt range at 18 hours, which mirrors what was
shown in the previous NHC forecast.
 
Due to Julia's more southern and faster track, there is increasing
global model support that the cyclone will be able to maintain a
well-defined center and circulation while it crosses Central
America, and it could also still be at tropical storm intensity
when it reaches the Pacific side of Central America.  However, even
if it survives the crossing, most of the guidance shows the
circulation becoming more diffuse or dissipating over the Pacific
waters in 2 to 3 days.  Based on the updated NHC forecast, and to
account for the possibility of tropical-storm-force winds along the
Pacific coast of Central America, tropical storm warnings and
watches have been issued for the Pacific coasts of Nicaragua,
Honduras, and El Salvador.  Regardless of Julia's track and
existence as a tropical cyclone, the evolving set up is likely to
lead to heavy rains over Central America for several days, which
could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides, especially
in areas of mountainous terrain.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Julia is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane later today, and
a Hurricane Warning is in effect for portions of the Nicaragua coast
and the islands of Providencia and San Andres. Hurricane-force winds
and a dangerous storm surge are expected in areas where the core of
the system crosses the islands later today and moves onshore in
Nicaragua early Sunday morning.
 
2. Life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides are expected across
portions of Central America this weekend.  Flash flooding is
possible across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico early next
week.
 
3. There is an increasing chance that Julia could remain as a
tropical storm while it moves across Central America, and tropical
storm warnings and watches have been issued along the Pacific
coasts of Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador to account for the
possibility of tropical-storm-force winds in those areas late
Sunday and Monday.
