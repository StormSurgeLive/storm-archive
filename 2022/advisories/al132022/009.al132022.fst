DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Julia was
located near latitude 12.6 North, longitude 79.9 West.  Julia is
moving toward the west near 21 mph (33 km/h).  A general westward
motion with some decrease in forward speed is expected through
Monday.  On the forecast track, the center of Julia is expected to
pass near or over San Andres and Providencia Islands later today
and then move inland along the coast of Nicaragua early Sunday
morning.  Julia is then expected to cross Nicaragua on Sunday, and
move near or along the Pacific coasts of Nicaragua, Honduras, and
El Salvador Sunday night and Monday.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast, and Julia
is expected to become a hurricane later today.  Weakening is
forecast after the center moves inland over Nicaragua on Sunday,
but Julia could still be at tropical storm strength when it moves
near or along the Pacific coasts of Nicaragua, Honduras, and El
Salvador Sunday night and Monday.  Julia is forecast to become a
remnant low by late Monday and dissipate by Tuesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).
