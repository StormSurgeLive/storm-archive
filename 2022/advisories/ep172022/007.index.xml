...PAINE CLOSE TO BECOMING POST-TROPICAL...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM MDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.3N 114.3W
ABOUT 425 MI...685 KM SW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1006 MB...29.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Paine was
located near latitude 18.3 North, longitude 114.3 West.  Paine is
moving toward the northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h) and this general 
motion should continue through the morning.  Later today, Paine is 
expected to gradually turn to the west with a slight increase in 
forward speed on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Gradual weakening is expected in the next 
couple of days and Paine should become a remnant low later today.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Tropical Storm Paine Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172022
300 AM MDT Wed Oct 05 2022
 
The satellite presentation of Paine has degraded during the past 
several hours.  Apart from one small burst of convection being 
sheared away from the center, the cyclone is generally just a 
low-level circulation. Satellite intensity estimates have fallen and 
the initial intensity has been lowered to a possibly generous 35 kt. 
Global models indicate that moderate-to-strong vertical wind shear 
and increasingly dry mid-level air will prevent Paine from 
intensifying in the future.  Simulated satellite imagery from these 
models also suggests that little or no new deep, organized 
convection is likely to form.  The official forecast now shows Paine 
becoming a remnant low within 12 hours.

Paine is passing just east of Clarion Island while moving northwest 
at about 4 kt.  This motion is expected to gradually turn to the 
west-northwest and west today as the shallow vortex is steered by 
the low-level winds.  The NHC track prediction is shifted slightly 
south of the previous forecast track and near the center of the 
model guidance envelope.
