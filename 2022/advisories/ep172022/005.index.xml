<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Paine, located several hundred miles south-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
South of southern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
south of Acapulco, Mexico, is currently producing only a few <br/>
showers and thunderstorms.  Any development of this system over <br/>
the next few days is likely to be slow to occur due to strong <br/>
upper-level winds and nearby dry air.  The low is forecast to <br/>
move generally westward to west-northwestward remaining <br/>
south of the coasts of southern and southwestern Mexico. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Paine Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172022
300 PM MDT Tue Oct 04 2022
 
There has been a general increase in banding around the western and 
southern portions of Paine's circulation today, with the center 
embedded within the colder cloud tops. However, the bands are 
somewhat fragmented, and subjective Dvorak classifications are a 
consensus T2.5 (35 kt). Objective estimates from UW/CIMSS are 
slightly higher and support an initial intensity of 40 kt, which
is used for this advisory. Unfortunately, ASCAT missed the system 
this afternoon, and once again there is no scatterometer data to 
better determine the system's intensity or size. 

Paine's window for further strengthening is expected to close later 
tonight.  After that time, increasing westerly shear and a drier 
mid-level environment are likely to begin to lower Paine's 
intensity. Weakening is anticipated on Wednesday, and simulated 
satellite imagery from the global models indicate that convection 
will cease, and Paine is forecast to degenerate into a remnant low 
by 36 hours.  This system is forecast to dissipate by day 3. 

Paine is moving northwestward at about 5 kt.  The cyclone should 
continue to move on that general heading and speed through early 
Wednesday as it is steered around the western side of a mid-level 
ridge.  After that time, a bend to the west-northwest and west is 
anticipated as Paine becomes increasingly shallow and is steered by 
the low-level flow. The official track forecast is once again near 
the multi-model consensus aids and it is not very different than 
this morning's forecast.
