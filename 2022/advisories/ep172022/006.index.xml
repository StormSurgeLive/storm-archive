<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Paine, located several hundred miles south-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
South of southern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
south of Acapulco, Mexico, is currently producing only a few <br/>
showers and thunderstorms. Development of this system, if any, <br/>
should be slow to occur, due to strong upper-level winds and nearby <br/>
dry air.  The low is forecast to move generally westward to <br/>
west-northwestward remaining south of the coasts of southern and <br/>
southwestern Mexico. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Paine Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172022
900 PM MDT Tue Oct 04 2022

During the past few hours, convection associated with Paine has 
decreased significantly, as most of the cold cloud tops near the 
center are currently comprised of cirrus debris.  This decrease has 
not yet affected the various satellite intensity estimates, which 
remain in the 35-40 kt range.  The initial intensity is thus held 
at 40 kt, but this could be generous.

The window of opportunity for Paine to strengthen is just about 
closed.  The cyclone is starting to encounter increasing westerly 
vertical wind shear, and it is embedded in a dry air mass that may 
make it difficult for the convection to re-develop.  Indeed, 
simulated satellite imagery from the latest GFS run suggests the 
possibility that the convection may not return even at the normal 
diurnal maximum in about 12 h.  The intensity forecast calls for 
gradual weakening, with the cyclone degenerating to a remnant low 
between 24-36 h and dissipating completely between 60-72 h.  Both 
of these events could happen earlier if the convection does not 
re-develop.

The initial motion remains northwestward or 325/5 kt.  This motion 
should persist for the next 12 h or so.  After that, a slow motion  
toward the west-northwest and west is anticipated as the weakening 
Paine becomes increasingly shallow and is steered by the low-level 
flow. The new official forecast is basically an update of the 
previous forecast and lies near the various consensus models.
