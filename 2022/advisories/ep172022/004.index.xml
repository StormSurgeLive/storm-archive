<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Paine, located several hundred miles south-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
South of southern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
south of Acapulco, Mexico, is currently producing only a few <br/>
showers and thunderstorms.  Any development of this system over <br/>
the next day or two is forecast to be slow to occur due to strong <br/>
upper-level winds and nearby dry air, but environmental conditions <br/>
could become a little more conducive after that time.  The low is <br/>
forecast to move generally westward to west-northwestward remaining <br/>
south of the coasts of southern and southwestern Mexico. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Paine Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172022
900 AM MDT Tue Oct 04 2022
 
Deep convection continues to burst around the western portion of
Paine's circulation.  Infrared and early-light visible satellite
imagery suggests that there has been some increase in convective
banding, and that the center is slightly more embedded within the 
colder cloud tops.  Despite the slight increase in organization, 
subjective and objective Dvorak classifications have not changed 
much and still support an initial intensity of 35 kt.  Hopefully 
scatterometer data will provide additional information on the size 
and intensity of Paine this afternoon.
 
Paine still has a very brief window of opportunity in which to
intensify.  The deep-layer shear is forecast to remain low today,
but is expected to increase significantly tonight and Wednesday.
Therefore, some slight strengthening is predicted, followed by
gradual weakening due to the unfavorable upper-level environment
and an increasing dry mid-level air mass.  Paine is expected to 
become a remnant low in about 48 hours, and dissipate around day 3.

The cyclone is moving northwestward or 325/6 kt.  Paine should 
continue northwestward for the 24-36 hours around the western 
side of a mid-level ridge.  After that time, a bend to the 
west-northwest and west is predicted as Paine becomes increasingly 
shallow and is steered by the low-level tradewind flow. The 
latest NHC track forecast is similar to the previous advisory and 
lies near the simple consensus aids.
