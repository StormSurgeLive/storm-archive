Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 PM PDT Mon Oct 3 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center has issued the last advisory on <br/>
Orlene, which has dissipated over southwestern Mexico, and is <br/>
issuing advisories on Tropical Storm Paine, located several hundred <br/>
miles south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California <br/>
peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
South of southern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
south-southwest of the Gulf of Tehuantepec is currently producing <br/>
only a few showers and thunderstorms.  Any development of this <br/>
system over the next couple of days is forecast to be slow to occur <br/>
due to strong upper-level winds and nearby dry air, but <br/>
environmental conditions could become more conducive by the end of <br/>
this week.  The low is forecast to move generally west-northwestward <br/>
during the next couple of days, but could turn northwestward toward <br/>
the end of the week. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
Public Advisories on Tropical Storm Paine are issued under WMO <br/>
header WTPZ32 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCPEP2. <br/>

1000 PM CDT Mon Oct 03 2022

Visible satellite imagery indicates that Orlene has dissipated over 
the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico, with no trace of a low-level 
circulation.  Thus, this is the last advisory.  Moisture from 
Orlene could still lead to flash flooding and landslides through 
Tuesday in southwestern Mexico.  
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Lingering rainfall from Orlene could lead to flash flooding, as 
well as possible landslides in areas of rugged terrain of 
southwestern Mexico into Tuesday.

Tropical Storm Paine Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172022
300 AM MDT Tue Oct 04 2022
 
Paine is holding steady as a tropical storm.  Satellite imagery has 
shown a few deep convective bursts near the low-level circulation 
overnight, which is now tucked underneath some cold cloud tops.  
Subjective and objective Dvorak estimates range from T2.0/30 kt 
and T2.5/35 kt and the initial intensity is held at 35 kt.
 
There is a brief window where environmental conditions are forecast 
to be conducive for some additional slight strengthening.  Global 
models suggest the deep-layer vertical wind shear will remain low 
for the next 6-12 hours as Paine moves over warm waters.  Beyond 
that time frame, the shear is expected to increase significantly 
which will likely force the surrounding dry mid-level humidities 
into the circulation and induce a weakening trend.  Simulated 
satellite imagery from both GFS and ECMWF suggest Paine will be a 
remnant low in a couple of days.  The latest NHC intensity forecast 
is similar to the previous advisory, but now shows Paine becoming a 
remnant low by 48 h.

The cyclone is moving northwestward at about 5 kt towards a weakness 
in the ridge to its north.  This general motion is expected to 
continue for the next day or so until the Paine weakens and turns 
westward in the low-level flow.  There is still some spread in the 
model guidance which seems largely linked to the depth of the 
circulation and when it is expected to make the turn to the west.  
The latest official track forecast is shifted south of the previous 
prediction but still north of much of model guidance, excluding the 
ECMWF.
