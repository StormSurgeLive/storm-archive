DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Bonnie was located
near latitude 15.5 North, longitude 105.7 West.  Bonnie is moving
toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h).  A westward to
west-northwestward motion is forecast through the period with a
slight decrease in forward speed during the next couple of days. 
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Bonnie is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in strength is forecast 
tonight.  Gradual weakening is forecast to begin Wednesday or 
Wednesday night and continue through Thursday. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 964 mb (28.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Bonnie will continue to affect portions
of the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next day or so.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Bonnie Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
1000 AM CDT Tue Jul 05 2022
 
Earlier microwave images reveal a well-developed inner core
structure with a 10-nm-wide eye, and impressive curved band 
features in the west and south parts of the cyclone.  The 
surrounding cloud tops have cooled quite a bit during the past few 
hours, but the eye temperature hasn't warmed that much.  The initial 
intensity is increased to 100 kt for this advisory and is supported 
by a blend of the Dvorak satellite intensity estimates from TAFB and 
SAB.
 
It appears as though modest northeasterly shear has begun 
to restrict the outflow some in the north portion of the cyclone, 
and this shear is expected to persist during the next 24 hours.
Consequently, some fluctuations in strength are possible during the 
period and the NHC forecast shows a slight increase in intensity in 
12 hours in deference to the recent inner core improvement.
Afterward, the inhibiting shear should decrease, however,the GFS and 
ECMWF SHIPS intensity models show the cyclone traversing cooler 
oceanic surface temperatures and moving into a less favorable 
thermodynamic surrounding environment.  A combination of these 
negative intensity contributions should cause Bonnie to slowly 
weaken through the remainder of the period and the official 
forecast follows suit.
 
Bonnie's initial motion is estimated to be westward, or 280/12 kt. 
A mid-tropospheric ridge anchored to the north of the cyclone 
should keep it on a west to west-northwest heading through the  
entire forecast period.  Around mid-period, however, a weakness in 
the ridge is forecast to develop over the Baja California 
peninsula, which should temporarily slow Bonnie's forward speed.  
The track forecast is a little faster than the previous one beyond 
day 3 and is based on the TVCE multi-model consensus aid.
 
Although the core of Bonnie is expected to remain well south of
Mexico, rough surf and the potential for rip currents will continue
to affect southwestern Mexico for another day or two.
