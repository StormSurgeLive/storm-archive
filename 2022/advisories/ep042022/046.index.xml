500 PM PDT Fri Jul 8 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
downgraded Tropical Storm Bonnie, located several hundred miles <br/>
west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California <br/>
peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southwestern Mexico:<br/>
Shower activity associated with a broad area of low pressure located <br/>
several hundred miles southwest of the southwestern coast of Mexico <br/>
is gradually becoming better organized.  Environmental conditions <br/>
appear conducive for further development, and a tropical depression <br/>
is likely to form over the central or western part of the eastern <br/>
North Pacific basin later this weekend or early next week while the <br/>
system moves generally westward at 15 to 20 mph.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
West of Central America:<br/>
A low pressure area is expected to form west of the coast of Central <br/>
America by early next week.  Environmental conditions are expected <br/>
to be conducive for some gradual development of this system next <br/>
week while it moves generally westward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Bonnie Discussion Number  46
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
800 PM PDT Fri Jul 08 2022
 
Bonnie continues to produce an area of deep convection near the 
center, but stable air is entraining into the circulation and some 
dry slots have become evident during the past couple of hours.  The 
Dvorak intensity estimates from CIMSS at the University of 
Wisconsin, SAB, and TAFB range from 35 to 55 kt, and based on that 
data, the initial intensity is nudged down to 50 kt for this 
advisory.
 
Bonnie is currently over cool 24C waters and it is headed for even
cooler waters during the next day or so.  These unfavorable oceanic
conditions combined with a stable air mass should cause additional
weakening, and Bonnie will likely become a post-tropical cyclone by
late Saturday.  The post-tropical system should open into a trough
late in the weekend or early next week when it moves into a region
of moderate to strong vertical wind shear.
 
The tropical storm is moving relatively quickly west-northwestward 
at 17 kt.  A turn to the west within the low-level flow is expected 
on Saturday, and that motion should continue until Bonnie 
dissipates.  The models are in good agreement, and this forecast 
remains near the middle of the guidance envelope.
