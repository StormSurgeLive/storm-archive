Tropical Storm Bonnie Advisory Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
400 PM CDT Sun Jul 03 2022
 
...BONNIE CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN...
...ROUGH SURF AFFECTING PORTIONS OF THE COASTS OF GUATEMALA AND
SOUTHERN MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 400 PM CDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...12.3N 94.1W
ABOUT 280 MI...450 KM SSE OF SALINA CRUZ MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...70 MPH...110 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 285 DEGREES AT 17 MPH...28 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...993 MB...29.33 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests along the southern and southwestern coasts of Mexico
should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bonnie was
located near latitude 12.3 North, longitude 94.1 West. Bonnie is
moving toward the west-northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h), and this 
general motion should continue for the next several days. On the 
forecast track, the core of Bonnie is expected to remain south, but 
move parallel to, the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico 
during the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast during 
the next day or so, and Bonnie is expected to become a hurricane 
tonight. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 993 mb (29.33 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: The outer rain bands of Bonnie could cause areas of heavy 
rainfall during the next couple of days across portions of extreme 
southern and southwestern Mexico.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Bonnie will affect portions of the coasts
of Guatemala, and southern and southwestern Mexico during the next
few days.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Bonnie Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
400 PM CDT Sun Jul 03 2022
 
Convective banding associated Bonnie has continued to increase 
since the previous advisory, with the primary band now wrapping 
completely around the estimated center. Visible satellite imagery 
and a recent ATMS microwave overpass suggest that the inner core 
also continues to become better established. The latest subjective
Dvorak estimates are 65 and 55 kt, from TAFB and SAB respectively, 
and UW/CIMSS Advanced Dvorak Technique estimates have increased 
to a little above 55 kt.  Based on the these data, the initial 
intensity has been raised to 60 kt for this advisory.
 
The outflow over Bonnie is still somewhat restricted over the 
eastern portion of the circulation owing to some moderate easterly 
shear.  The shear, however, is not likely to be strong enough to 
prevent strengthening, and with warm SSTs and a moist atmosphere 
ahead, Bonnie is forecast to steadily intensify during the next 36 
hours or so.  The NHC intensity forecast now calls for a little 
faster rate of strengthening during the first day or so, but shows 
a similar peak intensity as the previous advisory as northeasterly 
shear is expected to increase over the system between 48 and 72 
hours. After that time, decreasing SSTs and a drier mid-level 
environment are likely to cause gradual weakening late in the 
period.  The updated intensity forecast is close to the ICON 
consensus aid, but is a little below the SHIPS and HWRF guidance.   
 
Bonnie is moving west-northwestward or 285/15 kt. There has been no 
change to the track forecast philosophy.  Bonnie is forecast to 
remain on a west-northwestward heading to the south of a mid-level 
ridge over the next several days, and this motion will steer 
Bonnie generally south of, but parallel to, the coast of southern 
and southwestern Mexico. The track guidance remains tightly 
clustered, and the NHC track lies near the middle of the guidance 
envelope. 
 
The main impact from Bonnie is expected to be rough surf and the
potential for rip currents along the coast of Guatemala 
through tonight and southern/southwestern Mexico Monday and 
Tuesday.
