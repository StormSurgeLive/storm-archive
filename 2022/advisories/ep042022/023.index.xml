SUMMARY OF 400 AM CDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...11.6N 90.6W
ABOUT 160 MI...255 KM S OF PUERTO SAN JOSE GUATEMALA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 275 DEGREES AT 16 MPH...26 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests along the coasts of Guatemala and southern and 
southwestern Mexico should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bonnie was 
located near latitude 11.6 North, longitude 90.6 West. Bonnie is 
moving toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h).  A westward to 
west-northwestward motion should continue for the next several days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and 
Bonnie is expected to become a hurricane by Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Bonnie can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header
WTPZ44 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Areas of heavy rainfall are possible during the next 
couple of days across portions of El Salvador, Guatemala, and 
southern and southwestern Mexico.  This rainfall could cause some 
instances of flash flooding and mudslides across the region.

SURF:  Swells generated by Bonnie will affect portions of the coasts 
of El Salvador, Guatemala, and southern and southwestern Mexico 
during the next couple of days.  These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Bonnie Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
400 AM CDT Sun Jul 03 2022
 
Geostationary satellite imagery shows a large, persistent convective 
cloud mass displaced to the west of Bonnie's low-level center by 
some easterly shear. Infrared cloud top temperatures colder than -80 
deg C indicate the convection remains vigorous, and it is showing 
more signs of curvature in recent imagery after appearing somewhat 
amorphous overnight. Unfortunately, no recent microwave or 
scatterometer data are available to assess recent structural 
changes. A blend of the subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and 
SAB supports holding the initial intensity at 50 kt.
 
Environmental conditions appear favorable for Bonnie to strengthen 
during the next few days. In the near term, the deep-layer easterly 
shear is forecast to slightly diminish while Bonnie traverses warm 
SSTs of 28-29 deg C within a moist mid-level environment. The 
official NHC forecast calls for Bonnie to become a hurricane by 
Monday and continue strengthening during the next 48 h or so. While 
not explicitly forecast, the SHIPS guidance suggests some increased 
potential for rapid intensification. The latest NHC forecast is 
raised slightly higher than the previous one, in line with the IVCN 
consensus aid. Increasing northeasterly shear and gradually cooler 
SSTs along its forecast track should cause Bonnie's intensity to 
level off and gradually decrease by days 4-5.

Bonnie is still moving quickly westward at 275/14 kt. A mid-level 
ridge to the north of the cyclone should steer Bonnie westward to 
west-northwestward during the next several days, roughly parallel to 
the coast of southern Mexico. The track guidance remains in 
excellent agreement, and the latest NHC forecast is very similar to 
the previous one given the tightly clustered track models. Once 
again, this forecast keeps the center of Bonnie far enough offshore 
that the tropical-storm-force winds are not forecast to reach the 
coast of Central America or Mexico at this time. However, interests 
in coastal El Salvador, Guatemala, and southern and southwestern 
Mexico should closely monitor updates to Bonnie's forecast track, as 
a slight northward adjustment to the track could require tropical 
storm watches for portions of this coastline.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Areas of heavy rainfall are possible across portions of El 
Salvador, Guatemala, and southern Mexico during the next couple of 
days.  This rainfall could cause some instances of flash flooding 
and mudslides across the region.
 
2. Interests along the coasts of Guatemala and southern and 
southwestern Mexico should monitor the progress of this system. 
While the center of Bonnie is forecast to stay offshore, any 
northward adjustment in the track forecast could require the 
issuance of a tropical storm watch for part of this area.
