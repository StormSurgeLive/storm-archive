Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 AM PDT Sat Jul 9 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Bonnie, located several hundred miles west-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southwestern Mexico:<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity continues to show signs of <br/>
organization in association with an area of low pressure located <br/>
several hundred miles southwest of the southwestern coast of Mexico. <br/>
If these trends continue, a tropical depression could form as soon <br/>
as this afternoon. This system is forecast to move generally <br/>
westward at 15 to 20 mph across the central part of the eastern  <br/>
North Pacific basin over the next several days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure is forecast to form south of the southern <br/>
coast of Mexico by early next week.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
expected to be conducive for some gradual development of this system <br/>
next week while it moves generally westward at 10 to 15 mph, <br/>
remaining offshore of the southern coast of Mexico. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Bonnie Discussion Number  48
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
800 AM PDT Sat Jul 09 2022
 
The last few deep convective cloud tops below -50C dissipated with
Bonnie at around 0600 UTC last night. In the absence of any deeper
convection since then, Bonnie's remaining time as a tropical
cyclone is fleeting. Subjective and objective Dvorak estimates
continue to decrease, and the initial intensity has been reduced to
35 kt in this advisory.
 
The initial motion continues just north of due west at 280/18 kt. As
Bonnie continues weakening, it will be increasingly steered westward
by the low-level trade wind flow. The latest track forecast is
largely an update of the previous one but just a bit faster,
remaining close to the center of the track guidance envelope.
 
Bonnie is now over sub-24C sea-surface temperatures and embedded
in a very dry, stable atmospheric environment. These factors are
expected to prevent additional deep convective activity over the
system. If deeper convection does not return soon near the center,
Bonnie could become a post-tropical cyclone as early as this
afternoon. This expectation is reflected in the latest forecast with
Bonnie becoming a remnant low in 12 h, with the closed circulation
opening up into a trough in 48 h.
