BULLETIN
Hurricane Bonnie Advisory Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
1000 PM CDT Sun Jul 03 2022
 
...BONNIE BECOMES THE THIRD HURRICANE OF THE 2022 EASTERN NORTH
PACIFIC SEASON...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1000 PM CDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...13.2N 95.5W
ABOUT 210 MI...335 KM S OF SALINA CRUZ MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...80 MPH...130 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 17 MPH...28 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...987 MB...29.15 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests along the southern and southwestern coasts of Mexico
should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Bonnie was
located near latitude 13.2 North, longitude 95.5 West.  Bonnie is
moving toward the west-northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h), and this
general motion should continue for the next several days.  On the
forecast track, the core of Bonnie is expected to remain south of,
but move parallel to, the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico
during the next couple of days.
 
Satellite images indicate that the maximum sustained winds have
increased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher gusts.  Additional
strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Outer rain bands north of Bonnieâ€™s track will bring
periods of heavy showers into portions of southern Mexico through
Monday night. These bands are expected to produce between 1 and 3
inches of rain across southern Oaxaca and Guerrero, with locally
higher totals along the southernmost coastal areas in Oaxaca.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Bonnie will affect portions of the coasts
of Guatemala, and southern and southwestern Mexico during the next
few days.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

Hurricane Bonnie Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
1000 PM CDT Sun Jul 03 2022
 
Bonnie's cloud pattern continues to become better organized on both
geostationary and microwave imagery.  Cold cloud tops are beginning
to surround a ragged eye on infrared images and there is nearly a
closed ring evident from passive microwave data, indicating that
the inner core continues to become more defined.   Using a blend
of Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB, the current intensity is
increased to 70 kt for this advisory.
 
The hurricane has strong upper-level outflow over its western
semicircle and limited outflow to the east, due to moderate
easterly shear.  However, this shear is not likely to offset the
otherwise conducive environmental factors of warm ocean waters and a
moist atmosphere for the next couple of days.  The SHIPS Rapid
Intensification, RI, Index shows a little more than a 30 percent
chance of RI during the next day or so.  The official intensity
forecast shows more strengthening than in the previous advisories
and is a blend of the LGEM and HWRF guidance through 48 hours, and 
is close to the Decay-SHIPS model after that time interval.  Gradual
weakening is likely in 3-5 days due to cooler SSTs and lower
humidities.
 
Bonnie moved just a bit north of the previous track, but appears to
still be on a west-northwestward heading or about 290/15 kt.
A mid-level ridge to the north of the cyclone is forecast to be
mostly maintained over the next several days.  This should result in
a continued west-northwestward or westward motion through the
forecast period.  The official track forecast follows the
multi-model consensus and keeps the hurricane moving parallel to and
offshore of the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico.
 
The main impact from Bonnie is expected to be rough surf and the
potential for rip currents along the coast of Guatemala
through tonight and southern/southwestern Mexico Monday and
Tuesday.
