Hurricane Bonnie Advisory Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
400 AM CDT Mon Jul 04 2022
 
...BONNIE EXPECTED TO BRING ROUGH SURF TO PORTIONS OF THE COAST OF
SOUTHERN MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 400 AM CDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...13.6N 97.3W
ABOUT 155 MI...250 KM SSW OF PUERTO ANGEL MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...80 MPH...130 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 285 DEGREES AT 18 MPH...30 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...987 MB...29.15 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests along the southern and southwestern coasts of Mexico
should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Bonnie was located 
near latitude 13.6 North, longitude 97.3 West. Bonnie is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 18 mph (30 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue through midweek.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Bonnie is expected to move parallel to, but 
remain south of, the coasts of southern and southwestern Mexico 
during the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast through midweek.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: The outer rain bands of Bonnie could cause areas of heavy
rainfall during the next couple of days across portions of southern
and southwestern Mexico.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Bonnie will affect portions of the coasts
of southern and southwestern Mexico during the next couple of days.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

Hurricane Bonnie Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
1000 PM CDT Sun Jul 03 2022
 
Bonnie's cloud pattern continues to become better organized on both
geostationary and microwave imagery.  Cold cloud tops are beginning
to surround a ragged eye on infrared images and there is nearly a
closed ring evident from passive microwave data, indicating that
the inner core continues to become more defined.   Using a blend
of Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB, the current intensity is
increased to 70 kt for this advisory.
 
The hurricane has strong upper-level outflow over its western
semicircle and limited outflow to the east, due to moderate
easterly shear.  However, this shear is not likely to offset the
otherwise conducive environmental factors of warm ocean waters and a
moist atmosphere for the next couple of days.  The SHIPS Rapid
Intensification, RI, Index shows a little more than a 30 percent
chance of RI during the next day or so.  The official intensity
forecast shows more strengthening than in the previous advisories
and is a blend of the LGEM and HWRF guidance through 48 hours, and 
is close to the Decay-SHIPS model after that time interval.  Gradual
weakening is likely in 3-5 days due to cooler SSTs and lower
humidities.
 
Bonnie moved just a bit north of the previous track, but appears to
still be on a west-northwestward heading or about 290/15 kt.
A mid-level ridge to the north of the cyclone is forecast to be
mostly maintained over the next several days.  This should result in
a continued west-northwestward or westward motion through the
forecast period.  The official track forecast follows the
multi-model consensus and keeps the hurricane moving parallel to and
offshore of the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico.
 
The main impact from Bonnie is expected to be rough surf and the
potential for rip currents along the coast of Guatemala
through tonight and southern/southwestern Mexico Monday and
Tuesday.
