NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 PM PDT Fri Jul 8 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Bonnie, located several hundred miles west-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southwestern Mexico:<br/>
Shower activity associated with a broad area of low pressure located <br/>
several hundred miles southwest of the southwestern coast of Mexico <br/>
has changed little in organization during the past several hours. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear conducive for further development, <br/>
and a tropical depression is likely to form over the central or <br/>
western part of the eastern North Pacific basin later this weekend <br/>
or early next week while the system moves generally westward at 15 <br/>
to 20 mph.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
West of Central America:<br/>
A low pressure area is expected to form west of the coast of Central <br/>
America by early next week.  Environmental conditions are expected <br/>
to be conducive for some gradual development of this system next <br/>
week while it moves generally westward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Bonnie Discussion Number  47
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
200 AM PDT Sat Jul 09 2022

Deep convection associated with Bonnie has decreased over the past 
several hours, with only a small area of convection remaining in 
the northeastern quadrant.  The various satellite intensity 
estimates are in the 30-55 kt range, and based on these and the 
convective trends the initial intensity is reduced to 45 kt.

Bonnie should continue to weaken as it moves over cool sea surface 
temperatures and as it ingests a drier air mass.  The system is 
expected to become a post-tropical cyclone by 24 h, and the global 
models are in good agreement that the system will weaken to a 
trough by 60 h.  The new intensity forecast has some minor 
adjustments from the previous forecast.

The initial motion is now 280/17 kt.  Bonnie or its remnants should 
move quickly westward in the low-level trade winds until the 
system dissipates.  The new forecast track is in the center of the 
tightly-clustered track guidance.
