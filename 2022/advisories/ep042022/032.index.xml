Hurricane Bonnie Advisory Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
1000 AM CDT Tue Jul 05 2022
 
...BONNIE BECOMES A MAJOR HURRICANE...
...FIRST OF THE EASTERN NORTH PACIFIC SEASON...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1000 AM CDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.3N 104.3W
ABOUT 250 MI...400 KM SW OF ZIHUATANEJO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...115 MPH...185 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 280 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...964 MB...28.47 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Bonnie was
located near latitude 15.3 North, longitude 104.3 West. Bonnie is
moving toward the west near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A westward to 
west-northwestward motion is forecast through the period with a 
slight decrease in forward speed during the next couple of days.  On 
the forecast track, the core of Bonnie is expected to move parallel 
to, but remain south of the coast of southwestern Mexico today.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 115 mph (185 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Bonnie is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in strength 
are possible through Thursday.  A gradual weakening trend is 
expected to begin thereafter.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 964 mb (28.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
---------------------- 
SURF:  Swells generated by Bonnie will affect portions of the coasts
of southern and southwestern Mexico during the next day or two.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Hurricane Bonnie Discussion Number  31
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
400 AM CDT Tue Jul 05 2022
 
While Bonnie continues to generate well-organized central 
convection with cloud tops temperatures near -80C, the eye has 
become less distinct over the past several hours.  There has been 
little change in the various subjective and objective satellite 
intensity estimates, so the initial intensity remains 90 kt in best 
agreement with subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and 
SAB.

The hurricane is starting to experience moderate northerly to 
northeasterly shear, and this will likely continue through the next 
24-36 h.  The shear is expected to limit additional strengthening, 
and the new intensity forecast follows the overall trend of the 
guidance in calling for a 90-95 kt intensity during this time.  
After 36 h, the shear is forecast to diminish, but by that time 
Bonnie will be moving over cooler sea surface temperatures and into 
a drier air mass.  This should lead to gradual weakening starting 
after 60 h and continuing for the remainder of the forecast period.

The initial motion is 290/15 kt.  A deep-layer ridge to the north 
of the hurricane should cause a general west-northwestward to 
westward motion through the forecast period, with a slowing of the 
forward speed during the first 48 h as the cyclone passes to the 
south of a weakness in the ridge.  The new forecast track is in the 
center of the tightly-clustered track guidance and lies close to 
the various consensus models.
 
Although the core of Bonnie is expected to remain well south of
Mexico, rough surf and the potential for rip currents will continue
to affect southwestern Mexico for another day or two.
