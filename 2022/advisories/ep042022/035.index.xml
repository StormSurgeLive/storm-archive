At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Bonnie was located
near latitude 15.9 North, longitude 108.3 West. Bonnie is moving
toward the west near 14 mph (22 km/h). A westward to west-
northwestward motion is forecast through the week with a slight
decrease in forward speed during the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 100 mph (155 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is expected through 
Thursday.  Gradual weakening is forecast to begin on Thursday 
night and continue through Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 971 mb (28.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Bonnie will continue to affect portions
of the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next day or so.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.

Hurricane Bonnie Discussion Number  35
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
300 AM MDT Wed Jul 06 2022
 
Bonnie continues to feel the effects of north-northeasterly shear, 
with the central convection becoming less organized during the past 
few hours.  The various subjective and objective satellite 
intensity estimates have trended downward since the last advisory, 
and based on this the initial intensity is lowered to 85 kt.  This 
could be a little generous, as the CIMSS SATCON and ADT estimates 
are currently 65-70 kt
 
The current shear is likely to diminish during the next 24 h.  
However, the sea surface temperatures are expected to decrease 
along the forecast track, with the cyclone reaching the 26C 
isotherm in about 48 h and moving over colder water after that.  In 
addition, Bonnie is likely to encounter a much drier air mass after 
about 24 h.  The new intensity forecast now calls for Bobbie to 
change little in strength during the next 24-36 h, followed by 
steady weakening.  The cyclone is forecast to become post-tropical 
in about 96 h and to degenerate to a remnant low pressure area by 
120 h.  The new intensity forecast has some downward adjustments 
from the previous forecast and follows the general trend of the 
intensity guidance.
 
Bonnie is moving 280/12 kt along the southern periphery of a 
mid-level ridge to the north.  This ridge is forecast to weaken a 
bit in the next day or so and slightly reduce the forward speed of 
the system for a couple of days.  Later in the forecast period, 
Bonnie is expected to weaken and become a shallow circulation, 
which would result in the cyclone turning westward and accelerating 
in the low-level trade wind flow.  The new forecast track is an 
update of the previous track and lies near the consensus models, 
which are between the slightly faster UKMET and the slightly slower 
GFS.
 
Although Bonnie will be moving farther away from the southwestern
coast of Mexico, rough surf and the potential for rip currents will
continue to affect portions of the coast of southwestern Mexico for
another day or so.
