<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Bonnie, located several hundred miles southwest of the southern tip <br/>
of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southern Mexico:<br/>
A tropical wave located several hundred miles south of the southern <br/>
coast of Mexico continues to produce a large area of disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions are expected to <br/>
be conducive for gradual development, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form well southwest of the southwestern coast of Mexico <br/>
over the weekend or early next week while the disturbance moves <br/>
westward or west-northwestward at about 15 mph.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Central America:<br/>
A low pressure area is expected to form late in the weekend or <br/>
early next week south of the coast of Central America.  Subsequent <br/>
slow development of this system is possible as it moves generally <br/>
westward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Bonnie Discussion Number  43
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
200 AM PDT Fri Jul 08 2022

Convection associated with Bonnie had decreased significantly in 
coverage and intensity since the last advisory, with the primary 
convection now confined to the northeastern quadrant.  Satellite 
intensity estimates have also decreased, and the initial intensity 
is reduced to a possibly generous 75 kt.  The cyclone has passed 
over the 26C isotherm, and it continues to move over colder water 
and into a drier air mass.  Thus, steady to rapid weakening is 
expected, with Bonnie weakening to a tropical storm in less than 24 
h and becoming a post-tropical low by 48 h.  The system is forecast 
to degenerate to a trough after 72 h, and the global model guidance 
suggests this could happen earlier than currently forecast.

The initial motion is 285/16 kt.  A low- to mid-level ridge to the 
north of Bonnie is expected to steer the cyclone or its remnants 
generally westward with a slight increase in forward speed until 
dissipation.  The new track forecast is an update of the previous 
forecast and lies in the middle of the tightly clustered track 
guidance.
