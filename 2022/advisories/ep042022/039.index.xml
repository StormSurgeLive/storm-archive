1100 PM PDT Wed Jul 6 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Bonnie, located several hundred miles south-southwest of the <br/>

<br/>
Offshore of Southern Mexico:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave located <br/>
several hundred miles south of the southern coast of Mexico have <br/>
become a little better organized since yesterday.  Environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to be conducive for gradual development, <br/>
and a tropical depression is likely to form well south or southwest <br/>
of the southwestern coast of Mexico over the weekend while the <br/>
disturbance moves generally west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph.<br/>

Maximum sustained winds decreased to near 90 mph (150 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Weakening is forecast, and Bonnie is expected to
weaken below hurricane strength by Friday and become a post-
tropical cyclone in a couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles
(110 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).

Hurricane Bonnie Discussion Number  39
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
300 AM MDT Thu Jul 07 2022
 
The convection associated with Bonnie is gradually losing
organization as the cyclone continues to feel the effects of shear
and moves over cooler waters. However, while there has been no
distinguishable eye feature for several hours in IR imagery, a
just-received GMI 37 GHz microwave overpass shows a well-defined
low-level eye under the convective overcast. Objective and
subjective satellite intensity estimates range from 60-90 kt, which
is a greater than normal spread.  However, the estimates are
trending downward, and based on this the initial intensity is
decreased to an uncertain 80 kt.  The 34-kt wind radii have been
reduced based on recent scatterometer data.
 
Bonnie is moving over progressively cooler water and into a dry 
air mass. This combination should cause steady to rapid weakening.  
Current expectations are that Bonnie will stop producing convection 
between 48-60 h and become a post-tropical cyclone.  The system is 
expected to decay to a remnant low by 72 h, and the dynamical 
models are in good agreement that it will weaken to a trough by 96 
h.  The new intensity forecast follows the overall trend of the 
intensity guidance and has only minor adjustments from the previous 
forecast.
 
The initial motion is 290/12 kt as Bonnie is steered by a mid-level
ridge to its north.  There is no change to the track forecast
philosophy and little change to the forecast from the previous
advisory. The ridge is predicted to steer Bonnie west-northwestward
for the next couple of days until its circulation weakens and the
resulting shallower vortex follows the faster, westward trade wind
flow.  The new track forecast lies in the middle of the tightly
clustered track guidance.
