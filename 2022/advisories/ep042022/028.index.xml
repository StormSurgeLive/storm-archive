BULLETIN
Hurricane Bonnie Advisory Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
1000 AM CDT Mon Jul 04 2022
 
...BONNIE STRENGTHENING...
...BRINGING ROUGH SURF AND THREAT OF RIP CURRENTS TO PORTIONS OF THE
COAST OF SOUTHERN MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1000 AM CDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...13.7N 99.0W
ABOUT 230 MI...370 KM SSE OF ACAPULCO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 285 DEGREES AT 18 MPH...30 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...982 MB...29.00 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests along the southern and southwestern coasts of Mexico
should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Bonnie was
located near latitude 13.7 North, longitude 99.0 West. Bonnie is
moving toward the west-northwest near 18 mph (30 km/h). A west- 
northwestward motion with some decrease in forward speed is expected
during the next few days.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Bonnie is expected to move parallel to, but remain south of, the 
coasts of southern and southwestern Mexico during the next day or 
two. 
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 90 mph (150 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is forecast 
today, followed by little overall change in intensity Tuesday and 
Wednesday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 982 mb (29.00 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: The outer rain bands of Bonnie could cause areas of heavy
rainfall during the next day or so across portions of southern
and southwestern Mexico.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Bonnie will affect portions of the coasts
of southern and southwestern Mexico during the next couple of days.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Hurricane Bonnie Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
1000 AM CDT Mon Jul 04 2022
 
Bonnie's satellite presentation has improved this morning with a
ragged eye becoming more apparent in both infrared and visible
satellite imagery.  An earlier AMSR2 microwave overpass that
arrived after the release of the previous advisory, and more
recent SSMIS imagery revealed a fairly well-defined low- to
mid-level eye feature.  Subjective Dvorak estimates from both TAFB
and SAB are T4.5 or 77 kt.  Objective estimates from UW/CIMSS are
lagging a bit, but recent raw T-numbers have increased as the eye
has become better defined.  The advisory intensity is set at 80
kt, near the higher end of the estimates due to the continued
improvement in structure.
 
Bonnie's intensity forecast is a bit tricky this morning as
expected subtle changes in shear throughout the forecast
period could have larger-than-normal implications on the
forecast.  In the very near term, some additional strengthening is
likely while Bonnie remains within an area of moderate northeasterly
shear and otherwise favorable environmental conditions. The NHC
wind speed forecast is near the high end of the guidance during the
first 12-24 hours given the recent upward trend in organization. The
shear is forecast to increase on Tuesday, which the guidance 
suggests will cause Bonnie's intensity to plateau or perhaps 
fluctuate over the next 2-3 days.  By 72 hours, global models now 
indicate that the shear will decrease while the system is still 
over marginally warm water.  As a result, the NHC forecast keeps 
Bonnie's intensity slightly higher through 96 h than the previous 
advisory.  Shortly after that time, rapid weakening is likely to 
begin as the cyclone moves over waters less than 26C and into a 
less favorable thermodynamic environment.
 
Bonnie is moving briskly westward to west-northwestward with a
longer term motion of 285/16 kt.  The track forecast reasoning has
not changed over the past day or so.  Bonnie should continue to
move generally west-northwestward with some reduction in forward
speed while it is steered by a large mid-level to the north.  This
motion will take Bonnie roughly parallel to but well offshore the
coasts of southern and southwestern Mexico during the next day or
two. The latest NHC track forecast is again an update of the
previous advisory, and it remains close to the TVCE multi-model
consensus aid.
 
The forecast keeps tropical-storm-force winds associated with
Bonnie offshore the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico, but
coastal locations can still expect rough surf and the potential for
rip currents today and Tuesday as Bonnie passes offshore.
