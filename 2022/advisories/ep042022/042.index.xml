<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Bonnie, located several hundred miles southwest of the southern tip <br/>
of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southern Mexico:<br/>
A tropical wave located several hundred miles south of the southern <br/>
coast of Mexico continues to produce a large area of disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions are expected to <br/>
be conducive for gradual development, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form well southwest of the southwestern coast of Mexico <br/>

Hurricane Bonnie Discussion Number  42
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
800 PM PDT Thu Jul 07 2022
 
Bonnie appears to once again be on the cusp of weakening this 
evening based on satellite imagery. A 2112 UTC GMI microwave pass 
showed the storm had about a 30 nm diameter eye, which was also 
apparent on visible imagery.  Since this overpass, the eye has 
become obscured by clouds and the infrared imagery shows the cloud 
tops are warming throughout the central dense overcast. Subjective 
Dvorak intensity estimates range between 90 kt and 65 kt.  The 
initial intensity was held at 80 kt, which is a blend of the TAFB 
and SAB estimates.

The hurricane is quickly approaching the 26 C ocean surface 
temperature threshold.  There is also a considerably dry air mass 
working its way around the system.  These two environmental 
conditions should weaken Bonnie, which is expected to become 
post-tropical within about two days.  The official intensity 
forecast is similar to the previous advisory and lies close the 
consensus guidance.

The initial motion has turned more westward and increased to near 
15 kt.  The track philosophy has not changed.  A mid-level ridge 
continues to steer Bonnie westward and as the storm weakens, it is 
expected to increase in forward speed as it follows the lower trade 
winds.  The model guidance is very tightly clustered and the NHC 
track forecast remains quite similar to both the previous advisory 
and the consensus aids.
