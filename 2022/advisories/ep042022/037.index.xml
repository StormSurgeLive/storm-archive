showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions are expected <br/>
to be conducive for gradual development, and a tropical depression <br/>
is likely to form well south or southwest of the southwestern coast <br/>
of Mexico over the weekend while the disturbance moves generally <br/>
west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM MDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Bonnie was located
near latitude 16.5 North, longitude 110.1 West. Bonnie is moving
toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A westward to
west-northwestward motion at a slightly faster forward speed is
expected over the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Weakening is forecast to commence later tonight, and 
continue through Saturday.  Bonnie is expected to become a 
post-tropical cyclone in a few days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 972 mb (28.71 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Bonnie will continue to affect portions
of the coast of southwestern Mexico through tonight. These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.

Hurricane Bonnie Discussion Number  37
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
300 PM MDT Wed Jul 06 2022
 
The satellite presentation of Bonnie has not changed much since
this morning.  At times, the small eye has become a little more
distinct and warmer in infrared satellite pictures, but then
becomes cloud filled.  This has led to a waffling of subjective
Dvorak estimates between about T4.5 and T5.0 depending on the
infrared eye temperature of each picture.  Objective numbers
remain lower, but have increased somewhat today.  The initial
intensity is maintained at 90 kt, and is based on the latest
SAB Dvorak classification.  Recent scatterometer data have helped
confirm the 34- and 50-kt wind radii.
 
Bonnie will be moving over gradually decreasing sea surface
temperatures later tonight and into a drier and more stable
environment which is likely to begin the weakening process.
After that time, a faster rate of filling is forecast as Bonnie
moves over sub 26C sea surface temperatures.  The cyclone is
forecast to become post-tropical in about 72 hours, and dissipate
by the end of the 5-day forecast period. The updated NHC intensity
forecast is closest to the lower LGEM guidance.
 
Bonnie is moving on a motion between west and west-northwest at
about 10 kt.  A mid-level ridge to the north of the system should
continue to steer the cyclone westward to west-northwestward during
the next couple of days.  A faster and more westward motion is
likely by 72 hours as Bonnie weakens and is steered by the low level
trade wind flow.  The new forecast is essentially an update of the
previous advisory and it lies closest to a blend of the latest 
GFS and ECMWF tracks.
