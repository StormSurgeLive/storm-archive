Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 AM PDT Sat Jul 9 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Bonnie, located several hundred miles west-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southwestern Mexico:<br/>
Recent satellite imagery indicates that the coverage and <br/>
organization of shower and thunderstorm activity has increased <br/>
significantly overnight in association with an area of low pressure <br/>
located several hundred miles southwest of the southwestern coast of <br/>
Mexico. Environmental conditions appear conducive for further <br/>
development, and a tropical depression is likely to form over the <br/>
central part of the eastern North Pacific basin today or tomorrow <br/>
while the system moves generally westward at 15 to 20 mph.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
West of Central America:<br/>
An area of low pressure is forecast to form west of the coast of <br/>
Central America by early next week.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
expected to be conducive for some gradual development of this system <br/>
next week while it moves generally westward at 10 to 15 mph, <br/>
remaining offshore of the southern coast of Mexico. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Bonnie Discussion Number  47
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
200 AM PDT Sat Jul 09 2022

Deep convection associated with Bonnie has decreased over the past 
several hours, with only a small area of convection remaining in 
the northeastern quadrant.  The various satellite intensity 
estimates are in the 30-55 kt range, and based on these and the 
convective trends the initial intensity is reduced to 45 kt.

Bonnie should continue to weaken as it moves over cool sea surface 
temperatures and as it ingests a drier air mass.  The system is 
expected to become a post-tropical cyclone by 24 h, and the global 
models are in good agreement that the system will weaken to a 
trough by 60 h.  The new intensity forecast has some minor 
adjustments from the previous forecast.

The initial motion is now 280/17 kt.  Bonnie or its remnants should 
move quickly westward in the low-level trade winds until the 
system dissipates.  The new forecast track is in the center of the 
tightly-clustered track guidance.
