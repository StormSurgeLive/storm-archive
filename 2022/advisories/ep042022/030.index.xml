BULLETIN
Hurricane Bonnie Advisory Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
1000 PM CDT Mon Jul 04 2022
 
...BONNIE STRENGTHENS FURTHER...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1000 PM CDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.5N 101.4W
ABOUT 220 MI...355 KM S OF ZIHUATANEJO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...105 MPH...165 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 285 DEGREES AT 16 MPH...26 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...974 MB...28.77 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Bonnie was located 
near latitude 14.5 North, longitude 101.4 West. Bonnie is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h). A 
west-northwestward or westward motion with some decrease in forward 
speed is expected during the next few days. On the forecast track, 
the core of Bonnie is expected to move parallel to, but remain 
south of, the coasts of southern and southwestern Mexico during the 
next day or two.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 105 mph (165 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is forecast
through tomorrow morning, followed by little change in intensity 
until Wednesday.  A gradual weakening trend is expected to begin 
thereafter.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 974 mb (28.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: The outer rain bands of Bonnie could cause areas of heavy
rainfall during the next day or so across portions of southern
and southwestern Mexico.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Bonnie will affect portions of the coasts
of southern and southwestern Mexico during the next couple of days.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

Hurricane Bonnie Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
1000 PM CDT Mon Jul 04 2022
 
Satellite imagery indicates that Bonnie continues to gradually 
strengthen this evening.  A 0112 UTC SSMIS microwave pass reveals a 
compact inner core with an eye less than 10 nm.  Upper-level outflow 
and convective banding appears to be fairly well-defined over the 
western and southern quadrants of the storm.  Subjective Dvorak 
intensity estimates range from 77 kt to 90 kt. The initial intensity 
has been increased to 90 kt in favor of the higher estimate, based 
on increasingly cold cloud tops near the core.

Bonnie is expected to be in a relatively conducive environment for 
the next day or so.  Based on current satellite trends, some 
additional strengthening seems likely.  However, most of the 
intensity guidance does not show significant intensification beyond 
24 hours, possibly due to the moderate vertical shear in the 
near-storm environment.  By Wednesday, the wind shear is expected to 
decrease, but lower mid-level relative humidities and cooling sea 
surface temperatures should become a limiting factor.  Therefore, 
the official forecast shows some additional short-term strengthening 
followed by gradual weakening.  This forecast is slightly higher 
than the previous advisory for the first 24 hours.

The storm has jogged a little to the north in the past few hours, 
but the longer-term motion is still west-northwestward at 14 kt.  
Bonnie is being steered by a deep-layer ridge to its north and 
north-northeast which is expected to build westward and keep the 
system on a general west-northward trajectory.  The NHC track 
prediction is shifted slightly north of the previous one on account 
of the shorter-term northward shift, and is very near the consensus 
model forecast.
 
Although the core of Bonnie is expected to remain well south of
Mexico, rough surf and the potential for rip currents will continue
to affect southwestern Mexico for another day or two.
