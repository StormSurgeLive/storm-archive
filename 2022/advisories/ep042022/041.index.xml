Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 AM PDT Thu Jul 7 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Bonnie, located several hundred miles south-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southern Mexico:<br/>
A tropical wave located several hundred miles south of the southern <br/>
coast of Mexico continues to produce a large area of disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions are expected to <br/>
be conducive for gradual development, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form well south or southwest of the southwestern coast of <br/>
Mexico over the weekend or early next week while the disturbance <br/>
moves westward or west-northwestward at about 15 mph.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

Friday and then become a post-tropical cyclone on Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles
(110 km).  Over the past few hours, a Mexican navy automatic weather

Hurricane Bonnie Discussion Number  40
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
900 AM MDT Thu Jul 07 2022
 
The overall satellite presentation of Bonnie has not changed much 
this morning.  An earlier AMSR2 microwave overpass revealed a 
well-defined low-level eye, but the deep convection was fragmented 
over the southwestern portion of the circulation.  The latest 
subjective Dvorak current intensity (CI) numbers from TAFB and SAB 
are 5.0 and 4.0, respectively, which supports maintaining an 
intensity of 80 kt.  Bonnie will be crossing the 26C isotherm later 
today, and into a drier and more stable environment over the next 
24-48 hours.  These factors should result in steady to rapid 
weakening beginning later today or tonight. Simulated satellite 
imagery from the global models suggest Bonnie will cease to produce 
deep convection in 48-60 h, and the official forecast calls for 
Bonnie to become a remnant low by late Saturday.  Additional spin 
down is expected after that time, and the system should degenerate 
into a trough of low pressure shortly after day 3. 
 
Bonnie is moving west-northwestward at about 12 kt.  A subtropical 
ridge to the north of the system should continue to steer the storm 
westward to west-northwestward.  As Bonnie weakens it is expected to 
accelerate more westward as it comes under the influence of the 
stronger low-level trade wind flow.  The new forecast is similar to 
the previous advisory and remains near the center of the guidance 
envelope.
