Tropical Storm Bonnie Advisory Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
1000 AM CDT Sun Jul 03 2022
 
...BONNIE GRADUALLY STRENGTHENING...
...AREAS OF HEAVY RAIN AND ROUGH SURF AFFECTING PORTIONS OF THE
GUATEMALA AND THE SOUTHERN MEXICO COAST...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1000 AM CDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...11.9N 92.4W
ABOUT 205 MI...335 KM S OF TAPACHULA MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 280 DEGREES AT 16 MPH...26 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...995 MB...29.39 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests along the coasts of Guatemala and southern and
southwestern Mexico should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bonnie was
located near latitude 11.9 North, longitude 92.4 West. Bonnie is
moving toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h). A westward to
west-northwestward motion should continue for the next several 
days. On the forecast track, the core of Bonnie is expected to 
remain south, but move parallel to, the coast of southern and 
southwestern Mexico during the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Strengthening is expected during the next couple 
of days, and Bonnie is expected to become a hurricane tonight.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: The outer rain bands of Bonnie could cause areas of 
heavy rainfall during the next couple of days across portions of 
Guatemala, and southern and southwestern Mexico.  

SURF:  Swells generated by Bonnie will affect portions of the coasts
of Guatemala, and southern and southwestern Mexico during the next 
few days.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening 
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your 
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Bonnie Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
1000 AM CDT Sun Jul 03 2022
 
Bonnie appears to be gradually gaining strength. Satellite images 
show a strong convective band, with a significant amount of 
lightning, on the western side of the system. Recent microwave 
data indicate than an inner core is becoming better established, 
with hints of an eye apparent in the 37 GHz channel. The latest 
Dvorak classifications were both 3.5/55 kt from TAFB and SAB, and 
the initial intensity is nudged up to 55 kt based on that data.
 
The storm is currently experiencing a moderate amount of easterly 
shear, but that is expected to let up some during the next day or 
so. The improving upper-level wind pattern combined with a moist 
air mass and warm SSTs should allow Bonnie to steadily strengthen 
through Monday. Rapid intensification is a possibility, and the 
SHIPS model shows a fair chance (40 percent) of that occurring 
within the next 24 hours. In a couple of days, however, easterly 
shear is expected to increase and SSTs gradually cool beneath the 
system. These factors should end the strengthening trend and 
perhaps induce slow weakening. The NHC intensity forecast shows a 
faster rate of strengthening than the previous one in the short 
term, but is otherwise unchanged.   
 
Bonnie is still moving relatively quickly westward at 280/14 kt. A 
mid-level ridge to the north of the cyclone should steer Bonnie 
westward to west-northwestward during the next several days, roughly 
parallel to the coast of southern Mexico. The track models are in 
good agreement, and the new forecast lies close to the various 
consensus aids. Based on the forecast, no watches are required for 
Guatemala or southern/southwestern Mexico, but interests there 
should closely monitor updates, as a northward adjustment to the 
track could require tropical storm watches for portions of this 
coastline.

The main impact from Bonnie is expected to be rough surf and the 
potential for rip currents along the coast of Guatemala today and 
southern/southwestern Mexico Monday and Tuesday.
