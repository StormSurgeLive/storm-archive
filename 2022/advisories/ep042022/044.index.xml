500 AM PDT Fri Jul 8 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Bonnie, located several hundred miles west-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southwestern Mexico:<br/>
A tropical wave located several hundred miles south of the <br/>
southwestern coast of Mexico continues to produce a large area of <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions <br/>
are expected to be conducive for gradual development, and a <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form well southwest of the <br/>
southwestern coast of Mexico over the weekend or early next week <br/>
while the disturbance moves westward or west-northwestward at about <br/>
15 mph.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Central America:<br/>
A low pressure area is expected to form by early next week south of <br/>
the coast of Central America.  Environmental conditions are expected <br/>
to be conducive for gradual development of this system next week <br/>
while it moves generally westward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Bonnie Discussion Number  44
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
800 AM PDT Fri Jul 08 2022
 
Deep convection continues to quickly decrease near Bonnie, with a
small area remaining near and north of the surface center.  Dvorak 
satellite intensity estimates are falling, and a blend of 4 
0935 UTC microwave SATCON intensity values supports an initial 
intensity of 65 kt for this advisory.  Bonnie's moving over 25 deg 
C water with cooler oceanic surface temperatures and a drier, 
stable air mass along the forecast path of the cyclone.  Therefore, 
further weakening is likely with a loss of organized convection, 
and post-tropical status is predicted in 36 hours, possibly less.  
As shown in the global models and the NHC intensity forecast, 
Bonnie should degenerate into a trough in 4 days.
 
The initial motion is due west, or 280/17 kt.  Low- to 
mid-tropospheric easterly flow should steer the cyclone on a 
continued westward heading with a slight decrease in forward speed 
early Sunday.  The model guidance remains in good agreement with 
the future track of Bonnie through the period, and no appreciable 
changes were made from the previous advisory.
