...BONNIE CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN...
...BRINGING ROUGH SURF AND THREAT OF RIP CURRENTS TO PORTIONS OF THE
COAST OF SOUTHERN AND SOUTHWESTERN MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 400 PM CDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...13.9N 100.3W
ABOUT 210 MI...335 KM S OF ACAPULCO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...100 MPH...155 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 275 DEGREES AT 17 MPH...28 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...978 MB...28.88 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Bonnie was
located near latitude 13.9 North, longitude 100.3 West. Bonnie is
moving toward the west near 17 mph (28 km/h). A west to west-
northwest motion with some decrease in forward speed is expected
during the next few days. On the forecast track, the center of
Bonnie is expected to move parallel to, but remain south of, the
coasts of southern and southwestern Mexico during the next day or
two.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 100 mph (155 km/h)
with higher gusts. Some additional strengthening is forecast
through tonight, followed by little overall change in intensity
Tuesday and Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 978 mb (28.88 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: The outer rain bands of Bonnie could cause areas of heavy
rainfall during the next day or so across portions of southern
and southwestern Mexico.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Bonnie will affect portions of the coasts
of southern and southwestern Mexico during the next couple of days.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.

Hurricane Bonnie Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042022
400 PM CDT Mon Jul 04 2022
 
Bonnie continues to strengthen and it has a become a fairly well 
organized hurricane. Visible satellite images show a distinct eye 
and inner core, and outer bands continue to become better 
established. The latest subjective Dvorak estimates are 4.5/77 kt 
and 5.0/90 kt from SAB and TAFB, respectively, and the initial 
intensity is nudged up to 85 kt based on that data.
 
Bonnie has been on a steady strengthening trend since it emerged 
over the eastern Pacific a couple of days ago, and it could 
strengthen some more through tonight. Although none of the 
intensity models show Bonnie reaching major hurricane status, it 
seems like a possibility given recent trends. However, by early 
Tuesday, the models suggest that the intensification trend will 
likely plateau as northeasterly shear is expected to increase to the 
15-20 kt range. The shear is expected to let up beginning Wednesday, 
but Bonnie will be tracking over progressively cooler waters, 
especially late in the period. The net result seems to suggest 
little change in strength from 12-72 hours, followed by steady 
weakening once Bonnie moves over sub 26C waters and into a drier 
air mass in about 4 days. This forecast lies at the high end of the 
guidance in the short term, but is near the consensus aids beyond 48 
hours.
 
The hurricane is moving westward at 15 kt on the south-southwest
side of a deep-layer ridge. Since the subtropical ridge is
expected to build westward, this should keep Bonnie on a west to
west-northwest path during the next several days. There is some
speed, or along-track, differences in the models, but they all show
a similar theme. The NHC track forecast is largely an update of the
previous one and near the various consensus models.
 
Although the core of Bonnie is expected to remain well south of
Mexico, rough surf and the potential for rip currents will continue
to affect southwestern Mexico for another day or two.
