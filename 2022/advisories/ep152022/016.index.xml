Tropical Depression Newton Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152022
800 AM PDT Sun Sep 25 2022

Newton barely qualifies as a tropical depression this morning, with 
a small area of not-exactly-organized deep convection, which has 
been weakening during the past few hours.  The initial wind speed 
is held at 30 kt, perhaps generously.  The system should gradually 
weaken due to persistent southerly shear helping to entrain drier 
air into the circulation.  This environment should eliminate any 
significant convection by this evening, and remnant low status is 
now indicated in 12 hours.  

The depression is turning leftward, with the motion now estimated 
at 240/8 kt.  Newton should move southwestward during the next few 
days due to the orientation of the low-level ridge, and the model 
guidance is in good agreement on this scenario.  No significant 
changes were made to the previous NHC forecast for track or 
intensity.
