SUMMARY OF 200 AM PDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.4N 115.6W
ABOUT 440 MI...705 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 260 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1006 MB...29.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM PDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Newton
was located near latitude 19.4 North, longitude 115.6 West. The
depression is moving toward the west near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this
general motion should continue through this morning. A gradual turn 
toward the west-southwest is expected by this evening followed by a 
turn toward the southwest early Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next day or so.
Slow weakening is anticipated once Newton becomes a post-tropical
remnant low, possibly as soon as later today or tonight.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).

Tropical Depression Newton Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152022
200 AM PDT Sun Sep 25 2022
 
This morning's conventional satellite presentation consists of a
partially exposed, well-defined surface circulation with a recent, 
shapeless burst of deep convection near and north of the surface 
center.  The initial intensity is held at 30 kt and is supported by 
the subjective Dvorak satellite intensity estimate from TAFB and 
SAB.  Increasing shear magnitude and intrusion of dry stable air 
should degenerate Newton by early Monday, or possibly sometime 
today.  The statistical SHIPS intensity guidance has Newton as a 
persistent depression through early Tuesday, but the global models 
show Newton decaying earlier, and the NHC forecast follows the 
latter solution.
 
Newton's initial motion is 260/7 kt, a little left of due west. 
A west-southwestward turn is expected by this evening, followed by 
a turn southwestward early Monday while embedded in the 
northeasterly low-level trade wind flow.  The official track 
forecast is slightly faster than the 0300 UTC advisory beyond the 
24-hour period and has been adjusted south to align more closely to 
the NOAA HFIP consensus model and the TVCE aid.
