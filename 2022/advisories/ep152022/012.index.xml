DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Newton was
located near latitude 19.1 North, longitude 113.2 West. Newton is
moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A gradual
turn toward the west and southwest is expected during the next 24
to 36 hours.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours.  Weakening is
forecast, and Newton is expected to weaken to a tropical depression
later today and degenerate to a remnant low pressure area by late
Sunday or early Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).

Tropical Storm Newton Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152022
900 AM MDT Sat Sep 24 2022
 
Small bursts of convection continue to form near the center of
Newton's center.  A recent satellite microwave pass still showed
a small curved band in the northern semicircle of the circulation.
Subjective and objective satellite classifications range between
25-35 kt.  The initial intensity is held at a possibly generous 35
kt.
 
The combination of low environmental relative humidities and
moderate vertical wind shear are expected to slowly weaken Newton, 
despite the relatively warm sea surface temperatures.  There is 
little change in the latest intensity forecast and Newton is still 
expected to become a remnant low in two days and dissipate within 
three days. 
 
Newton is moving west-northwestward at 7 kt and gradually turning to 
the west.  As convection slowly dwindles, the shallow vortex is 
expected to turn westward and eventually southwestward in the 
low-level flow in the next day or so.  The track guidance is 
tightly clustered and the official forecast track is very similar to 
the previous prediction.
