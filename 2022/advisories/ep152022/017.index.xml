Post-Tropical Cyclone Newton Advisory Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152022
200 PM PDT Sun Sep 25 2022
 
...NEWTON BECOMES A REMNANT LOW...
...THIS IS THE LAST ADVISORY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM PDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.4N 117.1W
ABOUT 560 MI...900 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...30 MPH...45 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...SW OR 235 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1008 MB...29.77 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM PDT (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Newton
was located near latitude 18.4 North, longitude 117.1 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the southwest near 9 mph (15
km/h), and this general motion is expected to continue for the next 
couple of days before the low opens up into a trough of low 
pressure.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 30 mph (45 km/h) 
with higher gusts. The remnant low should slowly weakened over the 
next couple of days before totally dissipating.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system. For additional information on the remnant low 
please see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather 
Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and 
on the web at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php

Post-Tropical Cyclone Newton Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152022
200 PM PDT Sun Sep 25 2022

Satellite images during the last 24 hours indicate that Newton has 
not produced much convection, and a brief burst overnight was too 
ephemeral to qualify as organized enough for a tropical cyclone.  
Thus, this system has degenerated to a remnant low, and this is the 
last NHC advisory.  The initial wind speed is set to 25 kt, assuming 
some spin down of the vortex since this morning.  The remnant low 
should continue moving southwestward for the few days before opening 
up into a trough.  At the same time, the system should gradually 
weaken.  This solution is consistent with the previous forecast and 
the consensus aids.

For additional information on the remnant low, please see High Seas
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php
