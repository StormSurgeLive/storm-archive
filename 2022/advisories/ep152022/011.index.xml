SUMMARY OF 300 AM MDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.9N 112.4W
ABOUT 320 MI...515 KM SSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1004 MB...29.65 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Newton was
located near latitude 18.9 North, longitude 112.4 West. Newton is
moving toward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A gradual 
turn toward the west and southwest is expected during the next 24 
to 36 hours.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast, and Newton is expected to weaken to a 
tropical depression later today and to degenerate to a remnant low 
pressure area by late Sunday or early Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).

Tropical Storm Newton Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152022
300 AM MDT Sat Sep 24 2022

While Newton is producing small areas of convection near and 
north of the center, the storm is gradually becoming less 
organized.  Satellite intensity estimates are generally in the 
30-40 kt range, and based on the decreased organization since the 
last advisory the initial intensity is reduced to 35 kt.

While Newton is likely to stay over warm sea surface temperatures, 
a combination of a dry air mass and southerly vertical wind shear 
should cause weakening.  The new intensity forecast calls for the 
cyclone to decay to a remnant low by 48 h and to dissipate 
completely by 72 h.  This much longevity could be generous, as 
several of the global models forecast an earlier dissipation.

The initial motion is 290/8 kt. A general west-northwest motion is 
forecast for about 12 h, followed by a turn toward the west and 
eventually west-southwest.  The track guidance is in good agreement 
on this scenario, and the new forecast track is near the various 
consensus models.
