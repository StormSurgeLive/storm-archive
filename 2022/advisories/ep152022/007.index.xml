DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Newton was
located near latitude 18.1 North, longitude 110.4 West. Newton is
moving toward the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue during the next couple of 
days.  A turn west-southwestward is forecast by Sunday evening.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Slow weakening is forecast and Newton is 
expected to degenerate into a post-tropical remnant low on Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).

Tropical Storm Newton Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152022
300 AM MDT Fri Sep 23 2022
 
Tonight's satellite presentation consists of a pulsating, shapeless
convective mass just east of the surface circulation.  A 0430 UTC 
METOP-B ASCAT pass revealed peak surface winds of 33 kt in the east 
quadrant.  A blend of the Dvorak satellite intensity estimates from 
TAFB and SAB along with the likely under-sampled scatterometer pass 
supports lowering the initial intensity to 45 kt.
 
Slow weakening is forecast while the cyclone moves into a dry, 
stable lower boundary marine layer invading from the northwest.  The 
statistical SHIPS and the global models also indicate that Newton 
will encounter increasing southerly shear.  Again, these factors are 
likely to result in slow weakening and degeneration to a remnant low 
no later than Saturday night.
 
Newton's initial motion is estimated to be west-northwestward, or 
285/6 kt.  The cyclone is moving along the southwest periphery of a
subtropical ridge stretching westward from northwestern Mexico.
Newton should continue in this general direction through early 
Sunday, then turn west-southwestward within the trade wind flow 
through the end of the period as a vertically shallow remnant low.  
Only a slight adjustment was made to the south of the previous 
forecast beyond the 48-hour period to come in closer agreement with 
the NOAA HFIP HCCA model.
