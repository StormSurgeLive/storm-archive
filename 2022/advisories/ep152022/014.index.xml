...NEWTON IS BARELY A TROPICAL DEPRESSION...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM MDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.5N 114.8W
ABOUT 395 MI...635 KM SW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 270 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1006 MB...29.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM MDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Newton
was located near latitude 19.5 North, longitude 114.8 West. The
depression is moving toward the west near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this 
general motion should continue overnight. A gradual turn toward the 
southwest is expected by late Sunday or early Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Little change in strength is forecast during the next day or so. 
Slow weakening is anticipated once Newton becomes a post-tropical 
remnant low, potentially as soon as tomorrow.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.

Tropical Depression Newton Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152022
900 PM MDT Sat Sep 24 2022
 
A little deep convection has reformed near the center of Newton 
since the last advisory. While it isn't particularly well organized, 
it was enough to get a 2.0 Dvorak classification from TAFB, which 
was the primary basis for the 30 kt initial intensity. The lack of 
persistent or organized deep convection is probably due to a 
combination of factors including a dry surrounding environment 
(700-500 mb 50 to 55 percent RH according to SHIPS diagnostics) and 
moderate wind shear. 

Even though Newton is forecast to move over warmer SSTs during the 
next few days, various global models suggest it could become 
post-tropical sooner than that, and based on current trends that 
could be as soon as tomorrow. The HWRF has a notably different 
forecast, indicating Newton could stick around as a weak tropical 
depression for at least another few days. The NHC forecast is very 
similar to the previous advisory, showing Newton becoming 
post-tropical in about a day and dissipating by day 3.

Newton has turned westward. Low-level winds should steer the 
depression westward overnight, and then southwestward by late Sunday 
or early Monday. Only minor adjustments were made to the official 
track forecast which is based on the track consensus aids HCCA and 
TVCN.
