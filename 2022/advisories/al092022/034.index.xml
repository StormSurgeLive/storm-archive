WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
All Tropical Storm and Storm Surge Watches and Warnings have been
discontinued.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Ian 
was located near latitude 35.3 North, longitude 79.5 West. The 
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the north near 15 mph (24 
km/h). This general motion with a decrease in forward speed is 
expected through Saturday as Ian moves farther inland across central 
North Carolina and Virginia.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with 
higher gusts. These winds are occurring over water off the Carolina 
coast.  Ian is forecast to weaken through Saturday and dissipate by 
early Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles (315 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches) 
based on surface observations.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE: Surge related flooding will continue to recede along
portions of the North Carolina coast, including the Pamlico Sound
and Neuse River as well as the Albemarle Sound. For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather forecast office.
 
WIND:  Wind gusts to tropical storm force are expected to continue
over portions of North Carolina and South Carolina overnight as Ian
moves farther inland.
 
RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce 3 to 6 inches, with local
maxima of 8 inches across portions of North Carolina, West Virginia,
and the southern Mid-Atlantic states.
 
Major to record river flooding will continue across central Florida
through next week.  Considerable flash, urban and small stream
flooding is possible across portions of North Carolina and southern
Virginia tonight into early Saturday, with minor river flooding
possible over Coastal Carolinas. Limited flooding is possible across
portions of the southern Mid-Atlantic this weekend.
 
TORNADOES:  A brief tornado remains possible through early Saturday
morning across far southeast Virginia and the southern Delmarva
Peninsula.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian and a nearby frontal system are
affecting the east coast of Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, and the
northwestern Bahamas. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 AM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 500 AM EDT.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Ian Discussion Number  34
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
1100 PM EDT Fri Sep 30 2022
 
Ian has a classic comma-shaped cloud pattern of an extratropical 
cyclone in satellite imagery. The radar structure of the system has 
degraded tonight, but surface observations indicate the center of 
Ian is moving northward across the central portion of North 
Carolina. The initial intensity is lowered to 45 kt for this 
advisory, which is consistent with the latest Decay-SHIPS guidance 
and some marine observations offshore of the Cape Fear region that 
indicate sustained tropical-storm-force winds are still occurring 
over water.
 
Ian is still moving northward at about 13 kt. This general motion is 
expected to continue through Saturday, which will bring Ian across 
the central portions of North Carolina and Virginia on Saturday. 
Continued weakening is forecast, and the cyclone is expected to 
dissipate by early Sunday. There were no notable changes made to the 
NHC track or intensity forecast.

Because recent observations indicate that wind speeds over land have 
diminished, the Tropical Storm Warning has been discontinued for the 
coasts of South Carolina and North Carolina. Similarly, coastal 
water levels have receded below warning criteria along the coast of 
North Carolina, and the Storm Surge Watches and Warnings there have 
also been discontinued. However, heavy rain and gusty winds are 
expected to continue into tomorrow morning across portions of the 
Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic states.

Even though all tropical watches and warnings have been 
discontinued, intermediate advisories will still be issued as long 
as Ian continues to produce winds of tropical storm strength.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Gusty winds are expected through early Saturday over portions of 
South Carolina and North Carolina.
 
2. Ongoing major to record river flooding will continue through next 
week across portions of central Florida. Considerable flooding is 
possible across portions of the Carolinas and southeast Virginia.  
Locally considerable flooding is possible across portions of 
northwest North Carolina and southern Virginia tonight into early 
Saturday.
