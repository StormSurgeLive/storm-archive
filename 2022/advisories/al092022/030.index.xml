Post-Tropical Cyclone Eleven Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112022
500 PM AST Thu Sep 29 2022

The structure of the system this afternoon has continued to go 
downhill. The circulation fidelity has become increasingly diffuse 
and stretched out in a north-to-south fashion. What little deep 
convection remains is displaced about 100 n mi to the 
north-northeast of the center and also lacks sufficient organization 
to be considered a tropical cyclone. Therefore, this is the final 
advisory and the system is now considered to be a post-tropical 
remnant low, albeit one that is likely to open up into a surface 
trough at any time. 

In general the poorly-defined center still appears to be mostly on 
track, moving to the northwest at 320/12 kt. This general motion is 
expected to continue until the elongated circulation completely 
degenerates into a surface trough over the central Atlantic basin. 
A 12 hour point is mainly provided for continuity purposes, which 
lies along the fairly tightly clustered consensus aids. 

Additional information on this system can be found in High Seas
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ian was located
near latitude 30.2 North, longitude 79.3 West.  Ian is moving toward
the north-northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A turn toward the north
is expected early Friday, followed by a turn toward the
north-northwest with an increase in forward speed Friday night.  On
the forecast track, Ian will approach the coast of South Carolina on
Friday.  The center will move farther inland across the Carolinas
Friday night and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Ian could strengthen a little more before
landfall tomorrow, and is forecast to rapidly weaken over the
southeastern United States late Friday into Saturday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 415 miles
(665 km). A sustained wind of 58 mph (93 km/h) with a gust of 64 
mph (104 km/h) was recently reported west of the center by a NOAA 
and Saildrone Inc. research mission vessel.
 
The minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft is 986 mb (29.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
* Edisto Beach to Little River Inlet...4-7 ft
* Flagler/Volusia County Line to Edisto Beach...3-5 ft
* Litter River Inlet to Cape Fear...3-5 ft
* Cape Fear River...2-4 ft
* St. Johns River...2-4 ft
* East of Cape Fear to Duck, including Pamlico and Neuse
Rivers...2-4 ft
* Patrick Air Force Base to Flagler/Volusia County Line... 1-3 ft
* Albemarle Sound...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to begin in the
Hurricane Warning area starting early Friday, with tropical storm
conditions beginning overnight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are now occurring in parts of the warning 
area on the northeast coast of Florida and should spread northward 
along the Georgia and North Carolina coasts tonight through Friday.  
Hurricane conditions are possible within the Hurricane Watch area in 
North Carolina on Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall amounts:
 
* Coastal Georgia: 1 to 2 inches.
* Northeast South Carolina: 4 to 8 inches, with local maxima of
12 inches.
* Central South Carolina, North Carolina, and southern Virginia:
3 to 6 inches with local maxima of 8 inches across northwest North
Carolina and southwest Virginia.
 
Major to record river flooding will continue across central Florida
through next week.  Considerable flash and urban flooding, and minor
river flooding is possible across coastal and northeast South
Carolina Friday.  Locally considerable flash, urban, and small
stream flooding is possible Friday into Saturday across portions of
northwest North Carolina and southwest Virginia. Limited flooding is
possible across portions of the southern Mid-Atlantic this weekend.
 
TORNADOES:  Potential for a few tornadoes will begin late Friday
morning along a portion of the coastal Carolinas, spread inland
across eastern North Carolina during the afternoon and evening, and
shift into southeast Virginia overnight through early Saturday
morning.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting the northern coast
of Cuba, the northeastern coast of the Yucatan peninsula, Florida
and Georgia. Swells will increase along the coasts of South Carolina
and North Carolina.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.

<title>Hurricane Ian Forecast Discussion Number 30</title>

Hurricane Ian Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
1100 PM EDT Thu Sep 29 2022
 
Ian continues to have the appearance of a hybrid tropical cyclone, 
having the characteristics of both an extratropical low with some 
frontal features, and a sheared tropical cyclone with convection 
well removed from the low-level center.  The system is interacting 
with a mid- to upper-level shortwave trough just to its west, and 
this interaction may be contributing to slight strengthening. Based 
on a blend of flight-level and SFMR-observed winds, along with 
dropsonde measurements, from an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
the current intensity has been increased a little to 70 kt for this 
advisory.  The strongest winds are currently occuring over the 
northwestern quadrant of the hurricane.
 
Southwesterly vertical wind shear is expected to remain high and the 
environmental air mass will stay dry until landfall.  However, Ian 
could intensify a little more within the next 12 hours or so due to 
trough interaction and extraction of energy from the underlying warm 
Gulf Stream waters.  Therefore the NHC forecast calls for slight 
strengthening before the system reaches the coast. This is above the 
available intensity model guidance.   It should be emphasized that 
although Ian is not expected to be a classic hurricane at landfall, 
this does not diminish the threat it poses.  Strong winds and storm 
surge will also extend far from the center and will begin well 
before the center arrives.
 
Ian continues to move north-northeastward at about 030/9 kt. Over 
the next day or so, the cyclone is expected to turn northward and 
then north-northwestward as it moves along the eastern side of the 
shortwave trough.  The dynamical model consensus, TVCN, has again 
shifted slightly eastward on this cycle.  Therefore the NHC track 
prediction is, again, moved a little eastward from the previous 
official forecast.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge through Friday
along the coasts of northeast Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.
Residents in these areas should follow any advice given by local
officials.
 
2. Hurricane-force winds are expected across the coasts of South
Carolina and southeastern North Carolina beginning early Friday,
where a Hurricane Warning is in effect.  Hurricane conditions are
possible in North Carolina on Friday where a Hurricane Watch is in
effect.   Preparations should be rushed to completion.
 
3. Ongoing major to record river flooding will continue through next
week across portions of central Florida.  Considerable flooding is
expected through Friday across portions of coastal and northeast
South Carolina. Locally considerable flooding is possible across
portions of North Carolina and southern Virginia through Friday.
