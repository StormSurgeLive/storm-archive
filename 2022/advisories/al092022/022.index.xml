For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Ian, located over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure <br/>
located several hundred miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands <br/>
continue to show signs of organization. Although environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to be marginally conducive for development, <br/>
only a slight increase in organization would result in the formation <br/>
of a short-lived tropical depression today. Further development will <br/>
become less likely by the end of the week due to increasing <br/>
upper-level winds. The disturbance is forecast to meander for the <br/>
next day or so and then turn north-northwestward by Thursday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ian was located
near latitude 25.6 North, longitude 82.9 West. Ian is moving toward
the north-northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h).  This general motion with
a reduction in forward speed is forecast today, followed by a turn 
toward the north on Thursday. On the forecast track, the center of 
Ian is expected to approach the west coast of Florida within the 
hurricane warning area this morning, and move onshore later today. 
The center of Ian is forecast to move over central Florida tonight 
and Thursday morning and emerge over the western Atlantic by late 
Thursday.
 
Very recent data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that the maximum sustained winds have increased to near 140 
mph (220 km/h) with higher gusts.  Ian is a category 4 hurricane on 
the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in 
intensity are possible before Ian reaches the coast of Florida.   
Ian is forecast to approach the west coast of Florida as an 
extremely dangerous major hurricane.  Weakening is expected after 
landfall.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 942 mb (27.82 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
* Middle of Longboat Key to Bonita Beach, including Charlotte 
Harbor...8-12 ft
* Bonita Beach to Chokoloskee...6-10 ft
* Anclote River to Middle of Longboat Key, including 
Tampa Bay...4-6 ft
* Chokoloskee to East Cape Sable...4-7 ft
* Suwannee River to Anclote River...3-5 ft
* Lower Keys from Key West to Big Pine Key, including the 
Dry Tortugas...3-5 ft
* Flagler/Volusia County Line to Savannah River including St. Johns 
River...3-5 ft
* St. Johns River south of Julington...2-4 ft
* Savannah River to South Santee River...2-4 ft
* East Cape Sable to Card Sound Bridge...2-4 ft
* Florida Keys east of Big Pine Key...2-4 ft
* Patrick Air Force Base to Flagler/Volusia County Line...1-3 ft
* Indian Pass to Suwanee River...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Catastrophic wind damage is likely where the core of Ian
moves onshore.  Hurricane conditions will begin along the west
coast of Florida within the Hurricane Warning area later this
morning, with tropical storm conditions beginning before daybreak.
 
Tropical storm conditions are occurring in the warning area in the
Florida Keys, and will continue this morning.  Tropical storm
conditions are expected in the warning area on the east coast of
Florida beginning today, and should spread up the Georgia and
South Carolina coasts tonight and Thursday.  Tropical storm
conditions are expected within the warning area in Cuba for the
next few hours.
 
RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall:
 
* Florida Keys and South Florida: 6 to 8 inches, with local maxima
up to 12 inches.
* Central and Northeast Florida: 12 to 18 inches, with local
maxima up to 24 inches.
* Eastern Georgia and Coastal South Carolina: 4 to 8 inches, with
local maxima of 12 inches.
 
Widespread, life-threatening catastrophic flash, urban, and river
flooding is expected across central Florida.  Widespread
considerable flash, urban, and river flooding is expected across
portions of southern Florida through Wednesday, and northeast
Florida, southeastern Georgia, and coastal South Carolina later this
week through the weekend.  Limited flash, urban, and river flooding
is possible over portions of the Southeast and southern Mid-Atlantic
later this week through the weekend.
 
TORNADOES: Tornadoes are possible today and tonight across central
and south Florida.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting the northern coast
of Cuba, the northeastern coast of the Yucatan peninsula, the
Florida Keys, and the Gulf coast of Florida.  These swells will
spread westward along portions of the north-central Gulf
coast during the next day or so. Swells will increase along the
east coast of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina tonight and
Thursday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.

Residents in these areas should listen to advice given by local 
officials and follow any evacuation orders for your area.
 
2. Hurricane-force winds are expected in the hurricane warning area
in southwest and west-central Florida beginning Wednesday morning
with tropical storm conditions expected overnight.  Devastating wind
damage is expected near the core of Ian. Residents should rush all
preparations to completion.
 
3. Heavy rainfall will spread across the Florida peninsula through
Thursday and reach portions of the Southeast later this week and
