Tropical Depression Eleven Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112022
1100 AM AST Thu Sep 29 2022
 
The overnight deep convective burst with Tropical Depression Eleven 
did not appear to help spin up its low-level circulation. In fact, 
morning visible satellite imagery suggest that the circulation is 
actually losing definition, and may already be in the process of 
opening up into a surface trough. For now, we will continue writing 
advisories on the system, pending scatterometer data expected later 
today. The latest intensity was held at 30 kt based on the CI 
numbers from TAFB and SAB. If the current trends on visible 
satellite imagery continue, the system may be declared either 
post-tropical or dissipated as soon as this afternoon. Vertical wind 
shear only increases from here on out as the mid-level relative 
humidity remains quite low, so it looks increasingly unlikely the 
structure can recover. The NHC intensity forecast shows more 
immediate weakening but is generally in line with the intensity 
guidance consensus.
 
The initial motion appears to still be off to the northwest, just a
bit faster at 320/12 kt. This general motion is expected to
continue until the system dissipates, as the system is steered
generally by a low-level ridge that has nosed in to the northeast of
the depression. The updated track is quite similar, but just a
touch west, of the prior track, remaining close to the consensus
aids.

the forecast track, Ian will approach the coast of South Carolina on 
Friday.  The center will move farther inland across the Carolinas 
Friday night and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Ian is expected to become a hurricane again 
this evening and make landfall as a hurricane on Friday, with rapid 
weakening forecast after landfall.
 
Ian is a large cyclone. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward 
up to 415 miles (665 km) from the center. A NOAA CMAN station at the 
Saint Johns County pier in Saint Augustine Beach recently reported a 
sustained wind of 53 mph (85 km/h) and a gust of 61 mph (98 km/h). 
A WeatherSTEM station reported a gust of 74 mph (119 km/h) was 
reported at Marineland, Florida.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

* Edisto Beach to South Santee River...4-7 ft
* Flagler/Volusia County Line to Edisto Beach...4-6 ft
* South Santee River to Little River Inlet...3-5 ft
* St. Johns River...2-4 ft
* East of Little River Inlet to Duck, including Pamlico and 
Neuse Rivers...2-4 ft
* Patrick Air Force Base to Flagler/Volusia County Line...1-3 ft
* Bonita Beach to Chokoloskee including Charlotte Harbor... 1-3 ft
* Albemarle Sound...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to begin over the
Hurricane Warning area starting early Friday, with tropical storm
conditions beginning overnight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are now occurring in parts of the
warning area on the east coasts of Florida and should spread
northward along the Georgia and North Carolina coasts today through
Friday.  Hurricane conditions are possible within the Hurricane
Watch area in northeastern Florida and Georgia today into Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall:
 
* East Central to Northeast Florida: Additional rainfall of 2 to 4
inches, with storm totals around 20 inches in spots.
* Coastal Georgia: 2 to 5 inches with locally higher amounts.
* Lowcountry of South Carolina: 4 to 8 inches, with local maxima of
12 inches.
* Upstate and central South Carolina, North Carolina, and southern
Virginia: 3 to 6 inches with local maxima of 8 inches across western
North Carolina.
 
Major-to-record river flooding will continue across central Florida
through next week.  Considerable flash, urban, and river flooding is
expected across coastal portions of northeast Florida, southeastern
Georgia, and eastern South Carolina through Friday.  Locally
considerable flash, urban, and small stream flooding is possible
this weekend across portions of the southern Appalachians, where
landslides will be possible as well. Limited flooding is possible
across portions of the southern Mid-Atlantic.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two will be possible Friday across the
coastal Carolinas.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting the northern coast
of Cuba, the northeastern coast of the Yucatan peninsula and
Florida. Swells will increase along the coasts of Georgia,
South Carolina and North Carolina today.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Ian Forecast Discussion Number 28</title>

Tropical Storm Ian Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
1100 AM EDT Thu Sep 29 2022
 
The center of Ian has emerged into the western Atlantic Ocean to
the north of Cape Canaveral.  While satellite images show the
system is becoming a hybrid cyclone, with frontal features outside 
of the core of Ian, the winds from multiple sources are notable.  
Velocity data from NWS Doppler radar indicate maximum winds of about 
70-75 kt at 10,000 ft over land, and sustained winds of about 55 kt 
were recorded in the Daytona Beach area earlier this morning.  These 
data support a higher initial intensity, now 60 kt for this 
advisory.
 
The storm is moving northeastward at about 8 kt.  Ian has stubbornly 
gone east of the track forecast for the past couple of days and has 
moved back over water faster than expected.   A mid-level shortwave 
trough moving southward across the southern United States should 
turn Ian northward overnight and north-northwestward on Saturday. 
The official track forecast is shifted to the east, consistent with 
the latest consensus guidance.
 
Ian should move over the Gulf Stream tonight and tomorrow for a 
longer period of time than previously anticipated, which should 
maintain Ian's central convection.  Additionally, an increased 
pressure gradient on the northwestern side from a stationary front 
near the southeastern US, should provide a boost to the wind speeds 
on that side of the storm.  We now expect Ian to become a hurricane 
again by this evening.  As the system approaches South Carolina, Ian 
should maintain this intensity, and Hurricane Warnings have been 
issued for the entire coast of South Carolina.  This scenario is 
consistent with the global and regional hurricane model guidance.  
It is worth noting that Ian is forecast to have atypical structure 
when it nears the southeastern United States, and strong winds will 
extend well ahead of the center, even on the northwestern side.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge through Friday
along the coasts of northeast Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.
Residents in these areas should follow any advice given by local
officials.
 
2. Hurricane-force winds are expected across the South Carolina
coast beginning early Friday, where a Hurricane Warning has been
issued. Hurricane conditions are possible by tonight along the
coasts of northeastern Florida and Georgia, where a Hurricane Watch
is in effect.   Preparations should be rushed to completion since
tropical-storm-force winds will begin well before the center
approaches the coast.
 
3. Ongoing major-to-record river flooding will continue across
portions of central Florida, with considerable flooding in northern
Florida.  Considerable flash and urban flooding is expected across
coastal portions of northeast Florida through Friday. Local
significant flooding in southeastern Georgia and eastern South
Carolina is expected through the end of the week.
