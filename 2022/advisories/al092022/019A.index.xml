DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ian was located
near latitude 24.4 North, longitude 83.0 West.  Ian is moving toward
the north-northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h).  This general motion 
with a reduction in forward speed is forecast tonight and Wednesday.
On the forecast track, the center of Ian is expected to pass west 
of the Florida Keys later tonight, and approach the west coast of 
Florida within the hurricane warning area on Wednesday and Wednesday 
night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Ian is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Strengthening is expected tonight through 
Wednesday.  Ian is forecast to approach the west coast of Florida as
an extremely dangerous major hurricane.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140
miles (220 km). Sustained tropical-storm-force winds have been 
reported at the Key West International Airport and the Key West 
Naval Air Station during the last hour. A National Data Buoy 
Center Site near Sombrero Key recently reported a sustained wind of 
43 mph (69 km/h). The Florida Keys Marathon International Airport 
just reported a wind gust to 52 mph (84 km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft observations is 947 mb (27.96 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
* Middle of Longboat Key to Bonita Beach, including Charlotte
Harbor...8-12 ft
* Bonita Beach to Chokoloskee...6-9 ft
* Anclote River to Middle of Longboat Key, including Tampa 
Bay...4-6 ft
* Suwannee River to Anclote River...3-5 ft
* Mouth of the St. Mary's River to Altamaha Sound...4-6 ft
* Chokoloskee to East Cape Sable...4-6 ft
* Dry Tortugas...3-5 ft
* Flagler/Volusia County Line to Mouth of the St. Mary's River,
including St. Johns River...3-5 ft
* Altamaha Sound to Savannah River...3-5 ft
* St. Johns River south of Julington...2-4 ft
* Savannah River to South Santee River...2-4 ft
* East Cape Sable to Card Sound Bridge...2-4 ft
* Florida Keys...2-4 ft
* Patrick Air Force Base to Flagler/Volusia County Line...1-3 ft
* Indian Pass to Suwanee River...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected along the west coast of
Florida within the Hurricane Warning area on Wednesday morning, with
tropical storm conditions possibly beginning tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are occurring in the warning area in the
Florida Keys, and will continue overnight.  Tropical storm 
conditions are expected in the warning area on the east coast of 
Florida beginning early Wednesday, and should spread up to Georgia 
and South Carolina on Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions are 
expected within the warning area in Cuba for the next few hours.
 
RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce the following rainfall through
Thursday night:
 
* Western Cuba: 6 to 12 inches, with isolated totals up to 16
inches. These rains may produce flash flooding and mudslides in
areas of higher terrain over western Cuba.
* Florida Keys and South Florida: 6 to 8 inches, with isolated
totals up to 12 inches.
* Central and Northeast Florida: 12 to 18 inches, with isolated
totals up to 24 inches.
* Eastern Georgia and coastal South Carolina: 4 to 8 inches, with
isolated totals up to 12 inches.
 
Widespread catastrophic flash, urban, and river flooding is expected
across central and west Florida beginning midweek.  Widespread
considerable flash, urban, and river flooding is expected across
northern Florida, southeastern Georgia, and coastal South Carolina
from the end of the week through the weekend.  Limited river
flooding is expected over portions of the southeastern United
States into the Mid-Atlantic mid-to-late week.
 
TORNADOES: Tornadoes are possible through Wednesday across central
and south Florida.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting the western Caribbean
and the Florida Keys, and will spread northward throughout the
eastern Gulf of Mexico tonight and Wednesday.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Hurricane Ian Forecast Discussion Number 19</title>

Hurricane Ian Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
500 PM EDT Tue Sep 27 2022
 
The pressure on the last Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft fix
fell to about 952 mb, indicating that Ian is restrengthening
over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico.  The eye of Ian remains
well-defined on visible imagery, although radar data from Key West
suggest that an eyewall replacement could be in the initial stages.
The initial wind speed is set to 105 kt, matching a blend of
earlier SFMR and flight-level wind data.  The plane data also
showed that the area of hurricane-force winds is growing on the
east side of the cyclone.
 
Ian is moving east-of-due-north, or 010/9-kt, with occasional
wobbles to the north-northeast.  A track toward the north-northeast
is expected for the next couple of days while it moves between a
ridge over the Bahamas and a trough over the western Gulf of Mexico.
There has been some model convergence this afternoon showing Ian
remaining stronger and vertically deeper through landfall.  This
solution results in a faster track, again adjusted to the southeast,
and the new forecast is moved in that direction. This new NHC track
is close to the corrected model consensus and between the quicker
ECMWF and slower GFS models.  It should be emphasized that this
track remains uncertain, with a typical spread in the steering
features leading to big speed and track differences down the line,
not to mention the oblique angle of approach to Florida. In a few
days, more of the guidance is showing Ian interacting with a
shortwave trough over the southeastern United States, causing the
system to move back over the northwestern Atlantic in the longer
range, before turning northwestward back over land.  The day 3-5
track forecast is also shifted eastward, although significant
re-strengthening is not expected at long range.
 
The outflow pattern of the hurricane is beginning to be impinged
upon in the southwestern quadrant, a sign that upper-level
southwesterly flow is starting to affect the outer circulation.
While the shear should increase up through landfall, it is just too
close-to-call whether it starts to weaken Ian or not, or whether the
larger system is able to resist the shear.  Additionally, an eyewall
replacement cycle could be in its initial phases, although
predicting these structural changes is extremely difficult.  The new
forecast is near the last one, a little higher than the consensus.
I should note that whether Ian comes ashore as category 4 hurricane
or a large category 3 after an eyewall cycle, avoiding a large and
destructive hurricane for Florida seems very unlikely, and residents
should heed the advice of local emergency management officials.
 
The new forecast necessitates a Hurricane Warning for portions of
extreme southwestern Florida, and a Tropical Storm Warning for the
rest of southeastern Florida that wasn't previously under a warning.
Users are reminded to not focus on the exact track as some
additional adjustments to the track are possible. Significant wind,
storm surge, and rainfall hazards will extend far from the center.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Life-threatening storm surge is increasingly likely along the 
Florida west coast where a storm surge warning is in effect, with 
the highest risk from Naples to the Sarasota region. Residents in 
these areas should listen to advice given by local officials and 
follow any evacuation orders for your area.

2. Hurricane-force winds are expected in the hurricane warning area 
in southwest and west-central Florida beginning Wednesday morning 
with tropical storm conditions expected overnight.  Devastating wind 
damage is expected near the core of Ian. Residents should rush all 
preparations to completion.

3. Heavy rainfall will affect most of the Florida Peninsula for the 
next several days, spreading to the rest of the Southeast U.S. by 
Thursday and Friday, likely causing flash, urban, and small stream 
flooding. Considerable flooding is expected with widespread, 
prolonged moderate to major river flooding expected across central 
Florida.
