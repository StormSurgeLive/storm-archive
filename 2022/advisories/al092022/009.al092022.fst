DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ian was
located near latitude 14.9 North, longitude 78.8 West. Ian is moving
toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A turn toward the
northwest at a similar forward speed is expected later today, 
followed by a turn toward the north-northwest on Monday and north 
on Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Ian is forecast
to pass well southwest of Jamaica today, and pass near or west of 
the Cayman Islands early Monday.  Ian will then move near or over 
western Cuba Monday night and early Tuesday and emerge over
the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Rapid strengthening is forecast to begin later today.  Ian is 
expected to become a hurricane later today or tonight and reach 
major hurricane strength by late Monday or Monday night before it 
reaches western Cuba.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach Grand Cayman by
early Monday, with tropical storm conditions expected by tonight.
Tropical storm conditions are possible on Little Cayman and Cayman
Brac by tonight or early Monday.  Hurricane conditions are possible
within the hurricane watch area in Cuba by Monday night or early
Tuesday, with tropical storm conditions possible by late Monday.
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the tropical storm
watch area in Cuba Monday night and Tuesday.

RAINFALL:  Tropical Storm Ian is expected to produce the following
rainfall:

Jamaica and the Cayman Islands: 3 to 6 inches, with local maxima up
to 8 inches.

Western Cuba: 4 to 8 inches, with local maxima up to 12 inches.

Florida Keys to the southern and western Florida Peninsula: 2 to 4
inches, with local maxima up to 6 inches through Wednesday morning.

These rains may produce flash flooding and mudslides in areas of
higher terrain, particularly over Jamaica and Cuba. Flash and urban
flooding is possible with rainfall across the Florida Keys and the
Florida peninsula through mid week. Additional flooding and rises on
area streams and rivers across northern Florida and parts of the
Southeast cannot be ruled out, especially in central Florida given
already saturated antecedent conditions.

STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 9
to 14 feet above normal tide levels along the coast of western Cuba
in areas of onshore winds in the watch area Monday night and early
Tuesday.

Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Cayman Islands Sunday night into Monday.

Localized coastal flooding is possible along the coast of Jamaica in
areas of onshore winds on Sunday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting Jamaica and will
spread to the Cayman Islands later today.  Swells will then
spread northwestward to the southwestern coast of Cuba and the
coasts of Honduras, Belize, and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico
Monday and Monday night.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
