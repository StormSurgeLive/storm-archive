DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ian was located by 
NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft, Cuban and Key West radar data near 
latitude 22.6 North, longitude 83.6 West. Ian is moving toward the 
north near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this motion is expected to continue 
today.  A turn toward the north-northeast with a reduction in 
forward speed is forecast tonight and Wednesday.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Ian is expected to emerge over the southeastern 
Gulf of Mexico in a couple of hours, pass west of the Florida Keys 
later today, and approach the west coast of Florida within the 
hurricane warning area on Wednesday and Wednesday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are estimated near 125 mph (205 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Ian is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in strength is expected while
Ian moves over Cuba.  Strengthening is expected later this morning
after Ian emerges over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. Ian is
forecast to approach the west coast of Florida as a dangerous major
hurricane.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115
miles (185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 950 mb (28.05 inches) 
based on NOAA Hurricane Hunter data.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

* Anclote River to Bonita Beach, FL including Tampa 
Bay and Charlotte Harbor...5-10 ft
* Suwannee River to Anclote River... 5-8 ft
* Bonita Beach, FL to Chokoloskee, FL... 4-7 ft
* Chokoloskee, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...3-5 ft
* Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL to Altamaha Sound including
St. Johns River...2-4 ft
* East Cape Sable, FL to Card Sound Bridge, FL including Florida
Bay...2-4 ft
* Aucilla River to Suwannee River...2-4 ft
* Florida Keys including the Dry Tortugas...2-4 ft
* Indian Pass, FL to Aucilla River...1-3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.

Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 9 to 14 feet
above normal tide levels along the coast of western Cuba in areas of
onshore winds in the hurricane warning area early today.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the warning area in
Cuba through this morning. Destructive winds are expected where the
core of Ian moves across western Cuba. Tropical storm conditions
are expected within the tropical storm warning area in Cuba today.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected along the west coast of Florida
within the Hurricane Warning area on Wednesday morning, with
tropical storm conditions possibly beginning by late today. Tropical
storm conditions are expected in the Tropical Storm Warning area
along the southwest coast of the Florida peninsula by this evening,
and along the west coast north of the Tampa Bay area and along
portions of the east coast of Florida on Wednesday. Hurricane
conditions are possible in the watch area beginning on Wednesday,
and tropical storm conditions are possible in the Tropical Storm
Watch area on Wednesday into early Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in the
lower and middle Florida Keys beginning later today.
 
RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce the following rainfall through
Thursday night:
 
* Western Cuba: 6 to 12 inches, with isolated totals up to 16
inches. These rains may produce flash flooding and mudslides in
areas of higher terrain over western Cuba.
* Florida Keys and South Florida: 4 to 6 inches, with isolated 
totals up to 8 inches
* Central West Florida: 12 to 16 inches, with isolated totals up to
24 inches.
* Northeast Florida and the remainder of the Central Florida
Peninsula: 5 to 10 inches, with isolated totals up to 12 inches.
 
Heavy rainfall is expected to affect the southeastern United States 
Friday and Saturday.
 
Widespread considerable flash and urban flooding are expected
mid-to-late week across central and northern Florida, southern
Georgia, and coastal South Carolina, with significant, prolonged
river flooding expected across central to northern Florida. Flash
and urban flooding are also expected with rainfall across southern
Florida through mid week. Limited flash and river flooding is
expected over portions of the southeastern United States into the 
Mid-Atlantic mid-to-late week.
 
TORNADOES: Tornadoes are possible today through Wednesday across
the Florida Keys and the southern and central Florida Peninsula.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting the western Caribbean,
and will begin to affect the Florida Keys today, and will spread
northward throughout the eastern Gulf of Mexico tonight and
Wednesday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.

<title>Hurricane Ian Forecast Discussion Number 17</title>

Hurricane Ian Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
500 AM EDT Tue Sep 27 2022
 
Ian's satellite presentation continued to improve up until the 
center reached the coast of western Cuba around 0830 UTC.  An Air 
Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft that was in the storm until 
around 0400 UTC reported peak 700-mb flight-level winds of 101 kt, 
and a peak SFMR wind of 97 kt. During the final pass through the 
center, dropsonde data supported a minimum pressure of 960 mb.  
Given the continued improvement in satellite imagery, Dvorak data 
T-numbers from SAB and TAFB of T5.5 (102 kt), and objective 
estimates from UW/CIMSS of T5.4 (100 kt), the intensity was 
increased to 100 kt shortly after 0600 UTC.  The latest objective 
Dvorak estimates have increased to around 110 kt, and that is the 
estimated landfall intensity and initial intensity for this 
advisory.  NOAA and Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft are 
scheduled to investigate the storm as it moves off the northern 
coast of Cuba this morning. 
 
Ian is expected to spend only spend a few hours over western Cuba, 
and little overall change in strength is likely during that time. 
The center should emerge over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico later 
this morning, where warm water and generally low vertical wind shear 
conditions are expected to allow for additional intensification, and 
the NHC forecast calls for Ian to reach category 4 strength.  By 24 
to 36 hours, increasing southwesterly vertical wind shear and drier 
mid-level air are likely to result in some gradual weakening. 
However, Ian is still expected to be a major hurricane when it 
reaches the Florida west coast.  The official intensity forecast is 
near the latest simple and corrected multi-model consensus 
predictions.
 
Ian has turned northward and is moving 355/10 kt. The hurricane
should continue on a northward motion today around the western
periphery of a subtropical ridge.  After that time, a broad trough
over the eastern United States is expected to cause a
north-northeastward turn.  There continues to be larger-than-normal
spread in the track guidance by 36-48 hours, however the trend in
the global models has been more southward and eastward over the
last cycle or two.  As a result, the NHC track has been adjusted to
the southeast of the previous forecast and it lies just west of the
TVCA multi-model consensus aid.  Users are reminded to not focus on
the exact track as some additional adjustments to the track are
possible, and wind, storm surge, and rainfall hazards will extend
far from the center.  The updated forecast track has necessitated
several changes to the warnings and watches across the Florida Keys
and Florida peninsula, including an extension of the Hurricane
Warning southward to Bonita Beach on the west coast.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Life-threatening storm surge, hurricane-force winds, flash 
floods and possible mudslides are expected in portions of western 
Cuba today. Devastating wind damage is expected where the core of 
Ian moves across western Cuba this morning. 

2. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge along much
of the Florida west coast where a storm surge warning has been
issued, with the highest risk from Fort Myers to the Tampa Bay
region.  Residents in these areas should listen to advice given by
local officials.
 
3. Hurricane-force winds are expected in the hurricane warning area
in west-central Florida beginning Wednesday morning with tropical
storm conditions expected by late today.
 
4. Heavy rainfall will spread across western Cuba through Tuesday.  
This will likely produce instances of flash flooding and possible 
mudslides in areas of higher terrain over western Cuba.

5. Heavy rainfall will increase across the Florida Keys and South 
Florida Tuesday, spreading into central to northern Florida 
Wednesday and Thursday, and the Southeast by Friday and Saturday, 
likely causing flash, urban, and small stream flooding. 
Considerable flooding is expected across Central Florida into 
southern Georgia  and coastal South Carolina, with significant, 
prolonged river flooding expected across central to northern 
Florida.
