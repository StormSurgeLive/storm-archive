DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ian was located 
near latitude 18.7 North, longitude 82.4 West. Ian is moving toward 
the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). A turn toward the 
north-northwest is expected later today, followed by a northward 
motion on Tuesday with a slightly slower forward speed. A turn 
toward the north-northeast is forecast on Tuesday night or early 
Wednesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Ian is expected to 
pass near or west of the Cayman Islands today, and near or over 
western Cuba tonight and early Tuesday.  Ian will then emerge over 
the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday, pass west of the Florida 
Keys late Tuesday, and approach the west coast of Florida on 
Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Rapid strengthening is expected during the next day or so, 
and Ian is forecast to become a major hurricane tonight when it is 
near western Cuba.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90
miles (150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 981 mb (28.97 inches) 
based on dropsonde data from the NOAA and Air Force Hurricane 
Hunters.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE:   The combination of storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
*Anclote River to Englewood, FL including Tampa Bay... 5-8 ft
*Englewood to Bonita Beach, FL including Charlotte Harbor... 4-7 ft
*Bonita Beach to East Cape Sable, FL... 3-5 ft
*East Cape Sable to Card Sound Bridge, FL including Florida Bay...
2-4 ft
*Florida Keys including the Dry Tortugas... 2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 9 to 14 feet 
above normal tide levels along the coast of western Cuba in areas of 
onshore winds in the hurricane warning area tonight and early 
Tuesday.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Cayman Islands today.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm and hurricane conditions are expected on Grand
Cayman today. Hurricane conditions are expected within the warning
area in Cuba tonight, with tropical storm conditions expected
by late today.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical storm 
warning area in Cuba tonight and Tuesday. Tropical storm conditions 
are possible on Little Cayman and Cayman Brac today.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in the
lower Florida Keys on Tuesday. Tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area along the Florida west coast by
Tuesday evening. Hurricane conditions are possible along the
Florida West coast within the Hurricane Watch area on Wednesday,
with tropical storm conditions possibly beginning by Tuesday
night.
 
RAINFALL:  Ian is expected to produce the following rainfall through
Thursday:
 
Cayman Islands: 3 to 6 inches, with local maxima up to 8 inches.
 
Western Cuba: 6 to 10 inches, with local maxima up to 16 inches.
 
Florida Keys: 4 to 6 inches.
 
Central West Florida: 8 to 10 inches, with local maxima up to 15
inches.
 
Remainder of the Florida Peninsula: 3 to 8 inches.
 
Heavy rainfall is expected to affect North Florida, eastern portions
of the Florida Panhandle, and portions of the Southeast, and Mid
Atlantic regions Friday and Saturday.
 
These rains may produce flash flooding and mudslides in areas of
higher terrain over  western Cuba. Considerable flooding impacts are
possible mid-to-late week in central Florida given already saturated
antecedent conditions, and flash and urban flooding is possible with
rainfall across the Florida Keys and the Florida peninsula through
mid week. Limited flood impacts and rises on area streams and rivers
are possible over northern Florida and portions of the Southeast
mid-to-late week.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible late tonight and Tuesday 
across the Florida Keys and the southern and central Florida 
Peninsula.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting Jamaica and the Cayman
Islands. Swells will spread northwestward to the southwestern coast
of Cuba and the coasts of Honduras, Belize, and the Yucatan
Peninsula of Mexico today and tonight. Swell are expected to begin
affecting the Florida Keys Tuesday and spread northward along the
west coast of Florida through Wednesday.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Ian Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
500 AM EDT Mon Sep 26 2022
 
Satellite imagery shows that Ian has quickly become better organized 
overnight. Banding has increased in all quadrants of the storm, and 
the eye has become much better defined in radar data from Grand 
Cayman.  The improving eye structure was also reported by an Air 
Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft that was in the storm 
overnight.  During a single pass through the northeastern portion 
of the storm the plane measured peak 700-mb flight-level winds of 71 
kt and SFMR winds of 57 kt.  Given the continued increase in 
organization and drop in central pressure on the latest center fix, 
the initial intensity has been increased to 65 kt, making Ian the 
fourth hurricane of the 2022 hurricane season.  The latest center 
drop from the aircraft supported a minimum pressure of 983 mb.
 
In addition to the development of an inner core, the upper-level
outflow over the storm has expanded overnight.  Ian will be
traversing the warm waters (30 degrees C) of the northwestern
Caribbean and remain within very low shear conditions today. These
very conducive environmental factors along with the improved
structure of the storm are likely to result in rapid intensification
today, and Ian is forecast to be a major hurricane when it moves 
near or over western Cuba tonight.  This is supported by the 
majority of the intensity guidance, and the SHIPS Rapid 
Intensification (RI) Index that gives a 90 percent chance of a 
30 kt increase in wind speed over the next 24 hours, and about a 60 
percent chance of a 40 kt increase in wind speed during that same 
period.  Ian is not expected to spend much time over western Cuba, 
and additional strengthening is likely over the southeastern Gulf 
of Mexico on Tuesday.  Around 60 hours, a sharp increase in 
southwesterly vertical wind shear and a drier mid-level environment 
to the northwest of Ian is likely to induce some weakening.  
Despite the reduction in intensity, Ian is likely to have an 
expanding wind field and will be slowing down by that time, which 
will have the potential to produce significant wind and storm surge 
impacts along the west coast of Florida.
 
The initial motion estimate is 325/12 kt. Ian is expected to turn
northward around the western side of a mid-level ridge during the
next day or so.  Later in the period, a broad trough over the
eastern United States is forecast to induce a north-northeastward
motion, however the steering currents are forecast to weaken 
around day 3, and a slower forward speed is expected by that time.
Although the track guidance is in good agreement during the first
48 hours, there is still significant spread after that time.  The
UKMET and ECWMF are still on the eastern side of the guidance and
show a track very near or over the west-central coast of Florida
while the GFS, HWRF, and HMON, and GFS ensemble mean are on the
western side with a track toward Appalachia Bay. The NHC track
forecast remains close to the TVCA multi-model consensus aid, and 
is very similar to the previous official forecast. It should again 
be stressed that there is still significant uncertainty in the track
of Ian, especially in the 3-5 day time frame, and users should not
focus on the details of the track forecast at longer time ranges.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Ian is expected to produce heavy rainfall and instances of
flash flooding and possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain,
particularly over Jamaica and Cuba.  Considerable flooding impacts
are possible later this week in west central Florida. Additional
flash and urban flooding, and flooding on rivers across the Florida
Peninsula and parts of the Southeast cannot be ruled out for later
this week.
 
2.  Life-threatening storm surge and hurricane-force winds are
expected in portions of western Cuba beginning late today, and
Ian is forecast to be at major hurricane strength when it is near
western Cuba. Efforts to protect life and property should be
rushed to completion.
 
3.  Ian is expected to be a major hurricane in the eastern Gulf of
Mexico during the middle of this week. Regardless of Ian’s exact
track and intensity, there is a risk of a life-threatening storm
surge, hurricane-force winds, and heavy rainfall along the west
coast of Florida and the Florida Panhandle by the middle of this
week.  Tropical Storm and Hurricane Watches have been issued for a
portion of the west coast of Florida and additional watches may be
required later today.
