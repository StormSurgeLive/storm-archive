A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm- 
force winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or 
dangerous.  Preparations to protect life and property should be 
rushed to completion.

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.

Interests in central Cuba, the Florida Keys, and the Florida
peninsula should monitor the progress of Ian.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ian was 
located near latitude 15.2 North, longitude 79.8 West. Ian is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). A turn toward the 
northwest at a similar forward speed is expected later today, 
followed by a north-northwestward motion on Monday and a northward 
motion on Tuesday with a slightly slower forward speed. On the 
forecast track, the center of Ian is forecast to pass well southwest 
of Jamaica today, and pass near or west of the Cayman Islands early 
Monday. Ian will then move near or over western Cuba Monday night 
and early Tuesday and emerge over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on 
Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Rapid strengthening is forecast to begin later today or tonight. Ian 
is expected to become a hurricane tonight or early Monday and reach 
major hurricane strength Monday night or early Tuesday before it 
reaches western Cuba.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach Grand Cayman by 
early Monday, with tropical storm conditions expected later tonight. 
Hurricane conditions are expected within the warning area in Cuba by 
early Tuesday, with tropical storm conditions expected by late 
Monday. Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical 
storm warning area in Cuba Monday night and Tuesday.

RAINFALL:  Ian is expected to produce the following rainfall:

Jamaica and the Cayman Islands: 3 to 6 inches, with local maxima up
to 8 inches.

Western Cuba: 6 to 10 inches, with local maxima up to 16 inches.

Florida Keys into southern and central Florida Peninsula: 2 to 4
inches, with local maxima up to 6 inches beginning Monday through
Wednesday morning.

Heavy rainfall may affect north Florida, the Florida panhandle and
the southeast United States Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

These rains may produce flash flooding and mudslides in areas of
higher terrain, particularly over Jamaica and Cuba. Flash and urban
flooding are possible across the Florida Keys and the Florida 
peninsula through mid week. Additional flooding and rises on
area streams and rivers across northern Florida and parts of the
southeast U.S. later this week cannot be ruled out, especially in 
central Florida given already saturated conditions.

STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 9
to 14 feet above normal tide levels along the coast of western Cuba
in areas of onshore winds in the hurricane warning area Monday night 
and early Tuesday.

Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Cayman Islands Sunday night into Monday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting Jamaica and will 
spread to the Cayman Islands later today. Swells will then spread 
northwestward to the southwestern coast of Cuba and the coasts of 
Honduras, Belize, and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico on Monday and 
Monday night. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf 
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local 
weather office.
