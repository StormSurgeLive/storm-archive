DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Ian
was located near latitude 33.9 North, longitude 79.2 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the north near 15 mph (24
km/h). Ian is forecast to move farther inland overnight over 
eastern South Carolina, move across central North Carolina early 
tomorrow and western Virginia by early Sunday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  These winds are occurring primarily over water. 
Ian should continue to weaken overnight and dissipate over western 
North Carolina or Virginia late tomorrow.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
from the center.  A WeatherFlow station at Oak Island, North 
Carolina recently reported sustained winds of 54 mph (87 km/h) with 
a gust to 78 mph (126 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 982 mb (29.00 inches) 
based on surface observations.

 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
* Cape Fear River...2-4 ft
* South Santee River to Duck, including Pamlico and Neuse
Rivers...2-4 ft
* Albemarle Sound...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue in
portions of the warning area through overnight.
 
RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall:
 
* Northeast South Carolina: 4 to 8 inches, with local maxima of 12
inches.
* Central South Carolina, North Carolina, and southern Virginia:
3 to 6 inches with local maxima of 8 inches
* Elsewhere in Virginia, portions of West Virginia, Washington D.C.,
and Maryland: 1 to 3 inches, local maxima of 5 inches.
 
Major-to-record river flooding will continue across central Florida
through next week.  Considerable flash and urban flooding, and minor
river flooding is possible across coastal and northeast South
Carolina, coastal North Carolina and southeast Virginia today.
Locally considerable flash, urban, and small stream flooding is
possible today into early Saturday across portions of northwest
North Carolina and southwest Virginia. Limited flooding is possible
across portions of the southern Mid-Atlantic this weekend.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible through this evening across
eastern North Carolina, shifting northward into southeast Virginia
tonight through early Saturday morning.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian and a nearby frontal system are
affecting the east coast of Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, and the
northwestern Bahamas. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM EDT.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Ian Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
500 PM EDT Fri Sep 30 2022
 
Deep convection has ceased now that Ian has lost its energy source 
from the Atlantic Ocean, and the circulation has wrapped into cooler 
surface air.  Thus, Ian has transitioned into an extratropical low. 
The initial wind speed is set to 60 kt based on elevated 
hurricane-force winds still being observed on radar offshore of 
eastern South Carolina.
 
Ian continues to move faster to the north, around 13 kt, and should
turn to the north-northwest later today due to a shortwave trough
over the southeastern United States.  Ian should rapidly weaken in
the cool airmass and dissipate by early Sunday over western North
Carolina or Virginia.  No significant changes were made to the
track or intensity forecast.

It should be emphasized that just because Ian has become a 
post-tropical cyclone that the danger is not over.  Dangerous storm 
surge, flash flooding and high winds are still in the forecast from 
this cyclone.  
 
Key Messages:
 
1. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge this evening 
along the coasts of the Carolinas within the Storm Surge Warning 
areas.
 
2. Tropical-storm-force winds are expected along the coasts of South
Carolina and southeastern North Carolina within the warning area
through early Saturday.
 
3. Ongoing major-to-record river flooding will continue through
next week across portions of central Florida. Considerable flooding
is expected today across portions of coastal and northeast South
Carolina, coastal North Carolina and southeast Virginia. Locally
considerable flooding is possible across portions of northwest North
Carolina and southern Virginia today into early Saturday.
