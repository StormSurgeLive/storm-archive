Tropical Depression Eleven Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112022
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 28 2022
 

There's been little change of note with the depression this 
evening. All of its deep convection is displaced well to the 
northeast of its center of circulation. In the absence of recent 
ASCAT data, the intensity is based on the subjective Dvorak 
classifications from TAFB and SAB which suggest an intensity of 
25-30 kt. Conservatively the advisory intensity was held at 30 kt, 
but this may be generous.

There was a slight westward adjustment to the position of the 
depression at 00Z, which resulted in an adjustment of the track 
forecast in that direction. Otherwise there's no change to any 
thinking behind the forecast. The depression should continue 
heading generally northwestward or north-northwestward for a day 
or two. The environment around the cyclone is forecast to quickly 
get very hostile, which should prevent strengthening and should 
cause it to dissipate within a few days, as indicated by all 
dynamical models. The NHC track and intensity forecasts remain near 
the various consensus aids.

to move across central Florida this morning and emerge over the 
western Atlantic later today.  Ian is forecast to turn northward on 
Friday and approach the northeastern Florida, Georgia, and South 
Carolina coasts.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 75 mph (120 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Further weakening is expected for the next day
or so, but Ian could be near hurricane strength when it moves over
the Florida East coast later today, and when it approaches the
northeastern Florida, Georgia and South Carolina coasts on Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175
miles (280 km).  A WeatherFlow station at New Smyrna Beach, 
Florida, recently reported a sustained wind of 55 mph (89 km/h) and 
a gust to 86 mph (139 km/h).  A sustained wind of 39 mph (63 km/h) 
and a gust to 66 mph (106 km/h) were recently reported at 
Melbourne, Florida.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
* Englewood to Bonita Beach, including Charlotte Harbor...5-8 ft
* Bonita Beach to Chokoloskee...4-6 ft
* Flagler/Volusia County Line to Altamaha Sound...4-6 ft
* Middle of Longboat Key to Englewood... 3-5 ft
* Altamaha Sound to South Santee River...3-5 ft
* St. Johns River north of Julington...3-5
* St. Johns River south of Julington...2-4 ft
* Chokoloskee to East Cape Sable...2-4 ft
* Suwannee River to Middle of Longboat Key, including Tampa 
Bay...2-4 ft
* South Santee River to Little River Inlet...2-4 ft
* East Cape Sable to Card Sound Bridge...1-3 ft
* Patrick Air Force Base to Flagler/Volusia County Line...1-3 ft
* East of Little River Inlet to Cape Lookout...1-3 ft
* Florida Keys...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND: Wind damage is likely near the center of Ian.  Hurricane 
conditions are ongoing within the Hurricane Warning area now and 
will slowly spread northeastward overnight.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected to begin along the east coast of
Florida in the Hurricane Warning area this morning.  Hurricane 
conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch area today through 
late Friday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are occuring in parts of the warning area
on the east coast of Florida and should spread northward through
the northeast Florida, Georgia and South Carolina coasts today.  
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the Tropical Storm Watch 
area starting on Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall amounts:
 
* Central and Northeast Florida: 12 to 20 inches, with local
maxima up to 30 inches.
* Coastal Georgia and Low Country of South Carolina: 4 to 8
inches, with local maxima of 12 inches.
* Upstate and central South Carolina, North Carolina, and
southern Virginia: 3 to 6 inches with local maxima of 8 inches
across western North Carolina.
 
Widespread, life-threatening catastrophic flash and urban flooding,
with major to record flooding along rivers, will continue across
central Florida.  Widespread considerable flash, urban, and river
flooding is expected across portions of northeast Florida,
southeastern Georgia, and eastern South Carolina today through
the weekend.  Locally considerable flash, urban, and river flooding
is possible this weekend across portions of the southern
Appalachians with limited flooding possible across portions of
southern Mid-Atlantic.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two remains possible across parts of
east-central and northeast Florida through this morning. This
threat will shift into the coastal Carolinas on Friday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting the northern coast
of Cuba, the northeastern coast of the Yucatan peninsula and
west coast of Florida. Swells will increase along the east coast of
Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina today.  These swells are likely 
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Hurricane Ian Forecast Discussion Number 26</title>

Hurricane Ian Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
1100 PM EDT Wed Sep 28 2022
 
Ian remains inland over central Florida at this time.  Although the
eye is no longer evident on satellite or radar imagery, it 
continues to have a well-organized cloud pattern, and surface 
observations show hurricane-force winds near the system's core.  
Assuming a decay rate similar to that given by the Decay-SHIPS 
model, the current intensity is set at 80 kt.  Given the lack of 
pressure observations from surface stations, the central pressure is 
estimated using a blend of standard wind/pressure relationships.
 
Steady weakening will occur while Ian continues to move over land. 
Although not explicitly shown by the official forecast, the cyclone 
could still be at hurricane strength when it reaches the central 
east coast of Florida or the southeast U.S. coast.  Therefore, a 
hurricane warnings and watches are in effect for that area.  The 
environment during the next 36 hours or so does not appear to be 
conducive for strengthening, with strong shear and dry air 
prevailing.  However some intensification is possible due to a 
favorable trough interaction.  The official intensity forecast is 
above the model guidance at this time.

Ian continues to move north-northeastward, or about 030/7 kt.  
Over the next couple of days, the system should move around a 
trough near the southeastern U.S. and west of a subtropical ridge 
over the southwestern Atlantic.  The official track forecast is 
shifted slightly east of the previous one and is on top of the new 
multi-model consensus.

Since the radar presentation of the center has degraded, and the 
center is no longer easily trackable, hourly Tropical Cyclone 
Updates will no longer be issued.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Severe and life-threatening storm surge inundation of 8 to 10 
feet above ground level along with destructive waves is ongoing 
along the southwest Florida coastline from Englewood to Bonita 
Beach, including Charlotte Harbor.
 
2. Hurricane-force winds, especially in gusts, will continue to
spread across central Florida near the core of Ian through early
Thursday. Hurricane conditions are expected along the east-central
Florida coast overnight through early Thursday.
 
3. Widespread, life-threatening catastrophic flooding, with major to
record river flooding, will continue across portions of central
Florida tonight with considerable flooding in northern Florida,
southeastern Georgia and eastern South Carolina expected tomorrow
through the end of the week.
 
4.  There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge on Thursday
and Friday along the coasts of northeast Florida, Georgia, and South
Carolina, with hurricane conditions possible. Residents in these
areas should follow any advice given by local officials.
