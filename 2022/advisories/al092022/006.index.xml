DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Fiona
was located near latitude 47.9 North, longitude 61.3 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the north near 25 mph (41
km/h), and a slightly slower northward motion is expected during 
the next few days.   On the forecast track, the center of Fiona will
move across the Gulf of St. Lawrence today, and then move across 
Labrador and over the Labrador Sea on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is expected during the next couple of 
days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 405
miles (650 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface 
observations is 945 mb (27.91 inches).   An observation on St. Paul 
Island recently reported a sustained wind of 67 mph (107 km/h) and 
a gust to 82 (132 km/h).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Fiona can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are occurring in portions of the
hurricane warning area in Canada. Tropical storm conditions are
occurring in portions of the tropical storm warning area in Canada.
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in 
Labrador on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following additional
rainfall:
 
Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and western Newfoundland: 1 to 3
inches (25 to 75 mm), resulting in storm total rainfall maxima of up
to 10 inches (200 mm). Flooding is expected, some of which could be
significant.
 
Labrador and eastern Quebec:  2 to 5 inches (50 to 125 mm).
 
Eastern New Brunswick: 1 inch (25 mm) with locally higher amounts.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding within the warning areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of
onshore winds. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting Atlantic Canada, the
northeastern United States coast, and Bermuda. The swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Fiona Discussion Number  41
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
1100 AM AST Sat Sep 24 2022
 
Fiona continues to produce hurricane-force winds, heavy rains,
storm surge, and rough marine conditions across Atlantic Canada and
the surrounding waters. Surface observations suggest that the
minimum pressure has been rising, and is now estimated to be 
about 945 mb, which is still extraordinarily low.  The maximum 
winds of the storm are decreasing and are estimated to be near 70 
kt.
 
Fiona is now an occluded low, and it has slowed down.  The initial
motion is estimated to be northward at 22 kt.  A slower northward
motion is forecast during the next few days, taking the center of
the system across the Gulf of St. Lawrence through tonight, across
Labrador early Sunday, and into the Labrador Sea by Sunday night.
The NHC track forecast is just a touch to the west of the previous
one.
 
Winds are expected to fall below hurricane strength later today,
but the cyclone is still forecast to be a potent low for the next
day or so while it continues to affect Atlantic Canada.  NHC will
continue to issue forecasts for Fiona until gale-force winds end
along the Atlantic Canada coastline.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Fiona is forecast to continue to affect portions of Atlantic
Canada during the next day or so, and significant impacts
from high winds, storm surge, and heavy rainfall are expected.
Hurricane and Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect for much of
Atlantic Canada.

2. Heavy rains from Fiona are expected to continue to impact 
portions of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and western 
Newfoundland today, persisting across eastern Quebec and Labrador 
into Sunday. This rainfall is expected to produce flooding, some of 
which could be significant. 
 
3. Large swells generated by Fiona are expected to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the coast of
the northeast United States, Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada during
the next couple of days.

products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gaston was
located near latitude 38.0 North, longitude 30.8 West. Gaston is
moving toward the west-southwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A turn toward
the west is anticipated later today, followed by a turn to the
southwest by late Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual weakening is forecast over the next few days, and Gaston is 
expected to become a post-tropical cyclone later today.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gaston can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical-storm-force winds are expected in portions of the
western and central Azores for the next several hours.  See 
products issued by the meteorological service in the Azores for 
more information.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Gaston are expected to affect portions of
the Azores through tonight.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
 
RAINFALL:  Gaston is expected to produce additional rainfall
accumulations of 1 to 2 inches with locally higher amounts of 3
inches across the western and central Azores.  This will result in
storm total rainfall of 2 to 6 inches which may result in landslides
and areas of flooding.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 600 PM GMT.
Next complete advisory at 900 PM GMT.

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
300 PM GMT Sat Sep 24 2022
 
Gaston has lost most of its deep convection and it is currently an 
exposed low-level circulation.  The closest relatively deep 
convective activity is south of Pico Island over 100 miles away 
from the center and likely terrain-induced. Though a recent 
scatterometer pass missed the center of Gaston, it did show an area 
of tropical-storm-force winds of around 35 kt to the east of the 
center.  Therefore, the initial intensity has been lowered to 40 
kt, slightly higher than the satellite intensity estimates.
 
Hostile environmental conditions have weakened Gaston considerably.
The strong vertical wind shear and dry mid-level humidities are not
expected to improve for the remainder of the forecast period, and
additional weakening is likely.  The official forecast is similar to
the previous prediction and still shows Gaston becoming fully
post-tropical within 12 hours.  A couple of the global models,
however, indicate a mid-latitude shortwave trough/baroclinic zone
interacting with post-tropical Gaston early Sunday morning could
develop isolated deep convection, but this should be a short-lived
event.
 
The storm is moving west-southwestward at an estimated 245/8 kt.  A
building mid-level ridge to the north is expected to steer Gaston
to the west through Monday morning, and to the west-southwest 
until it dissipates near the end of the week.  The NHC forecast 
track is shifted slightly south of the previous advisory track, 
likely due to the southern shift of the initial position.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions over the western and central Azores
today should diminish today as Gaston moves away from the islands.
 
2. Gaston is expected to produce heavy rainfall over the western
and central Azores through Saturday.  This rainfall may result in
landslides and areas of flooding.

A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area. A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests in western and central Cuba, the Florida Keys, and the
Florida peninsula should monitor the progress of Ian.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ian was 
located near latitude 14.4 North, longitude 75.2 West. Ian is moving 
toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this general motion is 
expected to continue through tonight. A turn toward the northwest is 
forecast on Sunday, followed by a north-northwestward turn on Monday 
and a northward motion on Tuesday. On the forecast track, the center 
of Ian is forecast to move across the central Caribbean Sea today, 
pass southwest of Jamaica on Sunday, and pass near or over the 
Cayman Islands Sunday night and early Monday. Ian will then approach 
western Cuba late Monday and emerge over the southeastern Gulf of 
Mexico on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Significant strengthening is forecast during the next few 
days. Ian is expected to become a hurricane late Sunday or Sunday 
night and could be at or near major hurricane strength late Monday 
when it approaches western Cuba. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches) 
based on NOAA Hurricane Hunter dropsonde data.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible in the Cayman Islands by
early Monday, with tropical storm conditions possible by Sunday
night. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Jamaica on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce the following rainfall:
 
Southern Haiti and southern Dominican Republic: 2 to 4 inches, with 
local maxima up to 6 inches

Jamaica and the Cayman Islands: 4 to 8 inches, with local maxima up 
to 12 inches

Western to central Cuba: 6 to 10 inches, with local maxima up to 14 
inches

Florida Keys and south Florida: 1 to 3 inches, with local maxima up 
to 5 inches through Tuesday morning

These rains may produce flash flooding and mudslides in areas of 
higher terrain, particularly over Jamaica and Cuba. Flash and urban 
flooding is possible with rainfall across the Florida Keys and the 
Florida peninsula through mid next week. Additional flooding and 
rises on area streams and rivers across Florida cannot be ruled out 
through next week given already saturated antecedent conditions. 
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to
4 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas
of onshore winds in the Cayman Islands Sunday night into Monday.
 
Localized coastal flooding is possible along the coast of Jamaica in
areas of onshore winds on Sunday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ian will begin affecting Jamaica and the
Cayman Islands on Sunday and spread westward to Cuba by Monday.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 500 PM EDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Ian Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Ian Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
1100 AM EDT Sat Sep 24 2022
 
Ian still has an asymmetric appearance in satellite imagery this 
morning, with most of the deep convection located over the western 
portion of the circulation. Tail Doppler radar and dropsonde data 
from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate the cyclone is still 
vertically tilted, with the low- to mid-level center displaced to 
the south of the surface center. This structure is likely a product 
of the northerly shear that has affected the cyclone since genesis. 
The aircraft reported 700-mb flight-level winds of 43 kt and SFMR 
retrievals slightly above 35 kt, which supports keeping the initial 
intensity at 40 kt for this advisory.

The initial motion is a bit south of due west at 260/13 kt. A 
generally westward motion is expected through tonight as the cyclone 
is steered by a narrow ridge to its north. Ian is forecast to turn 
northwestward on Sunday and north-northwestward on Monday as it 
moves across the northwestern Caribbean Sea around the periphery of 
the ridge. The NHC track forecast during this period has been 
adjusted slightly south and west of the previous one, in line with 
the track consensus aids. Beyond 72 h, there is still a large amount 
of cross-track spread in the guidance as Ian emerges into the 
eastern Gulf of Mexico and approaches Florida. Hopefully, data 
collected from special radiosonde releases beginning later today and 
a scheduled NOAA G-IV flight will help resolve the steering flow 
around Ian and deep-layer trough that is forecast to be over the 
eastern U.S. early next week. The guidance envelope has once again 
shifted westward this cycle, and the official NHC track forecast has 
been adjusted in this direction as well, though it still lies 
slightly to the east of the TVCA and HCCA aids. Further adjustments 
to the track forecast may be needed given the increased uncertainty 
in the day 3-5 period. 

Ian is moving into a lower shear environment over very warm waters, 
and it should not take long for the system to shed its tilted 
structure and develop an inner core. Once that occurs, significant 
to rapid intensification is expected while Ian crosses the 
northwestern Caribbean Sea. The intensity guidance unanimously 
supports strengthening during the next several days, and the 
SHIPS-RII probabilities indicate a 67 percent chance of a 65-kt 
intensity increase in 72 h. Therefore, the NHC track forecast has 
been raised from the previous one, showing Ian becoming a hurricane 
by late Sunday and approaching western Cuba at or near major 
hurricane strength by Monday night. Limited land interaction is 
expected as the cyclone quickly passes over western Cuba, and Ian 
is forecast to be a major hurricane over the eastern Gulf of Mexico 
on Tuesday and Wednesday as it approaches the west coast of Florida.
  
Key Messages:
 
1.  Ian is expected to produce heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and 
possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain, particularly over 
Jamaica and Cuba. Limited flash and urban flooding is possible with 
rainfall across the Florida Keys and Florida peninsula through mid 
next week.
 
2.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the Cayman Islands by early 
Monday, with tropical storm conditions possible by late Sunday.  
Tropical storm conditions are possible in Jamaica on
Sunday.

3.  Ian is forecast to move near or over western Cuba and approach 
the west coast of the Florida peninsula at or near major hurricane 
strength early next week, where there is increasing confidence in 
multiple life-threatening hazards: storm surge, hurricane-force 
winds and rainfall flooding. While it is too soon to determine the 
exact magnitude and location of these hazards, residents in Cuba, 
the Florida Keys, and the Florida peninsula should ensure they have 
their hurricane plan in place, follow any advice given by local 
officials, and closely monitor updates to the forecast.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM CVT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Hermine was
located near latitude 20.8 North, longitude 20.8 West. Hermine is
moving toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h) and this motion is
expected to continue during the next day or two.  After that time, 
a turn toward the northwest is expected.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Weakening is forecast, and Hermine is expected to become a 
remnant low in a day or two.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Hermine is expected to produce 3 to 6 (75 to 150 mm) 
inches of rainfall with localized higher amounts up to 10 inches 
(250 mm) across the Canary Islands through this weekend. This
rainfall may cause some flash flooding in areas of higher terrain.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM CVT.

Tropical Storm Hermine Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102022
200 PM CVT Sat Sep 24 2022
 
Hermine is a strongly sheared and weak tropical cyclone.  Satellite
images indicate that the low-level center is exposed well to the
south-southwest of the main area of deep convection.  A recent
ASCAT-B pass caught the eastern half of the storm and showed
peak winds of about 30 kt well northeast of the center.  Based on
this data and the Dvorak estimates, Hermine is being held at a
35-kt tropical storm for this advisory, but that could be a little
generous.  Regardless, the main impact is heavy rain that continues 
across the Canary Islands.
 
The storm is moving northward at 7 kt and that motion is expected 
to continue during the next day or two while Hermine moves in the 
flow on the west side of a subtropical ridge.   After that time, a 
turn toward the left is expected as the shallow system is steered by 
the low-level flow.  The NHC track forecast remains near the middle 
of the guidance envelope.
 
Hermine is currently experiencing about 20 kt of southwesterly
vertical wind shear.  Since the shear is expected to increase while
Hermine moves into a region of cooler SSTs and drier air, weakening
is forecast.  Hermine is now predicted to become a remnant low in
36 hours, but given recent trends and the expected environment, the
transition to a post-tropical cyclone could occur sooner than that.
