200 AM EDT Mon Sep 26 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Ian, located over the western Caribbean Sea, and has <br/>
issued the last advisory on Tropical Storm Gaston, located a few <br/>
hundred miles west of the western Azores.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
An area of low pressure located several hundred miles west of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands is producing persistent but disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions appear <br/>
conducive for some development, and a tropical depression could <br/>
form during the next few days before upper-level winds become less <br/>
favorable toward the end of the week.  The system is expected to <br/>
meander during the next day or two and then move slowly <br/>
north-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

Post-Tropical Cyclone Gaston Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
300 AM GMT Mon Sep 26 2022
 
Gaston lacks organized deep convection and has become post-tropical.
Organized convection is not expected to redevelop due to hostile
upper-level winds and a dry surrounding environment. Therefore, this
is the final NHC advisory. ASCAT data valid at 2353 UTC indicated
peak winds between 30-35 kt on the north side of Gaston. Assuming a
little undersampling may have occurred, the initial intensity was 
set on the high end of those estimates at 35 kt.
 
Gaston is forecast to move generally west-southwestward for the next
day or so, steered by a low- to mid-level ridge that extends across
most of the northern Atlantic. Since deep convection is not expected
to redevelop and no baroclinic forcing is expected to otherwise
sustain the remnants of Gaston, the cyclone should gradually spin
down until it dissipates in about 48 h. No significant changes were
made to the NHC track or intensity forecast.

A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests in central Cuba, the remainder of the Florida Keys, and
the Florida peninsula should monitor the progress of Ian.
Additional watches may be need later today farther north along the
west coast of Florida.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ian was located
near latitude 18.2 North, longitude 82.0 West.  Ian is moving toward
the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A turn toward the 
north-northwest is expected today followed by a northward
motion on Tuesday with a slightly slower forward speed.  A turn
toward the north-northeast is forecast on Tuesday night or early
Wednesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Ian is expected
to pass near or west of the Cayman Islands today, and near or
over western Cuba tonight and early Tuesday.  Ian will then
emerge over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday, and pass
west of the Florida Keys late Tuesday, and approach the west coast
of Florida on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Rapid strengthening is expected during the next
day or so, and Ian is forecast to become a major hurricane tonight 
when it is near western Cuba. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force 
Reserve reconnaissance aircraft data is 983 mb (29.03 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE:   The combination of storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
*Anclote River to Englewood, FL including Tampa Bay... 5-8 ft
*Englewood to Bonita Beach, FL including Charlotte Harbor... 4-7 ft
*Bonita Beach to East Cape Sable, FL... 3-5 ft
*East Cape Sable to Card Sound Bridge, FL including Florida Bay...
2-4 ft
*Florida Keys including the Dry Tortugas... 2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 9 to 14 feet
above normal tide levels along the coast of western Cuba in areas
of onshore winds in the hurricane warning area Monday night
and early Tuesday.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Cayman Islands Sunday night into Monday.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm and hurricane conditions are expected on Grand
Cayman today. Hurricane conditions are expected within the warning
area in Cuba tonight, with tropical storm conditions expected
by late today.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical storm
warning area in Cuba Monday night and Tuesday.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible on Little Cayman and Cayman Brac today.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in the
lower Florida Keys on Tuesday.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area along the Florida west coast by
Tuesday evening. Hurricane conditions are possible along the
Florida West coast within the Hurricane Watch area on Wednesday,
with tropical storm conditions possibly beginning by Tuesday
night.
 
RAINFALL:  Ian is expected to produce the following rainfall through
Thursday:
 
Cayman Islands: 3 to 6 inches, with local maxima up to 8 inches.
 
Western Cuba: 6 to 10 inches, with local maxima up to 16 inches.
 
Florida Keys: 4 to 6 inches.
 
Central West Florida: 8 to 10 inches, with local maxima up to 15
inches.
 
Remainder of the Florida Peninsula: 3 to 8 inches.
 
Heavy rainfall is expected to affect North Florida, eastern portions
of the Florida Panhandle, and portions of the Southeast, and Mid
Atlantic regions Friday and Saturday.
 
These rains may produce flash flooding and mudslides in areas of
higher terrain over  western Cuba. Considerable flooding impacts are
possible mid-to-late week in central Florida given already saturated
antecedent conditions, and flash and urban flooding is possible with
rainfall across the Florida Keys and the Florida peninsula through
mid week. Limited flood impacts and rises on area streams and rivers
are possible over northern Florida and portions of the Southeast
mid-to-late week.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible late Monday night and
Tuesday across the Florida Keys and the southern and central
Florida Peninsula.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting Jamaica and the Cayman
Islands. Swells will spread northwestward to the southwestern coast
of Cuba and the coasts of Honduras, Belize, and the Yucatan
Peninsula of Mexico today and tonight. Swell are expected to begin
affecting the Florida Keys Tuesday and spread northward along the
west coast of Florida through Wednesday.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Hurricane Ian Forecast Discussion Number 12</title>

Tropical Storm Ian Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
1100 PM EDT Sun Sep 25 2022

The storm has become better organized-looking on satellite imagery, 
with strengthening central convection and developing banding 
features.  Upper-level anticyclonic outflow also appears to be 
increasing over the system.  Flight-level winds, Doppler radar 
velocities, and dropsonde data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that Ian's intensity is now near 55 kt.
 
Ian has turned toward the northwest and the initial motion estimate
is now 315/11 kt.  During the next 48 hours, the tropical cyclone
is expected to turn toward the north as it moves along the western
side of a mid-level high pressure area.  Later in the forecast
period, a broad mid-tropospheric trough over the eastern United 
States is likely to induce a slightly east of northward motion.  
However, around 4 days, the steering currents are forecast to 
weaken as the trough moves to the east of Ian's longitude.  Some 
of the guidance model tracks such as that from the GFS have, again, 
shifted to the east, mainly after 48 hours.  The official track 
forecast has been shifted somewhat to the east of the previous one 
and is mainly a blend of the latest ECMWF and GFS predictions.  It 
should again be stressed that there is still significant 
uncertainty in the track of Ian, especially in the 3-5 day time 
frame.  Users should not focus on the details of the track forecast 
at longer time ranges.

Observations from the aircraft indicate that the tropical cyclone 
is developing an inner core, so significant intensification is 
likely to occur during the next couple of days.  The SHIPS Rapid 
Intensification Index indicate a fairly high chance for rapid 
strengthening during the next 24 to 36 hours, and the official 
forecast reflects this likelihood, calling for Ian to become a 
major hurricane over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Ian is expected to produce heavy rainfall and instances of 
flash flooding and possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain, 
particularly over Jamaica and Cuba.  Considerable flooding impacts 
are possible later this week in west central Florida. Additional 
flash and urban flooding, and flooding on rivers across the Florida 
Peninsula and parts of the Southeast cannot be ruled out for later 
this week. 
 
2.  Life-threatening storm surge and hurricane-force winds are
expected in portions of western Cuba beginning late Monday, and Ian
is forecast to be at or near major hurricane strength when it is
near western Cuba. Efforts to protect life and property should be
rushed to completion.
 
3.  Ian is expected to be a major hurricane in the eastern Gulf of
Mexico during the middle of this week, but uncertainty in the track
and intensity forecasts remains higher than usual. Regardless of
Ian’s exact track and intensity, there is a risk of dangerous storm
surge, hurricane-force winds, and heavy rainfall along the west
coast of Florida and the Florida Panhandle by the middle of this
week, and residents in Florida should ensure they have their
hurricane plan in place. Follow any advice given by local officials
and closely monitor updates to the forecast.
