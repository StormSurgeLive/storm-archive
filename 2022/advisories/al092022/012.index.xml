Post-Tropical Cyclone Gaston Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
300 AM GMT Mon Sep 26 2022
 
Gaston lacks organized deep convection and has become post-tropical.
Organized convection is not expected to redevelop due to hostile
upper-level winds and a dry surrounding environment. Therefore, this
is the final NHC advisory. ASCAT data valid at 2353 UTC indicated
peak winds between 30-35 kt on the north side of Gaston. Assuming a
little undersampling may have occurred, the initial intensity was 
set on the high end of those estimates at 35 kt.
 
Gaston is forecast to move generally west-southwestward for the next
day or so, steered by a low- to mid-level ridge that extends across
most of the northern Atlantic. Since deep convection is not expected
to redevelop and no baroclinic forcing is expected to otherwise
sustain the remnants of Gaston, the cyclone should gradually spin
down until it dissipates in about 48 h. No significant changes were
made to the NHC track or intensity forecast.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ian was
located near latitude 17.3 North, longitude 81.4 West.  Ian is 
moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A turn toward
the north-northwest is expected on Monday followed by a northward
motion on Tuesday with a slightly slower forward speed.  On the
forecast track, the center of Ian is expected to pass near or west
of the Cayman Islands on Monday, and near or over western Cuba
Monday night and early Tuesday.  Ian will then emerge over the
southeastern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast tonight,
followed by more rapid strengthening on Monday and Tuesday.  Ian is
forecast to become a hurricane by early Monday and a major 
hurricane on Tuesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
observations is 989 mb (29.21 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach Grand Cayman on
Monday, with tropical storm conditions beginning late tonight.
Hurricane conditions are expected within the warning area in Cuba by
early Tuesday, with tropical storm conditions expected by late
Monday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical storm
warning area in Cuba Monday night and Tuesday.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible on Little Cayman and Cayman Brac on Monday.

Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in the
lower Florida Keys on Tuesday.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area along the Florida west coast by 
Tuesday evening. 

RAINFALL:  Ian is expected to produce the following rainfall:
 
Jamaica: Additional 1-3 inches, with storm total local maxima up to
8 inches.
 
Cayman Islands: 3 to 6 inches, with local maxima up to 8 inches.
 
Western Cuba: 6 to 10 inches, with local maxima up to 16 inches.
 
Florida Keys into southern and central Florida Peninsula: 2 to 4
inches, with local maxima up to 6 inches beginning Monday through
Wednesday evening.
 
Heavy rainfall may affect North Florida, the Florida Panhandle and
portions of the Southeast on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
 
These rains may produce flash flooding and mudslides in areas of
higher terrain, particularly over Jamaica and Cuba. Considerable
flooding impacts are possible later this week in west central
Florida given already saturated antecedent conditions, and flash and
urban flooding is possible with rainfall across the Florida Keys and
the Florida peninsula through mid week.  Additional flooding and
rises on area streams and rivers across northern Florida and parts
of the Southeast later this week cannot be ruled out.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
* Englewood to Bonita Beach, FL... 4-7 ft
* Bonita Beach to East Cape Sable, FL... 3-5 ft
* East Cape Sable to Card Sound Bridge, FL including Florida Bay...
2-4 ft
* Florida Keys including the Dry Tortugas... 2-4 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 9 to 14 feet
above normal tide levels along the coast of western Cuba in areas
of onshore winds in the hurricane warning area Monday night
and early Tuesday.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Cayman Islands Sunday night into Monday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting Jamaica and the Cayman
Islands. Swells will spread northwestward to the southwestern coast
of Cuba and the coasts of Honduras, Belize, and the Yucatan
Peninsula of Mexico on Monday and Monday night. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Ian Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Tropical Storm Ian Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
500 PM EDT Sun Sep 25 2022
 
The organization of Ian has not changed much since this morning. 
There have been some small bursts of convection closer to the center 
of the storm this afternoon, but the activity has not yet led to any 
notable changes in its structure. In fact, the most persistent 
convection has been in outer rainbands well to the northeast of the 
circulation near Jamaica. The SFMR wind data and adjusted 
flight-level winds from the earlier reconnaissance flights supported 
surface winds of 35-40 kt, and the initial intensity is set at 40 kt 
for this advisory. A NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to 
investigate Ian later tonight. 

The center of Ian has jogged a bit northward this afternoon, but its 
longer-term motion is west-northwestward at 300/10 kt. A generally 
northwestward motion is expected tonight, followed by a 
north-northwestward motion on Monday and early Tuesday as it moves 
across the northwestern Caribbean Sea and near or over western Cuba. 
From there, the track guidance still diverges at days 3-5 as Ian is 
forecast to move northward across the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The 
ECMWF and UKMET models still lie on the eastern edge of the guidance 
and bring the center of Ian over the coast of west-central Florida, 
while the HWRF and HMON models are on the western side of the 
envelope and show Ian approaching the central Florida panhandle. 
Notably, the GFS has trended slightly eastward for the past few 
cycles, which has brought the multi-model consensus aids a bit 
eastward as well. The latest NHC track forecast has been adjusted in 
this direction, but only on the order of 15-20 n mi in the extended 
range. Users are reminded not to focus on the details of the track 
forecast at longer time ranges, since uncertainty is still high and 
future adjustments may be required.
 
Although the storm has yet to develop an inner core, the conditions 
over the northwestern Caribbean Sea appear very likely to support 
strengthening once it becomes better organized. Some dry 
environmental air may have limited convection today, but the GFS- 
and ECMWF-simulated satellite imagery indicate that deep convection 
will increase during the diurnal maximum period overnight. Then, 
significant strengthening is expected with low deep-layer shear and 
high oceanic heat content along the forecast track. There is still 
strong support for rapid intensification in the latest intensity 
guidance, and the NHC intensity forecast shows Ian becoming a 
hurricane on Monday and a major hurricane on Tuesday. This forecast 
remains close to the IVCN multi-model consensus, with some model 
aids including HCCA showing even higher peak intensities. Strong 
southwesterly shear develops over Ian by 72 h related to interaction 
with an upper-level trough, and the structure of the cyclone could 
significantly degrade before landfall given these hostile 
conditions. However, Ian is likely to have an expanding wind field 
and will be slowing down by that time, which will have the potential 
to produce significant wind and storm surge impacts across portions 
of the Florida west coast and the Florida panhandle.

 
Key Messages:

1.  Ian is expected to produce heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and 
possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain, particularly over 
Jamaica and Cuba.  Flash and urban flooding is possible with 
rainfall across the Florida Keys and the Florida peninsula through 
the middle of the week. Additional flooding on rivers across 
northern Florida and parts of the southeast U.S. cannot be ruled out 
later this week. 

2.  Life-threatening storm surge and hurricane-force winds are 
expected in portions of western Cuba beginning late Monday, and Ian 
is forecast to be at or near major hurricane strength when it is 
near western Cuba. Efforts to protect life and property should be 
rushed to completion. 

3.  Ian is expected to be a major hurricane in the eastern Gulf of 
Mexico during the middle of this week, but uncertainty in the track 
and intensity forecasts remains higher than usual. Regardless of 
Ian’s exact track and intensity, there is a risk of dangerous storm 
surge, hurricane-force winds, and heavy rainfall along the west 
coast of Florida and the Florida Panhandle by the middle of this 
week, and residents in Florida should ensure they have their 
hurricane plan in place. Follow any advice given by local officials 
and closely monitor updates to the forecast.
