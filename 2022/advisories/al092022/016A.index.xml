DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ian was located 
near latitude 21.7 North, longitude 83.6 West. Ian is moving toward 
the north-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A turn toward the north 
with a slightly slower forward speed is expected today.  A turn 
toward the north-northeast with a further reduction in forward speed 
is forecast on Wednesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Ian 
is expected to move near or over western Cuba early this morning.  
Ian will then emerge over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico today, 
pass west of the Florida Keys later today, and approach the west 
coast of Florida on Wednesday into Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 110 mph (175 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Rapid strengthening is expected today, and 
Ian is forecast to become a major hurricane today when it is near 
western Cuba, and remain a major hurricane over the southeastern 
Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115
miles (185 km). 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 958 mb (28.29 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
* Anclote River to Middle of Longboat Key, FL including Tampa
Bay...5-10 ft
* Suwannee River to Anclote River...5-8 ft
* Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...5-8 ft
* Englewood, FL to Bonita Beach, FL including Charlotte Harbor...
4-7 ft
* Bonita Beach, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...3-5 ft
* Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL to Altamaha Sound including
St. Johns River...2-4 ft
* East Cape Sable, FL to Card Sound Bridge, FL including Florida
Bay...2-4 ft
* Aucilla River to Suwannee River...2-4 ft
* Florida Keys including the Dry Tortugas...2-4 ft
* Indian Pass, FL to Aucilla River...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 9 to 14 feet 
above normal tide levels along the coast of western Cuba in areas of 
onshore winds in the hurricane warning area early today.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the warning area in
Cuba through this morning. Destructive winds are possible where the
core of Ian moves across western Cuba. Tropical storm conditions
are expected within the tropical storm warning area in Cuba today.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected along the west coast of Florida
within the Hurricane Warning area on Wednesday, with tropical storm
conditions possibly beginning by tonight. Tropical storm
conditions are expected in the Tropical Storm Warning area by
this evening. Hurricane conditions are possible in the watch
area beginning on Wednesday, and tropical storm conditions are
possible in the watch area on Wednesday into early Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in the
lower Florida Keys and are possible in the watch area in the middle
Florida Keys beginning later today.
 
RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce the following rainfall through 
Thursday:
 
* Western Cuba: 6 to 10 inches, with local maxima up to 16 inches;
these rains may produce flash flooding and mudslides in areas of
higher terrain over western Cuba.
* Florida Keys: 4 to 6 inches, with local maxima up to 8 inches
* Coastal Southwest and Southeast Florida: 4 to 6 inches with
local maxima up to 10 inches.
* Central West Florida: 6 to 12 inches, with local maxima up to
20 inches.
* Northeast Florida: 6 to 10 inches, with local maxima up to 12
inches.
* Remainder of the Central Florida Peninsula:  4 to 8 inches.
 
Widespread considerable flash and urban flooding, and prolonged
significant river flooding is likely mid-to-late week across central
and northern Florida, southern Georgia, and coastal South Carolina.
Flash and urban flooding is also possible with rainfall across
southern Florida through mid week. Limited flash and river flooding
are possible over portions of the Southeast mid-to-late week.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible today across the Florida 
Keys and the southern and central Florida Peninsula.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting the western Caribbean,
and will begin to affect the Florida Keys today, and will spread
northward throughout the eastern Gulf of Mexico tonight and 
Wednesday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf 
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local 
weather office.

Hurricane Ian Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
1100 PM EDT Mon Sep 26 2022
 
Ian continues to become better organized on satellite images with 
intense deep convection in its Central Dense Overcast and numerous 
surrounding banding features.  The overall cloud pattern is quite 
symmetric with well-defined upper-level outflow.  Observations from 
both Air Force and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the 
central pressure is falling, and the intensity is increased to 90 
kt based on a recently reported 700 mb flight-level wind of 101 kt 
from the Air Force plane.  This is also in agreement with a 
subjective Dvorak satellite estimate from SAB.
 
Aside from its relatively brief time passing over western Cuba, Ian 
will be moving over waters of very high oceanic heat content during 
the next couple of days.  The various Rapid Intensification (RI) 
indices show a significant probability of RI and this is reflected 
in the short-term official intensity forecast.  However, the SHIPS 
guidance, which is based on global model predictions, indicates that 
a significant increase in southwesterly shear and a substantially 
drying of low- to mid-level air will begin in 24-36 hours.  The NHC 
forecast, like the previous one, shows strengthening to Category 4 
intensity in a day or so, followed by gradual weakening.  However, 
Ian is still expected to be a major hurricane when it reaches the 
Florida west coast.  The official intensity forecast is near or 
above the latest simple and corrected multi-model consensus 
predictions.

Ian continues its north-northwestward trek at about 340/11 kt.  The 
hurricane is expected to move north-northwestward to northward 
over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico during the next day or so, 
along the western periphery of a subtropical ridge.  After around 
36 hours, the track forecast becomes more uncertain, since there is 
considerable divergence of the track  models in the 2-3 day 
time frame.  The guidance also shows considerable slowing of the 
forward speed, due to a weakening of the steering currents, when 
Ian approaches the west coast of Florida.  This slower forward 
motion is likely to prolong the storm surge, wind, and rainfall 
impacts, especially along the west coast of Florida.  The official 
track forecast is adjusted just slightly east of the previous NHC 
prediction based on the latest multi-model consensus aid, TVCN.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Life-threatening storm surge, hurricane-force winds, flash floods 
and possible mudslides are expected in portions of western Cuba 
beginning overnight and continuing into Tuesday. Devastating wind 
damage is possible where the core of Ian moves across western Cuba. 
Efforts to protect life and property should be rushed to completion.
 
2. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge along much
of the Florida west coast where a storm surge warning has been
issued, with the highest risk from Fort Myers to the Tampa Bay
region.  Residents in these areas should listen to advice given by
local officials.
 
3. Hurricane-force winds are expected in the hurricane warning area
in west-central Florida beginning Wednesday morning with tropical
storm conditions expected by late Tuesday.
 
4. Heavy rainfall will spread across western Cuba through Tuesday.  
This will likely produce instances of flash flooding and possible 
mudslides in areas of higher terrain over western Cuba.  

5. Heavy rainfall will increase across the Florida Keys and South 
Florida Tuesday, spreading into central and northern Florida 
Wednesday and Thursday and the Southeast by Friday and Saturday, 
potentially causing flash, urban and small stream flooding. 
Considerable flooding, including significant, prolonged river 
flooding, is likely across Central Florida.
