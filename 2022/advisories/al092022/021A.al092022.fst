DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ian was located
near latitude 25.2 North, longitude 83.0 West. Ian is moving toward
the north-northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h). This general motion with
a reduction in forward speed is forecast tonight and Wednesday,
followed by a turn toward the north on Thursday. On the forecast
track, the center of Ian is expected to approach the west coast of
Florida within the hurricane warning area this morning, and move 
onshore later today. The center of Ian is forecast to move over 
central Florida Wednesday night and Thursday morning and emerge over 
the western Atlantic by late Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Ian is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Strengthening is forecast until the 
hurricane makes landfall, and Ian is forecast to approach the 
west coast of Florida as an extremely dangerous major hurricane.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140
miles (220 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 953 mb (28.14 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

* Middle of Longboat Key to Bonita Beach, including Charlotte
Harbor...8-12 ft
* Bonita Beach to Chokoloskee...6-10 ft
* Anclote River to Middle of Longboat Key, including Tampa
Bay...4-6 ft
* Suwannee River to Anclote River...3-5 ft
* Mouth of the St. Mary's River to Altamaha Sound...4-6 ft
* Chokoloskee to East Cape Sable...4-7 ft
* Lower Keys from Key West to Big Pine Key, including the Dry
Tortugas...3-5 ft
* Flagler/Volusia County Line to Mouth of the St. Mary's River,
including St. Johns River...3-5 ft
* Altamaha Sound to Savannah River...3-5 ft
* St. Johns River south of Julington...2-4 ft
* Savannah River to South Santee River...2-4 ft
* East Cape Sable to Card Sound Bridge...2-4 ft
* Florida Keys east of Big Pine Key...2-4 ft
* Patrick Air Force Base to Flagler/Volusia County Line...1-3 ft
* Indian Pass to Suwanee River...1-3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to begin along the west 
coast of Florida within the Hurricane Warning area later this 
morning, with tropical storm conditions beginning before daybreak.

Tropical storm conditions are occurring in the warning area in the
Florida Keys, and will continue this morning.  Tropical storm
conditions are expected in the warning area on the east coast of
Florida beginning today, and should spread up the Georgia and 
South Carolina coasts tonight and Thursday.  Tropical storm 
conditions are expected within the warning area in Cuba for the 
next few hours.

RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce the following storm
total rainfall:

* Florida Keys and South Florida: 6 to 8 inches, with local
maxima up to 12 inches.
* Central and Northeast Florida: 12 to 18 inches, with local
maxima up to 24 inches.
* Eastern Georgia and Coastal South Carolina: 4 to 8 inches,
with local maxima of 12 inches.

Widespread catastrophic flash, urban, and river flooding is
expected across central Florida.  Widespread considerable flash,
urban, and river flooding is expected across portions of southern
Florida through tomorrow and northeast Florida, southeastern
Georgia, and coastal South Carolina later this week through the
weekend.  Limited flash, urban, and river flooding is possible over
portions of the Southeast and southern Mid-Atlantic later this week
through the weekend.

TORNADOES: Tornadoes are possible today across central and south 
Florida.

SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting the northern coast 
of Cuba, the northeastern coast of the Yucatan peninsula, the 
Florida Keys, and the Gulf coast of Florida.  These swells will 
spread westward along portions of the north-central Gulf 
coast during the next day or so. Swells will increase along the 
east coast of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina tonight and 
Thursday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf 
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local 
weather office.
