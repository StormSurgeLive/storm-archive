<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Ian, located over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure <br/>
located several hundred miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands <br/>
continue to show signs of organization. Although environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to be marginally conducive for development, <br/>
only a slight increase in organization would result in the formation <br/>
of a short-lived tropical depression today. Further development will <br/>
become less likely by the end of the week due to increasing <br/>
upper-level winds. The disturbance is forecast to meander for the <br/>
next day or so and then turn north-northwestward by Thursday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM EDT (1100 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Ian was located by 
Air Force and NOAA Hurricane Hunter data near latitude 25.9 North, 
longitude 82.8 West. Ian is moving toward the north-northeast near 
9 mph (15 km/h). This general motion with a reduction in forward 
speed is forecast today, followed by a turn toward the north on 
Thursday. On the forecast track, the center of Ian is expected to 
approach the west coast of Florida within the hurricane warning 
area this morning, and move onshore later today. The center of Ian 
is forecast to move over central Florida tonight and Thursday 
morning and emerge over the western Atlantic by late Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 155 mph (250 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Ian is a category 4 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Ian is forecast to make 
landfall on the west coast of Florida as a catastrophic category 4 
hurricane.  Weakening is expected after landfall. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The minimum central pressure is 937 mb (27.67 inches) based on Air 
Force Hurricane Hunter dropsonde data.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
* Englewood to Bonita Beach, including Charlotte Harbor...12-16 ft
* Middle of Longboat Key to Englewood... 6-10 ft
* Bonita Beach to Chokoloskee...7-11 ft
* Anclote River to Middle of Longboat Key, including Tampa Bay...4-6 
ft
* Chokoloskee to East Cape Sable...4-7 ft
* Suwannee River to Anclote River...3-5 ft
* Lower Keys from Key West to Big Pine Key, including the 
Dry Tortugas...3-5 ft
* Flagler/Volusia County Line to Savannah River including St. Johns 
River...3-5 ft
* St. Johns River south of Julington...2-4 ft
* Savannah River to South Santee River...2-4 ft
* East Cape Sable to Card Sound Bridge...2-4 ft
* Florida Keys east of Big Pine Key...2-4 ft
* Patrick Air Force Base to Flagler/Volusia County Line...1-3 ft
* Indian Pass to Suwanee River...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Catastrophic wind damage is likely where the core of Ian
moves onshore.  Hurricane conditions will begin along the west
coast of Florida within the Hurricane Warning area later this
morning, with tropical storm conditions beginning before daybreak.
 
Tropical storm conditions are occurring in the warning area in the
Florida Keys, and will continue this morning.  Tropical storm
conditions are expected in the warning area on the east coast of
Florida beginning today, and should spread up the Georgia and
South Carolina coasts tonight and Thursday.  Tropical storm
conditions are expected within the warning area in Cuba for the
next few hours.
 
RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall:
 
* Florida Keys and South Florida: 6 to 8 inches, with local maxima
up to 12 inches.
* Central and Northeast Florida: 12 to 18 inches, with local
maxima up to 24 inches.
* Eastern Georgia and Coastal South Carolina: 4 to 8 inches, with
local maxima of 12 inches.
 
Widespread, life-threatening catastrophic flash, urban, and river
flooding is expected across central Florida.  Widespread
considerable flash, urban, and river flooding is expected across
portions of southern Florida through Wednesday, and northeast
Florida, southeastern Georgia, and coastal South Carolina later this
week through the weekend.  Limited flash, urban, and river flooding
is possible over portions of the Southeast and southern Mid-Atlantic
later this week through the weekend.
 
TORNADOES: Tornadoes are possible today and tonight across central
and south Florida.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting the northern coast
of Cuba, the northeastern coast of the Yucatan peninsula and 
west coast of Florida. These swells will spread westward along 
portions of the north-central Gulf coast during the next day or so. 
Swells will increase along the east coast of Florida, Georgia, and 
South Carolina tonight and Thursday.  These swells are likely to 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Ian Special Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
700 AM EDT Wed Sep 28 2022

This special advisory is being issued to update Ian's current and 
forecast intensity.  Recent NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane 
Hunter flight-level winds are as high as 160 kt, with SFMR data 
around 135 kt, with a central pressure down to 937 mb.  This 
supports a current intensity of 135 kt.  

The forecast intensity is raised to 135 kt at landfall, and we are 
now forecasting a catastrophic storm surge of 12 to 16 ft from 
Englewood to Bonita Beach, Florida.  No other significant changes 
were made to the forecast.  

Previous discussion --
 
Ian completed an eyewall replacement cycle during the overnight
hours, and very recent data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane
Hunter aircraft indicate that the hurricane has reached category 4
intensity.  The plane reported that the central pressure has fallen
to 942 mb, down about 10 mb from around midnight.  The plane
measured a peak 700-mb flight-level wind of 141 kt, and an SFMR
wind of 109 kt.  A blend of the 700-mb reduced wind and the SFMR
yields an initial intensity of 120 kt.  Although there is some
moderate shear over the hurricane, this is not likely to affect Ian
very much due to its large size. Some fluctuations in intensity are
possible before the center reaches the coast later today, but Ian is
expected to reach the coast as an extremely dangerous category 4
hurricane.  Weakening is expected while Ian moves over the Florida
peninsula.
 
Ian has jogged a little to the left this morning, but the
longer-term motion remains north-northeastward or 015 degrees
at 9 kt.  The hurricane should continue moving north-northeastward
through Thursday between the western side of a subtropical ridge
and a broad trough over the eastern United States. This motion is
expected to bring the center of Ian onshore along the west coast of
Florida later today, and over central Florida tonight and Thursday.
A shortwave trough that is forecast to move southward toward the
northwestern Gulf in about 24 to 36 hours is expected to sharpen
the trough over the eastern U.S. causing Ian to turn northward
along coast of northeastern Florida and Georgia Thursday night and
Friday.  The model envelope did not change much this cycle, and very
little cross-track adjustments were needed to the official
forecast.  The GFS and ECWMF are noticeably slower than the
remainder of the dynamical models, and the updated NHC track
forecast is a little slower than the previous advisory and slightly
slower than the TVCA consensus aid out of respect for those models.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Catastrophic storm surge inundation of 12 to 16 feet above ground 
level along with destructive waves are expected somewhere along the 
southwest Florida coastline from Englewood to Bonita Beach, 
including Charlotte Harbor. Residents in these areas should urgently 
follow any evacuation orders in effect. 
 
2. Catastrophic wind damage is expected along the southwestern 
coast of Florida beginning in the next few hours where the core of 
Ian makes landfall.  Preparations to protect life and property 
should be urgently rushed to completion. 

3. Heavy rainfall will spread across the Florida peninsula through 
Thursday and reach portions of the Southeast U.S. later this week 
and this weekend.  Widespread, life-threatening catastrophic 
flooding is expected across portions of central Florida with 
considerable flooding in southern Florida, northern Florida, 
southeastern Georgia and coastal South Carolina. Widespread, 
prolonged major and record river flooding expected across central 
Florida.
