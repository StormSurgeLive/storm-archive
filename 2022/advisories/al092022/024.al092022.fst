DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Ian was located
near latitude 26.3 North, longitude 82.5 West. Ian is moving toward
the north-northeast near 9 mph (15 km/h). This general motion with a
reduction in forward speed is forecast today, followed by a turn
toward the northeast on Thursday. On the forecast track, the center
of Ian is expected to move onshore within the hurricane warning area
in a few hours, move over central Florida tonight and Thursday
morning and emerge over the western Atlantic by late Thursday.  Ian
is forecast to turn northward on Friday and approach the 
northeastern Florida, Georgia and South Carolina coasts late 
Friday.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 155 mph (250 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Ian is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Ian is forecast to make landfall on the west 
coast of Florida as a catastrophic hurricane.  Weakening is expected 
after landfall, but Ian could be near hurricane strength when it 
moves over the Florida East coast tomorrow, and when it approaches 
the northeastern Florida, Georgia and South Carolina coasts late 
Friday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles 
(280 km).  A Weatherflow station on Sanibel Island recently reported 
sustained winds of 58 mph (93 km/h) with a gust to 75 mph 
(121 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 937 mb (27.67 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

* Englewood to Bonita Beach, including Charlotte Harbor...12-18 ft
* Middle of Longboat Key to Englewood...6-10 ft
* Bonita Beach to Chokoloskee...8-12 ft
* Chokoloskee to East Cape Sable...5-8 ft
* Anclote River to Middle of Longboat Key, including Tampa Bay...4-6
ft
* Suwannee River to Anclote River...3-5 ft
* Lower Keys from Key West to Big Pine Key, including the
Dry Tortugas...3-5 ft
* Flagler/Volusia County Line to South Santee River including St. 
Johns River...3-5 ft
* St. Johns River south of Julington...2-4 ft
* East Cape Sable to Card Sound Bridge...2-4 ft
* Florida Keys east of Big Pine Key...2-4 ft
* Patrick Air Force Base to Flagler/Volusia County Line...1-3 ft
* North of South Santee River to Surf City NC...1-3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.

WIND:  Catastrophic wind damage is likely where the core of Ian
moves onshore.  Hurricane conditions will begin along the west
coast of Florida within the Hurricane Warning area shortly, with 
tropical storm conditions ongoing.

Hurricane conditions are expected to begin along the east coast of 
Florida in the Hurricane Warning area starting overnight.  Hurricane 
conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch area on Thursday 
through late Friday.

Tropical storm conditions are occurring in the warning area in the 
Florida Keys, and will continue this morning.  Tropical storm 
conditions are occuring in parts of the warning area on the east 
coast currently, and should spread up northward through the Georgia 
and South Carolina coasts tonight and Thursday.  Tropical storm 
conditions are expected within the warning area in Cuba for the next 
few hours.

RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall:

* Florida Keys and South Florida: 6 to 8 inches, with local maxima
up to 12 inches.
* Central and Northeast Florida: 12 to 18 inches, with local
maxima up to 24 inches.
* Eastern Georgia and Coastal South Carolina: 4 to 8 inches, with
local maxima of 12 inches.

Widespread, life-threatening catastrophic flash, urban, and river 
flooding is expected across central Florida.  Widespread 
considerable flash, urban, and river flooding is expected across 
portions of southern Florida through Wednesday, and northeast 
Florida, southeastern Georgia, and coastal South Carolina later this 
week through the weekend.  Limited flash, urban, and river flooding 
is possible over portions of the Southeast and southern Mid-Atlantic 
U.S. later this week through the weekend.

TORNADOES: Tornadoes are possible today and tonight, especially 
across east central Florida.

SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting the northern coast
of Cuba, the northeastern coast of the Yucatan peninsula and
west coast of Florida. Swells will increase along the east coast of
Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina tonight and Thursday.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
