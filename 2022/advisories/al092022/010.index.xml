DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gaston was
located near latitude 39.4 North, longitude 36.5 West. Gaston is
moving toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h). A gradual turn toward
the west-southwest is forecast by tomorrow.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual weakening is forecast over the next few days, and Gaston is
forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone by Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Gaston are expected to affect portions of
the Azores today.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
300 PM GMT Sun Sep 25 2022
 
The large convective burst that fired overnight and this morning
appears to have lead to Gaston's center reforming under the deep
convection further to the north and west. This also evident in
GOES-16 GLM lightning data that showed a clear arcing pattern
embedded in the convection prior to the new center becoming evident
on visible satellite imagery.  Since then, the convection has been
rapidly decaying, as the storm loses instability support from a
sharp upper-level trough as it moves into its axis. Subjective and
objective Dvorak numbers this morning were still CI 3.0/45-kt from
TAFB and UW-CIMSS ADT. While scatterometer data largely missed the
circulation earlier, it still showed tropical storm force winds
extending well to the northeast of the center. The initial intensity
is being maintained at 45 kt for this advisory.
 
Gaston, post reformation, has made its westward turn, with the
latest motion estimate at 270/10 kt. Gaston is currently situated
between an anomalously strong deep-layer ridge to its northeast, and
a more climatological ridge to its southwest. These features are
forecast to merge over the next 24-48 hours to the northwest of
Gaston, and should help steer the storm more to the west-southwest
for the remainder of its lifespan. The guidance this cycle is just a
bit further south and west compared to the previous cycle, and the
latest NHC track forecast was nudged in that direction, following
the consensus aids TVCN and HCCA.
 
Gaston might have had its last convective hurrah this morning, with 
the GFS, ECMWF, CMC, and HWRF suggesting the storm will struggle to 
produce organized convection from here on out. This could be related 
to the upper-level flow pattern, where the storm is moving out of an 
environment favorable for ascent into an environment favorable for 
descent, limiting convection, especially as it continues to traverse 
24-25C SSTs. The latest forecast still shows Gaston becoming a 
post-tropical cyclone in about 24 hours, but if the convection does 
not return before then, this evolution could occur sooner. The low 
should persist another day or two before it opens up into a trough 
in the subtropical Atlantic in about 72 hours, in agreement with the 
majority of the global model guidance.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ian was 
located near latitude 15.2 North, longitude 79.8 West. Ian is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). A turn toward the 
northwest at a similar forward speed is expected later today, 
followed by a north-northwestward motion on Monday and a northward 
motion on Tuesday with a slightly slower forward speed. On the 
forecast track, the center of Ian is forecast to pass well southwest 
of Jamaica today, and pass near or west of the Cayman Islands early 
Monday. Ian will then move near or over western Cuba Monday night 
and early Tuesday and emerge over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on 
Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Rapid strengthening is forecast to begin later today or tonight. Ian 
is expected to become a hurricane tonight or early Monday and reach 
major hurricane strength Monday night or early Tuesday before it 
reaches western Cuba.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach Grand Cayman by 
early Monday, with tropical storm conditions expected later tonight. 
Hurricane conditions are expected within the warning area in Cuba by 
early Tuesday, with tropical storm conditions expected by late 
Monday. Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical 
storm warning area in Cuba Monday night and Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL:  Ian is expected to produce the following rainfall:
 
Jamaica and the Cayman Islands: 3 to 6 inches, with local maxima up
to 8 inches.
 
Western Cuba: 6 to 10 inches, with local maxima up to 16 inches.
 
Florida Keys into southern and central Florida Peninsula: 2 to 4
inches, with local maxima up to 6 inches beginning Monday through
Wednesday morning.
 
Heavy rainfall may affect north Florida, the Florida panhandle and
the southeast United States Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
 
These rains may produce flash flooding and mudslides in areas of
higher terrain, particularly over Jamaica and Cuba. Flash and urban
flooding are possible across the Florida Keys and the Florida 
peninsula through mid week. Additional flooding and rises on
area streams and rivers across northern Florida and parts of the
southeast U.S. later this week cannot be ruled out, especially in 
central Florida given already saturated conditions.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 9
to 14 feet above normal tide levels along the coast of western Cuba
in areas of onshore winds in the hurricane warning area Monday night 
and early Tuesday.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Cayman Islands Sunday night into Monday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting Jamaica and will 
spread to the Cayman Islands later today. Swells will then spread 
northwestward to the southwestern coast of Cuba and the coasts of 
Honduras, Belize, and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico on Monday and 
Monday night. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf 
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local 
weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Ian Forecast Discussion Number 10</title>

Tropical Storm Ian Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
1100 AM EDT Sun Sep 25 2022
 
The satellite presentation of Ian is gradually improving this 
morning. The overall circulation appears better defined in visible 
satellite imagery, and fragmented bands of convection around the 
center are showing increased signs of curvature. The low-level 
center of Ian also appears better defined in the latest data 
collected by the NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunters. Although the 
vortex is still vertically tilted, tail Doppler radar data suggest 
the low- and mid-level centers are beginning to converge. An earlier 
center dropsonde indicated the minimum pressure dropped slightly to 
1001 mb, but the aircraft winds thus far have not reflected any 
strengthening. Therefore, initial intensity for this advisory is 
held at 45 kt.

The latest fixes suggest Ian is beginning to make its turn around 
the western side of the subtropical ridge, and the initial motion 
is west-northwestward at 290/12 kt. A gradual turn to the northwest 
is expected later today as the cyclone passes well southwest of 
Jamaica, followed by a north-northwestward motion that brings the 
center of Ian west of the Cayman Islands on Monday and near or over 
western Cuba by early Tuesday. There is relatively high confidence 
in this portion of the track forecast. However, once the cyclone 
emerges over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, the spread in the 
track guidance increases at days 3-5. The HWRF and GFS still lie on 
the western side of the guidance envelope and show Ian moving over 
the central or western Florida panhandle, while the ECMWF and UKMET 
models show a track farther east into west-central Florida. Overall, 
the NHC track forecast remains near the center of the guidance 
envelope and still lies very near the TVCA multi-model consensus. 
However, there is still significant uncertainty in the long-range 
track forecast of Ian, and future adjustments to this portion of the 
forecast will likely be required.
 
The atmospheric and oceanic conditions over the northwestern 
Caribbean Sea appear very conducive for significant strengthening. 
So once Ian becomes more organized, the high oceanic heat content 
and low vertical shear conditions appear likely to support rapid 
intensification. The Deterministic to Probabilistic Statistical 
Rapid Intensification Index (DTOPS) still shows a greater than 90 
percent chance of rapid strengthening during the next 2-3 days. The 
intensity guidance remains very aggressive with strengthening Ian, 
and the NHC forecast reflects this potential. Ian is expected to 
become a hurricane by tonight or early Tuesday, and is forecast to 
reach major hurricane strength before it reaches western Cuba. This 
forecast lies very near the latest SHIPS guidance and the IVCN aid. 
By day 4, a significant increase in southwesterly shear is forecast 
by the global models, and this is forecast to induce some weakening 
as the vertical structure of the hurricane is disrupted. Despite 
this, Ian is likely to have an expanding wind field and will be 
slowing down by that time, which will have the potential to produce 
significant wind and storm surge impacts across portions of the 
Florida west coast and the Florida panhandle. 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Ian is expected to produce heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and 
possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain, particularly over 
Jamaica and Cuba.  Flash and urban flooding is possible across the 
Florida Keys and Florida peninsula through mid week. Additional 
flooding on rivers across northern Florida and parts of the 
southeast U.S. cannot be ruled out later this week. 
 
2.  Life-threatening storm surge and hurricane-force winds are 
expected in portions of western Cuba beginning late Monday, where 
a hurricane warning is now in effect. Efforts to protect life and 
property should be rushed to completion. 
 
3.  Ian is expected to be a major hurricane in the eastern Gulf of 
Mexico during the middle of the week, but uncertainty in the 
long-term track and intensity forecasts is higher than usual.  
Regardless of Ian’s exact track and intensity, there is a risk of 
dangerous storm surge, hurricane-force winds, and heavy rainfall 
along the west coast of Florida and the Florida Panhandle by the 
middle of the week, and residents in Florida should ensure they 
have their hurricane plan in place, follow any advice given by 
local officials, and closely monitor updates to the forecast.

THROUGH MONDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM CVT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...23.6N 20.2W
ABOUT 580 MI...935 KM NNE OF THE CABO VERDE ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...30 MPH...45 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 10 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1008 MB...29.77 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM CVT (0900 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Hermine was located near latitude 23.6 North, longitude 20.2 West.
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the north near 7 mph (11
km/h) and this motion is expected to continue through Sunday 
followed by a slow turn toward the northwest early Monday and a 
turn to the west-northwest Monday evening.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 30 mph (45 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Hermine is expected to dissipate in a couple of 
days.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Hermine is expected to produce 3 to 6 (75 to 150 mm)
inches of rainfall with localized higher amounts up to 10 inches
(250 mm) across the Canary Islands through Monday. This rainfall may
cause some flash flooding in areas of higher terrain.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on Hermine.  Additional information on Hermine can be 
found in High Seas Forecasts issued by Meteo France under WMO 
header FQNT50 LFPW and available on the web at

Post-Tropical Cyclone Hermine Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102022
800 AM CVT Sun Sep 25 2022
 
Hermine's structure overnight has deteriorated further.  While
occasional intermittent bursts of deep convection are still 
occurring to the north of the elongated surface circulation, this 
convection lacks organization.  The system no longer meets the 
definition of a tropical cyclone and, therefore, is being declared 
a remnant low and this will be the last NHC advisory on Hermine.
 
Strong southwesterly shear greater than 40 kt and a high
statically stable surrounding Saharan air mass should prevent the
regeneration of organized convection during the next several days.
The global models and the statistical SHIPS intensity guidance
agree that the remnant low will open up into a trough of low
pressure Tuesday, and the official forecast follows suit.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be northward, or 010/6 kt. This 
general motion is expected to continue today while the cyclone 
moves around the western periphery of a mid-tropospheric ridge. 
Beyond Monday morning, the remnant low is forecast to turn toward 
the northwest and west-northwest in response to the above mention 
ridge building westward over the extreme eastern tropical Atlantic. 
The NHC forecast track is based on the various consensus aids and 
is similar to the previous advisory.
 
Additional information on this system can be found in High Seas
Forecasts issued by Meteo France under WMO header FQNT50 LFPW and
available on the web at
