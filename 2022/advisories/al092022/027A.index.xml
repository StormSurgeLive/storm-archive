Tropical Depression Eleven Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112022
500 AM AST Thu Sep 29 2022
 
Deep convection associated with the depression has become more
concentrated overnight, but it remains well to the northeast of the
low-level center due to moderate southwesterly vertical shear.
Dvorak classifications from both TAFB and SAB remain T2.0 or 30 kt.
Objective estimates from UW/CIMSS are slightly higher, but since the
current convective burst has not persisted very long, the initial
intensity is maintained at 30 kt, in line with the subjective
satellite estimates.  The cyclone is forecast to move into an area
of stronger upper-level southwesterlies, and as a consequence the
SHIPS guidance indicates that the shear will increase to more than
30 kt in about 24 hours.  Therefore, little change in strength is
expected in the short term, and weakening should occur by late
tomorrow with the depression becoming a remnant low. The system is
forecast degenerate into a trough of low pressure by 48 hours, but
the global model guidance suggests this could occur sooner.
 
The initial motion estimate is 320/11 kt. The depression should
continue to move generally northwestward for the next day or two
within the low- to mid-level flow.  The updated track forecast is
slightly west of the previous track, but it remains close to the
various consensus models.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ian was
located near latitude 28.5 North, longitude 80.7 West.  Ian is
moving toward the northeast near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A turn toward the
north-northeast is expected later today, followed by a turn toward
the north and north-northwest with an increase in forward speed
Friday and Friday night.  On the forecast track, the center of Ian
is expected to move off the east-central coast of Florida soon and
then approach the coast of South Carolina on Friday.  The
center will move farther inland across the Carolinas Friday night
and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Some re-intensification is forecast, and Ian could be near 
hurricane strength when it approaches the coast of South Carolina 
on Friday.  Weakening is expected Friday night and Saturday after 
Ian moves inland.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 415 miles (665 km)
from the center.  Daytona Beach International Airport recently
reported a sustained wind of 60 mph (97 km/h) and a gust to 70 mph
(113 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches) 
based on surface observations.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
* Flagler/Volusia County Line to South Santee River...4-6 ft
* St. Johns River north of Julington...3-5 ft
* St. Johns River south of Julington...2-4 ft
* South Santee River to Little River Inlet...2-4 ft
* Patrick Air Force Base to Flagler/Volusia County Line...1-3 ft
* East of Little River Inlet to Cape Lookout...1-3 ft
* Englewood to Chokoloskee including Charlotte Harbor... 1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occuring in parts of the
warning area on the east and west coasts of Florida and should
spread northward along the Georgia, South Carolina, and North
Carolina coasts today through Friday.  Hurricane conditions are
possible within the Hurricane Watch area in northeastern Florida,
Georgia, and South Carolina through Friday.
 
RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall:
 
* Northeast Florida, coastal Georgia and Lowcountry of South
Carolina: 4 to 8 inches, with local maxima of 12 inches.
* Upstate and central South Carolina, North Carolina, and southern
Virginia: 3 to 6 inches with local maxima of 8 inches across western
North Carolina.
 
Widespread, life-threatening catastrophic flash and urban flooding,
with major to record  flooding along rivers, will continue across
central Florida.  Widespread considerable flash, urban, and river
flooding is expected across portions of northeast Florida,
southeastern Georgia, and eastern South Carolina tomorrow through
the weekend.  Locally considerable flash, urban, and river flooding
is possible this weekend across portions of the southern
Appalachians, where landslides will be possible as well. Limited
flooding is possible across portions of the southern Mid-Atlantic.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two remains possible across east-central
and northeast Florida through this morning. This threat will shift
into the coastal Carolinas on Friday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting the northern coast
of Cuba, the northeastern coast of the Yucatan peninsula and 
Florida. Swells will increase along the coasts of Georgia, 
South Carolina and North Carolina today.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Ian Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
500 AM EDT Thu Sep 29 2022
 
Ian's center continues to move northeastward across central Florida, 
and nearly all of the heavy rains are located to the north over 
northeastern Florida.  NWS WSR-88D Doppler velocities from the
Melbourne and Tampa radars have decreased significantly since last
evening, and based on that data, Ian is now a tropical storm with 
maximum sustained winds of 55 kt.  This intensity is also supported 
by wind observations across Florida, with the highest recent 
sustained wind being 52 kt at New Smyrna Beach.

Ian's current motion is northeastward, or 040/7 kt.  The tail end 
of a deep-layer trough is expected to detach from the main trough 
axis over the southeastern United States during the next 24 to 48 
hours, and Ian is forecast to move around the eastern periphery of 
this feature, turning north-northeastward later today and then 
north-northwestward by Friday night.  In this scenario, Ian should 
move off the east coast of Florida later today, and then swing 
northward toward the South Carolina coast during the next 36 hours 
or so.  Although there is some cross-track spread in the guidance, 
they all agree on this general scenario, and the NHC track forecast 
lies where most of the models are packed.  No significant changes 
were made to the previous prediction.

Little change in intensity is forecast during the next 24 hours or 
so, mainly due to strong southwesterly shear.  After 24 hours, 
global models are suggesting that Ian could have some favorable 
interaction with the eastern U.S. trough, all while it's moving 
over the warm 28-29 degree Celsius waters of the Gulf Stream.  As a 
result, some slight strengthening is indicated in the official 
forecast by 36 hours, and Ian could be near hurricane intensity as 
it's approaching the coast of South Carolina.  This possibility is 
accounted for by the Hurricane Watch that is effect for the area.  
After moving inland, Ian is expected to weaken quickly, and global 
models indicate it should dissipate or become absorbed by another 
broader area of low pressure over the Carolinas by day 3.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Coastal water levels continue to subside along the west coast of 
Florida.  There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge today 
through Friday along the coasts of northeast Florida, Georgia, 
and South Carolina.  Residents in these areas should follow any 
advice given by local officials.
 
2. Tropical-storm-force winds are expected to spread northward 
across northeastern Florida, Georgia, and the Carolina coasts 
through Friday.  Hurricane conditions are possible through 
Friday along the coasts of northeastern Florida, Georgia and South 
Carolina where a Hurricane Watch in effect. 
 
3. Widespread, life-threatening catastrophic flooding, with major to 
record river flooding, will continue today across portions of 
central Florida with considerable flooding in northern Florida, 
southeastern Georgia and eastern South Carolina expected today 
through the end of the week.
