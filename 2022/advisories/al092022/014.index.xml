DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ian was located
near latitude 19.1 North, longitude 82.7 West. Ian is moving toward
the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). A north-northwestward motion is
expected to begin later today, followed by a northward motion on
Tuesday with a slightly slower forward speed. A turn toward the
north-northeast with a further reduction in forward speed is
forecast on Wednesday. On the forecast track, the center of Ian is
expected to pass near or west of the Cayman Islands today, and near
or over western Cuba tonight and early Tuesday. Ian will then emerge
over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday, pass west of the
Florida Keys late Tuesday, and approach the west coast of Florida on
Wednesday into Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Rapid strengthening is expected during the next 
day or so, and Ian is forecast to become a major hurricane tonight 
or early Tuesday when it is near western Cuba and remain a major 
hurricane over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The minimum central pressure based on Air Force and NOAA Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft data is 980 mb (28.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

*Anclote River to Middle of Longboat Key, FL including Tampa 
Bay...5-10 ft
*Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...5-8 ft
*Englewood, FL to Bonita Beach, FL including Charlotte Harbor... 
4-7 ft
*Bonita Beach, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...3-5 ft
*East Cape Sable, FL to Card Sound Bridge, FL including Florida 
Bay...2-4 ft
*Florida Keys including the Dry Tortugas...2-4 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.

Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 9 to 14 feet 
above normal tide levels along the coast of western Cuba in areas of 
onshore winds in the hurricane warning area tonight and early 
Tuesday.

Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Cayman Islands today.

WIND:  Tropical storm and hurricane conditions are expected on Grand
Cayman today. Hurricane conditions are expected within the warning
area in Cuba tonight, with tropical storm conditions expected
by late today. Destructive winds are possible where the core of Ida
moves across western Cuba.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical storm
warning area in Cuba tonight and Tuesday. Tropical storm conditions
are possible on Little Cayman and Cayman Brac today.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible along the west coast of Florida
within the Hurricane Watch area on Wednesday, with tropical
storm conditions possibly beginning by Tuesday night.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in the
lower Florida Keys and are possible in the watch area in the middle
Florida Keys on Tuesday. Tropical storm conditions are possible
within the watch area along the Florida west coast by Tuesday
evening.
 
RAINFALL:  Ian is expected to produce the following rainfall through
Thursday:
 
Jamaica: An additional 1 to 3 inches, with local maximum of 5
inches, especially along the south coastal region.

Cayman Islands: 3 to 6 inches, with local maxima up to 8 inches.

Western Cuba: 6 to 10 inches, with local maxima up to 16 inches.
 
These rains may produce flash flooding and mudslides in areas of
higher terrain over western Cuba.
 
Florida Keys: 4 to 6 inches.
 
Central West Florida: 8 to 10 inches, with local maxima up to 15
inches.
 
Remainder of the Florida Peninsula: 3 to 8 inches.
 
Heavy rainfall is expected to affect North Florida, eastern portions 
of the Florida Panhandle, and portions of the Southeastern U.S. 
Friday and Saturday.
 
Widespread considerable flash and urban flooding and prolonged
significant river flooding impacts are likely mid-to-late week in
central Florida given already saturated conditions. Flash and urban
flooding impacts are also possible with rainfall across the Florida
Keys and the Florida peninsula through mid-week. Limited flooding
impacts and rises on area streams and rivers are also possible over
northern Florida and portions of the Southeast mid-to-late week.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible late tonight and Tuesday
across the Florida Keys and the southern and central Florida
Peninsula.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting Jamaica and the Cayman
Islands. Swells will spread northwestward to the southwestern coast
of Cuba and the coasts of Honduras, Belize, and the Yucatan
Peninsula of Mexico today and tonight. Swells are expected to begin
affecting the Florida Keys Tuesday and spread northward along the
west coast of Florida through Wednesday.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Ian Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
1100 AM EDT Mon Sep 26 2022
 
The satellite presentation of Ian has improved this morning. Deep 
convection has increased within the inner core during the past 
several hours, with an expanding central dense overcast noted in 
recent satellite imagery. The inner core structure continues to take 
shape in radar data, although the eyewall still has a banded 
appearance and remains open on the west side. Dropsonde data from 
the NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the 
minimum pressure has gradually fallen to about 980 mb, and the 
initial intensity is raised slightly to 70 kt for this advisory. 
 
The intensity of Ian has increased by 30 kt during the past 18 h. 
Further rapid intensification (RI) is expected during the next 24-36 
h as Ian crosses the high oceanic heat content of the northwestern 
Caribbean Sea within a very low vertical wind shear (VWS) 
environment. The latest SHIPS-RI probabilities continue to highlight 
the high likelihood of this scenario, with a 73 percent chance of a 
35-kt wind speed increase in 24 h and a 79 percent chance of a 45-kt 
increase in 36 h. The NHC intensity forecast is similar to the 
previous one, and it shows Ian becoming a major hurricane by the 
time it reaches western Cuba. Ian is forecast to reach its peak 
intensity in 36 h over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. Then, 
increasing southwesterly shear by 36-48 h is expected to bring an 
end to the intensification phase. The combination of strong VWS and 
drier mid-level air will induce weakening thereafter, but Ian is 
expected to remain at or near major hurricane strength as it passes 
near the west-central coast of Florida on Wednesday and Thursday.
 
Ian continues to move northwestward at 325/11 kt. A turn toward the 
north-northwest and north is expected during the next day or so as 
the hurricane moves around the western extent of a mid-level ridge. 
Then, an upper-level trough over the eastern U.S. should cause Ian 
to turn more north-northeastward through Thursday. This track brings 
the center of Ian close to the west-central coast of Florida during 
the middle of the week. An even greater concern is the slower 
forward motion that is forecast during this period, as the upper 
trough passes north and east of Ian and the steering currents 
weaken. This would likely prolong the storm surge, wind, and 
rainfall impacts along the affected portions of the west coast of 
Florida, although the roughly shore-parallel track still makes it 
difficult to pinpoint exactly what locations will experience the 
most severe impacts. The track guidance has come into better 
agreement during the first 72 h of the forecast period, and only a 
minor eastward adjustment was made to the NHC track forecast in line 
with the multi-model consensus aids.

The aircraft data indicate that the 34-kt wind radii in the 
northeastern quadrant were 20-30 n mi larger than previously 
estimated, and this has been reflected in the latest forecast. 
Based on these changes, Tropical Storm Watches have been issued for 
the middle Florida Keys and extended southward along the 
southwestern coast of Florida.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Life-threatening storm surge, hurricane-force winds, flash 
floods and possible mudslides are expected in portions of western 
Cuba beginning this evening and continuing into Tuesday.  
Devastating wind damage is possible where the core of Ian moves 
across western Cuba. Efforts to protect life and property should be 
rushed to completion.

2. Life-threatening storm surge is possible along much of the 
Florida west coast, with the highest risk from Fort Myers to the 
Tampa Bay region.  Residents in these areas should listen to advice 
given by local officials.

3. Hurricane-force winds are possible in the hurricane watch area 
in west-central Florida beginning Wednesday morning with tropical 
storm conditions possible by late Tuesday.  Residents in this area 
should ensure that they have their hurricane plan in place.

4. Heavy rainfall will increase across the Florida Keys and south 
Florida Tuesday, spreading to central and northern Florida Wednesday 
and Thursday, potentially causing flash, urban and small stream 
flooding. Significant prolonged river flooding is likely across 
central Florida.
