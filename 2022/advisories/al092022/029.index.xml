Post-Tropical Cyclone Eleven Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112022
500 PM AST Thu Sep 29 2022

The structure of the system this afternoon has continued to go 
downhill. The circulation fidelity has become increasingly diffuse 
and stretched out in a north-to-south fashion. What little deep 
convection remains is displaced about 100 n mi to the 
north-northeast of the center and also lacks sufficient organization 
to be considered a tropical cyclone. Therefore, this is the final 
advisory and the system is now considered to be a post-tropical 
remnant low, albeit one that is likely to open up into a surface 
trough at any time. 

In general the poorly-defined center still appears to be mostly on 
track, moving to the northwest at 320/12 kt. This general motion is 
expected to continue until the elongated circulation completely 
degenerates into a surface trough over the central Atlantic basin. 
A 12 hour point is mainly provided for continuity purposes, which 
lies along the fairly tightly clustered consensus aids. 

Additional information on this system can be found in High Seas
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php

north-northwest with an increase in forward speed Friday night.  On
the forecast track, Ian will approach the coast of South Carolina on
Friday.  The center will move farther inland across the Carolinas
Friday night and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Ian could slightly strengthen before landfall 
tomorrow, and is forecast to rapidly weaken over the southeastern 
United States late Friday into Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 415 
miles (665 km). Kennedy Space Center Tower 1 recently reported a 
wind gust to 89 mph (145 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 986 mb (29.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
* Edisto Beach to Murrells Inlet...4-7 ft
* Flagler/Volusia County Line to Edisto Beach...4-6 ft
* Murrells Inlet to Cape Fear...3-5 ft
* Cape Fear River...2-4 ft
* St. Johns River...2-4 ft
* East of Cape Fear to Duck, including Pamlico and
Neuse Rivers...2-4 ft
* Patrick Air Force Base to Flagler/Volusia County Line...1-3 ft
* Albemarle Sound...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to begin in the
Hurricane Warning area starting early Friday, with tropical storm
conditions beginning overnight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are now occurring in parts of the
warning area on the east coasts of Florida and should spread
northward along the Georgia and North Carolina coasts today through
Friday.  Hurricane conditions are possible within the Hurricane
Watch area in northeastern Florida and Georgia today into Friday, 
and in the watch area in North Carolina on Friday morning.
 
RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall:
 
* Coastal Georgia: 1 to 3 inches with locally higher amounts.
* Northeast South Carolina: 4 to 8 inches, with local maxima of 12
inches
* Upstate and central South Carolina, North Carolina, and southern
Virginia: 3 to 6 inches with local maxima of 8 inches across
northwest North Carolina and southwest Virginia.
 
Major-to-record river flooding will continue across central Florida
through next week.  Considerable flash and urban flooding, and minor
river flooding is possible across South Carolina through Friday.
Locally considerable flash, urban, and small stream flooding is
possible this weekend across portions of northwest North Carolina
and southwest Virginia. Limited flooding is possible across portions
of the southern Mid-Atlantic.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes will be possible Friday across the
coastal Carolinas and southeast Virginia.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting the northern coast
of Cuba, the northeastern coast of the Yucatan peninsula, Florida
and Georgia. Swells will increase along the coasts of South Carolina
and North Carolina.  These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.

<title>Hurricane Ian Forecast Discussion Number 28</title>

Tropical Storm Ian Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
1100 AM EDT Thu Sep 29 2022
 
The center of Ian has emerged into the western Atlantic Ocean to
the north of Cape Canaveral.  While satellite images show the
system is becoming a hybrid cyclone, with frontal features outside 
of the core of Ian, the winds from multiple sources are notable.  
Velocity data from NWS Doppler radar indicate maximum winds of about 
70-75 kt at 10,000 ft over land, and sustained winds of about 55 kt 
were recorded in the Daytona Beach area earlier this morning.  These 
data support a higher initial intensity, now 60 kt for this 
advisory.
 
The storm is moving northeastward at about 8 kt.  Ian has stubbornly 
gone east of the track forecast for the past couple of days and has 
moved back over water faster than expected.   A mid-level shortwave 
trough moving southward across the southern United States should 
turn Ian northward overnight and north-northwestward on Saturday. 
The official track forecast is shifted to the east, consistent with 
the latest consensus guidance.
 
Ian should move over the Gulf Stream tonight and tomorrow for a 
longer period of time than previously anticipated, which should 
maintain Ian's central convection.  Additionally, an increased 
pressure gradient on the northwestern side from a stationary front 
near the southeastern US, should provide a boost to the wind speeds 
on that side of the storm.  We now expect Ian to become a hurricane 
again by this evening.  As the system approaches South Carolina, Ian 
should maintain this intensity, and Hurricane Warnings have been 
issued for the entire coast of South Carolina.  This scenario is 
consistent with the global and regional hurricane model guidance.  
It is worth noting that Ian is forecast to have atypical structure 
when it nears the southeastern United States, and strong winds will 
extend well ahead of the center, even on the northwestern side.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge through Friday
along the coasts of northeast Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.
Residents in these areas should follow any advice given by local
officials.
 
2. Hurricane-force winds are expected across the South Carolina
coast beginning early Friday, where a Hurricane Warning has been
issued. Hurricane conditions are possible by tonight along the
coasts of northeastern Florida and Georgia, where a Hurricane Watch
is in effect.   Preparations should be rushed to completion since
tropical-storm-force winds will begin well before the center
approaches the coast.
 
3. Ongoing major-to-record river flooding will continue across
portions of central Florida, with considerable flooding in northern
Florida.  Considerable flash and urban flooding is expected across
coastal portions of northeast Florida through Friday. Local
significant flooding in southeastern Georgia and eastern South
Carolina is expected through the end of the week.
