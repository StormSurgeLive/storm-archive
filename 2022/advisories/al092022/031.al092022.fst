DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ian was located
near latitude 30.8 North, longitude 79.1 West.  Ian is moving toward
the north-northeast near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A turn toward the north 
with an increase in forward speed is expected this morning, 
followed by a turn toward the north-northwest by tonight.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Ian will approach and reach the coast 
of South Carolina today, and then move farther inland across 
eastern South Carolina and central North Carolina tonight and 
Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected before Ian reaches 
the coast later today.  Rapid weakening is expected after landfall, 
and Ian is forecast to become an extratropical low over North 
Carolina tonight or on Saturday.  The low is then expected to 
dissipate by Saturday night. 

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 485
miles (780 km).  A sustained wind of 38 mph (61 km/h) and a gust 
to 52 mph (83 km/h) were recently reported at the Hilton Head 
Airport in South Carolina.  An elevated WeatherFlow station at the 
Winyah Bay Range Light in South Carolina measured a sustained wind 
of 49 mph (80 km/h) and a gust to 71 mph (115 km/h) during the past 
couple of hours.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 984 mb (29.06 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.

STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

* Edisto Beach to Little River Inlet...4-7 ft
* Little River Inlet to Cape Fear...3-5 ft  
* Savannah River to Edisto Beach...3-5 ft
* Flagler/Volusia County Line to Savannah River...2-4 ft
* Cape Fear River...2-4 ft
* St. Johns River...2-4 ft
* East of Cape Fear to Duck, including Pamlico and Neuse 
Rivers...2-4 ft
* Patrick Air Force Base to Flagler/Volusia County Line... 1-3 ft
* Albemarle Sound...1-2 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring in parts of the
warning areas on the coasts of Georgia and the Carolinas, and
hurricane conditions are expected to begin in the Hurricane Warning 
area in South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina by this 
afternoon.  Hurricane conditions are possible within the Hurricane 
Watch area in North Carolina by this afternoon.

RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall:

* Northeast South Carolina: 4 to 8 inches, with local maxima of 12
inches.
* Central South Carolina, North Carolina, and southern Virginia:
3 to 6 inches with local maxima of 8 inches across northwest North
Carolina and southwest Virginia.

Major to record river flooding will continue across central Florida
through next week.  Considerable flash and urban flooding, and minor
river flooding is possible across coastal and northeast South
Carolina today.  Locally considerable flash, urban, and small stream
flooding is possible today into Saturday across portions of
northwest North Carolina and southwest Virginia. Limited flooding is
possible across portions of the southern Mid-Atlantic this weekend.

TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible this afternoon and evening 
across eastern North Carolina, shifting northward into southeast 
Virginia overnight through early Saturday morning.

SURF:  Swells generated by Ian and a nearby frontal system are
affecting the east coast of Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, and the
northwestern Bahamas. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office. Swells will subside along
the northern coast of Cuba and the northeastern coast of the Yucatan
peninsula today.
