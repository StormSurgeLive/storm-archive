Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Mon Sep 26 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Ian, located over the northwestern Caribbean Sea.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity has changed little in organization <br/>
today associated with an area of low pressure located several <br/>
hundred miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands. Despite the proximity <br/>
of nearby dry air, upper-level winds appear generally conducive <br/>
for additional development, and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form during the next couple of days as the system meanders over the <br/>
central tropical Atlantic. By the end of this week, upper-level <br/>
winds are forecast to become less favorable for development as the <br/>
system begins to move slowly north-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ian was located 
near latitude 20.3 North, longitude 83.2 West. Ian is moving toward 
the north-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). A turn toward the north 
with a slightly slower forward speed is expected on Tuesday. A turn 
toward the north-northeast with a further reduction in forward speed 
is forecast on Wednesday. On the forecast track, the center of Ian 
is expected to move near or over western Cuba tonight and early 
Tuesday. Ian will then emerge over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico 
on Tuesday, pass west of the Florida Keys late Tuesday, and approach 
the west coast of Florida on Wednesday into Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 100 mph (155 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Rapid strengthening is expected during the next 
day or so, and Ian is forecast to become a major hurricane tonight 
or early Tuesday when it is near western Cuba and remain a major 
hurricane over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 972 mb (28.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
*Anclote River to Middle of Longboat Key, FL including Tampa
Bay...5-10 ft
 
*Suwannee River to Anclote River...5-8 ft
*Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...5-8 ft
*Englewood, FL to Bonita Beach, FL including Charlotte Harbor...
4-7 ft
*Bonita Beach, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...3-5 ft
 
*Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL to Altamaha Sound including 
St. Johns River...2-4 ft
*East Cape Sable, FL to Card Sound Bridge, FL including Florida
Bay...2-4 ft
 
*Aucilla River to Suwannee River...2-4 ft
*Florida Keys including the Dry Tortugas...2-4 ft
 
*Indian Pass, FL to Aucilla River...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 9 to 14 feet
above normal tide levels along the coast of western Cuba in areas of
onshore winds in the hurricane warning area tonight and early
Tuesday.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the warning area in
Cuba tonight, with tropical storm conditions expected by this
evening. Destructive winds are possible where the core of Ian moves
across western Cuba. Tropical storm conditions are expected within
the tropical storm warning area in Cuba tonight and Tuesday.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected along the west coast of Florida
within the Hurricane Warning area on Wednesday, with tropical storm
conditions possibly beginning by Tuesday night. Tropical storm
conditions are expected in the warning area by Tuesday evening.
Hurricane conditions are possible in the watch area beginning on
Wednesday, and tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch
area on Wednesday into early Thursday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in the
lower Florida Keys and are possible in the watch area in the middle
Florida Keys on Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL:  Ian is expected to produce the following rainfall through
Thursday:
 
Jamaica: An additional 1 to 3 inches, with local maximum of 5
inches, especially along the south coastal region.
 
Cayman Islands: 3 to 6 inches, with local maxima up to 8 inches.
 
Western Cuba: 6 to 10 inches, with local maxima up to 16 inches.
 
These rains may produce flash flooding and mudslides in areas of
higher terrain over  western Cuba.
 
Florida Keys: 4 to 6 inches, with local maxima up to 8 inches
 
Coastal Southwest and Southeast Florida: 4 to 6 inches with local
maxima up to 10 inches
 
Central West Florida: 6 to 12 inches, with local maxima up to 20
inches.
 
Northeast Florida: 6 to 10 inches, with local maxima up to 12
inches.
 
Remainder of the Central Florida Peninsula:  4 to 8 inches.
 
Heavy rainfall is expected to affect the Southeast U.S. Friday and
Saturday. Widespread considerable flash and urban flooding, and
prolonged significant river flooding impacts are likely mid-to-late
week across central and northern Florida, southern Georgia, and
coastal South Carolina. Flash and urban flooding impacts are also
possible with rainfall across the Florida Keys and the Florida
peninsula through mid week. Limited flooding impacts and rises on
area streams and rivers are also possible over portions of the
Southeast mid-to-late week.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible late tonight and Tuesday
across the Florida Keys and the southern/central Florida Peninsula.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting Jamaica and the Cayman 
Islands. Swells will spread northwestward to the southwestern coast 
of Cuba and the coasts of Honduras, Belize, and the Yucatan 
Peninsula of Mexico tonight. Swells are expected to begin affecting 
the Florida Keys Tuesday and spread northward along the west coast 
of Florida through Wednesday.  These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Ian Special Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
500 PM EDT Mon Sep 26 2022
 
Ian continues to strengthen over the northwestern Caribbean Sea. The 
last report from the Air Force Hurricane Hunters around 1630 UTC 
found 700-mb flight-level winds of 79 kt. The inner core appears 
better organized, and the eyewall structure has greatly improved in 
radar imagery from the Cayman Islands. The 18 UTC satellite 
classifications from SAB and TAFB were a consensus T4.5/77 kt, but 
the continued improvement in satellite structure warrants raising 
the initial intensity to 85 kt for this advisory.

Atmospheric and oceanic conditions remain very favorable for 
additional intensification during the next 24 h or so, as Ian moves 
over the very warm waters of the northwestern Caribbean Sea and the 
southeastern Gulf of Mexico while the shear remains quite low. The 
NHC intensity forecast calls for Ian to become a major hurricane 
before it reaches western Cuba early Tuesday. It is then forecast to 
reach its peak intensity over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico in 36 
h. After that, southwesterly shear in association with a deep-layer 
trough over the eastern U.S. is forecast to significantly increase 
over the hurricane on Wednesday and Thursday, which will likely 
disrupt the vertical structure and import drier air into its 
circulation. Despite these less favorable conditions, Ian is still 
forecast to remain at or near major hurricane strength as it passes 
near the west-central coast of Florida on Wednesday and Thursday. 
The NHC intensity forecast agrees well with the latest IVCN and HCCA 
aids.

Ian has made an expected turn toward the north-northwest, and its 
initial motion is 330/11 kt. The hurricane will move 
north-northwestward to northward over the next day or so as it is 
steered by a mid-level ridge to the east. A turn to the 
north-northeast with a decrease in forward speed is forecast on 
Wednesday and Thursday as the center of Ian moves near the west 
coast of Florida. The slower forward motion is likely to prolong the 
storm surge, wind, and rainfall impacts, especially along the west 
coast of Florida. The latest track guidance has come into better 
agreement on this scenario, although it is noted that small 
deviations to the shore-parallel track could have large implications 
on the impacts at particular locations along the west coast of 
Florida. The NHC track forecast has again been adjusted slightly 
eastward at 48-72 h, which follows the latest trends in the global 
model guidance and lies near but just west of the multi-model 
consensus aids.

Based on the latest forecast and timing of expected impacts, 
Hurricane and Storm Surge Warnings have been issued along the west 
coast of Florida. 
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Life-threatening storm surge, hurricane-force winds, flash 
floods and possible mudslides are expected in portions of western 
Cuba beginning this evening and continuing into Tuesday.  
Devastating wind damage is possible where the core of Ian moves 
across western Cuba. Efforts to protect life and property should be 
rushed to completion.

2. There is the danger of life-threatening storm surge along much 
of the Florida west coast where a storm surge warning has been 
issued, with the highest risk from Fort Myers to the Tampa Bay 
region.  Residents in these areas should listen to advice given by 
local officials.

3. Hurricane-force winds are expected in the hurricane warning area 
in west-central Florida beginning Wednesday morning with tropical 
storm conditions expected by late Tuesday.   

4. Heavy rainfall will increase across the Florida Keys and south 
Florida Tuesday, spreading to central and northern Florida Wednesday 
and Thursday, potentially causing flash, urban and small stream 
flooding. Significant prolonged river flooding is likely across 
central Florida.
