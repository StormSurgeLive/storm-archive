expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ian was located
near latitude 30.3 North, longitude 79.2 West.  Ian is moving toward
the north-northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A turn toward the north
is expected later today, followed by a turn toward the 
north-northwest with an increase in forward speed tonight.  On
the forecast track, Ian will approach and reach the coast of South 
Carolina today.  The center will move farther inland across the 
Carolinas tonight and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected before Ian makes 
landfall later today, and rapid weakening is forecast over the 
southeastern United States late today into Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 415
miles (665 km).
 
The minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force Hurricane
Hunter aircraft is 984 mb (29.06 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
* Edisto Beach to Little River Inlet...4-7 ft
* Flagler/Volusia County Line to Edisto Beach...3-5 ft
* Litter River Inlet to Cape Fear...3-5 ft
* Cape Fear River...2-4 ft
* St. Johns River...2-4 ft
* East of Cape Fear to Duck, including Pamlico and Neuse
Rivers...2-4 ft
* Patrick Air Force Base to Flagler/Volusia County Line... 1-3 ft
* Albemarle Sound...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring in parts of the 
warning areas on the northeast coast of Florida, Georgia, and the 
Carolinas, and hurricane conditions are expected to begin in the 
Hurricane Warning area later today.  Hurricane conditions are 
possible within the Hurricane Watch area in North Carolina later 
today.
 
RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall amounts:
 
* Coastal Georgia: 1 to 2 inches.
* Northeast South Carolina: 4 to 8 inches, with local maxima of
12 inches.
* Central South Carolina, North Carolina, and southern Virginia:
3 to 6 inches with local maxima of 8 inches across northwest North
Carolina and southwest Virginia.
 
Major to record river flooding will continue across central Florida
through next week.  Considerable flash and urban flooding, and minor
river flooding is possible across coastal and northeast South
Carolina today.  Locally considerable flash, urban, and small
stream flooding is possible today into Saturday across portions of
northwest North Carolina and southwest Virginia. Limited flooding is
possible across portions of the southern Mid-Atlantic this weekend.
 
TORNADOES:  The potential for a few tornadoes will begin later this 
morning along a portion of the coastal Carolinas, spread inland
across eastern North Carolina during the afternoon and evening, and
shift into southeast Virginia overnight through early Saturday
morning.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian and a nearby frontal system are 
affecting the east coast of Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, and the 
northwestern Bahamas. These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office. Swells will subside along 
the northern coast of Cuba and the northeastern coast of the Yucatan 
peninsula today. 
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM EDT.

Hurricane Ian Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
1100 PM EDT Thu Sep 29 2022
 
Ian continues to have the appearance of a hybrid tropical cyclone, 
having the characteristics of both an extratropical low with some 
frontal features, and a sheared tropical cyclone with convection 
well removed from the low-level center.  The system is interacting 
with a mid- to upper-level shortwave trough just to its west, and 
this interaction may be contributing to slight strengthening. Based 
on a blend of flight-level and SFMR-observed winds, along with 
dropsonde measurements, from an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
the current intensity has been increased a little to 70 kt for this 
advisory.  The strongest winds are currently occuring over the 
northwestern quadrant of the hurricane.
 
Southwesterly vertical wind shear is expected to remain high and the 
environmental air mass will stay dry until landfall.  However, Ian 
could intensify a little more within the next 12 hours or so due to 
trough interaction and extraction of energy from the underlying warm 
Gulf Stream waters.  Therefore the NHC forecast calls for slight 
strengthening before the system reaches the coast. This is above the 
available intensity model guidance.   It should be emphasized that 
although Ian is not expected to be a classic hurricane at landfall, 
this does not diminish the threat it poses.  Strong winds and storm 
surge will also extend far from the center and will begin well 
before the center arrives.
 
Ian continues to move north-northeastward at about 030/9 kt. Over 
the next day or so, the cyclone is expected to turn northward and 
then north-northwestward as it moves along the eastern side of the 
shortwave trough.  The dynamical model consensus, TVCN, has again 
shifted slightly eastward on this cycle.  Therefore the NHC track 
prediction is, again, moved a little eastward from the previous 
official forecast.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge through Friday
along the coasts of northeast Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.
Residents in these areas should follow any advice given by local
officials.
 
2. Hurricane-force winds are expected across the coasts of South
Carolina and southeastern North Carolina beginning early Friday,
where a Hurricane Warning is in effect.  Hurricane conditions are
possible in North Carolina on Friday where a Hurricane Watch is in
effect.   Preparations should be rushed to completion.
 
3. Ongoing major to record river flooding will continue through next
week across portions of central Florida.  Considerable flooding is
expected through Friday across portions of coastal and northeast
South Carolina. Locally considerable flooding is possible across
portions of North Carolina and southern Virginia through Friday.
