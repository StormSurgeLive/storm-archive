...GASTON WEAKENING AND SOON TO BE POST TROPICAL...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM GMT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...39.1N 37.5W
ABOUT 475 MI...765 KM W OF FAIAL ISLAND IN THE CENTRAL AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 260 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gaston was
located near latitude 39.1 North, longitude 37.5 West. Gaston is
moving toward the west near 10 mph (17 km/h) and a general west to
west-southwestward motion is expected until dissipation.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with
higher gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast over the next few days,
and Gaston is forecast to become a post-tropical tonight and
dissipate entirely later this week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Gaston are expected to affect portions of
the Azores though tonight.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM GMT.

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
900 PM GMT Sun Sep 25 2022
 
Gaston this evening consists of a well-defined, low-level swirl
absent of any deep convection. All of the earlier activity
dissipated shortly after 1200 UTC and if deep, organized convection
does not quickly return near the center, Gaston could soon become
post-tropical. Both subjective and objective Dvorak estimates have
been decreasing, though there were enough derived motion winds
between 925-850 mb (around 50 kt) to lower the intensity down to
just 40 kt for this advisory.
 
Gaston has continued to turn leftward, with the latest estimated
motion now south of due west at 260/9 kt. A deep-layer
southwest-to-northeast oriented ridge is becoming established
northwest of Gaston, which should maintain the system on a
west-southwest heading for the next several days until the
closed-circulation opens up into a trough. The guidance took another
southward shift this cycle, and the NHC track forecast follows the
guidance in bending the track a bit more southward, following the
reliable consensus aids.
 
Gaston has lost its earlier baroclinic support that maintained
instability aiding last night's convective resurgence. The global
and regional hurricane models are in good agreement that Gaston will
fail to produce any additional convective bursts in an environment
of strong northerly vertical wind shear, 24-25 C SSTs, and
significant synoptic forcing for descent on the upwind side of a
upper-level trough. Gaston is now forecast to become a post-tropical
cyclone in 12 hours, but this could occur as quickly as tonight if
convection does not return soon. The post-tropical low should
gradually fill thereafter, opening up into a trough by 60 hours.

located near latitude 17.0 North, longitude 80.8 West.  Ian is 
moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A turn toward 
the north-northwest is expected on Monday followed by a northward 
motion on Tuesday with a slightly slower forward speed.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Ian is expected to pass near or west 
of the Cayman Islands on Monday, and near or over western Cuba 
Monday night and early Tuesday.  Ian will then emerge over the 
southeastern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast tonight, 
followed by more rapid strengthening on Monday and Tuesday.  Ian is 
forecast to become a hurricane on Monday and a major hurricane on 
Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft observations is 991 mb (29.26 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach Grand Cayman on
Monday, with tropical storm conditions beginning late tonight.  
Hurricane conditions are expected within the warning area in Cuba by
early Tuesday, with tropical storm conditions expected by late
Monday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical storm
warning area in Cuba Monday night and Tuesday.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible on Little Cayman and Cayman Brac on Monday.
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the lower Florida Keys by
Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL:  Ian is expected to produce the following rainfall:
 
Jamaica and the Cayman Islands: 3 to 6 inches, with local maxima up
to 8 inches.
 
Western Cuba: 6 to 10 inches, with local maxima up to 16 inches.
 
Florida Keys into southern and central Florida Peninsula: 2 to 4
inches, with local maxima up to 6 inches beginning Monday through
Wednesday morning.
 
Heavy rainfall may affect North Florida, the Florida Panhandle and
the Southeast Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
 
These rains may produce flash flooding and mudslides in areas of
higher terrain, particularly over Jamaica and Cuba. Flash and urban
flooding are possible across the Florida Keys and the Florida
peninsula through mid week. Additional flooding and rises on
area streams and rivers across northern Florida and parts of the
southeast U.S. later this week cannot be ruled out, especially in
central Florida given already saturated conditions.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
East Cape Sable, FL to Card Sound Bridge...1-3 ft
Florida Keys, FL including Dry Tortugas...1-3 ft
Florida Bay...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing
of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 9 to 14 feet
above normal tide levels along the coast of western Cuba in areas
of onshore winds in the hurricane warning area Monday night
and early Tuesday.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Cayman Islands Sunday night into Monday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting Jamaica and the Cayman
Islands. Swells will spread northwestward to the southwestern coast
of Cuba and the coasts of Honduras, Belize, and the Yucatan
Peninsula of Mexico on Monday and Monday night. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Ian Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Tropical Storm Ian Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
500 PM EDT Sun Sep 25 2022
 
The organization of Ian has not changed much since this morning. 
There have been some small bursts of convection closer to the center 
of the storm this afternoon, but the activity has not yet led to any 
notable changes in its structure. In fact, the most persistent 
convection has been in outer rainbands well to the northeast of the 
circulation near Jamaica. The SFMR wind data and adjusted 
flight-level winds from the earlier reconnaissance flights supported 
surface winds of 35-40 kt, and the initial intensity is set at 40 kt 
for this advisory. A NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to 
investigate Ian later tonight. 

The center of Ian has jogged a bit northward this afternoon, but its 
longer-term motion is west-northwestward at 300/10 kt. A generally 
northwestward motion is expected tonight, followed by a 
north-northwestward motion on Monday and early Tuesday as it moves 
across the northwestern Caribbean Sea and near or over western Cuba. 
From there, the track guidance still diverges at days 3-5 as Ian is 
forecast to move northward across the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The 
ECMWF and UKMET models still lie on the eastern edge of the guidance 
and bring the center of Ian over the coast of west-central Florida, 
while the HWRF and HMON models are on the western side of the 
envelope and show Ian approaching the central Florida panhandle. 
Notably, the GFS has trended slightly eastward for the past few 
cycles, which has brought the multi-model consensus aids a bit 
eastward as well. The latest NHC track forecast has been adjusted in 
this direction, but only on the order of 15-20 n mi in the extended 
range. Users are reminded not to focus on the details of the track 
forecast at longer time ranges, since uncertainty is still high and 
future adjustments may be required.
 
Although the storm has yet to develop an inner core, the conditions 
over the northwestern Caribbean Sea appear very likely to support 
strengthening once it becomes better organized. Some dry 
environmental air may have limited convection today, but the GFS- 
and ECMWF-simulated satellite imagery indicate that deep convection 
will increase during the diurnal maximum period overnight. Then, 
significant strengthening is expected with low deep-layer shear and 
high oceanic heat content along the forecast track. There is still 
strong support for rapid intensification in the latest intensity 
guidance, and the NHC intensity forecast shows Ian becoming a 
hurricane on Monday and a major hurricane on Tuesday. This forecast 
remains close to the IVCN multi-model consensus, with some model 
aids including HCCA showing even higher peak intensities. Strong 
southwesterly shear develops over Ian by 72 h related to interaction 
with an upper-level trough, and the structure of the cyclone could 
significantly degrade before landfall given these hostile 
conditions. However, Ian is likely to have an expanding wind field 
and will be slowing down by that time, which will have the potential 
to produce significant wind and storm surge impacts across portions 
of the Florida west coast and the Florida panhandle.

 
Key Messages:

1.  Ian is expected to produce heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and 
possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain, particularly over 
Jamaica and Cuba.  Flash and urban flooding is possible with 
rainfall across the Florida Keys and the Florida peninsula through 
the middle of the week. Additional flooding on rivers across 
northern Florida and parts of the southeast U.S. cannot be ruled out 
later this week. 

2.  Life-threatening storm surge and hurricane-force winds are 
expected in portions of western Cuba beginning late Monday, and Ian 
is forecast to be at or near major hurricane strength when it is 
near western Cuba. Efforts to protect life and property should be 
rushed to completion. 

3.  Ian is expected to be a major hurricane in the eastern Gulf of 
Mexico during the middle of this week, but uncertainty in the track 
and intensity forecasts remains higher than usual. Regardless of 
Ian’s exact track and intensity, there is a risk of dangerous storm 
surge, hurricane-force winds, and heavy rainfall along the west 
coast of Florida and the Florida Panhandle by the middle of this 
week, and residents in Florida should ensure they have their 
hurricane plan in place. Follow any advice given by local officials 
and closely monitor updates to the forecast.
