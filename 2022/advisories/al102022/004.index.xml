DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Fiona
was located near latitude 46.0 North, longitude 61.0 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the north near 26 mph (43
km/h).  A slower north-northeast or northward motion is expected
through Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Fiona will
move across eastern Nova Scotia and into the Gulf of St. Lawrence 
this morning, and then move across Labrador and over the Labrador 
Sea on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Although gradual weakening is forecast during the next
couple of days, Fiona is expected to maintain hurricane-force winds
until this afternoon.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 405
miles (650 km).  There have been many reports of hurricane-force 
winds gusts in portions of eastern Nova Scotia during the past few 
hours.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 931 mb (27.50 inches). 
The Canadian station on Hart Island recently reported a pressure 
of 931.6 mb (27.51 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Fiona can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are occurring in portions of the
hurricane warning area in Canada. Tropical storm conditions are
occurring in portions of the tropical storm warning area in Canada.
These conditions should persist through later today. Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the watch area in Labrador on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and western Newfoundland: 3 to 6
inches (75 to 150 mm), with local maxima of up to 10 inches (250
mm). Flooding is expected, some of which could be significant.
 
Labrador and eastern Quebec:  2 to 5 inches (50 to 125 mm).
 
Eastern New Brunswick: 1 to 3 inches (25 to 75 mm).
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding within the warning areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of
onshore winds. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting Atlantic Canada, the
eastern United States coast, Bermuda, and the northwestern Bahamas.
The swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Fiona Discussion Number  40
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
500 AM AST Sat Sep 24 2022

Around 07Z, the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Fiona made landfall 
on the Canso Peninsula of Nova Scotia near Hart Island and 
Guysborough.  Surface observations indicate that the minimum 
pressure at landfall was near 931 mb.  The initial intensity is 
decreased to a somewhat uncertain 80 kt based on earlier 
scatterometer data, with these winds occurring primarily to the 
east and southeast of the center.

Fiona is starting to slow its forward motion, with the initial 
motion now 360/23 kt.  A general northward to north-northeastward 
motion with some additional decrease in forward speed is expected 
during the next 60 h.  A subsequent northeastward motion is then 
forecast until the cyclone dissipates just after 72 h.  The new 
forecast track is similar to the previous track, but it lies a 
little west of the previous track at 24-36 h.  The new forecast 
track is close to the various consensus models.
 
Gradual weakening is anticipated during the next couple of days,  
and Fiona's winds should drop below hurricane strength in just over 
12 h.  After that, winds should decrease below gale force by 72 h 
while the system is over the Labrador Sea.  The new intensity 
forecast follows the trend of the intensity guidance and lies on 
the upper edge of the guidance.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Fiona is expected to affect portions of Atlantic Canada as a
powerful hurricane-force cyclone today, and significant impacts
from high winds, storm surge, and heavy rainfall are expected.
Hurricane and Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect for much of
Atlantic Canada.
 
2. Large swells generated by Fiona are expected to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along much of the
east coast of the United States, the northwestern Bahamas, Bermuda,
and Atlantic Canada during the next couple of days.

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
900 AM GMT Sat Sep 24 2022
 
Since yesterday, Gaston has been transitioning to an asymmetric 
warm core post-tropical cyclone.  A Friday morning 1227Z METOP-C 
scatterometer data confirmed that the transition had begun by 
depicting growing asymmetry in the wind field with a hundred-mile 
increase in gale-force winds in the northwest quadrant.  Subsequent 
surface winds less than 60 miles from the center were 20 kt or 
less, all characteristics of a post-tropical/extratropical cyclone 
wind profile.  The initial intensity is set at a generous 45 kt and 
is above the various subjective and objective satellite intensity 
estimates.
 
As a result of increasing deep-layer shear and decreasing sea
surface temperature beneath the cyclone, Gaston's organized deep
convection has diminished considerably.  Only a few convective 
fragments remain well displaced to the southeast of the surface 
center.  Accordingly, further weakening is expected, and Gaston 
should complete its post-tropical transition later today.  A couple 
of the global models, however, indicate a mid-latitude shortwave 
trough/baroclinic zone interacting with post-tropical Gaston early 
Sunday morning, which could create a flare-up of deep convection, 
but this should be a short-lived event.
 
Gaston's initial motion is estimated to be west-southwestward, or 
250/8 kt.  Building high pressure over the northeast Atlantic 
should continue to steer the post-tropical cyclone westward through 
Monday morning, and west-southwestward until dissipation occurs 
toward the end of the week.  The official track forecast is a 
little faster than the previous advisory and is nudged to the 
south beyond 48 hours to agree more with the NOAA HFIP HCCA model.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions over the western and central Azores 
today should diminish this evening as Gaston moves away from the 
islands.
 
2. Gaston is expected to produce heavy rainfall over the western 
and central Azores through Saturday.  This rainfall may result in 
landslides and areas of flooding.

winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests in western and central Cuba should monitor the progress
of Ian.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ian was
located near latitude 14.7 North, longitude 72.9 West.  Ian is
moving toward the west near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A westward
to west-northwestward motion is expected through early Sunday.  A
turn toward the northwest is forecast late Sunday, followed by a
north-northwestward turn by late Monday.  On the forecast track, 
the center of Ian is forecast to move across the central Caribbean 
Sea today, pass southwest of Jamaica on Sunday, and pass near or 
over the Cayman Islands Sunday night and early Monday.  Ian will
then approach western Cuba on Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next few days, and Ian
is expected to become a hurricane Sunday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible in the Cayman Islands by
early Monday, with tropical storm conditions possible by Sunday
night.  Tropical storm conditions are possible on Jamaica on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce the following rainfall:
 
Southern Haiti and Southern Dominican Republic: 2 to 4 inches, with
local maximum up to 6 inches
 
Jamaica and the Cayman Islands: 4 to 8 inches, with local maximum up
to 12 inches
 
Western to central Cuba: 6 to 10 inches, with local maximum up to 14
inches
 
These rains may produce flash flooding and mudslides in areas of
higher terrain, particularly over Jamaica and Cuba.
 
Florida Keys and South Florida: Heavy rains could begin as early as
Monday. Limited flash and urban flooding is possible with this
rainfall.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to
3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas
of onshore winds in the Cayman Islands Sunday night into Monday.
 
Localized coastal flooding is possible along the coast of Jamaica in
areas of onshore winds on Sunday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ian will begin affecting Jamaica, the
Cayman Islands, and Cuba over the next several days. These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Ian Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
1100 PM EDT Fri Sep 23 2022
 
The system remains sheared from the northeast, with the low-level 
circulation evident a bit to the east of the deep convection.  
Unfortunately, we didn't have the benefit of a reconnaissance 
aircraft this evening to sample the winds, but satellite estimates 
did increase a bit.  TAFB and SAB provided Dvorak classifications 
of T2.0/30 kt and T3.0/45 kt, respectively, while the objective 
UW-CIMSS ADT and SATCON estimates are at tropical storm intensity.  
Based on a blend of these data, the depression is upgraded to 
Tropical Storm Ian with 35-kt winds.

Ian's center appears to have been moving more slowly this evening, 
and the initial motion estimate is west-northwestward, or 285/10 
kt.  The track guidance is in good agreement that Ian should turn 
westward during the next 12-24 hours while located to the south of 
a small mid-level anticyclone centered just north of Hispaniola.  
After 24 hours, Ian is expected to begin recurving around the 
western side of this high, turning northwestward over the 
northwestern Caribbean Sea, and then northward while crossing Cuba 
into the Gulf of Mexico and toward Florida.  The track models 
agree on this general scenario, and the guidance envelope is 
flanked by the major global models, with the ECMWF taking a route 
over South Florida and the GFS farther west, remaining over the 
eastern Gulf of Mexico by day 5.  The new NHC forecast lies between 
these two scenarios and is not much different from the previous 
forecast.  The GFS and ECMWF ensembles both show a similar amount 
of spread as the deterministic guidance, but both ensemble means 
are close to the multi-model consensus aids, which helps to give 
more credence to the position of the official forecast.

The moderate deep-layer shear affecting Ian is forecast to decrease 
during the next 6 to 12 hours, and the cyclone will be moving over 
the very warm waters of the central and northwestern Caribbean Sea, 
where sea surface temperatures are between 29 and 31 degrees 
Celsius.  Intensification is expected to be gradual during the next 
36 hours while Ian gets better organized in a lower-shear 
environment, but after that time, conditions will be conducive for 
faster strengthening.  In fact, the NHC intensity forecast 
explicitly calls for rapid intensification (RI) between days 2 and 
3 while Ian is moving over the northwestern Caribbean Sea toward 
western Cuba.  It's worth nothing too that the RI indices from 
SHIPS are showing a 2-in-3 chance of a 65-kt increase in winds 
during the next 3 days, and if that transpires, Ian could be 
stronger than what's shown in the official forecast.  The storm is 
not expected to be over Cuba long enough to cause much weakening, 
and the forecast still shows Ian as a major hurricane over the 
eastern Gulf of Mexico while approaching the west coast of Florida.

 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Ian is expected to produce heavy rainfall and instances of 
flash flooding and possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain, 
particularly over Jamaica and Cuba.
 
2.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the Cayman Islands by 
early Monday, with tropical storm conditions possible by late 
Sunday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible in Jamaica on 
Sunday.
 
3.  Early next week, Ian is forecast to move near or over western 
Cuba as a strengthening hurricane and then approach the Florida 
peninsula at or near major hurricane strength, with the potential 
for significant impacts from storm surge, hurricane-force winds, 
and heavy rainfall.  While it is too soon to determine the
exact magnitude and location of these impacts, residents in Cuba,
the Florida Keys, and the Florida peninsula should ensure they have
their hurricane plan in place and closely monitor forecast updates
through the weekend.

Tropical Storm Hermine Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102022
800 AM CVT Sat Sep 24 2022
 
Hermine is barely holding on as a tropical storm.  This morning's 
satellite presentation consists of an exposed surface circulation 
situated well to the south-southwest of the deep convective mass.  
The initial intensity is set at a generous 35 kt.
 
The southwesterly shear is currently affecting Hermine's cloud 
pattern is predicted to increase while the thermodynamic 
surrounding environment becomes progressively inhibiting.  
Therefore, Hermine may hang on as a tropical storm today, but 
weakening is expected to occur soon, and the cyclone should 
degenerate into a remnant low-pressure system on Monday.
The latest NHC intensity forecast is unchanged from the previous 
one, and is on the high end of the guidance.
 
The 0900 UTC position is based on a centroid point between 
multiple surface swirls, one well to the south of the 
convection and another near the edge of the convective canopy. 
Hermine's initial motion is estimated to be northward, or 355/9 kt.
Hermine is expected to turn toward the northeast around the
northwest periphery of the east Atlantic subtropical ridge Sunday 
evening.  By Monday evening, the vertically shallow remnant low 
should turn toward the northwest in the east Atlantic trade wind 
flow.  No significant changes were made to the NHC track forecast, 
which lies in the middle of the model guidance suite.
