DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Fiona
was located near latitude 48.4 North, longitude 60.5 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the northeast near 8 mph (13
km/h). A faster north-northeast or north motion is expected
through Monday.  On the forecast track, the center of Fiona will
move across Labrador and over the Labrador Sea late tonight and 
Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is expected during the next couple of
days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 550 miles (890 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface 
observations is 952 mb (28.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Fiona can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Gale-force and storm-force winds are expected to continue
across portions of Atlantic Canada through early Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce 1 to 2 inches (25 to 50 mm) 
of rainfall across portions of Atlantic Canada, with storm total 
maxima as high as 10 inches (250 mm) across Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and western Newfoundland. Flooding 
is expected, some of which could be significant.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding in portions of Atlantic Canada in areas of onshore winds.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting Atlantic Canada, the
northeastern United States coast, and Bermuda. The swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Fiona Discussion Number  42
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
500 PM AST Sat Sep 24 2022
 
Fiona remains a large and potent extratropical low pressure system.
Even though the maximum winds have decreased just below
hurricane-force, ASCAT data and surface observations show that
Fiona has a very large wind field.  The initial wind speed is
estimated to be 60 kt.
 
Fiona has slowed down significantly, and the system is now moving
northeastward at 7 kt.  A faster north to north-northeast motion is
expected, taking the center of the system across Labrador tonight
and early Sunday.  The NHC track forecast is similar to the
previous one.
 
Since the tropical warnings have been discontinued for Atlantic
Canada, this is the last NHC advisory on Fiona.  For information on
this system, see forecasts issued by Environment Canada at
https://weather.gc.ca/.  Additional information can be found in
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under
AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online
at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Fiona is forecast to continue to affect portions of Atlantic
Canada through early Sunday, and significant impacts from high
winds, storm surge, and heavy rainfall are expected.
 
2. Heavy rains from Fiona are expected to continue to impact
portions of Atlantic Canada into Sunday. This rainfall is expected
to produce flooding, some of which could be significant.
 
3. Large swells generated by Fiona are expected to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the coast of
the northeast United States, Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada during
the next couple of days.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM GMT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gaston was 
located near latitude 38.0 North, longitude 31.0 West. Gaston is 
moving toward the west near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general motion 
is expected to continue through Sunday.  A turn to the southwest is 
forecast by late Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast over the next few days, and
Gaston is expected to become a post-tropical cyclone later this 
evening.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gaston can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical-storm-force winds are expected in portions of the 
western Azores for the next several hours.  See products issued by 
the meteorological service in the Azores for more information.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Gaston are expected to affect portions of
the Azores through tonight.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
 
RAINFALL:  Gaston is expected to produce additional rainfall
accumulations of 1 to 2 inches with locally higher amounts of 3
inches across the western and central Azores.  This will result in
storm total rainfall of 2 to 6 inches which may result in landslides
and areas of flooding.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM GMT.

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
300 PM GMT Sat Sep 24 2022
 
Gaston has lost most of its deep convection and it is currently an 
exposed low-level circulation.  The closest relatively deep 
convective activity is south of Pico Island over 100 miles away 
from the center and likely terrain-induced. Though a recent 
scatterometer pass missed the center of Gaston, it did show an area 
of tropical-storm-force winds of around 35 kt to the east of the 
center.  Therefore, the initial intensity has been lowered to 40 
kt, slightly higher than the satellite intensity estimates.
 
Hostile environmental conditions have weakened Gaston considerably.
The strong vertical wind shear and dry mid-level humidities are not
expected to improve for the remainder of the forecast period, and
additional weakening is likely.  The official forecast is similar to
the previous prediction and still shows Gaston becoming fully
post-tropical within 12 hours.  A couple of the global models,
however, indicate a mid-latitude shortwave trough/baroclinic zone
interacting with post-tropical Gaston early Sunday morning could
develop isolated deep convection, but this should be a short-lived
event.
 
The storm is moving west-southwestward at an estimated 245/8 kt.  A
building mid-level ridge to the north is expected to steer Gaston
to the west through Monday morning, and to the west-southwest 
until it dissipates near the end of the week.  The NHC forecast 
track is shifted slightly south of the previous advisory track, 
likely due to the southern shift of the initial position.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions over the western and central Azores
today should diminish today as Gaston moves away from the islands.
 
2. Gaston is expected to produce heavy rainfall over the western
and central Azores through Saturday.  This rainfall may result in
landslides and areas of flooding.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of the Cayman Islands has upgraded the Hurricane 
Watch to a Hurricane Warning for Grand Cayman, and has changed the 
Hurricane Watch to a Tropical Storm Watch for Little Cayman and 
Cayman Brac.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Grand Cayman
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Jamaica
* Little Cayman and Cayman Brac

A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests in western and central Cuba, the Florida Keys, and the
Florida peninsula should monitor the progress of Ian.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ian was 
located near latitude 14.2 North, longitude 75.8 West. Ian is moving 
toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h), and this general motion is 
expected to continue through tonight. A turn toward the northwest is 
forecast on Sunday, followed by a north-northwestward turn on Monday 
and a northward motion on Tuesday. On the forecast track, the center 
of Ian is forecast to pass southwest of Jamaica on Sunday, and pass 
near the Cayman Islands Sunday night and early Monday. Ian will then 
approach western Cuba late Monday and emerge over the southeastern 
Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts. Significant strengthening is forecast during the next few
days. Ian is expected to become a hurricane late Sunday or Sunday
night and could be at or near major hurricane strength late Monday
when it approaches western Cuba.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach Grand Cayman by 
early Monday, with tropical storm conditions expected by Sunday 
night. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Jamaica by Sunday, 
and on Little Cayman and Cayman Brac by Sunday night.  
 
RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce the following rainfall:
 
Southern Haiti and southern Dominican Republic: 2 to 4 inches, with
local maxima up to 6 inches
 
Jamaica and the Cayman Islands: 4 to 8 inches, with local maxima up
to 12 inches
 
Western to central Cuba: 6 to 10 inches, with local maxima up to 14
inches
 
Florida Keys and south Florida: 1 to 3 inches, with local maxima up
to 5 inches through Tuesday morning
 
These rains may produce flash flooding and mudslides in areas of
higher terrain, particularly over Jamaica and Cuba. Flash and urban
flooding is possible with rainfall across the Florida Keys and the
Florida peninsula through mid next week. Additional flooding and
rises on area streams and rivers across Florida cannot be ruled out
through next week given already saturated antecedent conditions.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to
4 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas
of onshore winds in the Cayman Islands Sunday night into Monday.
 
Localized coastal flooding is possible along the coast of Jamaica in
areas of onshore winds on Sunday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ian will begin affecting Jamaica and the
Cayman Islands on Sunday and spread westward to Cuba by Monday.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.

<title>Tropical Storm Ian Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Ian Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
1100 AM EDT Sat Sep 24 2022
 
Ian still has an asymmetric appearance in satellite imagery this 
morning, with most of the deep convection located over the western 
portion of the circulation. Tail Doppler radar and dropsonde data 
from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate the cyclone is still 
vertically tilted, with the low- to mid-level center displaced to 
the south of the surface center. This structure is likely a product 
of the northerly shear that has affected the cyclone since genesis. 
The aircraft reported 700-mb flight-level winds of 43 kt and SFMR 
retrievals slightly above 35 kt, which supports keeping the initial 
intensity at 40 kt for this advisory.

The initial motion is a bit south of due west at 260/13 kt. A 
generally westward motion is expected through tonight as the cyclone 
is steered by a narrow ridge to its north. Ian is forecast to turn 
northwestward on Sunday and north-northwestward on Monday as it 
moves across the northwestern Caribbean Sea around the periphery of 
the ridge. The NHC track forecast during this period has been 
adjusted slightly south and west of the previous one, in line with 
the track consensus aids. Beyond 72 h, there is still a large amount 
of cross-track spread in the guidance as Ian emerges into the 
eastern Gulf of Mexico and approaches Florida. Hopefully, data 
collected from special radiosonde releases beginning later today and 
a scheduled NOAA G-IV flight will help resolve the steering flow 
around Ian and deep-layer trough that is forecast to be over the 
eastern U.S. early next week. The guidance envelope has once again 
shifted westward this cycle, and the official NHC track forecast has 
been adjusted in this direction as well, though it still lies 
slightly to the east of the TVCA and HCCA aids. Further adjustments 
to the track forecast may be needed given the increased uncertainty 
in the day 3-5 period. 

Ian is moving into a lower shear environment over very warm waters, 
and it should not take long for the system to shed its tilted 
structure and develop an inner core. Once that occurs, significant 
to rapid intensification is expected while Ian crosses the 
northwestern Caribbean Sea. The intensity guidance unanimously 
supports strengthening during the next several days, and the 
SHIPS-RII probabilities indicate a 67 percent chance of a 65-kt 
intensity increase in 72 h. Therefore, the NHC track forecast has 
been raised from the previous one, showing Ian becoming a hurricane 
by late Sunday and approaching western Cuba at or near major 
hurricane strength by Monday night. Limited land interaction is 
expected as the cyclone quickly passes over western Cuba, and Ian 
is forecast to be a major hurricane over the eastern Gulf of Mexico 
on Tuesday and Wednesday as it approaches the west coast of Florida.
  
Key Messages:
 
1.  Ian is expected to produce heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and 
possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain, particularly over 
Jamaica and Cuba. Limited flash and urban flooding is possible with 
rainfall across the Florida Keys and Florida peninsula through mid 
next week.
 
2.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the Cayman Islands by early 
Monday, with tropical storm conditions possible by late Sunday.  
Tropical storm conditions are possible in Jamaica on
Sunday.

3.  Ian is forecast to move near or over western Cuba and approach 
the west coast of the Florida peninsula at or near major hurricane 
strength early next week, where there is increasing confidence in 
multiple life-threatening hazards: storm surge, hurricane-force 
winds and rainfall flooding. While it is too soon to determine the 
exact magnitude and location of these hazards, residents in Cuba, 
the Florida Keys, and the Florida peninsula should ensure they have 
their hurricane plan in place, follow any advice given by local 
officials, and closely monitor updates to the forecast.

...HERMINE WEAKENS TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION...
...HEAVY RAINS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE ACROSS THE CANARY ISLANDS FOR
ANOTHER DAY OR SO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 PM CVT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.8N 20.6W
ABOUT 460 MI...735 KM NNE OF THE CABO VERDE ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 360 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1003 MB...29.62 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM CVT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Hermine
was located near latitude 21.8 North, longitude 20.6 West. The
depression is moving toward the north near 10 mph (17 km/h) and this 
motion is expected to continue during the next day or so. After 
that time, a turn toward the northwest is expected.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Weakening is forecast, and Hermine is expected 
to become a remnant low in a day or so.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Hermine is expected to produce 3 to 6 (75 to 150 mm)
inches of rainfall with localized higher amounts up to 10 inches
(250 mm) across the Canary Islands through this weekend. This
rainfall may cause some flash flooding in areas of higher terrain.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM CVT.

Tropical Depression Hermine Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102022
800 PM CVT Sat Sep 24 2022
 
Hermine has generally changed little during the past several hours 
and it continues to produce heavy rains across the Canary Islands. 
The cyclone remains strongly sheared with the low-level center 
exposed well to the south-southwest of the main area of deep 
convection due to strong southwesterly shear. The initial intensity 
is lowered to 30 kt, which is near the high end of the satellite 
estimates.  This makes Hermine a tropical depression. 
 
The storm is moving northward at 9 kt, and that motion is expected
to continue during the next day or two while Hermine moves in the
flow on the west side of a subtropical ridge.   After that time, a
turn toward the left is expected as the shallow system is steered by
the low-level flow.  The NHC track forecast remains near the middle
of the guidance envelope.
 
Hermine is expected to move into a region of even stronger shear,
drier air, and cooler SSTs, which should cause the storm to 
slowly weaken. The GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite images show 
that the system should lose all of its deep convection tomorrow, 
and the NHC forecast now shows the system becoming a remnant low in 
24 hours.
