WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Tuxpan to Frontera
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in southeastern Mexico should monitor the
progress of this system.  Additional watches or warnings may be
required for portions of the coast of Mexico later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Karl was
located near latitude 22.1 North, longitude 94.1 West.  Karl is 
moving toward the southeast near 2 mph (4 km/h).  A slightly 
faster southeastward motion is expected later today. Karl is then  
expected to turn southward or south-southwestward over the Bay 
of Campeche on Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of Karl 
should reach the coasts of Tabasco or Veracruz states in Mexico 
late Friday night or early Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is expected today, but Karl should
gradually lose some strength on Friday while it approaches the Bay
of Campeche coast of Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Reserve 
reconnaissance aircraft and buoy data is 1002 mb (29.59 inches). 
NOAA buoy 42055 located just east of Karl recently reported a 
minimum pressure of 1004 mb (29.64 inches). 

 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Karl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Karl is expected to produce 3 to 7 inches of rain, with
local maxima up to 12 inches, across portions of Veracruz and
Tabasco states in Mexico from Friday into Saturday night.  Rainfall
amounts of 2 to 4 inches, with local max up to 6 inches, is also
expected across portions of Chiapas and Oaxaca. These rains can
produce flash flooding, along with mudslides, in higher terrain.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Mexican
coastline in the watch area starting late Friday or Friday night.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Karl are expected to affect the Mexican
coastline for the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Karl Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Tropical Storm Karl Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142022
400 AM CDT Thu Oct 13 2022

Karl has become less organized since the last advisory due to the 
effects of increasing northwesterly vertical wind shear.  The 
central convection has decreased, and the strongest convection is 
now occurring in a band well east of the center.  Surface wind 
estimates received from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft since the last advisory were in the 40-45 kt range, and 
recently-received scatterometer data showed no winds higher than 40 
kt.  In addition, the last aircraft-reported central pressure had 
risen to 1002 mb.  Based on these data, the initial intensity is 
reduced to 45 kt.

Karl remains nearly stationary.  A mid-level ridge located over 
west-central Mexico and a high-amplitude mid-latitude trough over 
the eastern United States are expected to impart northerly or 
northwesterly flow over Karl today, which should push the cyclone 
southeastward and southward into the Bay of Campeche during the 
next couple of days.  A turn toward the southwest could occur near 
the end of the forecast period as the steering flow becomes more 
northeasterly.  The guidance has changed little since the previous 
advisory, and the new forecast track has only minor adjustments 
from the previous forecast.  The new track shows the center of Karl 
reaching the Mexican coast in Tabasco or Veracruz states by Saturday 
morning.

A combination of northwesterly vertical wind shear and dry air 
entrainment should cause Karl to gradually weaken during the next 
couple of days, and the new intensity forecast shows a little more 
weakening before the cyclone makes landfall.  This part of the 
intensity forecast lies near the upper edge of the intensity 
guidance.  After landfall, quick weakening is expected, with Karl 
forecast to become a depression by 60 h, a remnant low by 72 h, and 
dissipate by 96 h.  The new intensity forecast has some minor 
adjustments from the previous forecast due to the reduced initial 
intensity.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall associated with Karl could produce instances of 
flash flooding, with mudslides in areas of higher terrain, across 
portions of Veracruz, Tabasco, Chiapas and Oaxaca states in Mexico.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in
Mexico beginning late Friday or early Saturday.
