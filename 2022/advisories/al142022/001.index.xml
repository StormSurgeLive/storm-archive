Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Tue Oct 11 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Southwest Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
Satellite-derived surface winds indicate that the area of low <br/>
pressure over the Bay of Campeche is becoming better defined.  <br/>
Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive for further <br/>
development, and a tropical depression or tropical storm is likely <br/>
to form within the next day or so while the system moves slowly <br/>
northwestward over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico.  Heavy rainfall <br/>
is also expected over portions of southern Mexico during the next <br/>
couple of days.  An Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft is en <br/>
route to investigate the system, and interests in southwestern <br/>
Mexico should monitor the progress of this disturbance. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Karl Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142022
400 PM CDT Tue Oct 11 2022
 
Tropical Storm Karl has formed over the Bay of Campeche.  Aircraft
and scatterometer data show a closed circulation with a relatively
large radius of maximum winds and a broad area of light and variable
winds near the center.  The Air Force Hurricane Hunter
reconnaissance aircraft found believable SFMR wind speeds of 35 kt
and flight-level winds up to 46 kt while investigating the system.
The scatterometer data also showed a large area of 30-35 kt winds to
the north of the center. The initial intensity is set to 35 kt
based on these data.
 
Karl is moving slowly northwestward at an estimated 5 kt.  The storm
is embedded in a high pressure system, and this motion is expected
to continue for the next day or so.  Thereafter, the ridge is likely
to build westward and steer the cyclone southwestward into the coast
of Mexico in a few days.  The official forecast is close to the
consensus guidance, though this is an uncertain forecast due to the
spread in the forecast track models near landfall.
 
Atmospheric and oceanic conditions are forecast to be conducive for
Karl during the next day or so.  This should allow Karl to
strengthen before global models suggest the vertical wind shear
increases and causes gradual weakening before landfall.  Rapid decay
is expected once the storm moves inland due to the mountainous
terrain.  The NHC intensity forecast peaks at 45 kt in 24 h which is
close to the SHIPS guidance, though all of guidance is clustered
near this value.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall could produce flash flooding in the Isthmus of
Tehuantepec and in the southern Sierra Madre Oriental mountains and
adjacent coastal areas with possible mudslides in areas of higher
terrain.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in
Mexico starting Thursday.
