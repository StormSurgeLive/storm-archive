WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical Storm Warning
west of Coatzacoalcos to Alvarado.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Coatzacoalcos to Sabancuy
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within
12 to 24 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Karl was 
located near latitude 19.4 North, longitude 92.7 West. Karl is 
moving toward the south-southeast near 7 mph (11 km/h). A southward 
to south-southwestward motion is expected later today and tonight 
over the Bay of Campeche. On the forecast track, the center of Karl 
should reach the coast of southern Mexico late tonight or early 
Saturday.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Little change in strength is expected before the center of 
Karl reaches the coast. Steady weakening is expected after the storm 
crosses the coastline, and the system is forecast to dissipate over 
southern Mexico by Saturday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches) 
based on dropsonde data from the aircraft.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Karl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Karl is expected to produce 2 to 5 inches of rain, with 
local maxima up to 10 inches, across portions of Veracruz, Tabasco, 
and northern Chiapas and Oaxaca states in Mexico through Sunday 
morning. These rains could produce flash flooding, along with 
mudslides, in higher terrain.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin within
portions of the tropical storm warning area by this afternoon or
this evening.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Karl are expected to affect the Mexican
coastline for the next couple of days. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Karl Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142022
1000 AM CDT Fri Oct 14 2022
 
The satellite presentation of Karl has improved this morning. An 
increase in deep convection closer to the center has resulted in a 
more symmetric dense overcast, with a concentrated area of lightning 
noted downshear of the center. An Air Force Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft that is currently investigating Karl has found 850-mb 
flight-level winds of 42 kt so far, with peak SFMR retrievals in the 
40-45 kt range. Based on these data and a dropsonde that indicated a 
slightly lower minimum pressure than last night, the initial 
intensity is raised slightly to 40 kt for this advisory.
 
The long-term motion of Karl is now south-southeastward at 6 kt, 
although aircraft fixes and radar suggest the motion has been more 
southward during the past 3-6 hours. A southward to 
south-southwestward motion is expected through early Saturday as 
Karl moves around a mid-level ridge over west-central Mexico. While 
many of the models (including ECMWF, UKMET, and HMON) take the 
center of Karl inland between 12-24 h, the GFS and HWRF show a more 
shallow system turning westward within the low-level flow and 
remaining just offshore this weekend. Given that the ECMWF seems to 
have a better handle on the current convective structure and initial 
motion of Karl, the NHC forecast more closely follows the first set 
of models and shows the storm center inland by 24 h.
 
Moderate west-northwesterly shear and drier mid-level air in the 
surrounding environment should continue to plague Karl during the 
next 12-24 h. Therefore, little net change in strength is expected 
through landfall, although small intensity fluctuations are 
possible. Karl is forecast to reach the coast of southern Mexico as 
a tropical storm late tonight, then quickly weaken to a depression 
and dissipate over the terrain of southern Mexico by late Saturday 
or Saturday night.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall associated with Karl could produce flash flooding, 
with mudslides in areas of higher terrain, across portions of 
Veracruz, Tabasco, Chiapas, and Oaxaca states in Mexico.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin within a portion
of the warning area in southern Mexico by this afternoon or evening.
