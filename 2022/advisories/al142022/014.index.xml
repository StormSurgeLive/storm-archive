Storm Karl, located over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave located <br/>
several hundred miles southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands have <br/>
decreased during the past several hours. Environmental conditions <br/>
appear only marginally conducive for gradual development through the <br/>
weekend while the wave moves generally westward at about 10 mph. <br/>
Further development will become unlikely by early next week due to <br/>
increasing upper-level winds.<br/>

None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Coatzacoalcos to Sabancuy
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within the
next 12 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Karl was 
located near latitude 19.5 North, longitude 92.9 West. Karl is 
moving toward the south-southwest near 5 mph (7 km/h). A 
south-southwestward or southwestward motion is expected during the 
next day or so as Karl moves over the Bay of Campeche. On the 
forecast track, the center of Karl should be near the coast of 
southern Mexico on Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual weakening is forecast, and Karl is expected to become a
tropical depression by early Saturday and dissipate by early Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Karl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Karl is expected to produce 2 to 5 inches of rain, with
local maxima up to 8 inches, across portions of Veracruz, Tabasco,
and northern Chiapas and Oaxaca states in Mexico into early Sunday.
These rains could produce flash flooding, along with mudslides, in
higher terrain.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions, especially in gusts, are expected
within portions of the tropical storm warning area this evening.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Karl are expected to affect the Mexican
coastline through Saturday night. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Karl Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142022
400 PM CDT Fri Oct 14 2022
 
The deep convection associated with Karl collapsed around midday, 
with dry air and deep-layer shear continuing to take a toll on the 
cyclone. The second half of the previous Air Force Hurricane Hunter 
mission found the minimum pressure had increased to around 1003 mb, 
and the peak 850-mb flight-level winds were only 39 kt. Some ASCAT 
passes across the eastern portion of the circulation showed at least 
25-30 kt winds in the southeastern quadrant, with some higher 
tropical-storm-force vectors flagged as marginal. Based on these 
data and the latest satellite estimates, the initial intensity is 
lowered to 35 kt. This could be generous given the current lack of 
convection, but another Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 
scheduled to investigate the storm this evening.
 
The last few aircraft fixes and earlier ASCAT data indicated the 
center of Karl was not moving very much. Although the long-term 
motion is estimated at 195/4 kt, the near-term motion appears to be 
more of a west-southwestward drift. The shallow cyclone is expected 
to move generally southwestward during the next day or so as it 
becomes steered by a low-level ridge to the north. More of the 
latest track models show the center of Karl moving slower and more 
southwestward across the Bay of Campeche on Saturday, and so the NHC 
forecast has been adjusted westward from the previous track. Karl 
will likely struggle to generate more organized convection in the 
near term given the persistent shear and lack of mid-level moisture 
in its environment. Therefore, the NHC forecast now shows Karl 
weakening to a depression by early Saturday and degenerating into a 
post-tropical remnant low in 24 h, when it is near the coast of 
southern Mexico. Dissipation should occur soon thereafter due to 
the increased likelihood of land interaction.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall associated with Karl could produce flash flooding,
with mudslides in areas of higher terrain, across portions of
Veracruz, Tabasco, Chiapas and Oaxaca states in Mexico.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions, especially in gusts, are expected to
within a portion of the warning area in southern Mexico this
evening.
