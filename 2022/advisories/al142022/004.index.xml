eastward to Frontera.  The Tropical Storm Watch from Cabo Rojo to
Tuxpan has been discontinued.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Tuxpan to Frontera
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in southeastern Mexico should monitor the
progress of this system. Additional watches or warnings may be
required for portions of the coast of Mexico later today or tonight.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Karl was 
located near latitude 21.7 North, longitude 94.7 West. Karl is 
moving toward the north near 3 mph (6 km/h) and this motion is 
expected to continue through today.  A slow drift to the south and 
south-southeast is expected to begin this evening and a faster 
generally southward motion is forecast by Thursday morning.  On the 
forecast track, Karl will be approaching the coast of Mexico within 
the watch area by Friday.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft support
maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (70 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Little change in strength is forecast during the next 36 hours 
followed by slight weakening before landfall.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Karl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Karl is expected to produce 3 to 7 inches of rain, with
local maxima up to 12 inches, across portions of Veracruz and
Tabasco states in Mexico through Friday night. Rainfall amounts of 2
to 4 inches, with local maxima up to 6 inches, is also expected
across portions of Chiapas. Flash flooding with mudslides in higher
terrain is possible.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Mexican
coastline in the watch area starting Friday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Karl are expected to affect the Mexican
coastline for the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Karl Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142022
1000 AM CDT Wed Oct 12 2022
 
Despite the ragged satellite presentation, Karl has slightly 
strengthened this morning.  An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft investigating the storm found SFMR wind speeds of 37 kt 
and a decreased extrapolated minimum central pressure.  Given these 
data, the initial intensity was raised to 40 kt on the earlier 
intermediate advisory, and it remains at that value for now. 

Karl is slowly moving northward at about 3 kt.  A general northward 
motion is forecast for the next 12 hours.  Thereafter, a building 
ridge over northern Mexico is expected to steer Karl generally 
southward until it makes landfall between 60-72 h.  The model 
guidance has continued to shift eastward and shows Karl making the 
hairpin turn to the right, instead of left as shown in earlier 
cycles.  The official track forecast has been shifted rather 
significantly to the east in order to remain within the model 
guidance envelope.  The NHC track, however, is on the westernmost 
edge of the envelope, and should the guidance continue to shift 
eastward, further adjustments may be needed in future advisories.  
The Tropical Storm Watch has been extended eastward to Frontera, 
Mexico to account for the shift in the track forecast.

Based on the satellite appearance, the deep-layer vertical wind 
shear over Karl seems to be increasing.  Global model guidance 
suggests the shear will continue to increase and possible force 
dry mid-level humidities located upshear into the circulation.  
Therefore, the official intensity forecast no longer shows 
additional strengthening and instead holds Karl at 40 kt for the 
next day or so followed by slight weakening before landfall.  The 
cyclone is expected to rapidly decay and dissipate once it moves 
inland.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall could produce instances of flash flooding, with
mudslides in areas of higher terrain, across portions of Veracruz
and Tabasco states in Mexico.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in
Mexico starting on Thursday night or Friday.
