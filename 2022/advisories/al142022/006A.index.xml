SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Tuxpan to Frontera
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in southeastern Mexico should monitor the
progress of this system. Additional watches or warnings may be
required for portions of the coast of Mexico later tonight or on
Thursday.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Karl was 
located by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near 
latitude 22.4 North, longitude 94.2 West. Karl is moving toward the 
north-northeast near 3 mph (6 km/h).  The tropical storm is forecast 
to move little overnight, but a slow motion to the south-southeast 
is expected to begin by Thursday morning.  A faster generally 
southward motion is forecast by late Thursday, and that motion 
should continue through Friday night.  On the forecast track, Karl 
will approach the coast of Mexico within the watch area on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some slight strengthening is possible tonight, followed by
gradual weakening until landfall.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
Data from the Air Force Reserve reconnaissance mission indicate 
that the minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Karl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Karl is expected to produce 3 to 7 inches of rain, with
local maxima up to 12 inches, across portions of Veracruz and
Tabasco states in Mexico through Friday night. Rainfall amounts of 2
to 4 inches, with local maxima up to 6 inches, are also expected
across portions of Chiapas. Flash flooding with mudslides in higher
terrain is possible.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Mexican
coastline in the watch area starting Friday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Karl are expected to affect the Mexican
coastline for the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Karl Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142022
400 PM CDT Wed Oct 12 2022
 
The overall satellite presentation of Karl has improved since early 
this morning, but the system is being affected by moderate 
westerly shear.  The center is located near the western edge of a 
persistent cluster of convection that has cloud top temperatures of 
around -80C. As mentioned in the earlier Special Advisory, an Air 
Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft measured a peak 850-mb 
flight level wind of 58 kt and SFMR winds of around 50 kt as it 
exited the eastern portion of the storm.  There has been little 
overall change in structure since the plane departed, so the initial 
intensity is held at 50 kt.  Another reconnaissance mission into the 
storm is scheduled for this evening. 
 
Karl has continued to move northward, but its poleward progress 
is forecast to end very soon.  A ridge building over northern 
Mexico is forecast to start steering the cyclone generally 
southward later tonight or early Thursday.  A southward motion 
should then continue, and this motion is expected to bring 
the center near the southern coast of Bay of Campeche on Friday. 
The 1200 UTC dynamical model guidance suite is in slightly better 
agreement, but it was once again east of the previous NHC advisory. 
Another fairly significant eastward shift was required, but the 
latest forecast is now closer to the consensus aids as well as 
a blend of the GFS and ECMWF models. 

Karl is located over warm water but within an area of moderate 
westerly wind shear.  The shear is forecast to increase slightly, 
however some additional slight strengthening is possible in the 
short term.  After that, the shear and slightly lower mid-level 
humidity is expected to cause gradual weakening before Karl reaches 
the coast of Mexico.  After landfall, rapid weakening and 
dissipation should occur.  The NHC wind speed forecast is slightly 
higher than before, and it is not much different than the latest 
ICON and HCCA consensus aids. 

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall could produce instances of flash flooding, with
mudslides in areas of higher terrain, across portions of Veracruz
and Tabasco states in Mexico.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in
Mexico beginning on Friday.
