DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Karl was 
located near latitude 21.2 North, longitude 93.7 West. Karl is 
moving toward the south-southeast near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this 
general motion should continue through tonight. Karl is expected to 
turn southward or south-southwestward over the Bay of Campeche on 
Friday, and this motion should continue through early Saturday. On 
the forecast track, the center of Karl should reach the coasts of 
Tabasco or Veracruz states in Mexico within the warning area late 
Friday night or early Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Little change in strength is forecast during the next day or so 
before Karl reaches the Bay of Campeche coast of Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Reserve
reconnaissance aircraft data is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Karl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Karl is expected to produce 3 to 7 inches of rain, with
local maxima up to 12 inches, across portions of Veracruz, Tabasco,
and northern Chiapas and Oaxaca states in Mexico from Friday into
Sunday morning. These rains could produce flash flooding, along
with mudslides, in higher terrain.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin within
portions of the tropical storm warning area by late Friday or
Friday night.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Karl are expected to affect the Mexican
coastline for the next few days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Karl Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142022
1000 AM CDT Thu Oct 13 2022
 
A burst of deep convection has developed over the southeastern 
portion of Karl's circulation since the previous advisory. Data from 
an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft and NOAA buoy 42055 
indicate that the low-level center of the tropical cyclone is 
located near the northeastern edge of that convection due to 
northwesterly vertical wind shear.  Although the aircraft has only 
measured flight-level and SFMR winds to support an intensity of 
around 40 kt, the advisory wind speed is maintained at 45 kt due to 
the recent increase in convection. Also, this gives the plane more 
time to fully examine the cyclone, as it is possible the strongest 
winds have yet to be sampled. Continued northwesterly shear and the 
entrainment of dry mid-level air are likely to cause some weakening 
over the next day or so, but Karl is forecast to be a tropical storm 
when it nears the coast of Mexico.  After landfall, rapid weakening 
and dissipation of the low-level circulation is expected as the 
cyclone moves over the mountainous terrain of southern Mexico. 

Fixes from the aircraft show that Karl has finally begun its 
anticipated south-southeastward turn, and the initial motion 
estimate is 155/4 kt. A mid-level ridge to the northwest of Karl is 
expected to steer the storm south-southeastward through tonight. A 
southward to south-southwestward motion is forecast on Friday which 
should bring the center of Karl to the Bay of Campeche coast Friday 
night or Saturday.  The guidance envelope has moved slightly 
eastward this cycle, and the NHC track forecast has been adjusted in 
that direction.  There is still some spread in the models as to how 
fast Karl will move southward, which results in some timing 
differences regarding landfall in Mexico.  The official forecast is 
close to the GFEX and the other consensus aids to account for that. 

Based on the latest forecast, the government of Mexico has issued a 
Tropical Storm Warning for a portion of the coast of the Bay of 
Campeche. 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall associated with Karl could produce flash flooding, 
with mudslides in areas of higher terrain, across portions of 
Veracruz, Tabasco, Chiapas, and Oaxaca states in Mexico.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin within a portion 
of the warning area in Mexico by late Friday.
