An area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms located several <br/>
hundred miles south of the Cabo Verde Islands is associated <br/>
with a tropical wave.  Environmental conditions appear marginally <br/>
conducive for some gradual development during the next few days <br/>
while the system moves westward and then west-northwestward at <br/>
about 10 mph.  However, the disturbance is expected to move into a <br/>
less favorable area of stronger upper-level winds by early next <br/>
week.<br/>

None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Alvarado to Sabancuy
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within
24 to 36 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Karl was
located near latitude 20.2 North, longitude 92.4 West. Karl is
moving toward the southeast near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this general
motion should continue through this morning. Karl is expected to
turn southward or south-southwestward over the Bay of Campeche
later today, and this motion should continue through early
Saturday. On the forecast track, the center of Karl should reach
the coast of southern Mexico late tonight or early Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Little change in strength is expected before the 
center of Karl reaches the coast. Steady weakening is expected 
after the storm crosses the coastline, and the system is forecast 
to dissipate over southern Mexico by Saturday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.  A Mexican Navy station at Cayo Arcas recently 
reported sustained winds of 34 mph (55 km/h) and a wind gust of   
54 mph (86 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches). 
The station at Cayo Arcas recently reported a pressure of 1005.2 mb 
(29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Karl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Karl is expected to produce 2 to 5 inches of rain, with
local maxima up to 10 inches, across portions of Veracruz, Tabasco,
and northern Chiapas and Oaxaca states in Mexico through Sunday
morning. These rains can produce flash flooding, along with
mudslides, in higher terrain.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin within
portions of the tropical storm warning area by late today or
tonight.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Karl are expected to affect the Mexican
coastline for the next couple of days. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 AM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

Tropical Storm Karl Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142022
400 AM CDT Fri Oct 14 2022

Satellite imagery indicates that Karl remains disorganized this 
morning, with the low-level center at the northwestern edge of a 
newly-formed convective burst.  Recent scatterometer data and 
earlier data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
did not conclusively indicate any tropical-storm force winds in the 
system.  However, the central pressure was near 1001 mb, and based 
on likely undersampling of the winds the initial intensity is set 
at 35 kt.

The initial motion is southeastward or 140/5 kt. Karl should turn 
southward later today and then south-southwestward by tonight as 
the system reaches the periphery of a mid-level ridge over 
west-central Mexico. This south-southwestward motion is expected to 
continue until Karl dissipates over Mexico between 36-48 h.  While 
the forecast track follows the consensus models and has not changed 
much from the previous advisory, it should be noted that the GFS is 
an outlier in that it turns a weak and vertically shallow Karl more 
westward and keeps it offshore through 48 h.  
 
Moderate west-northwesterly shear, dry air entrainment, and 
upper-level convergence affecting Karl should continue through 
landfall.  Thus, little change in strength is likely before 
landfall, although it cannot be ruled out that Karl could weaken to 
a depression before reaching the coast.  After landfall, the 
cyclone should quickly weaken and dissipate between 36-48 h.  Even, 
if the cyclone stays over water longer as suggested by the GFS, the 
generally hostile environment should not allow strengthening.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall associated with Karl could produce instances of 
flash flooding, with mudslides in areas of higher terrain, across 
portions of Veracruz, Tabasco, Chiapas and Oaxaca states in Mexico.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin within a portion
of the warning area in southern Mexico by late today or tonight.
