For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Karl was
located near latitude 22.0 North, longitude 94.5 West. Karl is
moving toward the north near 3 mph (6 km/h) and this motion is
expected to continue through today.  A slow motion to the south and
south-southeast is expected to begin this evening and a faster
generally southward motion is forecast by Thursday morning.  On the
forecast track, Karl will be approaching the coast of Mexico within
the watch area by Friday.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft support an 
increase to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. Little change 
in strength is forecast overnight followed by gradual weakening 
until landfall.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Karl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Karl is expected to produce 3 to 7 inches of rain, with
local maxima up to 12 inches, across portions of Veracruz and
Tabasco states in Mexico through Friday night. Rainfall amounts of 2
to 4 inches, with local maxima up to 6 inches, is also expected
across portions of Chiapas. Flash flooding with mudslides in higher
terrain is possible.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Mexican
coastline in the watch area starting Friday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Karl are expected to affect the Mexican
coastline for the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Karl Special Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142022
100 PM CDT Wed Oct 12 2022
 
An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigating Karl 
found believable SFMR wind speeds between 48-52 kt east of the 
center.  Based on these observations, the initial intensity is 
increased to 50 kt.  The near-term intensity forecast has been 
raised to account for the higher initial intensity.  The reasoning 
for the intensity forecast has not changed from the earlier 
advisory.  Karl is still expected to gradually weaken until 
making landfall in 60-72 h.  

The official track forecast has been adjusted slightly eastward at 
12 and 24 hours based on its recent motion and now reflects a 
hairpin turn to the right that should be complete in about 24 hours. 
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall could produce instances of flash flooding, with
mudslides in areas of higher terrain, across portions of Veracruz
and Tabasco states in Mexico.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in
Mexico starting on Thursday night or Friday.
