DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Karl was 
located near latitude 21.5 North, longitude 94.8 West. Karl is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this 
motion is expected to continue through today.  A slow drift to the 
west and west-southwest is expected to begin later this morning and 
a somewhat faster motion toward the south-southwest is forecast by 
Thursday morning.  On the forecast track, Karl will be approaching 
the coast of Mexico within the watch area by Thursday night.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft support 
maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (70 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Additional strengthening is expected for the next day or so, 
followed by gradual weakening on Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.64 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Karl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Karl is expected to produce 3 to 7 inches, with local 
maxima up to 12 inches of rain across portions of Veracruz and 
Tabasco states in Mexico through Friday night.  Flash flooding with 
mudslides in higher terrain is possible.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Mexican
coastline in the watch area starting Thursday night.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Karl are expected to affect the Mexican
coastline for the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Karl Forecast Discussion Number 3</title>

Tropical Storm Karl Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142022
400 AM CDT Wed Oct 12 2022

Karl has not changed much in organization over the past several 
hours.  The central convection is currently minimal, with the 
primary convection occurring in bands somewhat removed from the 
center in the eastern semicircle.  NOAA buoy 42055 located to the 
northeast of the center has reported 1-min average winds of up to  
33 kt, and based on this plus a satellite intensity estimate from 
TAFB, the initial intensity remains 35 kt.

The initial motion is 340/5 kt.  A general north-northwestward 
motion is expected to continue through today.  After that, a ridge 
of high pressure is forecast to build to the northwest of Karl over 
northern Mexico.  The flow around the southeastern flank of this 
anticyclone is expected to cause Karl to make a left hairpin turn 
and move southward to south-southwestward by 36-48 h.  The latest 
track guidance has shifted eastward from the previous runs, with 
several models now showing a right hairpin turn and a east of south 
motion toward the coast of Mexico.  The new forecast track is 
shifted eastward from the previous forecast, but lies to the west of 
the current consensus models.  If the models do not shift back 
westward, additional eastward adjustments may be necessary later 
today.
 
Karl is currently located within an environment of light to moderate 
southwesterly shear and over warm sea surface temperatures.  This 
should allow some strengthening through the next 24 h.  After that 
time, increasing northwesterly shear and decreasing mid-level 
relative humidity are likely to cause some weakening before 
landfall. After Karl moves onshore, rapid decay is expected due to 
the mountainous terrain, and Karl is likely to dissipate just after 
72 h.  The new intensity forecast has only minor adjustments from 
the previous forecast and is on the high side of the intensity 
guidance.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall could produce instances of flash flooding, with 
mudslides in areas of higher terrain, across portions of Veracruz 
and Tabasco states in Mexico.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in 
Mexico starting on Thursday night.
