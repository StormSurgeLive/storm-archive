--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Tuxpan to Frontera
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in southeastern Mexico should monitor the
progress of this system.  Additional watches or warnings may be
required for portions of the coast of Mexico later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Karl was 
located near latitude 22.5 North, longitude 94.3 West.  Karl is 
nearly stationary currently.  A slow motion toward the southeast 
should begin later today, with Karl then expected to turn southward 
over the Bay of Campeche on Friday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Karl should reach the coasts of Tabasco or Veracruz states 
in Mexico Friday night or early Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Little change in strength is expected today, but Karl should 
gradually lose some strength on Friday while it approaches the Bay 
of Campeche coast of Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The latest minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force 
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Karl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Karl is expected to produce 3 to 7 inches of rain, with
local maxima up to 12 inches, across portions of Veracruz and
Tabasco states in Mexico from Friday into late Saturday.  Rainfall
amounts of 2 to 4 inches, with local maxima up to 6 inches, is
also expected across portions of Chiapas. These rains can produce
flash flooding, along with mudslides, in higher terrain.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible along the Mexican
coastline in the watch area starting late Friday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Karl are expected to affect the Mexican
coastline for the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

Tropical Storm Karl Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142022
1000 PM CDT Wed Oct 12 2022
 
Shear is having a greater influence on Karl this evening, with 
GOES-16 proxy-visible satellite imagery showing the low-level 
center now exposed to the northwest of a strong cluster of deep 
convection.  An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
investigating the storm found a similar peak 850-mb flight-level 
wind as earlier today (57 kt), but the SFMR readings have not been 
as high.  However, the strongest winds from earlier were directly 
east of the center, and the current aircraft has not sampled that 
area of the storm.  Plus, the central pressure was found to have 
fallen to 1000 mb during this mission.  Therefore, the initial 
intensity remains 50 kt.

The center does not look like it's moved very much during the past 
few hours, and that is confirmed by the aircraft fixes.  A mid-level 
high located over west-central Mexico and a large-amplitude 
mid-latitude trough over the United States are expected to impart 
northerly or northwesterly flow over Karl on Thursday, which should 
push the cyclone southward into the Bay of Campeche during the next 
couple of days.  The track guidance has again shifted eastward a bit 
on this cycle, but most of that is related to Karl's adjusted 
initial position and not with any particular change in forecast 
reasoning.  The updated NHC track is nudged eastward from the 
previous prediction, especially during the first 48 hours, and it 
shows Karl reaching the coasts of Tabasco or Veracruz states in 
Mexico by Saturday morning.

Deep-layer shear has increased to near 20 kt out of the west, and 
that magnitude is unlikely to decrease during the next few days.  
Even though ocean temperatures are about 28 degrees Celsius, a 
combination of the continued shear and surrounding dry mid-level 
air is expected to cause a gradual weakening trend while Karl 
approaches the Bay of Campeche coast of Mexico.  The NHC intensity 
forecast lies between the aggressive statistical-dynamical guidance 
(which show a little bit of strengthening) and the regional 
hurricane models and consensus aids (which show almost immediate 
weakening).  Fast weakening is expected after Karl reaches land, 
and the system is forecast to degenerate into a remnant low, or 
even dissipate, by late Saturday.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall associated with Karl could produce instances of 
flash flooding, with mudslides in areas of higher terrain, across 
portions of Veracruz, Tabasco, and Chiapas states in Mexico.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in
Mexico beginning late Friday.
