For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Karl was
located near latitude 20.9 North, longitude 93.5 West. Karl is
moving toward the south-southeast near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this
general motion should continue through tonight. Karl is expected to
turn southward or south-southwestward over the Bay of Campeche on
Friday, and this motion should continue through early Saturday. On
the forecast track, the center of Karl should reach the coasts of
Tabasco or Veracruz states in Mexico within the warning area late
Friday night or early Saturday.
 
Satellite-derived wind data indicate that maximum sustained winds 
are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. Little change in 
strength is forecast during the next day or so, followed by 
weakening as Karl moves inland over southern Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Karl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Karl is expected to produce 3 to 7 inches of rain, with
local maxima up to 10 inches, across portions of Veracruz, Tabasco,
and northern Chiapas and Oaxaca states in Mexico through Sunday
morning. These rains can produce flash flooding, along with
mudslides, in higher terrain.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin within
portions of the tropical storm warning area by late Friday or Friday
night.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Karl are expected to affect the Mexican
coastline for the next couple of days. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Karl Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142022
400 PM CDT Thu Oct 13 2022
 
The partially exposed center of Karl is evident in visible satellite
imagery this afternoon. The convective overcast has a sharp edge on
the northwestern side of the circulation, indicating that strong
west-northwesterly shear continues to impinge on the cyclone. Recent
satellite-derived wind data indicate that tropical-storm-force winds
are occurring mainly downshear of the center, where the deepest
convection has been ongoing today. Despite finding a slightly lower
minimum pressure than this morning, the Air Force Hurricane Hunters
reported flight-level winds and SFMR data early this afternoon that
support lowering the initial intensity to 40 kt for this advisory, 
which is consistent with recent ASCAT wind data.
 
The hostile environmental conditions that Karl is contending with 
are not expected to improve during the next day or so. Moderate 
west-northwesterly shear and continued intrusions of drier mid-level 
air should make it difficult for Karl's convective organization to 
improve much. The latest guidance suggests that little change in 
strength or even slight weakening is possible during the next 24-36 
hours as the storm moves toward the coast. The NHC track forecast 
still shows Karl moving onshore as a tropical storm on Friday night 
or early Saturday, then quickly weakening and eventually 
dissipating over the mountainous terrain of southern Mexico by 
Saturday night.
 
Karl is moving south-southeastward at a faster forward speed than 
earlier today (155/6 kt). This general motion should continue 
through tonight, followed by a southward to south-southwestward 
motion on Friday as Karl moves around the eastern periphery of a 
mid-level ridge over west-central Mexico. The NHC track forecast has 
once again been adjusted slightly eastward in the direction of the 
latest multi-model consensus aids. There are still some along-track 
differences noted in the guidance, with the slower GFS and HWRF 
solutions moving Karl inland later than the rest of the global 
models. Following a consensus approach, the NHC forecast is somewhat 
faster than the previous one and shows Karl just inland by 36 h.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall associated with Karl could produce flash flooding,
with mudslides in areas of higher terrain, across portions of
Veracruz, Tabasco, Chiapas and Oaxaca states in Mexico.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin within a portion
of the warning area in southern Mexico by late Friday.
