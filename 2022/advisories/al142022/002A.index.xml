DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Karl was 
located near latitude 20.8 North, longitude 94.9 West. Karl is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this 
motion is expected to continue through today.  A turn to the west 
and west-southwest is expected this evening and a turn to the 
southwest is forecast by Thursday morning.  On the forecast track, 
Karl will be approaching the coast of Mexico within the watch area 
on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual strengthening is expected for the next day or so,
followed by gradual weakening on Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.  During the past few hours, NOAA buoy 42055 
located to the northeast of the center reported sustained winds of 
36 mph (57 km/h) and a wind gust of 40 mph (65 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Karl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/MIATCDAT4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Karl is expected to produce the following rainfall
totals:
 
*Isthmus of Tehuantepec...3 to 6 inches, with local maximum up to
10 inches.

coastline for the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Karl Forecast Discussion Number 2</title>

Tropical Storm Karl Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142022
1000 PM CDT Tue Oct 11 2022
 
Bursts of deep convection have continued to develop this evening
near and to the northeast of the estimated center.  Data from the
earlier reconnaissance mission into Karl showed that the circulation
was elongated along a south-southeast to north-northwest axis with
at least a couple of swirls that are likely rotating around the
mean center.  The plane did not find flight-level or SFMR winds any
stronger than what was reported before the release of the previous
advisory. Therefore, the initial intensity is maintained at 35 kt,
which is slightly above the latest Dvorak satellite estimates.  The
next reconnaissance mission into Karl is scheduled for Wednesday
morning.
 
Karl is moving north-northwestward or 330/5 kt, and this general 
motion is expected to continue through Wednesday.  After that time, 
a ridge of high pressure is forecast to build to the northwest of 
Karl over northern Mexico.  The flow around the southeastern flank 
of that anticyclone is expected to cause Karl to turn southwestward
Wednesday night.  This motion should then bring the cyclone near the
coast of Mexico within the watch area on Thursday.  The latest
dynamical model guidance depicts a sharper turn Wednesday night and
the official forecast was adjusted southward, and a bit faster than
the previous forecast at 36 h and beyond.  This southward
adjustment required the government of Mexico to extend the Tropical
Storm Watch southward to Roca Partida.  The new NHC track forecast
is close to the simple consensus aids and is also in good
agreement with the ECMWF model.
 
Karl is currently located within an environment of generally light 
southwesterly shear and over warm sea surface temperatures.  This 
should allow some strengthening tonight or on Wednesday.  After that 
time, increasing northwesterly shear and decreasing mid-level 
relative humidity are likely to cause some weakening before 
landfall. After Karl moves onshore, rapid decay is expected due to 
the mountainous terrain, and Karl is likely to dissipate in around 
72 hours.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall could produce flash flooding in the Isthmus of
Tehuantepec and in the southern Sierra Madre Oriental mountains and
adjacent coastal areas with possible mudslides in areas of higher
terrain.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in
Mexico starting Thursday.
