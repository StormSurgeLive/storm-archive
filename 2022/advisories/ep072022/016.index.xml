<title>Hurricane Frank Forecast Discussion Number 16</title>

Hurricane Frank Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
900 PM MDT Fri Jul 29 2022
 
Frank is on a strengthening trend. Satellite images show that deep
convection has become more symmetric around the center, and there
have been hints of an eye forming. Although banding features have
become well established, microwave data indicate that a well-defined
inner has not yet developed. The latest satellite intensity
estimates range from 60 to 77 kt, and based on that data and the
improvement in the system's structure, the initial intensity is
increased to 70 kt. The minimum pressure has been set at 983 mb.
This makes Frank the sixth hurricane of the 2022 eastern North
Pacific season.
 
Over the past 12 hours, Frank has been moving west-northwestward at 
9 kt. A turn to the northwest is expected on Saturday, and that 
motion is forecast to continue during the next several days as the 
hurricane moves toward a weakness in the subtropical ridge. The NHC 
track forecast is a little to the left of the previous one, 
partially due to an adjustment of the initial position in that 
direction. This forecast lies close to the multi-model consensus 
TVCE from 12 to 72 hours, but is left of that aid beyond that, 
leaning toward the GFS and ECMWF models.

Frank is expected to remain in near ideal conditions of very low 
wind shear, warm waters, and a moist airmass for another 24-36 
hours. In fact, the SHIPS Rapid Intensification Indices show a 
greater than 60 percent chance that Frank could rapidly intensify 
during that period. The NHC intensity forecast during that time has 
been adjusted upward and lies a little above the consensus aids 
given the favorable environment and improving storm structure. 
However, by late Sunday, Frank will be moving over much cooler 
waters and into a progressively drier airmass, which should cause 
steady weakening. Although the system will be moving over quite cool 
waters in a few days, the GFS model suggests that it could still be 
producing some deep convection enhanced by a nearby trough, which 
might delay its transition into a remnant low.   
 
It again should be noted that Frank and Tropical Storm Georgette
are expected to come close enough to one another for some
interaction. Frank will be the larger and dominant system during
this interaction, and the smaller and weaker Georgette will have
little impact on the track or intensity of Frank.

Tropical Storm Georgette Advisory Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
200 PM PDT Fri Jul 29 2022
 
...GEORGETTE MOVING WEST-SOUTHWESTWARD OVER THE TROPICAL EASTERN
PACIFIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM PDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.7N 124.0W
ABOUT 1080 MI...1740 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WSW OR 255 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM PDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Georgette was
located near latitude 14.7 North, longitude 124.0 West. Georgette is
moving toward the west-southwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A 
west-southwest motion at a gradually slower pace is expected during 
the next few of days, followed by a turn toward the northeast by 
early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Although little change in strength is forecast
during the couple of days, some fluctuations in intensity are
possible in the short term due to Georgette's compact size.  Slow 
weakening is forecast to commence by the end of the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM PDT.

Tropical Storm Georgette Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
200 PM PDT Fri Jul 29 2022
 
Conventional satellite imagery shows that tiny Georgette has become
less organized during the past few hours.  Although a recent SSMIS 
overpass indicated that the inner core and eye-like feature have 
remained intact, the deep convection in the east semi-circle has 
thinned quite a bit, while the previously noted banding feature in 
the north portion of the cyclone has become fragmented.  All of 
this is more than likely due to some increase in the northeasterly 
shear magnitude.  The satellite subjective intensity estimates have 
decreased, and this advisory's initial intensity is set at 45 kt.
 
The moderate deep-layer shear should persist during the next several 
days; some increase in the magnitude of the inhibiting upper wind 
component is forecast beyond 48 hours.  This, along with a dry 
thermodynamic surrounding environment (45 to 50 percent RH in the 
mid-portions of the atmosphere) should induce slow weakening through 
the forecast period.  There's still some uncertainty as to how long 
Georgette will survive.  The GFS, however, is the only global model 
showing Georgette as a post-tropical cyclone or remnant low beyond 
day 4.  Therefore, the intensity forecast is an update of the 
previous one and is similar to the HCCA and IVCN intensity consensus 
forecasts.
 
Georgette's initial motion is estimated to be west-southwestward, or 
255/10 kt.  The forecast philosophy is unchanged.  An east-northeast 
to a west-southwest-oriented mid-tropospheric ridge should cause the 
cyclone to move generally west-southwestward through the 48-hour 
period.  Beyond mid-period, Georgette is expected slow its forward 
motion, turn northwestward, and then northeastward within the 
southeastern peripheral flow of larger and stronger Frank.  The NHC 
forecast has changed little from this morning's advisory and lies 
close to the HFIP Corrected Consensus aid.
