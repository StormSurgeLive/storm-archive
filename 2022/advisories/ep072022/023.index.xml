Hurricane Frank Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
200 PM PDT Sun Jul 31 2022
 
The satellite presentation of Frank has gradually degraded today 
with an erosion of deep convection over the western semicircle and 
a general warming of cloud top temperatures elsewhere. An eye was 
still evident in earlier microwave imagery, but it was open to the 
south. Subjective Dvorak T-numbers have decreased, and a blend of 
the latest CI-numbers yields an initial wind speed estimate of 70 
kt. 
 
Frank will be moving over progressively cooler waters and into a 
more stable air mass over the next several days.  As a result, 
steady weakening should continue with Frank becoming a 
post-tropical cyclone late Tuesday.  This is consistent with the GFS 
and ECMWF simulated satellite imagery which show little, if any, 
remaining deep convection by that time. The official forecast calls 
for the remnant low to dissipate by the end of the period which is 
also supported by the dynamical model guidance.  

Frank is moving northwestward or 320/10 kt. There is no change to 
the track forecast reasoning.  The cyclone should continue 
northwestward around the western periphery of a mid-level ridge 
during the next couple of days.  Once the cyclone becomes weaker 
and more vertically shallow, a slower northward motion is 
predicted. The new NHC track forecast is essentially an update 
of the previous advisory, and it remains near the center of the 
guidance envelope.

Tropical Depression Georgette Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
200 PM PDT Sun Jul 31 2022
 
There has been persistent deep convection near the estimated center 
of Georgette for the past several hours, likely due to the 
convective diurnal maximum.  However, a fortuitous ASCAT-B overpass 
that occurred at 1844 UTC over the cyclone indicates that the system 
has weakened into a 30 kt tropical depression.  Thus, the pulsing 
nature of the convection associated with the cyclone over the past 
day or so has appeared to have taken its toll.
 
Georgette has been moving slowly west-southwestward today, or 255/4 
kt, to the south of a weak mid-tropospheric ridge.  There is no 
change to the track reasoning, and model guidance remains in 
generally good agreement that the portion of the ridge to the north 
of the cyclone should weaken through early this week as Hurricane 
Frank passes well to the north.  As a result, Georgette should 
continue to move slowly west or west-southwest through tonight and 
begin drifting northward early this week toward the temporary 
weakness in the ridge carved out by Frank.  By mid-week, the ridge 
is forecast to re-strengthen, forcing the cyclone on a more westward 
track.  The latest NHC forecast track is near the previous one, and 
is close to the TVCE consensus.
 
Strong easterly shear caused by the outflow from the large 
circulation of Frank to the northeast of Georgette should prevent 
deep convection from persisting near the center of the cyclone long 
enough to support much reintensification. By late in the forecast 
period, the system is forecast to reach cooler waters and become 
surrounded by a drier airmass. This should cause further weakening, 
and Georgette is expected to become a remnant low by day 5, if not 
sooner. The official NHC intensity forecast no longer shows that 
Georgette will restrengthen into a tropical storm. However, it is 
possible some minor fluctuations in intensity could occur through 
midweek.
