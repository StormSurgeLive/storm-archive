<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Frank, located about 650 miles west-southwest of Punta <br/>
Eugenia, Mexico, and on Tropical Depression Georgette, located more <br/>
than 1500 miles west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja <br/>
California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure is expected to form a few hundred miles <br/>
south of eastern Mexico in a couple of days. Environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to be favorable for gradual development <br/>
thereafter, and a tropical depression could form this weekend. <br/>
This system is forecast to move west-northwestward, remaining well <br/>
offshore of the coast of southern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Well Southwest of Southwestern Mexico:<br/>
Another area of low pressure could form several hundred miles <br/>
south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula <br/>
later this week. Some development of this system is possible by the <br/>
end of this week while it moves westward over the open waters of <br/>
the eastern Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Frank Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
800 AM PDT Tue Aug 02 2022

Organized deep convection associated with Frank ceased overnight, 
and the tropical storm should become post-tropical very soon. The 
weakening cyclone is moving northwest near 10 kt, and should 
gradually bend toward the north over the next 36 h, then 
north-northeast by Thursday, steered primarily by the low-level 
flow. The latest TAFB Dvorak Current Intensity estimate is 35 kt, so 
the initial intensity is set at that value. Continued weakening 
will occur over the next few days while Frank gradually spins down 
over cold water with little or no convection to sustain it. 
Dissipation is forecast by nearly all of the dynamical models near 
or just after 60 h. No changes of note were made to the NHC track or 
intensity forecasts, both of which are near the model consensus 
aids.

<title>Tropical Depression Georgette Forecast Discussion Number 25</title>

Tropical Depression Georgette Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
800 AM PDT Tue Aug 02 2022
 
Convection has continued to pulse near Georgette's circulation
over the past 12 to 24 hours, but there has been little, if any,
organization to the thunderstorm activity during that time. In
fact, the Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB) provided its last
Dvorak T1.0 on the system at 1800 UTC yesterday, indicating the 
lack of organization since that time.  The initial intensity is set 
at a possibly generous 30 kt, which is based on earlier ASCAT data 
that showed peak winds just above 25 kt.
 
Given the lack of organization it now appears more likely that 
Georgette will succumb to the marginal environment that is embedded 
within.  Moderate northeasterly shear, SSTs cooling to around 26C 
along the forecast track, and dry mid-level humidity is expected
to result in additional weakening and degeneration of the system to
a remnant low within the next day or two. This could occur as soon
as later today, if organized deep convection does not return.
 
Georgette has made its much anticipated northeastward turn, with the 
latest motion estimated at 040/6 kt.  Low- to mid-level 
southwesterly flow to the south of Frank should continue to steer 
Georgette northeastward during the next 12 to 24 hours.  After that 
time, a low-level ridge is forecast to build to the north of the 
cyclone, which will cause Georgette to turn back sharply westward.  
The latest NHC track forecast has been adjusted slightly east of the 
previous forecast to be in better agreement with the latest track 
model envelope.
