Hurricane Frank Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
800 AM PDT Sat Jul 30 2022

Frank has changed little in organization since the last advisory.  
The hurricane continues to produce bands of cold deep convection 
near the center, but an eye is not currently apparent.  Since the 
various satellite intensity estimates are also basically unchanged, 
the initial intensity remains set at 80 kt.  The hurricane 
continues to have excellent cirrus outflow in all directions 
except the southwest.

Frank is running out of time to intensify, as it is now passing 
over the 28C sea surface temperature isotherm and will reach waters 
of 26C in about 24 h.  The guidance indicates that some 
strengthening is possible during the next 12 h, although the chances 
of rapid intensification have diminished.  Thus, the intensity 
forecast now calls for a 90-kt peak intensity in 12 h, which is at 
the upper edge of the guidance.  After 24 h, the cyclone should 
move over progressively cooler water, reaching 21C SSTs in about  
96 h.  This should lead to a steady weakening, and Frank is 
expected to degenerate to a remnant low by 96 h.  It should be noted 
that near the end of the forecast period, the GFS model shows some
rejuvenation of convection as the post-tropical cyclone interacts
with an upper-level trough to its northwest.

Frank continues moving northwestward or 310/10 kt, and there is 
little change to the track forecast scenario.  The cyclone should
continue on a northwestward track for most of the forecast period
while it moves along the southwestern periphery of a large
mid-level ridge toward a developing break in the ridge west of 
California. The track guidance shifted a little to the north and 
east at 96 and 120 h, and thus the new forecast track is also 
nudged in that direction at those times.  Otherwise, it is an 
update of the previous forecast and lies close to the consensus 
models.

SUMMARY OF 800 AM PDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.0N 126.8W
ABOUT 1265 MI...2035 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WSW OR 255 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM PDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Georgette was
located near latitude 14.0 North, longitude 126.8 West. Georgette is
moving toward the west-southwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). The storm is 
forecast to move on a similar heading at a slower forward speed for 
the next day or so. After that, Georgette's forward movement should 
slow further, resulting in a meandering motion through the remainder 
of the weekend.  A turn toward the northeast is expected by early 
next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next day or so, 
with gradual weakening anticipated after that.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM PDT.

Tropical Storm Georgette Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
200 AM PDT Sat Jul 30 2022

Georgette continues to be affected by northeasterly vertical shear 
that is displacing much of its deep convection to the southwest of 
the estimated center.  Based on a blend of subjective and objective 
Dvorak estimates from SAB, TAFB, and UW-CIMSS, the advisory 
intensity remains at 45 kt.

The tropical cyclone has continued on its west-southwestward track 
and is moving at about 255/9 kt.  A mid-level ridge just to the 
west of Hurricane Frank should continue to steer Georgette on a 
west-southwestward to westward course for the next day or so.  
Thereafter, the system should become situated in a region of weak 
steering currents between the ridge and broad southwesterly flow to 
the south and southwest of Frank.  This will likely cause Georgette 
to move slowly and erratically during the next 2-3 days.  By 72 
hours, the weakening cyclone is expected to begin moving 
northeastward within the southwesterly low- to mid-level flow.  
Most of the track guidance has shifted westward in comparison to the 
earlier model runs, and the official forecast is somewhat west of 
the previous NHC prediction beyond 36 hours, but not quite as far 
west as the latest model consensus.  

East-northeasterly shear is forecast to prevail over Georgette 
during the next few days, and the low- to mid-level environment is 
expected to remain rather dry.  This, along with an increasing lack 
of low-level inflow due to the influence of Franks's circulation, 
should result in gradual weakening.  The official forecast is 
similar to the previous one and closely follows the latest HFIP 
Corrected Consensus Approach, HCCA, intensity guidance.
