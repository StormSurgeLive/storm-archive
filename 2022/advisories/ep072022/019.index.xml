Hurricane Frank Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
800 AM PDT Sat Jul 30 2022

Frank has changed little in organization since the last advisory.  
The hurricane continues to produce bands of cold deep convection 
near the center, but an eye is not currently apparent.  Since the 
various satellite intensity estimates are also basically unchanged, 
the initial intensity remains set at 80 kt.  The hurricane 
continues to have excellent cirrus outflow in all directions 
except the southwest.

Frank is running out of time to intensify, as it is now passing 
over the 28C sea surface temperature isotherm and will reach waters 
of 26C in about 24 h.  The guidance indicates that some 
strengthening is possible during the next 12 h, although the chances 
of rapid intensification have diminished.  Thus, the intensity 
forecast now calls for a 90-kt peak intensity in 12 h, which is at 
the upper edge of the guidance.  After 24 h, the cyclone should 
move over progressively cooler water, reaching 21C SSTs in about  
96 h.  This should lead to a steady weakening, and Frank is 
expected to degenerate to a remnant low by 96 h.  It should be noted 
that near the end of the forecast period, the GFS model shows some
rejuvenation of convection as the post-tropical cyclone interacts
with an upper-level trough to its northwest.

Frank continues moving northwestward or 310/10 kt, and there is 
little change to the track forecast scenario.  The cyclone should
continue on a northwestward track for most of the forecast period
while it moves along the southwestern periphery of a large
mid-level ridge toward a developing break in the ridge west of 
California. The track guidance shifted a little to the north and 
east at 96 and 120 h, and thus the new forecast track is also 
nudged in that direction at those times.  Otherwise, it is an 
update of the previous forecast and lies close to the consensus 
models.

SUMMARY OF 800 AM PDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.0N 126.8W
ABOUT 1265 MI...2035 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WSW OR 255 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM PDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Georgette was
located near latitude 14.0 North, longitude 126.8 West. Georgette is
moving toward the west-southwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). The storm is 
forecast to move on a similar heading at a slower forward speed for 
the next day or so. After that, Georgette's forward movement should 
slow further, resulting in a meandering motion through the remainder 
of the weekend.  A turn toward the northeast is expected by early 
next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next day or so, 
with gradual weakening anticipated after that.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM PDT.

Tropical Storm Georgette Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
800 AM PDT Sat Jul 30 2022
 
The structure of Georgette continues to show evidence of 
northeasterly shear, with most of the convective activity occurring 
southwest of the estimated center.  Persistent convection near the 
center of the storm, as well as subjective and objective Dvorak 
estimates from SAB, TAFB, and UW-CIMSS, continue to support an 
initial intensity of 45 kt, consistent with the prior advisory. 

The mid-level ridge to the west of Hurricane Frank continues to 
steer the tropical storm west-southwestward, with a current 
estimated motion of 255/9 kt. This motion is expected to continue 
during the day today, after which the steering currents are 
expected to weaken, resulting in a slower forward motion during the 
next couple days. By 72 hours, Georgette is expected to begin 
moving northeastward under the influence of southwesterly steering 
flow. The track guidance diverges significantly after 36 hours, 
with many of the consensus aids indicating a delayed turn toward 
the north or northeast compared to the previous official forecast. 
The official forecast track is shifted westward from the previous 
NHC forecast and represents a blend of the HCCA and the previous 
forecast. 

The combined influences of east-northeasterly vertical shear and 
the proximity to Hurricane Frank are expected to limit the 
intensification of Georgette during the next several days. The 
intensity is forecast to hold steady during the next day or so, 
with gradual weakening expected thereafter before dissipating after 
96 hours. The official intensity forecast is similar to the prior 
forecast and aligned with the consensus aids.
