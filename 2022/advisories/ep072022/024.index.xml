Hurricane Frank Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
800 PM PDT Sun Jul 31 2022

The hurricane is continuing to weaken as it moves over colder 
water, and the cloud tops temperatures associated with the cyclone 
are gradually warming.  The various objective and subjective 
satellite intensity estimates have nudged downward, and the initial 
intensity is reduced to 65 kt.

The cyclone will continue to move over colder water, reaching the 
21C sea surface temperature isotherm between 36-48 h.  Thus, steady 
weakening should continue, with Frank becoming a post-tropical 
cyclone between 48-60 h and dissipating completely before 120 h.  
The new intensity forecast follows the trend of the intensity 
guidance and has only minor adjustments from the previous forecast.
 
Frank is still moving northwestward or 320/10 kt, and while it 
sounds like a broken record there is no change to the track 
forecast reasoning.  The cyclone should continue northwestward 
around the western periphery of a mid-level ridge during the next 
couple of days.  Later in the forecast period, the steering 
currents should change some as cyclone should become more 
vertically shallow, and a slower northward motion is expected.  The 
new forecast track is again an update of the previous track and 
follows the consensus models.

Tropical Depression Georgette Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
200 PM PDT Sun Jul 31 2022
 
There has been persistent deep convection near the estimated center 
of Georgette for the past several hours, likely due to the 
convective diurnal maximum.  However, a fortuitous ASCAT-B overpass 
that occurred at 1844 UTC over the cyclone indicates that the system 
has weakened into a 30 kt tropical depression.  Thus, the pulsing 
nature of the convection associated with the cyclone over the past 
day or so has appeared to have taken its toll.
 
Georgette has been moving slowly west-southwestward today, or 255/4 
kt, to the south of a weak mid-tropospheric ridge.  There is no 
change to the track reasoning, and model guidance remains in 
generally good agreement that the portion of the ridge to the north 
of the cyclone should weaken through early this week as Hurricane 
Frank passes well to the north.  As a result, Georgette should 
continue to move slowly west or west-southwest through tonight and 
begin drifting northward early this week toward the temporary 
weakness in the ridge carved out by Frank.  By mid-week, the ridge 
is forecast to re-strengthen, forcing the cyclone on a more westward 
track.  The latest NHC forecast track is near the previous one, and 
is close to the TVCE consensus.
 
Strong easterly shear caused by the outflow from the large 
circulation of Frank to the northeast of Georgette should prevent 
deep convection from persisting near the center of the cyclone long 
enough to support much reintensification. By late in the forecast 
period, the system is forecast to reach cooler waters and become 
surrounded by a drier airmass. This should cause further weakening, 
and Georgette is expected to become a remnant low by day 5, if not 
sooner. The official NHC intensity forecast no longer shows that 
Georgette will restrengthen into a tropical storm. However, it is 
possible some minor fluctuations in intensity could occur through 
midweek.
