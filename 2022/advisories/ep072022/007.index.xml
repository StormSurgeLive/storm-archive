<title>Tropical Storm Frank Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Tropical Storm Frank Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
300 PM MDT Wed Jul 27 2022

While Frank continues to feel the effects of northeasterly vertical 
wind shear, the shear seem to have diminished a little and the 
convection has become a little more concentrated just southwest of 
the low-level center.  The various subjective and objective 
satellite intensity estimates are in the 35-45 kt range and have 
nudged a little upward since the last advisory.  Thus, the initial 
intensity is increased to 40 kt in best agreement with the CIMSS 
satellite consensus estimate.
 
The global models suggest that the current shear should ease over
the next 12-18 h and allow Frank to gradually strengthen.  Between
18-72 h, the shear is forecast to become light while the cyclone is
over 28-29C sea surface temperatures, and this environment could
allow for steady, and possibly rapid, intensification.  The 
intensity guidance now shows more strengthening than the runs 6 h 
ago, and based on this the first 96 h of the intensity forecast 
have been revised upward.  It should be noted that the new forecast 
peak intensity of 85 kt could be conservative, as the SHIPS, HFIP 
Corrected Consensus, HMON, and COAMPS-TC models all forecast a 
higher peak intensity.  After 72 h, the cyclone should move over 
cooler waters, and this should cause a steady weakening.
 
Frank is now moving westward with an initial motion of 280/9.  A 
subtropical ridge to the north of the cyclone should continue to 
steer Frank generally westward for the next 24-36 h, followed by a 
west-northwestward motion.  After 72 h, the cyclone is expected to
moved more northwestward toward a break in the ridge caused by by a
mid- to upper-level trough developing over the Pacific west of
California.  The new official forecast track is similar to the
previous track through 60 h, and then is again nudged a little to 
the north of the previous forecast.  The new forecast is again 
close to or a little south of the various consensus models.
 
It should be noted that Frank and Tropical Storm Georgette are 
likely to come close enough to one another to interact.  The global 
models still suggest that Frank will be the larger and dominant 
system during this interaction, and that Georgette will have only 
minor impacts on the track and intensity of Frank.

Tropical Depression Eight-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
900 AM MDT Wed Jul 27 2022
 
The area of low pressure we have been monitoring more than 500 miles
southwest of the Baja California peninsula has continued to become
better organized this morning. First light visible imagery shows
cold convective cloud tops near the estimated center that also
appear to be rotating cyclonically. While we haven't had any recent
C-band scatterometer passes near the center of this system, a
recent KU-band scatterometer showed plenty of non-rain contaminated
winds to help confirm that a closed circulation exists. Subjective
Dvorak classifications were up to T2.0/30-kt from TAFB and
T1.5/25-kt from SAB. A recently arriving SSMIS pass at 1159 UTC
also showed a well-defined curve band wrapping at least 75 percent
around the northwestern side of the system. All these data indicate
a new tropical depression has formed, and the initial intensity
will be set at 30 kt this advisory.
 
Currently the depression is moving westward at 275/6 kt. A large 
deep-layer ridge is situated north of the cyclone which should steer 
it on a general westward to west-southwestward heading over the next 
day or so. Afterwards, the larger circulation of Tropical Storm 
Frank is expected to get close enough to initiate binary interaction 
with the depression. The net result of this interaction is that the 
depression is likely to bend even more southward than the 
larger-scale steering flow would initially suggest, and there is 
some chance that Frank may capture the smaller depression. For now, 
the track forecast keeps Frank and TD Eight-E separate, showing a 
very slow west-northwestward motion towards the end of the forecast 
period. This track forecast is roughly follows the TVCE aid early 
on, but is slower later in the  forecast period due to uncertainty 
with interaction with Frank to the east. This initial track forecast 
is of low confidence.
 
The intensity forecast is also challenging and strongly related to
how much interaction this depression has with the larger circulation
of Frank. Assuming the depression remains separate, environmental
conditions only appear marginally favorable for intensification in
the short-term, with moderate easterly vertical wind shear, and
plenty of nearby dry air that could get ingested into the small
circulation at any time. For these reasons, the intensity forecast
only shows modest intensification over the next 24-48 hours and
caps the storm at 40 kt thereafter due to uncertainty in its future
evolution near Frank. This is roughly in line with the latest SHIPS
guidance, but is lower than the HCCA and other consensus intensity
aids which are biased by the larger and stronger wind field of
Frank later on in the forecast.
