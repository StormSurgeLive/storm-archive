Tropical Storm Frank Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
300 PM MDT Fri Jul 29 2022

Frank has become better organized during the past several hours, 
with increased convective banding close to the center and signs of 
a ragged eye forming.  However, the convection in the formative 
eyewall is still a bit sporadic, likely due to some continued dry 
air entrainment.  Satellite intensity estimates have increased to 
the 50-77 kt range, and recent ASCAT-B scatterometer data showed 
winds of at least 50 kt northeast of the center. Based on these 
data, the initial intensity is set at 60 kt.  The wind radii have 
been modified using the ASCAT-B data.

Frank will be in an environment of light vertical shear and over
sea surface temperatures of 28-29C for the next 24-36 h, and 
this combined with the increasing organization in the inner core 
favors continued strengthening.  The new intensity forecast calls 
for a peak intensity of 90 kt in 36 h, and this lies at the top of 
the intensity guidance.  However, the rapid intensification indices 
of the SHIPS model call for about a 65 percent chance of 25-30 kt 
of strengthening in just the next 24 h, so it is possible the 
current forecast is conservative.  After 36 h, Frank should move 
over progressively cooler SSTs, with the system reaching 21C water 
by 96 h.  This should cause steady to rapid weakening, and Frank is
forecast to become a remnant low by the end of the forecast period.
 
The initial motion is now 305/10 kt.  Frank is moving along the
southwest side of the subtropical ridge over northwestern Mexico,
and it should move generally northwestward during the forecast
period toward a developing break in the ridge west of California.
The track guidance remains in good agreement with this scenario and 
has again changed little since the previous advisory. Thus, the new 
forecast track is once again an update of the previous forecast.
 
It again should be noted that Frank and Tropical Storm Georgette
are expected to come close enough to one another for some 
interaction.  Frank will be the larger and dominant system during 
this interaction, and the smaller and weaker Georgette will have 
little impact on the track or intensity of Frank.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM PDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Georgette was
located near latitude 15.1 North, longitude 123.0 West. Georgette is
moving toward the west near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A west-southwest to
southwest motion at a gradually slower pace is expected during the
next few of days followed by a turn toward the northeast by early 
next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Although Little change in strength is forecast 
during the next few days, some fluctuations in intensity are 
possible in the short term due to Georgette's compact size.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM PDT.

Tropical Storm Georgette Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
800 AM PDT Fri Jul 29 2022

GOES-17 Proxy-Vis and enhanced IR imagery show that Georgette's 
cloud pattern has become more symmetric with colder -77C inner core 
cloud tops.  An earlier AMSR2 revealed an eye-like feature in the 
lower frequency band and a well-developed rain band in the north 
part of the cyclone.  The eye feature, however, was not evident in 
the infrared presentation.  Although the Dvorak subjective 
T-numbers from TAFB and SAB haven't changed; the initial intensity 
is increased to 50 kt in deference to the microwave image. 
 
The global models and the statistical intensity guidance indicate 
that the easterly shear will increase within 24 hours, causing 
Georgette to weaken slowly.  However, due to Georgette's compact 
size, intensity fluctuations are possible in the short term.  The 
latest GFS run shows that Georgette could hang on a little longer 
than the NHC forecast indicates, possibly as a post-tropical 
cyclone.  Therefore, adjusting the forecast may be deemed necessary 
to extend the cyclone's life in subsequent advisories.  The official 
forecast is very close to the HCCA and IVCN intensity aids.
 
Georgette's initial motion is estimated to be just a bit south of 
due west or 260/11 kt.  A mid-tropospheric ridge stretching 
east-northeast to west-southwest should steer the small cyclone 
west to west-southwestward during the next 48 hours.  Afterward, a 
reduction in forward speed along with a turn toward the northeast 
is expected in response to larger Frank weakening the ridge and 
disrupting the steering flow while passing to the northeast of 
Georgette.  Although the ECMWF global has been the best performer 
in the eastern Pacific this season with respect to forecast track, 
the model continues to initialize poorly the compact TC indicating 
a significantly weaker system while remaining the left tracker 
outlier.  The GFS, however, now has a more accurate depiction of 
the cyclone's size and vertical depth and shows a more direct 
response to Frank's larger wind field.  There still is quite a bit 
of uncertainty in Georgette's future track as evident by the larger 
than usual guidance spread, particularly after the northeast turn.  
Consequently, this is a low confidence forecast.  The NHC forecast 
is similar to the previous advisory through 48 hours, but has been 
adjusted to the left beyond that point to agree more with the HCCA 
and GEFS/EPS ensemble member solutions.
