<title>Tropical Storm Frank Forecast Discussion Number 25</title>

Tropical Storm Frank Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
200 AM PDT Mon Aug 01 2022

Frank has continued to weaken while moving over increasingly colder 
waters, and deep convection is becoming more fragmented and 
diminishing in depth.  Unflagged data from an ASCAT-C 
scatterometer pass at around 0500 UTC indicate that the maximum 
winds have decreased to just below hurricane force, so the advisory 
intensity is reduced to 60 kt.  This is also the mean of the latest 
Dvorak Current Intensity numbers from TAFB and SAB.

Since the system will be moving over even colder ocean waters of 
near 20 deg C by 48 hours, the cyclone is likely to degenerate into 
a post-tropical remnant low by that time, or sooner.  The official 
intensity forecast follows the latest model consensus, IVCN, 
prediction.  Post-tropical cyclone Frank is expected to dissipate by 
the end of the forecast period.

Frank remains on its northwestward course with the initial motion 
continuing near 320/10 kt.  There are no significant changes to the 
track forecast or reasoning.  The cyclone is expected to move along 
the southwestern and western periphery of a mid-level ridge 
associated with a strong high over the southwestern United States 
for the next several days. Late in the forecast period, Frank or 
its remnant should move generally northward in the low-level flow.  
The official track forecast is very close to the simple and 
corrected dynamical model consensus tracks.

Tropical Depression Georgette Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
800 PM PDT Sun Jul 31 2022
 
Almost all deep convection has collapsed near the center of
Georgette.  Last-light visible imagery showed an exposed low-level
circulation and satellite water vapor imagery indicates the
presence of dry air near the inner core of the storm.  Subjective 
Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB range between 35-25 
kt.  The initial intensity is held at 30 kt to represent a blend 
of the classifications.

Georgette is drifting westward at 3 kt, to the south of a weak 
mid-level ridge.  The tropical depression is expected to turn 
northward at a break in the ridge, though models disagree on the 
timing of the turn and this has created a large spread amongst the 
track guidance.  However, most models do show the ridge 
restrengthening by mid-week and steering Georgette westward to 
west-southward through the end of the forecast period.  The official 
track forecast is similar to the previous advisory track prediction 
and closest to the model consensus aid, TVCE.

Moderate-to-strong easterly vertical wind shear caused by the 
outflow from Frank is expected to continue over Georgette for the 
next couple of days.  This combined with the dry mid-tropospheric 
relative humidities around the cyclone will likely prevent 
Georgette from restrengthening.  The NHC intensity forecast shows 
Georgette maintaining tropical depression strength until day 4, when 
it is predicted to become a post-tropical remnant low.  Though, if 
deep convection does not reform near the center, this could happen 
even sooner.
