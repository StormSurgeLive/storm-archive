<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Frank, located about 675 miles west-southwest of Punta <br/>
Eugenia, Mexico, and on Tropical Depression Georgette, located about<br/>
1500 miles west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California <br/>
peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure is expected to form a few hundred miles <br/>
south of eastern Mexico in a couple of days. Environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to be favorable for gradual development <br/>
thereafter, and a tropical depression could form this weekend. <br/>
This system is forecast to move west-northwestward, remaining well <br/>
offshore of the coast of southern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Well Southwest of Southwestern Mexico:<br/>
Another area of low pressure could form several hundred miles <br/>
south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula <br/>
later this week. Some gradual development of this system is <br/>
possible by the end of this week while it moves westward over the <br/>
open waters of the eastern Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Post-Tropical Cyclone Frank Discussion Number  31
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
200 PM PDT Tue Aug 02 2022
 
Frank has failed to produce organized deep convection since last 
night, and the system has been reduced to a well-defined low-level 
cloud swirl over the open waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean. Since 
Frank no longer satisfies the criteria of a tropical cyclone, this 
will be the final NHC advisory on now post-tropical Frank.

The cyclone is expected to gradually turn northward during the next 
couple of days as it moves around the western periphery of a distant 
low-level ridge. Although Frank is believed to be still producing 
some 34-kt winds in its northeastern quadrant, weakening is expected 
through midweek as the cyclone continues to spin down over cool 
SSTs. The system is forecast to open into a trough and dissipate by 
early Friday. For additional information on the post-tropical 
cyclone please see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National 
Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 
KWBC, and on the web at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php

<title>Tropical Depression Georgette Forecast Discussion Number 25</title>

Tropical Depression Georgette Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
800 AM PDT Tue Aug 02 2022
 
Convection has continued to pulse near Georgette's circulation
over the past 12 to 24 hours, but there has been little, if any,
organization to the thunderstorm activity during that time. In
fact, the Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB) provided its last
Dvorak T1.0 on the system at 1800 UTC yesterday, indicating the 
lack of organization since that time.  The initial intensity is set 
at a possibly generous 30 kt, which is based on earlier ASCAT data 
that showed peak winds just above 25 kt.
 
Given the lack of organization it now appears more likely that 
Georgette will succumb to the marginal environment that is embedded 
within.  Moderate northeasterly shear, SSTs cooling to around 26C 
along the forecast track, and dry mid-level humidity is expected
to result in additional weakening and degeneration of the system to
a remnant low within the next day or two. This could occur as soon
as later today, if organized deep convection does not return.
 
Georgette has made its much anticipated northeastward turn, with the 
latest motion estimated at 040/6 kt.  Low- to mid-level 
southwesterly flow to the south of Frank should continue to steer 
Georgette northeastward during the next 12 to 24 hours.  After that 
time, a low-level ridge is forecast to build to the north of the 
cyclone, which will cause Georgette to turn back sharply westward.  
The latest NHC track forecast has been adjusted slightly east of the 
previous forecast to be in better agreement with the latest track 
model envelope.
