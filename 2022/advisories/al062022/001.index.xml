Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Fri Sep 2 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Danielle, located about 900 miles west of the Azores.<br/>
<br/>
East of the Leeward Islands:<br/>
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft earlier <br/>
this afternoon indicated that the circulation associated with an <br/>
area of low pressure located a couple of hundred miles east of the <br/>
northern Leeward Islands has become better defined today, and the <br/>
plane reported that surface pressures have fallen a bit.  If the <br/>
showers and thunderstorms associated with the low persist through <br/>
the evening, the system could become a tropical depression or <br/>
tropical storm as early as tonight.  <br/>
<br/>
The disturbance is expected to move generally west-northwestward at <br/>
about 10 mph, passing near or just to the north of the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands on Saturday, and north of the Virgin Islands and <br/>
Puerto Rico Saturday night and Sunday.  Regardless of development, <br/>
locally heavy rains may occur over portions of the northern Leeward <br/>
Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico during the next couple <br/>
of days, and interests in those areas should monitor the progress <br/>
of the system.  Additional information on this system can be found <br/>
in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and <br/>

Tropical Storm Earl Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
1100 PM AST Fri Sep 02 2022
 
Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft each flew 
missions into the area of low pressure east of the Leeward Islands 
this afternoon into this evening, and the data from those flights 
indicated that the circulation and center of the low became well 
defined today.  Deep convection has also persisted with the low, 
albeit sheared near and to the east of the center, which means the 
system has finally met the criteria of a tropical cyclone. 
Flight-level, surface, and dropsonde data from the reconnaissance 
flights all indicate that the system is producing 
tropical-storm-force winds in the convection well to the east of the 
center, and for good measure TAFB provided a Dvorak estimate of 
T2.5/35 kt.  The low is therefore being designated as Tropical Storm 
Earl with maximum winds of 35 kt.  The minimum pressure is estimated 
to be 1005 mb based on an Air Force dropsonde that measured a 
surface pressure of 1007 mb with 23-kt winds.
 
Earl is moving toward the west-northwest, or 295/12 kt.  The track
guidance is in fairly good agreement during the next 3 days, with a
low- to mid-level ridge expected to steer Earl west-northwestward
and then northwestward at decreasing forward speed.  The ridge to
the north is forecast to weaken and shift westward around day 3, 
which should cause Earl to slow down to less than 5 kt and turn 
northward by day 4, and then north-northeastward by day 5 as it 
begins to feel the influence of the mid-latitude westerlies to the 
north.  The biggest outliers on days 4 and 5 are the GFS and HMON, 
which show a stronger Earl moving faster toward the northeast.  For 
now, the NHC official forecast favors a slower scenario on days 4 
and 5, closer to the ECMWF, HWRF, HCCA, and TVCN.
 
Moderate to strong shear is likely to continue affecting Earl for
much of the next 5 days, possibly peaking in 3 to 4 days according
to the SHIPS guidance.  Mid-level relative humidity ahead of the
system also remains lower than what is ideal for strengthening, and
as a result, the NHC intensity forecast shows only modest
intensification through the forecast period.  This forecast is very
close to the IVCN and HCCA consensus aids.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds are forecast to remain on the northern
and eastern side of the circulation, and as a result, are not
expected to move across the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, or Puerto Rico.  However, any southward shift of Earl's
center would increase the risk of tropical-storm-force winds in
those areas.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm Earl is forecast to pass near or just to the
north of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico over the weekend.  Gusty winds, especially in squalls,
area possible on those islands over the next day or two.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall from Earl is expected to lead to limited flash,
urban, and small stream flooding over the Leeward Islands, U.S. and
British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico this weekend.  Rapid rises
on rivers are possible in Puerto Rico.

<title>Hurricane Danielle Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Hurricane Danielle Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
300 AM GMT Sat Sep 03 2022
 
Danielle's satellite presentation has degraded further this 
evening, highlighted by a loss of the eye.  Dvorak T-numbers have 
decreased from TAFB and SAB since earlier today, but their 
respective Current Intensity numbers remain 4.0 and 4.5.  
Therefore, the initial intensity is being held at 65 kt.

Danielle has been stationary for the past 6-12 hours while it 
remains in a weak steering environment to the south of a blocking 
high over the North Atlantic.  This pattern is expected to hold 
firm for the next few days, with the hurricane forecast to meander 
through about day 3.  After that time, a deep-layer trough moving 
off the coast of Atlantic Canada and the northeastern U.S. should 
finally shove Danielle on an accelerating path toward the northeast 
on days 4 and 5.  During the acceleration phase, the updated NHC 
track forecast is a little north of the previous forecast and lies 
close to the HCCA, TVCN, and FSSE multi-model consensus aids.

Danielle's convective and organizational struggles during the past 
few hours could be due to upwelling of cooler waters.  While 
vertical shear is expected to be generally low 3 days or so, the 
hurricane's slow motion is likely to continue to upwell cooler 
waters, and therefore only slight strengthening is anticipated 
during that time.  Danielle is expected to move over colder waters 
after day 3, which should induce some weakening toward the end of 
the forecast period.  Global models also suggest that the 
cyclone could be undergoing extratropical transition by the end 
of the forecast period.  The updated NHC intensity forecast is very 
similar to the previous forecast.
