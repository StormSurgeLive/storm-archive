Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Mon Sep 5 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Danielle, located about 900 miles west-northwest of the Azores, and <br/>
on Tropical Storm Earl, located about 700 miles south of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic: <br/>
A tropical wave near the Cabo Verde Islands continues to produce a <br/>
broad area of disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity. An area <br/>
of low pressure is forecast to form with this system in the next day <br/>
or so, and environmental conditions appear generally conducive for <br/>
additional development.  A tropical depression could form by the <br/>
latter part of this week as the system moves generally <br/>
west-northwestward or northwestward over the eastern and central <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

followed by a turn to the north-northeast with some increase in 
forward speed.
 
Reports from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the 
maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast over the 
next few days, and Earl is expected to become a hurricane on 
Tuesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft observations is 991 mb (29.27 inches).

<title>Tropical Storm Earl Forecast Discussion Number 13</title>

Tropical Storm Earl Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
1100 PM AST Mon Sep 05 2022

Earl's cloud pattern consists of a rather round area of very deep 
convection with a few ragged banding features over the eastern 
portion of the circulation.  Doppler wind data from a NOAA Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft investigating the tropical cyclone indicate that 
the intensity is now near 60 kt and the central pressure has fallen 
to around 991 mb.  Thus, Earl is very close to hurricane strength 
at this time.  Radar reflectivity images from the aircraft show an 
eye-like feature is developing.  The Doppler wind data from the 
aircraft also reveal that the vortex is becoming more vertically 
aligned than it had been.

During the next few days, the system will be moving through an 
area of diffluent anticyclonic upper-level flow, and the 
thermodynamic environment should be conducive for intensification.  
These factors, along with the current strengthening trend, argue 
for continued intensification despite the presence of significant 
southwesterly shear through 48 hours.  The official intensity 
forecast is close to the HFIP Corrected Consensus, HCCA, prediction 
and continues to call for Earl to eventually become a major 
hurricane.

Aircraft and satellite fixes indicate that Earl is moving northward 
near 6 kt.  The tropical cyclone should continue to move through a 
weakness in the subtropical ridge for the next 48 hours or so.  
Thereafter, a broad approaching trough in the southern stream 
of the mid-latitude westerlies should cause Earl to turn toward the 
north-northeast and then northeast, with some acceleration.  The 
official track forecast is just slightly to the left of the 
previous NHC track in the 2-3 day time frame and is close to the 
latest HCCA solution.

Earl's center is expected to pass to the southeast of Bermuda in
around 3-4 days. However, the size of the wind field of the 
tropical cyclone is expected to increase significantly, and 
interests on the island should continue to monitor the progress of 
the storm closely.

Hurricane Danielle Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
300 AM GMT Tue Sep 06 2022
 
Danielle's cloud pattern has deteriorated during the past
several hours.  The outer curved band cloud tops have warmed while
becoming ragged, and the eye temperature has cooled while becoming
partially obscured.  A recent microwave image, however, indicated
very little vertical tilt while maintaining a symmetric structure.  
A blend of the subjective satellite intensity estimates from TAFB 
and SAB along with the AI-enhanced Advanced Dvorak Technique (AiDT) 
from UW-CIMSS yields an initial intensity of 70 kt for this 
advisory.  Danielle's wind radii profile was expanded a bit in the 
east semicircle based on recent METOP-B/C scatterometer data.
 
The cyclone should gradually spin down as it traverses cooler SSTs
of less than 22C by mid-period.  The GFS/ECMWF/UKMET continue to be 
in agreement that Danielle will complete its extratropical 
transition on Thursday, although the vertical thermal structure 
shows the system maintaining a warm core above 600 mb.  Over the 
weekend, Global model simulated IR imagery, and the Cyclone Phase 
Analysis show Danielle merging with a baroclinic system approaching 
from the west and developing a warm seclusion structure (shallow 
warm core with a cold core upper troposphere).  Although not 
explicitly indicated in the official forecast, Danielle could 
maintain its intensity during this evolution is due to dynamic 
forcing/favorable jet finger support while it tracks cyclonically 
over the central-north Atlantic. The NHC intensity forecast 
resembles the IVCN intensity consensus which has performed well so 
far on the system.
 
Danielle should still move generally northeastward in the
deep-layer mid-latitude steering flow through the afternoon hours.
Danielle is forecast to turn east-northeast on Wednesday while 
accelerating.  Toward the end of the week, as mentioned above, the 
cyclone is expected to interact with a baroclinic system, while 
rotating cyclonically north of the westerlies, then turn toward the 
southeast.  The only significant change in the official forecast 
track is the implementation of the cyclonic turn around day 3-4, 
which is based on the majority of the global models.
