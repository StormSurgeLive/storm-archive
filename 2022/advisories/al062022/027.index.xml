Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Fri Sep 9 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Earl, located a couple of hundred miles east-northeast of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic: <br/>
A gale-force low pressure system is located about 1100 miles east of <br/>
the Leeward Islands. Although the low has a well-defined center of <br/>
circulation, strong upper-level winds have caused most of the <br/>
disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity associated with the <br/>
low to be displaced well to its northeast. The strong upper-level <br/>
winds are forecast to persist for the next several days and it is <br/>
becoming less likely that a short-lived tropical storm will form. <br/>
Regardless of development, the disturbance is forecast to move <br/>
generally west-northwestward near 15 mph across the central <br/>
subtropical Atlantic. For more information on this system, including <br/>
gale warnings, please refer to the High Seas Forecasts issued by the <br/>
National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located several hundred miles south of the Cabo <br/>
Verde Islands is producing a disorganized area of showers and <br/>
thunderstorms.  Development of this system, if any, is expected to <br/>
be slow to occur while it moves westward or west-northwestward at <br/>
15 to 20 mph across the eastern and central tropical Atlantic <br/>
through the middle of next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Near the Coast of Africa:<br/>
Another tropical wave is forecast to move off the coast of Africa <br/>
by early next week. Some gradual development of the wave will be <br/>
possible after it moves over water and heads generally westward <br/>
over the far eastern Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Bermuda Weather Service has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warning for Bermuda.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Earl was located
near latitude 34.2 North, longitude 61.0 West. Earl is moving toward
the northeast near 22 mph (35 km/h) and is forecast to accelerate 
further toward the northeast today. Earl is then forecast to slow 
down considerably Saturday night through Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts. Slight fluctuations in intensity are possible today. Earl is
expected to complete its transition to a powerful hurricane-force
extratropical low on Saturday and then steadily weaken through
early Monday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230
miles (370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 961 mb (28.38 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Earl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
WIND:  Gusty winds are expected across the Avalon Peninsula of 
Newfoundland over the weekend after Earl becomes a post-tropical 
low.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Earl are affecting Bermuda and portions
of the U.S. East Coast and are expected to reach Nova Scotia and
Newfoundland tonight and on Saturday. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions through the
weekend.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

<title>Hurricane Earl Forecast Discussion Number 27</title>

Hurricane Earl Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
1100 AM AST Fri Sep 09 2022
 
During the past six hours, Earl's satellite appearance has 
oscillated between periods of gaining symmetry and becoming more 
ragged, with the latter winning out right now.  In fact, Earl's 
previously clear eye has become partially obscured by clouds during 
the last hour or two. Satellite-based intensity estimates range from 
70-100 kt, but since those estimates generally haven't changed much 
since the last advisory, the hurricane's intensity is held at 85 kt 
for now.
 
Whether Earl's recent satellite degradation is another temporary 
hiccup or the start of a weakening trend as it undergoes 
extratropical transition over the next 24 h isn't yet clear, but 
either way the intensity guidance is now in good agreement that 
little or no intensification is expected going forward. Dynamical 
models including the GFS and ECMWF are also in very good agreement 
that Earl will become post-tropical by Saturday afternoon or 
evening. This transition should coincide with the cyclone's maximum 
winds to decreasing sharply while the extent of its tropical storm 
or gale-force winds expands. The NHC intensity forecast shows a 
slightly faster rate of weakening than the previous advisory, but is 
still on the high end of the narrow intensity guidance envelope 
through 72 h. The official intensity forecast is based heavily on 
the consensus after that.

Earl continues to accelerate toward the northeast ahead of an 
approaching shortwave trough off the New England and Atlantic Canada 
coasts. This should cause Earl to accelerate further today and 
tonight before it merges with the trough and slows to a relative 
crawl southeast of Newfoundland as a post-tropical cyclone in about 
48 h. Around day 4-5, the broader mid-latitude system should move 
faster eastward, bringing extratropical Earl with it. Only minor 
adjustments were made to the NHC track forecast.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Swells generated by Earl are affecting Bermuda and the U.S. East
Coast and are expected to reach Nova Scotia and Newfoundland tonight
and on Saturday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions through the weekend.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
