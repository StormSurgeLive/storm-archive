...EARL MOVING SLOWLY NORTHWESTWARD WITH LITTLE CHANGE IN
STRENGTH...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.2N 65.4W
ABOUT 125 MI...205 KM NNW OF ST. THOMAS
ABOUT 835 MI...1345 KM S OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 3 MPH...6 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...998 MB...29.47 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands,
Puerto Rico, and Bermuda should monitor the progress of Earl.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Earl was
located near latitude 20.2 North, longitude 65.4 West.  Earl is
moving toward the northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A turn toward the 
north with some increase in forward speed is expected on Monday, 
followed by a turn toward the north-northeast later this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Slow strengthening is forecast over the next several days, and Earl 
could become a hurricane later this week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.  NOAA data buoy 41043 recently reported a 
sustained wind of 40 mph (65 km/h) with a gust to 49 mph (80 
km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Earl is expected to produce additional rainfall amounts 
of 1 to 4 inches, with isolated storm totals of 8 inches, across 
the Leeward Islands, U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and Puerto 
Rico through Monday.  

Limited flash, urban, and small stream flooding impacts are 
possible.  Rapid rises on rivers and mudslides in areas of steep 
terrain are also possible, especially across the central interior 
region of Puerto Rico.  Locally considerable flood impacts are 
possible in areas that will receive heavier rainfall totals.

WIND:  Gusty winds, especially in squalls, are possible across the
northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico
through tonight.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Earl Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Tropical Storm Earl Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
1100 PM AST Sun Sep 04 2022

Earl continues to produce intense deep convection with tops colder 
than -80 deg C over the eastern portion of its circulation,  
but the system still lacks clear-cut banding features.  A 2306 UTC 
SSMIS microwave image showed that the low-level center is displaced 
to the west-southwest of the main area of convection.  Dvorak 
intensity estimates range from 45 kt to 55 kt, and given that there 
has been no obvious change in organization since the aircraft 
missions earlier today, the current intensity estimate is held at 45 
kt for this advisory.

The storm is still being affected by southwesterly vertical wind 
shear associated with an upper-level trough located several hundred 
miles to the west and northwest.  However, Earl's upper-level 
outflow pattern is gradually becoming better defined, and global 
model predictions suggest a slow relaxation of the shear over the 
next several days as the trough shifts a little to the northwest.  
Since the other environmental factors appear conducive for 
strengthening, gradual intensification is likely.  The official 
intensity forecast is close to both the simple and corrected model 
consensus and also very similar to the previous NHC forecast.  Earl 
could become the first major hurricane of this Atlantic season.

Earl's motion is a somewhat uncertain but slow 305/3 kt.  The storm 
remains in a region of weak steering currents with mid-level 
anticyclones currently located to the west, northwest and east.  By 
tomorrow, however, Earl should begin to move northward into a 
weakness in the subtropical ridge.  Later in the forecast period, 
the cyclone is expected to start coming under the influence of a 
trough in the southern portion of the mid-latitude westerlies and 
turn toward the north-northeast and northeast.  The official track 
forecast is just slightly left of the previous NHC track and close 
to the latest dynamical model consensus.  This is roughly in the 
middle of the rather tightly clustered track guidance model suite.
 
While tropical-storm-force winds are still forecast to stay north of
the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico,
training rainbands are producing heavy rainfall over portions of 
these islands.  Users should refer to products issued by local 
weather offices in these areas.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Heavy rainfall from Earl is expected to lead to limited flash,
urban, and small stream flooding impacts over the Leeward Islands,
U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico today. Rapid rises
on rivers and mudslides in areas of steep terrain are possible in
Puerto Rico.  Considerable flood impacts cannot be ruled out in 
areas that receive heavier rainfall totals.
 
2.  Earl is forecast to remain to the north of the the Virgin 
Islands and Puerto Rico tonight, but gusty winds, especially in 
squalls, remain possible on those islands overnight.

<title>Hurricane Danielle Forecast Discussion Number 16</title>

Hurricane Danielle Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
300 AM GMT Mon Sep 05 2022
 
Danielle has become better organized during the past several hours.
GOES-16 ProxyVis and BD-curve enhanced IR imagery show a much 
improved inner core structure with a clear warm 14C eye.  The cloud 
pattern also comprises a well-developed outer curved band with -65C 
cloud tops.  A blend of the subjective and UW-CIMSS objective 
satellite intensity estimates raises the initial intensity to 80 kt 
for this advisory.

Danielle is forecast to remain over SSTs of around 26-27C and in a 
low-shear environment during the next 36 hours.  As a result,
the statistical SHIPS intensity model and the intensity consensus
aids call for Danielle to maintain its current intensity during 
that time, and the NHC forecast follows suit.  Beyond 36 hours, 
gradually decreasing oceanic surface temperatures along the 
forecast track and increasing southwesterly shear should 
weaken the cyclone.  The latest Florida State Cyclone Phase 
Analysis shows that the UKMET and the GFS agree with Danielle 
commencing an extratropical transition around 48 hours.  
The analysis also indicates that Danielle will complete its 
transition by 96 hours (Thursday evening), and this 
cyclone transformation is shown in the official forecast.
 
The hurricane's initial motion is estimated to be northeastward 
and at a slightly faster pace of 6 kt.  Danielle should continue to
accelerate northeastward during the next 36 hours in response to a 
mid-latitude major shortwave trough approaching from the northwest, 
out of the Canadian Maritimes.  By Tuesday night, the storm should 
turn toward the east-northeast within the mid-latitude westerlies 
and continue in this general heading through the period.  The NHC 
track forecast has been adjusted north of the previous advisory 
beyond 60 hours to agree more with the TVCA and HCCA consensus 
solutions.
