Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Wed Sep 7 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Danielle, located several hundred miles northwest of the Azores, and <br/>
on Hurricane Earl, located several hundred miles south of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic: <br/>
An area of low pressure located several hundred miles west of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands continues to produce disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms. Environmental conditions appear conducive for <br/>
additional development of this system and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form in the next couple of days while it moves westward <br/>
to west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic.  After that time, upper-level winds are forecast to become <br/>
less conducive for development.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
West Coast of Africa:<br/>
A tropical wave currently located near the west coast of Africa is <br/>
forecast to emerge into the eastern Atlantic tomorrow.  <br/>
Environmental conditions appear conducive for some gradual <br/>
development thereafter as the system moves west-northwestward over <br/>
the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Earl was located
near latitude 26.8 North, longitude 65.5 West. Earl is moving toward
the north near 8 mph (13 km/h). A turn toward the north-northeast
is expected overnight followed by a turn to the northeast during the 
day on Thursday with a gradual increase in forward speed.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 90 mph (150 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Significant strengthening is forecast during the 
next couple of days, and Earl is expected to become a major 
hurricane tomorrow.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150
miles (240 km).
 
The minimum central pressure reported by the NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft is 971 mb (28.67 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Earl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC

<title>Hurricane Earl Forecast Discussion Number 20</title>

Hurricane Earl Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
500 PM AST Wed Sep 07 2022
 
The structure of Earl is gradually improving, with deep convective
cold tops rotating around the core with an occasional warm spot
becoming evident on both infrared and visible satellite imagery. An
Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter mission has been flying through
Earl this afternoon, and they found a peak 700 mb flight level wind
of 90 kt in the SE quadrant of the hurricane. However, SFMR winds
have been lower than earlier observed in the NOAA P-3 mission and
the central pressure has stabilized somewhere in the 974-976 mb
range. These observations support keeping the intensity at 75 kt for
this advisory, which is also in agreement with the 1800 UTC Dvorak
T-numbers from both TAFB and SAB.
 
Center fixes from the aircraft show that Earl continues to move east
of due north estimated at 010/7 kt, and may be in the initial stages
of making a more rightward turn. The track reasoning has not changed
for the next couple of days, where Earl is expected to gradually
turn to the northeast and accelerate as it is caught in between a
mid-level ridge to the southeast, and a digging mid-latitude trough
to the northwest. The aforementioned trough is forecast to
ultimately capture Earl sometime in the 60-96 hour period, though
timing differences between the guidance are driving significant
along track spread in the forecast by that time. The latest NHC
track forecast was largely unchanged in the short-term, remaining
close to the tightly clustered guidance, though was shifted a bit
east compared to the prior cycle after Earl becomes extra-tropical.
 
The deep-layer vertical wind shear is beginning to decrease over
Earl, now under 20-kt in both GFS- and ECMWF-based SHIPS guidance.
This shear is forecast to decrease further tonight and be 10 kt or
under from 24-48 hours. Sea-surface temperatures are also expected
to remain at 29 C or warmer over this same time span. In terms of
the high-resolution regional hurricane model guidance, the most
recent HMON, experimental HAFS-S and HAFS-A, and COAMPS-TC all
explicitly show Earl becoming a Category 4 hurricane over the next
48-60h. The COAMPS-TC ensemble from the 00z cycle also indicated at
least 75 percent of its members becoming a Category 4 hurricane as
the hurricane passes by to the southeast of Bermuda. Finally, DTOPS
RI-probabilities from the latest SHIPS run indicate a greater than
50 percent chance of a 35 kt increase in intensity over the next 24
hours. While the latest intensity forecast will not go quite that
high, it does show a 40 kt increase in intensity in 48 hours still
making Earl a Category 4 hurricane. While it is relatively rare to
see such an intense hurricane at that latitude in the forecast
period, the guidance support, plus the favorable environment of Earl
being positioned in the right entrance region of a upper-level jet
streak ahead of the trough should provide both good dynamical
support on top of the favorable thermodynamic environment by the
warm SSTs. After 60 h, Earl will likely rapidly undergo
extra-tropical transition as an upper-level trough digs in and
captures Earl, increasing baroclinicity and removing the deep
convection as the storm moves poleward of the Gulf Stream.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Although Earl's center is forecast to pass southeast of Bermuda,
the wind field is expected to grow, with tropical-storm-force winds
forecast to spread across the island beginning Thursday afternoon
and continuing through Friday morning. The Bermuda Weather Service 
has also issued a Hurricane Watch for the island. 
 
2.  Swells generated by Earl are expected to reach Bermuda by
tonight and the U.S. East Coast shortly thereafter.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions through the weekend.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.

Hurricane Danielle Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
900 PM GMT Wed Sep 07 2022
 
Danielle has generally changed little since this morning and it
remains an impressive hurricane for being at a relatively
high latitude of around 45 N. The system continues to have a
large eye with a fairly symmetric convective pattern surrounding it.
The Dvorak estimates at 18Z range from 65 to 77 kt, and on this
basis, the initial intensity is held at 70 kt.
 
A mid-to upper-level trough is quickly approaching Danielle, and
it should cause an increase in shear soon. The higher shear,
interaction with the trough, and sharply cooler SSTs along the
predicted track should cause Danielle to complete extratropical
transition on Thursday and cause the cyclone to gradually decay.
The intensity models are in good agreement, and the NHC intensity
forecast is just an update of the previous one.
 
Danielle is moving northeastward at 14 kt, which is the fastest this 
system has moved in quite some time. This general motion should 
continue through tonight, however, a slow down and counterclockwise 
loop is expected to occur on Thursday and Friday when Danielle 
interacts with the trough that is expected to cut off. After that 
time, a faster motion to the southeast is forecast, which should 
take the extratropical cyclone toward western Europe by the end of 
the period. The NHC track forecast is a little faster than the 
previous one, trending toward the latest consensus aids.
 
Danielle continues to produce a large area of very rough seas over
the central-north Atlantic.  More information can be found in the
High Seas Forecasts issued by the Ocean Prediction Center under
AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php. The UK Met Office also has
information in High Seas Forecasts for the west Central and east
Central sections issued under WMO header FQNT21 EGRR and on the web
at metoffice.gov.uk/weather/specialist-forecasts/coast-and-sea/high-
seas-forecast
