Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Thu Sep 8 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Earl, located less than 200 miles south of Bermuda, and has written <br/>
the final advisory on Post-Tropical Cyclone Danielle, located <br/>
several hundred miles north-northwest of the Azores.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic: <br/>
Satellite imagery indicates that the area of low pressure located <br/>
about a thousand miles west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands has <br/>
a well-defined center, and earlier satellite wind data indicated <br/>
that the system is producing maximum sustained winds up to <br/>
40-45 mph to its north. However, the associated shower and <br/>
thunderstorm activity remains disorganized, and has become displaced <br/>
further from the center compared to this morning. Environmental <br/>
conditions appear only marginally conducive for additional <br/>
development, but only a small increase in organization in the <br/>
associated shower and thunderstorm activity could result in the <br/>
formation of a short-lived tropical storm in the next day or so <br/>
as it moves westward to west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the <br/>
central tropical Atlantic.  By this weekend, environmental <br/>
conditions are forecast to become less conducive for development. <br/>
For more information on this system, including Gale Warnings, please <br/>
refer to the High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather <br/>
Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located several hundred miles south-southeast of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands is producing a disorganized area of showers and <br/>
thunderstorms. Environmental conditions appear conducive for some <br/>
gradual development as the system moves generally west-northwestward <br/>
over the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Earl was located
near latitude 30.3 North, longitude 64.4 West. Earl is moving toward
the north-northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h) and this motion is
expected to continue with further acceleration tonight. A turn more
northeastward is expected tomorrow.
 
Maximum sustained winds measured by the Air Force Reserve Hurricane 
Hunters are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher gusts. Strengthening 
is still anticipated and Earl could become a major hurricane by 
tomorrow. Thereafter, some weakening and transition into a powerful 
extratropical cyclone is forecast on Saturday.
 
Earl is growing larger, with Hurricane-force winds extending outward 
up to 60 miles (95 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force 
winds extending outward up to 185 miles (295 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure measured by the Air Force
Reserve Hurricane Hunters is 961 mb (28.38 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

<title>Hurricane Earl Forecast Discussion Number 23</title>

Hurricane Earl Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
1100 AM AST Thu Sep 08 2022

The convective structure of Earl this morning is interesting, with a 
large convective band with cloud tops below -70 C completing one 
full cyclonic orbit around the hurricane. The NOAA Hurricane Hunters 
earlier indicated that the central pressure had fallen from last 
night, with the final reading at 965 mb. However, the 700 mb flight 
level, SFMR, and tail Doppler radar winds have yet to respond to the 
continued falling pressure. Therefore, the wind speed this advisory 
will be held at 90 kt. Of note, the aircraft mission is reporting 
that Earl has a fairly large closed eye , with an estimated 
diameter of 50 n mi. 

Based on the last few center fixes, Earl is starting to make the 
turn to the north-northeast as it gradually accelerates, estimated 
at 030/11 kt. A shortwave trough in the process of moving offshore 
of the Eastern U.S. coastline and this feature, in combination with 
mid-level ridging to the east of Earl, is expected to cause Earl to 
bend further eastward as the flow accelerates. There have been very 
few changes made to the NHC forecast track over the first 24-48 
hours, with Earl expected to pass 75-100 n mi to the southeast of 
Bermuda tonight into tomorrow morning. Shortly after 48 hours, Earl 
will be captured by the digging shortwave trough with model guidance 
indicating it will undergo a warm-seclusion-type extratropical 
transition. This process will also likely result in a substantial 
slow-down in the forward motion between 48-72 hours, and this 
portion of the track forecast has the largest along-track spread, 
related to the degree of phasing between Earl and this trough. 
Thereafter, their combination should begin to move eastward into the 
Atlantic Maritimes by the end of the forecast period, opting to 
favor a blend between the GFS and ECMWF track solutions. 

Per the latest SHIPS guidance, vertical wind shear over Earl is now 
under 10 kt and is forecast to remain that way for the next 24 hours 
as Earl traverses over 29 C sea-surface temperatures. Thus, steady 
intensification is expected, with the assumption that the current 
core structure of Earl fully consolidates and takes advantage of 
this favorable environment. The peak intensity of 115 kt is still 
under the latest LGEM and HCCA guidance. After 36 hours, Earl will 
begin to undergo extratropical transition as the trough interaction 
introduces substantial baroclinicity as vertical wind shear rapidly 
increases. Earl is expected to transition into a powerful 
hurricane-force extratropical low sometime between 48-60 hours, with 
this low filling rather quickly thereafter, in good agreement with 
the intensity consensus aids.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Although Earl's center is forecast to pass southeast of Bermuda,
tropical-storm-force winds are expected on the island this
afternoon through early Friday morning.  Hurricane-force winds are
possible on Bermuda this evening or tonight if Earl's track shifts
farther west than is currently forecast.
 
2.  Swells generated by Earl are building near Bermuda and are
expected to reach the U.S. East Coast later today and tonight.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions through the weekend.  Please consult products
from your local weather office.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Danielle Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
300 PM GMT Thu Sep 08 2022
 
Satellite imagery this afternoon has shown Danielle develop a clear 
comma-shaped cloud shield, a hallmark of an extratropical cyclone. 
In addition, an ASCAT-B pass near 12Z showed a wind shift, 
indicative of a front, that extended from the center of the cyclone 
northeastward. Based on these data, Danielle has been classified as 
post-tropical and this is the last NHC advisory. Peak winds in the 
ASCAT pass were just above 50 kt, so the intensity of Danielle was 
lowered slightly to 55 kt. It is worth noting that the peak winds 
are generally not representative of the impacts associated with 
extratropical cyclones and gale- to storm-force winds extend well 
from the center of Danielle. 

Danielle has begun its long-awaited counterclockwise loop, which 
should take another 36 to 48 h to complete. After that, the 
post-tropical cyclone is forecast to move initially southeastward, 
then eastward as it is caught within the flow of a broader 
mid-latitude trough moving eastward over the northeastern Atlantic. 
The track forecast for the post-tropical cyclone is based heavily on 
the multi-model consensus TVCN. All guidance indicates the cyclone 
will gradually weaken, both in terms of maximum winds and size 
through the end of the forecast period.
 
Danielle continues to produce a large area of very rough seas over 
the central-north Atlantic. More information about the 
post-tropical cyclone can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by 
the UKMET office under WMO header FQNT21 EGRR and on the web at 
metoffice.gov.uk/weather/specialist-forecasts/coast-and-sea/high- 
seas-forecast. Information can also be found in Meteo France's High 
Seas Forecast at weather.gmdss.org/II.html.
