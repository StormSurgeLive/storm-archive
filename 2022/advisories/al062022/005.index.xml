<title>Tropical Storm Earl Forecast Discussion Number 5</title>

Tropical Storm Earl Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
1100 PM AST Sat Sep 03 2022
 
There are no indications that Earl has strengthened further than it 
did this afternoon.  The low-level center is a little difficult to 
locate since it's obscured by high-level cirrus clouds, but it 
appears to have moved out ahead of the deep convection again.  The 
initial intensity remains 45 kt, and this fits a blend of the 
latest Dvorak estimates of T3.5 and T2.5 from TAFB and SAB, 
respectively.

Earl continues to move west-northwestward, or 285/9 kt, to the south 
of a low- to mid-level ridge.  However, a break is developing in the 
ridge over the western Atlantic, which should allow Earl to turn 
northwestward on Sunday, followed by a recurvature toward the north 
and northeast Tuesday through Thursday.  Although the track models 
agree on this scenario, the biggest differences among them is the 
along-track component, or how much Earl accelerates toward the north 
and northeast on days 3 through 5.  Interestingly, both the GFS and 
ECMWF ensemble means are well west and slower than their respective 
deterministic runs, and the deterministic GFS in particular is an 
extreme outlier and much faster than all other guidance by day 5 
(likely because it carries a much stronger cyclone).  With so many 
ensemble solutions slower and to the west, the updated NHC track 
forecast is placed to the west of many of the multi-model consensus 
aids, and it's just slightly west of the previous forecast.

The moderate to strong shear affecting Earl is unlikely to abate 
through much of the forecast period.  Despite this shear, very warm 
waters of at least 29 degrees Celsius and an unstable atmospheric 
environment are expected to encourage gradual strengthening during 
the next couple of days.  Then, around day 3, Earl could get an 
additional positive boost from interaction with an upper-level 
trough over the western Atlantic, and the official forecast shows 
the system reaching hurricane strength by day 4 and intensifying 
through the end of the forecast period.  It should be noted that a 
few models show significant strengthening by days 4 and 5, but for 
now the official forecast is conservative and is only nudged upward 
toward the IVCN model consensus.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds are still forecast to remain on the
northern and eastern side of the circulation, and are not expected
to move across the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, or
Puerto Rico.  However, gusty winds in squalls are possible at these
locations through Sunday.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Heavy rainfall from Earl is expected to lead to limited flash, 
urban, and small stream flooding impacts over the Leeward Islands, 
U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico this weekend. Rapid 
rises on rivers and mudslides in areas of steep terrain are possible 
in Puerto Rico.
 
2.  Earl is forecast to pass to the north of the the Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico overnight and on Sunday. Gusty winds, especially in
squalls, area possible on those islands through Sunday.

Tropical Storm Danielle Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
900 PM GMT Sat Sep 03 2022
 
Danielle's cloud pattern has become better organized during the
past several hours with banding features gaining symmetry around
the center.  However, there are still some dry slots disrupting
the system's inner core.  A blend of the latest satellite intensity
estimates still supports an intensity of 60 kt, but Danielle could
become a hurricane again soon.  An ASCAT pass from several
hours ago was helpful in adjusting the initial 34- and 50-kt wind
radii.
 
The storm has been moving a little faster to the west at 5 kt and is
back over the same location where it was on Thursday. A continued
slow westward motion is expected into Sunday as the storm remains
steered by a blocking ridge to its north. However, a sharp turn to
the north is forecast by Sunday night followed by a faster motion to
the northeast after that as a trough currently over eastern Canada
approaches Danielle.  The new NHC track forecast has been adjusted
to the left in the short term, but ends up to the east of the
previous track at 96 and 120 h, trending toward the latest
consensus aids.
 
Danielle is expected to gradually pull away from its own cool SST
wake, and since the atmospheric conditions appear generally
favorable, slow strengthening seems likely during the next day or
two.  Beyond a couple of days, however, sharply cooler SSTs, drier
air, and an increase in vertical wind shear should end the
strengthening trend and induce some weakening.  Danielle is expected
to become fully extratropical by day 5 when it merges with the
approaching trough and moves over SSTs cooler than 20C. The NHC
intensity forecast is again an update of the previous one and
remains in line with the HCCA and IVCN consensus aids.
