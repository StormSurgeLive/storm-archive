DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Earl was located
near latitude 42.9 North, longitude 53.0 West. Earl is now moving 
toward the north-northeast near 29 mph (46 km/h).  An additional 
decrease in forward speed is expected today, with Earl moving 
slowly northeastward to the southeast of Newfoundland tonight 
through Monday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 90 mph (150 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Earl is forecast to become a powerful 
hurricane-force extratropical low this afternoon.  After that, 
weakening is expected, and Earl's winds are likely to fall below 
hurricane force tonight or early Sunday.

Earl is a large cyclone.  Hurricane-force winds extend outward up 
to 90 miles (150 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds 
extend outward up to 415 miles (665 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 960 mb (28.35 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC

WIND:  Strong winds are expected across the Avalon Peninsula of
Newfoundland this afternoon through Sunday, after Earl becomes a
post-tropical low.

SURF:  Swells generated by Earl will affect Bermuda, portions
of the U.S. East Coast, and Nova Scotia and Newfoundland in
Canada during the next several days.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
