Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Tue Sep 6 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Danielle, located about 850 miles west-northwest of the Azores, and <br/>
on Tropical Storm Earl, located about 650 miles south of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic: <br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms stretching from the Cabo <br/>
Verde Islands southwestward several hundred miles are associated <br/>
with a broad and elongated area of low pressure.  Environmental <br/>
conditions are conducive for some development of this system, and a <br/>
tropical depression could form in a few days while moving westward <br/>
to west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the eastern and central <br/>
tropical Atlantic.  Upper-level winds are likely to become less <br/>
conducive for development late this week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

<title>Tropical Storm Earl Forecast Discussion Number 14</title>

Tropical Storm Earl Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
500 AM AST Tue Sep 06 2022
 
The deep convective blow-up that occurred last evening and led to 
Earl strengthening just shy of hurricane strength was quickly 
obliterated by strong shear around the issuance of the previous 
advisory.  In fact, after measuring a pressure as low as 991 mb 
early in their flight, the NOAA Hurricane Hunters reported that the 
central pressure had risen to near 998 mb based on the final 
dropsonde released near the center.  Some deep convection continues 
near and to the northeast of the estimated center, but based on the 
degraded structure from earlier, the intensity is estimated to be 55 
kt.  This value agrees with the latest Dvorak Data-T numbers from 
TAFB and SAB.

The remnant cirrus shield is obscuring the low-level center, so the 
initial position is based on interpolation from the previous 
forecast.  Earl is moving just west of due north, or 350/6 kt, and 
it should continue a slow northward path through a break in the 
subtropical ridge during the next 36 hours.  After that time, a 
deep-layer trough sliding off the U.S. east coast is expected to 
impart a faster north-northeastward and then northeastward motion 
into the upcoming weekend.  The updated NHC track forecast lies very 
close to the previous official prediction during the first 3 days, 
situated among the various multi-model consensus aids.  On days 4 
and 5, however, the new forecast is faster and to the east of the 
previous one, following the trend noted in most of the models.

UW-CIMSS and SHIPS analyses indicate that deep-layer shear over 
Earl is from the west-southwest at 30-35 kt.  Although the 
thermodynamic environment is plenty favorable for intensification, 
continued moderate to strong shear could put the breaks on 
significant strengthening until Earl turns and moves in the same 
direction as the shear vector, which should be in 2-3 days.  At 
about the same time, Earl could also benefit from a positive 
interaction with a mid- to upper-level trough located over the 
western Atlantic.  While the intensity forecast is highly 
uncertain, Earl is still expected to become a hurricane during the 
next couple of days, and possibly reach major hurricane strength in 
3-4 days.
 
Earl's center is expected to pass to the southeast of Bermuda in
about 3 days.  However, the size of the wind field of the tropical 
cyclone is expected to increase significantly, and interests on the 
island should continue to monitor the progress of the storm closely.

Hurricane Danielle Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
900 AM GMT Tue Sep 06 2022
 
Danielle's cloud pattern has degraded further this morning by
shedding its curved bands in the eastern semicircle.  The remaining
outer bands have become more fragmented with cloud top
temperatures of only -47C.  Dvorak final-T numbers are on the
decline, and a compromise of both TAFB's and SAB's intensity 
estimates, along with the UW-CIMSS objective assessment, supports 
lowering the initial intensity to 65 kt for this advisory.
 
Although Danielle is currently moving over relatively warm (25C)
oceanic surface temperatures, the cyclone should begin to lose its
tropical characteristics soon as it traverses cooler SSTs of less
than 22C during the next day or two.  Guidance continues to
indicate that Danielle will complete its extratropical transition
on Thursday, although the vertical thermal structure shows the
system sustaining its warm core above 600 mb.  Over the 
weekend, deterministic cyclone phase analyses, and simulated IR 
predictions show Danielle, as the dominant system, merging with a 
baroclinic system approaching from the west.  A warm seclusion 
structure develops while the system occludes, or is cut-off north 
of the mid-latitude westerlies.  The NHC intensity forecast is 
similar to the previous advisory and continues to lean toward the 
IVCN intensity consensus model.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be northeastward at 7 kt, and 
Danielle should continue moving in this heading through this 
evening.  Afterward, a turn toward the east-northeast by early 
Wednesday, while accelerating, is anticipated.  By the early 
weekend, the cyclone is expected to interact with a baroclinic 
system by rotating cyclonically north of the westerlies and 
becoming a vastly larger extratropical low well west of the British 
Isles.  Once merged into one large, storm-force extratropical low, 
the system should commence a general motion toward the 
east-southeast on Sunday.
 
Danielle is producing huge seas over the central-north Atlantic.

Ocean Prediction Center under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header
FZNT01 KWBC, and online at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php.
