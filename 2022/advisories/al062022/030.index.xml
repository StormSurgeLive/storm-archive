...EARL FORECAST TO BECOME AN EXTRATROPICAL LOW THIS AFTERNOON...
...EXPECTED TO PRODUCE STRONG WINDS OVER EXTREME SOUTHEASTERN
NEWFOUNDLAND THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH SUNDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...41.2N 53.5W
ABOUT 380 MI...610 KM S OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...105 MPH...165 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 35 DEGREES AT 35 MPH...56 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...955 MB...28.20 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Earl was located
near latitude 41.2 North, longitude 53.5 West.  Earl is moving
rapidly toward the northeast near 35 mph (56 km/h).  A significant
reduction in forward speed is expected today, with Earl moving
slowly northeastward to the southeast of Newfoundland tonight
through Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Earl is forecast to become a powerful hurricane-force
extratropical low this afternoon.  Weakening is expected during the
next few days, and Earl's winds are likely to fall below hurricane
force tonight or early Sunday.
 
Earl's wind field is expanding.  Hurricane-force winds extend
outward up to 90 miles (150 km) from the center and
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 415 miles (665 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 955 mb (28.20 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Earl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
WIND:  Strong winds are expected across the Avalon Peninsula of
Newfoundland this afternoon through Sunday, after Earl becomes a
post-tropical low.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Earl will affect Bermuda, portions
of the U.S. East Coast, and Nova Scotia and Newfoundland in
Canada during the next several days.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Earl Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
500 AM AST Sat Sep 10 2022
 
Earl is in the first stages of extratropical transition.  The
convective cloud pattern is becoming stretched east to west, and
the eye is rapidly losing definition while an extensive cirrus
shield radiates northward away from the hurricane.  Scatterometer
data from last evening showed that Earl's wind field continues to
expand and was beginning to merge with the strong winds behind an
approaching frontal boundary.  Maximum winds are still estimated to
be 90 kt based on a blend of Dvorak data-T and Current Intensity
numbers from TAFB and SAB, as well as the UW-CIMSS ADT.
 
The hurricane continues to accelerate just ahead of a shortwave
trough and is estimated to be moving rapidly northeastward (035
degrees) at 30 kt.  However, Earl will be merging with this trough
within the next 6 to 12 hours, which will cause it to slam on the
brakes southeast of Newfoundland, slowing to speeds of 5 kt or less
beginning tonight and continuing through Monday.  After Monday, a
less amplified upper-level pattern should cause the system to turn
eastward and pick up some speed.  The updated NHC track forecast
has been shifted a bit northwestward during the first couple of
days of the forecast and lies within the tightly packed guidance
envelope.  The NHC prediction then comes back in line with
the previous forecast on days 3 through 5.  The northwestward
shift of the track, along with Earl's large wind field, is expected
to lead to strong winds occurring over the Avalon Peninsula of
Newfoundland beginning this afternoon and continuing through
Sunday.  For additional information on impacts in Newfoundland,
please monitor forecasts and warnings from Environment Canada.
 
Global model fields show Earl's center migrating into the cold side
of the nearby frontal zone today, with extratropical transition
forecast to be complete this afternoon.  This process, along with
Earl now crossing the tight sea surface temperature gradient north
of the Gulf Stream, is expected to induce a weakening trend, with
the cyclone's winds likely falling below hurricane force by
tonight.  Continued weakening at a more gradual pace is anticipated
from Sunday onward into the middle of the week.  The NHC intensity
forecast most closely follows the GFS and ECMWF solutions given
that Earl will soon be extratropical.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Strong winds are expected over the Avalon Peninsula of
Newfoundland beginning this afternoon and continuing through Sunday,
after Earl becomes a post-tropical low.
 
2. Large swells generated by Earl will affect Bermuda, portions
of the U.S. East Coast, and Nova Scotia and Newfoundland during the
next several days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
