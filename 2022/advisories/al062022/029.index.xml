1100 PM AST Fri Sep 09 2022
 
...EARL GENERATING A LARGE AREA OF HIGH SEAS...
...STORM ACCELERATING TO THE NORTHEAST...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...38.1N 55.9W
ABOUT 610 MI...985 KM SSW OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...105 MPH...165 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 45 DEGREES AT 29 MPH...46 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...954 MB...28.17 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Earl was located
near latitude 38.1 North, longitude 55.9 West. Earl is moving toward
the northeast near 29 mph (46 km/h) and this general motion is 
expected to continue through tomorrow. Earl is then forecast
to slow down considerably Saturday night through Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Slight fluctuations in intensity are possible overnight. 
Earl is expected to complete its transition to a powerful
hurricane-force extratropical low on Saturday and then steadily
weaken through early Monday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275
miles (445 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 954 mb (28.17 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Earl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
WIND:  Gusty winds are expected across the Avalon Peninsula of
Newfoundland over the weekend after Earl becomes a post-tropical
low.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Earl are affecting Bermuda and portions
of the U.S. East Coast and are expected to reach Nova Scotia and
Newfoundland tonight and on Saturday. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions through the
weekend.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Hurricane Earl Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
1100 PM AST Fri Sep 09 2022
 
Earl has maintained its rather large eye that is encircled by  
cloud tops as cold as -70 degrees C this evening.  Microwave 
satellite imagery also shows that Earl still has a symmetric 
inner core and there are no indications of transitioning into an 
extratropical cyclone yet.  Satellite Dvorak classifications from 
SAB and TAFB were 5.0 and therefore, the initial intensity remains 
at 90 kt.  

The cyclone has increased in forward speed to the northeast at an 
estimated 45/25 kt.  This motion is expected to continue for another 
12 hours or so before Earl merges with a mid-latitude trough located 
just west of the storm.  Upon merging, Earl is expected to slow down 
off the coast of Newfoundland in about 24 hours for a couple of days 
while turning eastward.  In about 3 days, Earl is likely to 
accelerate eastward over the North Atlantic.  The official track 
forecast is slightly faster and a little south of the previous 
prediction and close to the corrected model consensus aids.
 
As stated earlier, there are no signs of Earl beginning its 
extratropical transition yet.  However, statistical model guidance 
suggests the vertical wind shear will rapidly increase over the 
hurricane shortly and induce weakening.  The tropical-storm-force 
winds are expected to expand as Earl becomes a post-tropical cyclone 
over the next day or so.  This will cause it to continue to produce 
large waves and swell in a vast area of the western Atlantic even 
as Earl weakens.  There is a high risk of rip current conditions 
across the U.S. East Coast, Bermuda, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland 
through the weekend.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Swells generated by Earl are affecting Bermuda and the U.S. East
Coast and are beginning to reach Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.  
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions through the weekend.  Please consult products 
from your local weather office.
