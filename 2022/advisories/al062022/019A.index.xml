Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Wed Sep 7 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Danielle, located several hundred miles northwest of the Azores, and <br/>
on Hurricane Earl, located several hundred miles south of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic: <br/>
Satellite imagery indicates that the area of low pressure located <br/>
several hundred miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands is gradually <br/>
becoming better defined. However, the associated shower and <br/>
thunderstorm activity still remains disorganized. Environmental <br/>
conditions appear conducive for additional development of this <br/>
system over the next day or two, and a tropical depression is likely <br/>
form by Friday while it moves westward to west-northwestward at 15 <br/>
to 20 mph over the eastern and central tropical Atlantic.  After <br/>
that time, upper-level winds are forecast to become less conducive <br/>
for development.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
African Coast:<br/>
A tropical wave currently located near the west African coast is <br/>
forecast to emerge offshore into the eastern Atlantic over the next <br/>
day or so. Environmental conditions appear conducive for some <br/>
gradual development thereafter as the system moves <br/>
west-northwestward over the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Earl was located 
near latitude 26.0 North, longitude 65.7 West. Earl is moving toward 
the north near 8 mph (13 km/h), and a continued northward motion is 
expected to continue through tonight.  A turn toward the 
north-northeast and then northeast with an increase in forward speed 
is expected to begin on Thursday and continue through early 
Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of Earl is expected to 
pass to the southeast of Bermuda on Thursday night.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that maximum sustained winds remain near 85 mph (140 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of 
days, and Earl is expected to become a major hurricane on Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140
miles (220 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from the Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 974 mb (28.76 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Hurricane Earl Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
1100 AM AST Wed Sep 07 2022

While it is evident that westerly vertical wind shear continues to 
affect the overall satellite presentation of Earl, useful data 
from the NOAA-P3 Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicates that the 
hurricane is holding its own and has even strengthened a bit. Part 
of this resilience could be due to the fact that the low and 
mid-level centers of Earl are now vertically stacked with the wind 
field relatively symmetric per the most recent set of Tail Doppler 
Radar from the aircraft. However, the westerly shear is still 
affecting the inner-core structure of the system, with its large 40 
n mi wide eye open in the southern semicircle. The highest flight- 
level winds from this morning's mission was 82 kt at 700 mb with 
SFMR at 75 kt. The initial intensity was increased to 75 kt at the 
8am intermediate advisory and remains this value for this advisory.
 
Fixes from this morning indicate that Earl has been moving just east 
of due north, with the motion estimated at 005/6 kt. The hurricane 
is caught in between a mid-level ridge now centered to its 
southeast, with a positively-tilted upper-level trough located to 
the northwest. This synoptic setup should enable Earl to begin 
recurving north-northeastward and then northeastward as it 
accelerates over the next 24-48 hours. The track guidance remains 
tightly clustered during the early portion of the forecast, with the 
GFS and ECMWF tracks now nearly identical during this period. The 
official track forecast was only adjusted a touch east of the prior 
one during this period. However, as noted previously, there is 
increasing model support that the upper-level trough will ultimately 
phase with Earl after 72 hours, resulting in the cyclone slowing 
down significantly and potentially turning more northward in days 
4-5. The official track forecast during this period now shows a bit 
more of a northward bend and further slowdown compared to the prior 
track, favoring a blend of the latest GFS and ECMWF forecast.  
 
The persistent deep-layer westerly vertical wind shear that has been 
impacting Earl the last several days is finally forecast to subside 
later today, dropping below 10 kt in 24 hours. This decreasing 
shear, in combination with very warm sea-surface temperatures, 
favorable positioning in the right-entrance region of an upper-level 
jet streak, and significant acceleration in the storm motion, is 
likely to result in substantial strengthening of the surface wind 
field and the latest NHC intensity forecast now shows a peak at 115 
kt in 60-h, in good general agreement with the latest HCCA, yet 
still under the LGEM intensity aid. After that, a significant 
trough interaction is likely to rapidly increase baroclinicity, with 
Earl forecast to become an extratropical-low as it phases with the 
upper-level trough between days 3-4 in the forecast period.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Although Earl's center is forecast to pass southeast of Bermuda,
the wind field is expected to grow, with tropical-storm-force winds
forecast to spread across the island beginning Thursday afternoon
and continuing through Friday morning.
 
2.  Swells generated by Earl are expected to reach Bermuda by 
tonight and the U.S. East Coast shortly thereafter.  These swells 
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions through the weekend.  Please consult products from your 
local weather office.

Hurricane Danielle Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
300 PM GMT Wed Sep 07 2022
 
Danielle is an impressive hurricane for so far north and east in
the Atlantic Ocean, thanks to near-record warm SSTs in the vicinity 
and a high-latitude blocking pattern.  Satellite images show that 
the cyclone has a large eye with a broken eyewall, although
recently the eyewall convection has degraded a bit.  The current
intensity is set to 70 kt, a blend of the recent TAFB/SAB fixes.  A
recent scatterometer pass also show that the hurricane has grown in
size, and this is reflected in the analysis and size forecast. 
Additionally, drifting buoy 41047 has reported 984.7 mb well 
outside of the eye, and the central pressure has been lowered to be 
in better agreement with this data.
 
The hurricane is already showing some signs of extratropical
transition, with the cloud pattern starting to elongate on the
northern side.  This is a harbinger of an incoming trough which, in
combination with cold SSTs, should result in a quick extratropical
transition of Danielle in about 24 hours.  Global and regional
hurricane models are in good agreement on a gradual decline in wind
speeds during the forecast period, and little change was made to
the previous NHC intensity forecast.
 
Danielle is moving northeastward at about 14 kt.  The cyclone is
expected to execute a large counterclockwise loop due to a
mid-latitude trough diving southward from the Canadian Maritimes.
Danielle should merge with this trough and be the dominant feature
as it moves east-southeastward across the north Atlantic.  Only
small changes were made to the last forecast, and the new forecast
is close to the Atlantic tropical cyclone consensus track aid TVCA.
 
The tropical cyclone continues to produce a large area of very
rough seas over the central-north Atlantic.  More information can be
found in the High Seas Forecasts issued by the Ocean Prediction
Center under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and
online at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php.  The UK Met Office
also has information in High Seas Forecasts for the west Central
and east Central sections issued under WMO header FQNT21 EGRR and
on the web at
