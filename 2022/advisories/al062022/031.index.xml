...EARL FORECAST TO BECOME A EXTRATROPICAL LOW LATER TODAY...
...EXPECTED TO PRODUCE STRONG WINDS OVER EXTREME SOUTHEASTERN
NEWFOUNDLAND THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH SUNDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...42.9N 53.0W
ABOUT 260 MI...420 KM S OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 25 DEGREES AT 29 MPH...46 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...960 MB...28.35 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Earl was located
near latitude 42.9 North, longitude 53.0 West. Earl is now moving 
toward the north-northeast near 29 mph (46 km/h).  An additional 
decrease in forward speed is expected today, with Earl moving 
slowly northeastward to the southeast of Newfoundland tonight 
through Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 90 mph (150 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Earl is forecast to become a powerful 
hurricane-force extratropical low this afternoon.  After that, 
weakening is expected, and Earl's winds are likely to fall below 
hurricane force tonight or early Sunday.
 
Earl is a large cyclone.  Hurricane-force winds extend outward up 
to 90 miles (150 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds 
extend outward up to 415 miles (665 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 960 mb (28.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Earl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
WIND:  Strong winds are expected across the Avalon Peninsula of
Newfoundland this afternoon through Sunday, after Earl becomes a
post-tropical low.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Earl will affect Bermuda, portions
of the U.S. East Coast, and Nova Scotia and Newfoundland in
Canada during the next several days.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Earl Discussion Number  31
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
1100 AM AST Sat Sep 10 2022

Earl continues to undergo extratropical transition as it merges 
with the mid-latitude trough seen in GOES-16 airmass imagery near 
and to the west of the hurricane.  The central convection is 
starting to shear away from the low-level center and cold-air clouds 
are wrapping around the south side of the circulation. The initial 
intensity is reduced to 80 kt based on a combination of subjective 
and objective Dvorak intensity estimates.

Earl should complete extratropical transition during the next 6 h 
or so, with the system maintaining  hurricane-force winds during 
this time.  After that, the cyclone is expected to gradually weaken 
during the next 72 h as it moves over the open North Atlantic.  The 
new intensity forecast has been adjusted downward during the first 
48 h to match the trend of the intensity guidance, and then is 
similar to the previous forecast.

Earl has turned a little to the left and slowed its forward motion 
since the last advisory, with the initial motion now 025/25 kt.  As 
Earl merges with the mid-latitude trough, an additional 
significant decease in forward speed is expected during the next 12 
h, followed by a slow northeastward motion that should continue 
through Sunday night.  Subsequently, Earl should be steered 
generally eastward by the mid-latitude westerlies.  The new 
forecast track has been shifted to the northwest of the previous 
track during the first 36 h and is close to the previous track 
thereafter. The northwestward shift of the track, along with 
Earl's large wind field, is expected to lead to strong winds 
occurring over the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland beginning this 
afternoon and continuing through Sunday.  For additional information 
on impacts in Newfoundland, please monitor forecasts and warnings 
from Environment Canada.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Strong winds are expected over the Avalon Peninsula of
Newfoundland beginning this afternoon and continuing through Sunday,
after Earl becomes a post-tropical low.
 
2. Large swells generated by Earl will affect Bermuda, portions
of the U.S. East Coast, and Nova Scotia and Newfoundland during the
next several days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
