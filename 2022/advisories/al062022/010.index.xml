...EARL NOW MOVING NORTH-NORTHWESTWARD WITH LITTLE CHANGE IN
STRENGTH...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.9N 65.3W
ABOUT 175 MI...280 KM N OF ST. THOMAS
ABOUT 790 MI...1270 KM S OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 335 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...998 MB...29.47 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands,
Puerto Rico, and Bermuda should monitor the progress of Earl.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Earl was
located near latitude 20.9 North, longitude 65.3 West. Earl is
moving toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h).  A turn 
toward the north at a slightly faster forward speed is expected 
later today, with this motion continuing for the next couple of 
days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Slow strengthening is forecast over the next several days, and Earl
could become a hurricane later this week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.  NOAA data buoy 41043 recently reported a
sustained wind of 43 mph (69 km/h) with a gust to 49 mph          
(79 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).  
NOAA data buoy 41043 recently reported a pressure of 1001.4 mb 
(29.57 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Earl is expected to produce additional rainfall amounts of
1 to 4 inches, with isolated storm totals of 8 inches, across the
Leeward Islands, U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico
through Monday.
 
Limited flash, urban, and small stream flooding impacts are
possible.  Rapid rises on rivers and mudslides in areas of steep
terrain are also possible, especially across the central interior
region of Puerto Rico. Locally considerable flood impacts are
possible in areas that will receive heavier rainfall totals.
 
WIND:  Gusty winds, especially in squalls, are possible across the
northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico
for a few more hours.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Earl Forecast Discussion Number 10</title>

Tropical Storm Earl Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
500 AM AST Mon Sep 05 2022

Satellite imagery this morning shows that Earl continues to produce 
strong convection to the northeast of the center.  However, data 
from the SHIPS model and analyses from CIMSS at the University 
of Wisconsin indicate that there is now 20-25 kt of southwesterly 
vertical shear impacting the cyclone.  As a result, the low-level 
center remains located near or just outside of the southwestern 
edge of the main convective mass.  Satellite intensity estimates 
have changed little since the last advisory, and data from NOAA 
buoy 41043 suggests the central pressure is still in the 998-1000 
mb range.  Based on this, the initial intensity remains 45 kt.  
Earlier scatterometer data showed that the circulation center was 
elongated from northeast to southwest, and recent wind obs suggest 
the northeast end of the elongation is near the NOAA buoy.

Earl is turning more northward, with the initial motion now 335/4 
kt.  For the next three days or so, the storm should move slowly 
northward in the flow between the subtropical ridge to the east and 
a mid- to upper-level trough to the west and northwest.  After 
that, a motion more toward the northeast is expected as Earl 
reaches the southern edge of the mid-latitude westerlies.  The 
large-scale models are in poor agreement on the features in the 
westerlies that Earl will encounter, with the GFS showing stronger 
flow and a faster motion than the UKMET and ECMWF.  The new 
forecast track is changed little through 60 h, then it is nudged a 
little westward based on a shift in the guidance envelope.  The 
track lies close to the various consensus models, and the speed at 
the end is a compromise between the faster GFS and the slower 
UKMET/ECMWF.

The large-scale models suggest that the current shear will persist 
for about the next 48 h.  After 48-60 h, Earl may find a region of 
lighter shear that could allow more significant strengthening.  
The new intensity forecast is a little slower to intensify Earl 
through 48 h based on the shear forecast, and it is possible that 
Earl could strengthen less than forecast during this time.  Later 
on, the new forecast is similar to the previous forecast.  It 
should be noted that if Earl does find a more favorable environment 
later in the forecast period, there are several models with a higher 
120-h forecast intensity than the current official forecast of 105 
kt.
 
While tropical-storm-force winds are still forecast to stay north of
the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico,
training rainbands are producing heavy rainfall over portions of
these islands.  Users should refer to products issued by local
weather offices in these areas.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Heavy rainfall from Earl is expected to lead to limited flash,
urban, and small stream flooding impacts over the Leeward Islands,
U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico today. Rapid rises
on rivers and mudslides in areas of steep terrain are possible in
Puerto Rico.  Considerable flood impacts cannot be ruled out in
areas that receive heavier rainfall totals.
 
2.  Earl is forecast to remain to the north of the the Virgin
Islands and Puerto Rico today, but gusty winds, especially in
squalls, remain possible on those islands for a few more hours.

Hurricane Danielle Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
900 AM GMT Mon Sep 05 2022
 
There's been little change in Danielle's cloud pattern during the
past 6 hours, and a clear symmetric warm 13C banding eye feature
has persisted and has intermittently been closing off.  The 
satellite intensity estimates haven't changed, and the initial
intensity is held at 80 kt for this advisory.
 
Little change in strength is forecast through today.  Afterward,
the cyclone should slowly weaken through the entire period as it
moves over cooler water while increasing southwesterly shear
disrupts the upper outflow pattern.  The CMC, UKMET, and the GFS
agree with Danielle to begin an extratropical transition around 36 
hours and complete its change by 72 hours (Thursday).  This cyclone 
transformation timeline is reflected in the NHC forecast, and the 
predicted 5-day intensity closely follows the IVCN and HCCA aids.
 
The hurricane's initial motion is estimated to be 030 at 7 kt, a 
little faster than previously noted.  Danielle should continue to 
accelerate and move north-northeastward to northeastward through 
early Tuesday in response to a mid-latitude baroclinic system 
approaching from the northwest, out of the Canadian Maritimes.  By 
Tuesday night, the cyclone should turn toward the east-northeast 
within the mid-latitude westerly steering flow and continue in 
this general motion for 60 hours.  A turn back toward the northeast 
is forecast as an extratropical cyclone on Thursday.  It's 
worth mentioning that earlier today, there was quite a bit of 
uncertainty (global model cross-track spread) about Danielle's 
trajectory beyond the mid-period.  The GFS and the UKMET predict 
Danielle will turn back toward the northeast Wednesday in the 
southwesterly peripheral flow of a larger baroclinic low 
approaching the cyclone from the northwest Atlantic.  However, the 
ECMWF 12 and 18z runs showed considerably less baroclinic low 
influence while continuing toward the east-northeast, southwest of 
the British Isles.  The latest 00z run, subsequently, has trended 
more toward the GFS/UKMET solution, which has resulted in some 
increase in track forecast confidence.  Accordingly, the NHC 
forecast is again adjusted slightly north of the previous one to 
align more with a consensus (TVCA) of the models mentioned above.
