DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Earl was located
near latitude 38.1 North, longitude 55.9 West. Earl is moving toward
the northeast near 29 mph (46 km/h) and this general motion is 
expected to continue through tomorrow. Earl is then forecast
to slow down considerably Saturday night through Monday.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Slight fluctuations in intensity are possible overnight. 
Earl is expected to complete its transition to a powerful
hurricane-force extratropical low on Saturday and then steadily
weaken through early Monday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275
miles (445 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 954 mb (28.17 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Earl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml

WIND:  Gusty winds are expected across the Avalon Peninsula of
Newfoundland over the weekend after Earl becomes a post-tropical
low.

SURF:  Swells generated by Earl are affecting Bermuda and portions
of the U.S. East Coast and are expected to reach Nova Scotia and
Newfoundland tonight and on Saturday. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions through the
weekend.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
