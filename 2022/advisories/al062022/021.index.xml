Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Wed Sep 7 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Danielle, located several hundred miles northwest of the Azores, and <br/>
on Hurricane Earl, located several hundred miles south of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic: <br/>
An area of low pressure located several hundred miles west of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands continues to produce disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms. Environmental conditions appear conducive for <br/>
additional development of this system and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form in the next couple of days while it moves westward <br/>
to west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic.  After that time, upper-level winds are forecast to become <br/>
less conducive for development.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
West Coast of Africa:<br/>
A tropical wave currently located near the west coast of Africa is <br/>
forecast to emerge into the eastern Atlantic tomorrow.  <br/>
Environmental conditions appear conducive for some gradual <br/>
development thereafter as the system moves west-northwestward over <br/>
the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Earl was located
near latitude 27.2 North, longitude 65.5 West. Earl is moving toward
the north near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A turn toward the north-northeast
is expected overnight followed by a turn to the northeast during the
day on Thursday with a gradual increase in forward speed.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 100 mph (155 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Significant strengthening is forecast during the
next couple of days, and Earl is expected to become a major
hurricane tomorrow.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).
 
The minimum central pressure reported by the NOAA Hurricane Hunter
aircraft is 970 mb (28.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Earl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
late Thursday.  Hurricane conditions are possible on Bermuda
beginning late Thursday.
 
RAINFALL:  Earl is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 1 to 2
inches (25 to 50 mm) across Bermuda through Friday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Earl are expected to reach Bermuda 
overnight and the U.S. east coast shortly thereafter. These swells 
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions
through the weekend.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.

Hurricane Earl Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 07 2022
 
Earl has resumed intensifying this evening.  A NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft reported a maximum flight-level wind of 107 kt (which 
reduces to an intensity of about 95 kt), and the central pressure 
has fallen to 970 mb.  Both SFMR and dropsonde data support surface 
winds of 80 kt.  Onboard radar has also confirmed a rather large eye 
of almost 60 miles (90 km) and a fairly symmetric wind field.  The 
initial intensity is increased to 85 kt as a blend of all available 
aircraft data, and considering the drop in pressure.
 
Aircraft center fixes confirm that Earl is still moving northward at 
about 8 kt.  This motion is expected to gradually turn 
north-northeastward and northeastward and accelerate as Earl moves 
between a mid-level ridge to the southeast, and a digging 
mid-latitude trough to the northwest in the next couple of days.  
The trough is forecast to capture Earl, however there is some 
uncertainty in the model guidance to the timing of this interaction 
resulting in a larger spread in the along-track positions beyond 72 
hours.  The official track forecast is very similar to the previous 
forecast and close to the model consensus aids.

The apparent decrease in deep-layer vertical wind shear has likely 
allowed Earl to strengthen.  Global model guidance suggests the 
shear will continue to abate over the next 36 hours and with 
atmospheric conditions remaining conducive, further intensification 
is expected. The NHC intensity forecast now shows a quicker rate of 
strengthening to a peak of 115 kt at 36 hours.  Earl is expected to 
undergo extra-tropical transition in a few days when it moves to 
higher latitudes and interacts with an upper-level trough.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Although Earl's center is forecast to pass southeast of Bermuda,
the wind field is expected to grow, with tropical-storm-force winds
forecast to spread across the island beginning late Thursday and 
continuing through Friday morning.  Hurricane-force winds are 
possible on Bermuda late Thursday or Thursday night if Earl's track 
shifts farther west than is currently forecast.
 
2.  Swells generated by Earl are expected to reach Bermuda by
tonight and the U.S. East Coast shortly thereafter.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions through the weekend.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.

Hurricane Danielle Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
300 AM GMT Thu Sep 08 2022
 
Danielle is beginning to feel the effects of an approaching mid-to 
upper-level trough just to its west. There has been some erosion of 
the deep convection over the southern portion of the circulation, 
likely due to increasing southwesterly shear, while the eye has 
filled with cloud cover. The latest Dvorak intensity estimates have 
overall lowered since the previous advisory, and a blend of these 
values suggest the cyclone's initial intensity has decreased to 65 
kt.
 
The cyclone is expected to undergo extratropical transition through 
Thursday morning due to the higher shear, interaction with the 
trough, and sharply cooler SSTs along its forecast track. These 
conditions are also expected to cause Danielle to gradually weaken. 
The latest NHC intensity forecast was tweaked slightly lower than 
the previous one, and closely follows the various multi-model 
consensus values. 
 
Danielle is moving northeastward at 15 kt, and this general motion 
should continue through tonight. A slow down and counterclockwise 
loop is expected to occur on Thursday and Friday when the cyclone 
interacts with the trough that is expected to cut off. After that 
time, a faster motion to the southeast is forecast, which should 
take the extratropical cyclone toward western Europe by the end of 
the period. The NHC track forecast is little changed from the 
previous one, and is near the latest consensus aids.
 
Danielle continues to produce a large area of very rough seas over
the central-north Atlantic.  More information can be found in the
High Seas Forecasts issued by the Ocean Prediction Center under
AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php. The UK Met Office also has
information in High Seas Forecasts for the west Central and east
Central sections issued under WMO header FQNT21 EGRR and on the web
at metoffice.gov.uk/weather/specialist-forecasts/coast-and-sea/high-
seas-forecast
