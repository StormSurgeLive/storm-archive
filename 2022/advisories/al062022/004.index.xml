DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Earl was 
located near latitude 19.3 North, longitude 63.2 West. Earl is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A slower

next couple of days, followed by a turn toward the north on Tuesday. 
On the forecast track, the center of Earl is expected to pass north 
of the northern Leeward Islands through this evening, and north of 
the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico tonight and Sunday.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Some slow strengthening is forecast during the 
next couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)

to 4 inches, with isolated totals of 6 inches, across the Leeward 
Islands, U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico this 
weekend. 

Limited flash, urban, and small stream flooding impacts are 
possible.  Rapid rises on rivers and mudslides in areas of steep 
terrain are also possible, especially across the central interior 
region of Puerto Rico.
 
WIND:  Gusty winds, especially in squalls, are possible across the
northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico
through Sunday.

Tropical Storm Earl Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
500 PM AST Sat Sep 03 2022
 
Earl has strengthened this afternoon. Satellite data indicate the 
previously exposed low-level center of the cyclone has been drawn 
underneath an area of deep convection, with cloud top temperatures 
colder than -70C. An Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft that 
recently investigated the storm reported max flight-level (925 mb) 
winds of 56 kt. This would support surface winds between 40 and 45
kt using a standard reduction factor. Based on these data, the 
cyclone's improved satellite structure, and falling surface 
pressures throughout the day, the initial intensity of Earl is 
raised to 45 kt for this advisory. 

The cyclone has strengthened some today despite facing moderate 
deep-layer southwesterly shear. The shear is forecast to persist or 
even increase during the next couple of days, so some fluctuation in 
intensity is possible if the deep convection gets stripped away and 
the center becomes exposed again. But, sea-surface temperatures 
greater than 29C should continue to support convective development, 
and the overall trend in the latest intensity guidance favors at 
least slow strengthening into early next week. Then, the models 
suggest that favorable interaction with an upper-level trough over 
the warm waters of the western Atlantic will promote additional 
strengthening, along with a broadening of the wind field. The latest 
NHC intensity forecast has been raised closer to the HCCA and IVCN 
consensus aids, and it now brings Earl up to hurricane strength at 
days 4-5.

The initial motion of Earl is west-northwestward, or 290/9 kt. The 
general forecast track reasoning has not changed. Earl is expected 
to slow down as it moves west-northwestward to northwestward over 
the next couple of days. A weakness in the subtropical ridge should 
allow the cyclone to gradually turn northward early next week, then 
move northeastward as it becomes steered by a mid- to upper-level 
trough over the western Atlantic. The official NHC forecast track is 
very similar to the previous forecast and lies slightly to the left 
of the HCCA and TVCA aids. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds are still forecast to remain on the 
northern and eastern side of the circulation, and are not expected 
to move across the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, or 
Puerto Rico.  However, gusty winds in squalls are possible at these 
locations through Sunday.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Heavy rainfall from Earl is expected to lead to limited flash, 
urban, and small stream flooding impacts over the Leeward Islands, 
U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico this weekend. Rapid 
rises on rivers and mudslides in areas of steep terrain are possible 
in Puerto Rico.
 
2.  Earl is forecast to pass to the north of the the Virgin Islands 
and Puerto Rico tonight and Sunday. Gusty winds, especially in 
squalls, area possible on those islands through Sunday.

Tropical Storm Danielle Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
900 PM GMT Sat Sep 03 2022
 
Danielle's cloud pattern has become better organized during the
past several hours with banding features gaining symmetry around
the center.  However, there are still some dry slots disrupting
the system's inner core.  A blend of the latest satellite intensity
estimates still supports an intensity of 60 kt, but Danielle could
become a hurricane again soon.  An ASCAT pass from several
hours ago was helpful in adjusting the initial 34- and 50-kt wind
radii.
 
The storm has been moving a little faster to the west at 5 kt and is
back over the same location where it was on Thursday. A continued
slow westward motion is expected into Sunday as the storm remains
steered by a blocking ridge to its north. However, a sharp turn to
the north is forecast by Sunday night followed by a faster motion to
the northeast after that as a trough currently over eastern Canada
approaches Danielle.  The new NHC track forecast has been adjusted
to the left in the short term, but ends up to the east of the
previous track at 96 and 120 h, trending toward the latest
consensus aids.
 
Danielle is expected to gradually pull away from its own cool SST
wake, and since the atmospheric conditions appear generally
favorable, slow strengthening seems likely during the next day or
two.  Beyond a couple of days, however, sharply cooler SSTs, drier
air, and an increase in vertical wind shear should end the
strengthening trend and induce some weakening.  Danielle is expected
to become fully extratropical by day 5 when it merges with the
approaching trough and moves over SSTs cooler than 20C. The NHC
intensity forecast is again an update of the previous one and
remains in line with the HCCA and IVCN consensus aids.
