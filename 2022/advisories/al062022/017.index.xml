Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Tue Sep 6 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Danielle, located several hundred miles west-northwest of the <br/>
Azores, and on Tropical Storm Earl, located several hundred miles <br/>
south of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic: <br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue near the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands extending southwestward several hundred miles in association <br/>
with a broad area of low pressure.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
conducive for some development of this system, and a tropical <br/>
depression could form in a few days while it moves westward to <br/>
west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the eastern and central <br/>
tropical Atlantic.  Upper-level winds are forecast to become less <br/>
conducive for development late this week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
African Coast:<br/>
A tropical wave currently located over western Africa is forecast to <br/>
emerge offshore into the eastern Atlantic in a day or two. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear generally conducive for some slow <br/>
development thereafter as the system moves west-northwestward over <br/>
the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Earl was located 
near latitude 24.8 North, longitude 65.8 West. Earl is moving toward 
the north near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this motion is expected to

Thursday. On the forecast track, the center of Earl is expected to 
pass to the southeast of Bermuda by Thursday evening.
 
Data from the NOAA Hurricane Hunters indicate that the maximum 
sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher gusts.  
Strengthening is expected over the next couple of days, and Earl is 
forecast to become a major hurricane by Thursday evening.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 985 mb (29.09 inches).

Hurricane Earl Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
1100 PM AST Tue Sep 06 2022
 
Earl continues to be become better organized this evening.  An 
ongoing NOAA reconnaissance mission measured 700-mb flight-level 
winds as high as 80 kt, which supports an intensity of around 70 kt. 
There were some higher winds measured by the SFMR and dropsondes, 
however, we prefer to remain on the conservative side given the 
fluctuations Earl has been experiencing over the past 24 hours.  
Radar images show the eyewall is still open to the south, and Earl 
is likely is still experiencing the affects of strong shear.

The aircraft fixes indicate that Earl is moving northward at 6 kt.  
A mid-level ridge over the hurricane is expected to continue 
weakening while a trough moves off the coast of the eastern United 
States.  This trough is predicted to steer Earl to the northeast in 
about a day or so and accelerate its forward motion poleward.  Once 
again, the track model guidance has shifted west slightly, and the 
NHC track forecast has moved to the west and is closest to the 
correct consensus model guidance.

Despite the model-analyzed strong westerly deep-layer shear, Earl 
has intensified.  This magnitude of shear is predicted to continue 
for another day or so before weakening briefly in about two days for 
a 24-hour period.  Oceanic conditions under the hurricane are 
expected to be conducive for further intensification for the next 
few days as well.  Therefore, the latest official forecast predicts 
the hurricane will continue to intensify for the next 24 hours, with 
a quicker rate of strengthening between 24 and 72 hours.  Earl is 
expected to make its extratropical transition by day 5.   


KEY MESSAGES: 

1.  Although Earl's center is forecast to pass southeast of Bermuda, 
the wind field is expected to grow, with tropical-storm-force winds 
possibly spreading across the island on Thursday.

2.  Swells generated by Earl are expected to reach Bermuda by
Thursday morning.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions through Friday.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Danielle Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
300 AM GMT Wed Sep 07 2022
 
This morning's conventional satellite presentation indicates
little change in Danielle's cloud pattern since yesterday morning.
However, a recent SSMI/S microwave image shows a subtle vertical
tilt toward the east.  The initial intensity is held at 65 kt for 
this advisory and is based on a blend of the subjective and AiDT 
objective satellite intensity estimates and an earlier STAR SAR/S1 
surface wind retrieval that indicated winds of 70 kt.  
 
Danielle should remain over marginally warm waters for the next 
12-18 hours. Subsequently, little change in strength is expected 
during that time.  By early Thursday, Danielle will move over a 
sharp surface temperature gradient of 22C or less.  This negative 
oceanic contribution, combined with the loss of dynamic forcing 
after the cyclone merges with the approaching baroclinic system, 
should induce a slow weakening trend through the end of the period.
 
Danielle's initial motion is estimated to be east-northeastward, or
060/11 kt.  There is no significant change to the NHC forecast
philosophy.  Danielle should continue accelerating in response to a 
vigorous baroclinic system approaching from the northwest Atlantic 
east of the Newfoundland coast.  Danielle is forecast to interact 
with the system mentioned above late Thursday night.  On Friday, the 
two systems are predicted to merge and become a larger and strong 
extratropical low with asymmetric deep warm core characteristics 
typical of warm seclusions.  Over the weekend, the large 
post-tropical low is expected to turn east-southeastward and 
maintain this general motion through early next week.
 
Danielle is producing a vast area of very rough seas over the
central-north Atlantic. More information can be found in the
High Seas Forecasts issued by the Ocean Prediction Center under
AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php.
The UK Met Office also has information in High Seas Forecasts for
the west Central and east Central sections issued under WMO header
FQNT21 EGRR and on the web at
metoffice.gov.uk/weather/specialist-forecasts/coast-and-sea/high-
