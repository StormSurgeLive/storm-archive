Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Fri Sep 9 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Earl, located a few hundred miles east-northeast of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic: <br/>
An area of low pressure located about 1000 miles east of the Leeward <br/>
Islands is producing limited shower and thunderstorm activity, <br/>
mostly displaced well to the northeast of the center of the low. <br/>
Strong upper-level winds are expected to prevent significant <br/>
development of this system while it moves generally <br/>
west-northwestward or northwestward for the next day or so. The <br/>
disturbance is then forecast to merge with a non-tropical system <br/>
over the weekend. For more information on this system, including <br/>
gale warnings, please refer to the High Seas Forecasts issued by the <br/>
National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located several hundred miles south of the Cabo <br/>
Verde Islands is producing a disorganized area of showers and <br/>
thunderstorms. No substantial development of this system is expected <br/>
through the middle of next week while it moves westward or <br/>
west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph across the eastern and central <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Near the Coast of Africa:<br/>
Another tropical wave is forecast to move off the coast of Africa <br/>
by early next week. Some gradual development of the wave will be <br/>
possible after it moves over water and heads generally westward <br/>
over the far eastern Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>

Hurricane Earl Advisory Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
500 PM AST Fri Sep 09 2022
 
...LARGE EARL WILL CONTRIBUTE TO HIGH RIP CURRENT THREAT ACROSS
THE WEST ATLANTIC THIS WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...35.9N 58.7W
ABOUT 430 MI...690 KM NE OF BERMUDA
ABOUT 800 MI...1285 KM SSW OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...105 MPH...165 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 35 DEGREES AT 26 MPH...43 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...954 MB...28.17 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the large ragged eye of Hurricane Earl 
was located near latitude 35.9 North, longitude 58.7 West. Earl is 
accelerating toward the northeast near 26 mph (43 km/h). A faster 
northeastward motion is anticipated tonight. Earl is then forecast 
to slow down considerably Saturday night through Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Slight fluctuations in intensity are possible this evening. 
Earl is expected to complete its transition to a powerful 
hurricane-force extratropical low on Saturday and then steadily 
weaken through early Monday.
 
Earl is a large hurricane. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up 
to 80 miles (130 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds 
extend outward up to 275 miles (445 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 954 mb (28.17 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Earl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
WIND:  Gusty winds are expected across the Avalon Peninsula of
Newfoundland over the weekend after Earl becomes a post-tropical
low.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Earl are affecting Bermuda and portions
of the U.S. East Coast and are expected to reach Nova Scotia and
Newfoundland tonight and on Saturday. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions through the
weekend.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Earl Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
500 PM AST Fri Sep 09 2022
 
Earl's large (and at times ragged) eye and surrounding convection
were finally organized enough at 1800 UTC to get consensus Dvorak
classifications of 5.0 from TAFB and SAB, an indication that the
hurricane has strengthened slightly with an estimated intensity of
90 kt. Even then, a mid-latitude frontal feature is quickly
approaching from the northwest, a sign that Earl isn't likely to
last much longer as a relatively symmetric hurricane. In fact, 
since 18Z, Earl's eye has already become partially obscured by 
clouds once again.
 
The hurricane continues to accelerate toward the northeast, and is
forecast to accelerate further during the next 12 h ahead of the 
aforementioned mid-latitude trough. Earl is forecast to merge with 
this feature and slow abruptly in about 36 to 48 h. A slightly 
faster eastward motion is forecast around day 4-5. The track model 
guidance remains tightly packed around the multi-model consensus, 
which is the basis of the NHC forecast once again. Only small 
modifications were made to the track forecast with this advisory.

Earl has a few more hours before it begins extratropical transition 
and some very short-term further intensification can't be completely 
ruled out. However, by tomorrow morning Earl should begin to 
steadily weaken as it becomes post-tropical. As noted before, the 
wind field of Earl will expand even as its peak winds begin to 
decrease, which will cause it to continue to produce large waves and 
swell across a large portion of the western Atlantic. This will 
contribute to a high risk of rip currents across the U.S. East 
Coast, Bermuda, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland through the weekend.


KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Swells generated by Earl are affecting Bermuda and the U.S. East
Coast and are expected to reach Nova Scotia and Newfoundland tonight
and on Saturday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions through the weekend.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
