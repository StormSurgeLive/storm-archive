Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Thu Sep 8 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Earl, located less than 140 miles south of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic: <br/>
A low pressure system located about 1300 miles east of the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands is producing shower and thunderstorm activity that <br/>
is displaced well to the northeast of the circulation center by <br/>
strong upper-level winds. Environmental conditions appear to be only <br/>
marginally conducive for additional development.  However, an <br/>
increase in organization of the system could still result in the <br/>
formation of a short-lived tropical cyclone in the next day or so as <br/>
it moves westward to west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the <br/>
central tropical Atlantic.  By this weekend, environmental <br/>
conditions are forecast to become less conducive for development. <br/>
For more information on this system, including Gale Warnings, please <br/>
refer to the High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather <br/>
Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located several hundred miles south-southeast of <br/>
the Cabo Verde Islands is producing a disorganized area of showers <br/>
and thunderstorms. Environmental conditions appear conducive for <br/>
some gradual development during the next several days while the <br/>
system moves generally west-northwestward over the eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>

...OUTER RAINBANDS OF EARL PRODUCING TROPICAL-STORM-FORCE GUSTS ON 
BERMUDA...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...31.3N 63.7W
ABOUT 95 MI...150 KM SE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 30 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...964 MB...28.47 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Bermuda Weather Service has discontinued the Hurricane Watch
for Bermuda.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case overnight.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products 
issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Earl was located
near latitude 31.3 North, longitude 63.7 West. Earl is moving toward
the north-northeast near 15 mph (24 km/h), and an increase in
forward speed is expected tonight, with a turn toward the northeast
tomorrow.
 
Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that maximum 
sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher gusts.  
Re-strengthening is still possible, and Earl could become a major 
hurricane by tomorrow. Thereafter, some weakening and a
transition into a powerful extratropical cyclone is forecast on
Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).  L.F. Wade International Airport on Bermuda recently 
reported a sustained wind of 37 mph (59 km/h) and a gust to 49 mph 
(80 km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure reported by the NOAA plane is 964 mb 
(28.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Earl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda overnight.
 
RAINFALL:  Earl is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 1 to 3
inches (25 to 75 mm) across Bermuda through Friday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Earl are affecting Bermuda and are
expected to reach the U.S. east coast tonight. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions
through the weekend.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Hurricane Earl Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
1100 PM AST Thu Sep 08 2022
 
The satellite and airborne radar presentation of Earl has continued
to degrade this evening.  The eye has expanded to 50 n mi wide,
become more ragged in appearance, and is open to the south.  A NOAA
Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigating the system has only found
peak flight-level winds of 89 kt and surface wind measurements of 75
kt.  The minimum central pressure has also risen to a reported 964
mb.  Based on these data and accounting for potential undersampling 
of the wind field, the initial intensity has been lowered to 80 kt 
on this advisory cycle.
 
The hurricane is moving north-northeastward at 13 kt.  The forward
motion is expected to increase as Earl is caught up in the
southwesterly flow between a mid-level ridge to the east, and a
digging mid-latitude trough to the northwest.  A mid-level trough
moving off the eastern seaboard is forecast to capture the storm and
slow Earl's motion off the Canadian coast.  There is some
uncertainty in timing of this interaction which is leading to a
larger spread in model track guidance in the 60-96 h forecast
range.
 
Statistical model guidance insists that Earl has another day or so 
of conducive atmospheric and oceanic conditions in which to 
strengthen.  However, the recent degradation in structural 
organization of the hurricane may be difficult to overcome in a 
short period of time.  The peak intensity of the official forecast 
has been lowered to 100 kt at 24 hours.  Beyond a day, the vertical 
wind shear is predicted to increase dramatically and induce rapid 
weakening, and extratropical transition is likely to occur within 48 
hours.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Although Earl's center is forecast to pass southeast of Bermuda,
tropical-storm-force winds are expected on the island tonight into
tomorrow morning.
 
2.  Swells generated by Earl are affecting Bermuda and are expected 
to reach the U.S. East Coast tonight. These swells are likely to 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions through the 
weekend.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
