Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD<br/>
200 PM EDT Tue Sep 6 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane<br/>
Danielle, located about 800 miles west-northwest of the Azores,<br/>
and on Tropical Storm Earl, located less than 600 miles south of<br/>
Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue near the Cabo Verde<br/>
Islands extending southwestward several hundred miles in association<br/>
with a broad area of low pressure.  Environmental conditions are<br/>
conducive for some development of this system, and a tropical<br/>
depression could form in a few days while moving westward to<br/>
west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the eastern and central<br/>
tropical Atlantic.  Upper-level winds are forecast to become less<br/>
conducive for development late this week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
African Coast:<br/>
A tropical wave currently located over western Africa is forecast to<br/>
emerge offshore into the eastern Atlantic in a day or two.<br/>
Environmental conditions appear generally conducive for some slow<br/>
development thereafter as the system moves west-northwestward over<br/>
the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

<title>Tropical Storm Earl Forecast Discussion Number 15</title>

Tropical Storm Earl Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
1100 AM AST Tue Sep 06 2022
 
The structure of Earl this morning is trying to regroup, though 
strong westerly vertical wind shear continues to affect the system. 
A new burst of deep convection has been attempting to form a little 
closer to the low-level center. Morning data from the NOAA-P3 
Hurricane Reconnaissance mission show that the mid-level center has 
shifted back downshear of the center, though the vertical depth of 
the overall circulation is deeper than 24 hours ago. The peak flight 
winds from the mission were 62 kt at 700mb, with SFMR values in the 
50-55 kt range. The initial intensity is maintained at 55 kt for 
this advisory, which is also in line with the subjective Dvorak 
estimates. 

Earl took a bit of a jog to the northwest this morning, but the 
larger mean motion is still generally northward at 360/4 kt. The 
gentle mid-level ridging that has been overhead of Earl is forecast 
to gradually break down and shift off to the southeast, as a 
positively-tilted deep-layer trough moves offshore of the eastern 
United States. Ultimately, this trough is expected to capture the 
tropical cyclone, helping Earl to recurve to the northeast in the 
2-4 day forecast period. How sharp and fast this turn to the 
northeast though remains uncertain, with the GFS showing a slower 
turn in comparison to some of the other guidance. The updated NHC 
track forecast lies very close to the previous official forecast, 
closest to the HCCA consensus aid, and roughly in between the 
westward GFS and eastward ECMWF for the first 72 hours of the 
forecast period.

Strong 25-30 kt of vertical wind shear is expected to keep Earl in 
check today, with little intensification forecast in the short 
term. However, shear begins to decrease markedly in about 36 h, 
with both the GFS- and ECMWF-SHIPS shear dropping under 10 kt in 
60-72 hours. Thus, the latest forecast continues to indicate Earl 
becoming a major hurricane around that time-frame. After 96 h, Earl 
is forecast to begin undergoing extratropical transition, with the 
latest forecast indicating that process completing by day 5.
 
Earl's center is expected to pass to the southeast of Bermuda in 
60-72 hours. However, the size of the wind field of the tropical 
cyclone is expected to increase significantly, and interests on the 
island should continue to monitor the progress of the storm closely.

Hurricane Danielle Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
900 PM GMT Tue Sep 06 2022
 
Danielle is holding its own over the north-central Atlantic. The 
cyclone's structure has stabilized since early this morning and the 
cloud tops have been cooling slightly over the past several hours, 
suggesting that any weakening that had been occurring overnight has 
temporarily ended. The initial intensity is being held at 65 kt for 
this advisory, which is based on the latest subjective Dvorak 
intensity estimate from SAB, and objective data from UW-CIMSS.
 
The hurricane continues to move slowly east-northeastward, or 070/6 
kt. There is no change to the forecast track reasoning. Danielle is 
expected to accelerate east-northeastward tonight in the increasing 
flow ahead of a digging upper-level trough. This trough is forecast 
to spawn a baroclinic system west of Danielle by late this week, 
forcing it to make a cyclonic loop while the two systems merge into 
a larger extratropical low. The merged system is then forecast to 
move east-southeastward to southeastward over the weekend. There 
were no significant changes to the NHC track forecast compared to 
the previous advisory, as model guidance remains in good agreement.
 
Danielle is forecast to continue over SSTs of about 25 degrees C 
over the next 18-24 h, so only minor fluctuations in strength is 
indicated during that time. However, by late Wednesday the cyclone 
should cross a tight SST gradient and begin traversing over waters 
of 20 degrees C or less for the remainder of the forecast period. 
The combination of these cooler waters and the interaction with the 
baroclinic system should cause extratropical transition to complete 
by Thursday. The latest NHC intensity forecast closely follows the 
latest multi-model consensus.
 
Danielle is producing a large area of very rough seas over the
central-north Atlantic. More information can be found in the 
High Seas Forecasts issued by the Ocean Prediction Center under 
AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php.
