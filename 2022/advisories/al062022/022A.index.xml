Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Thu Sep 8 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Danielle, located several hundred miles north-northwest of the <br/>
Azores, and on Hurricane Earl, located a few hundred miles south of <br/>
Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic: <br/>
An area of low pressure located almost a thousand miles <br/>
west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands is producing a concentrated <br/>
area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms primarily east of its <br/>
center. Environmental conditions appear only marginally conducive <br/>
for additional development of this system, but only a small increase <br/>
in organization could result in the formation of a short-lived <br/>
tropical depression or storm later today while it moves westward to <br/>
west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic.  After that time, upper-level winds are forecast to become <br/>
less conducive for development.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave has recently emerged off the west coast of Africa <br/>
this morning and is producing an area of disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms. Environmental conditions appear conducive for some <br/>
gradual development as the system moves generally west-northwestward <br/>
over the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

today, followed by a turn toward the northeast on Friday.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Earl is expected to pass to the 
southeast of Bermuda this evening and tonight.
 
Data from the current NOAA Hurricane Hunter mission so far suggests 
that maximum sustained winds remain near 105 mph (165 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast during the next 
couple of days, and Earl is expected to become a major hurricane 
later today.  The hurricane is forecast to become a powerful 
post-tropical low on Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160
miles (260 km).
 
The minimum central pressure from the NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
reconnaissance data is 965 mb (28.50 inches).

Hurricane Earl Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
500 AM AST Thu Sep 08 2022
 
Earl has developed a 20-30 n mi wide eye in infrared satellite 
imagery, although a recent Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter flight 
indicates that the circulation is still tilted toward the east with 
height due to continued moderate shear.  That said, this particular 
flight measured a peak 700-mb flight-level wind of 97 kt and SFMR 
winds as high as 82 kt, while the central pressure dropped to 969 
mb.  Recent research on SFMR measurements from the NOAA Hurricane 
Research Division and the University of Miami has shown that the 
SFMR undersampling for a hurricane of Earl's size is typically 
about 10 percent, which would suggest that the maximum winds are up 
to around 90 kt.  This estimate also more closely aligns to the 
107-kt flight-level wind measured by the NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
flight last evening.

The reconnaissance mission found Earl's low-level center to be 
located just a bit to the west of the previous forecast track, and 
it's still moving toward the north (005 degrees) at 8 kt.  With a 
shortwave trough now moving off the New England and Mid-Atlantic 
coasts, Earl is expected to turn north-northeastward and begin 
accelerating later today, with its center forecast to pass 
50-100 n mi to the southeast of Bermuda during the next 12 to 24 
hours.  Earl should then turn northeastward in about 36 hours and 
reach its fastest forward speed in about 48 hours.  Soon thereafter, 
Earl is forecast to become embedded within the aforementioned 
trough, which will cause it to slow down considerably and possibly 
even meander to the southeast of Newfoundland in 3 to 4 days.  The 
new NHC track prediction is shifted a bit westward during the first 
48 hours, mainly to account for the recent movement of Earl's 
center.  The forecast is a bit north of and slower than the previous 
forecast on days 3 through 5, shifted toward the GFS, ECMWF, and 
multi-model consensus aids.

Deep-layer shear is expected to decrease to less than 10 kt in just 
a few hours.  Along with waters remaining at or above 29 degrees 
Celsius for the next 36 hours, the more conducive atmospheric 
conditions are expected to cause Earl to strengthen further, 
reaching major hurricane intensity later today, and likely peaking 
in strength in 36-48 hours.  Earl will start to become involved 
with a frontal boundary and deep-layer trough in about 48 hours, 
and its transition to a powerful extratropical cyclone is now 
expected to be complete to the southeast of Newfoundland by 60 
hours.  The extratropical low is expected to weaken rather quickly, 
with its winds falling below hurricane force between days 3 and 4.  
The NHC intensity prediction closely follows the IVCN and HCCA 
consensus aids for much of the 5-day forecast period.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Although Earl's center is forecast to pass southeast of Bermuda,
tropical-storm-force winds are expected on the island this 
afternoon through early Friday morning.  Hurricane-force winds are 
possible on Bermuda this evening or tonight if Earl's track shifts 
farther west than is currently forecast.
 
2.  Swells generated by Earl are building near Bermuda and are 
expected to reach the U.S. East Coast later today and tonight.  
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions through the weekend.  Please consult products 
from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Danielle Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
900 AM GMT Thu Sep 08 2022
 
Danielle is losing its tropical characteristics. The deep convection 
has completely eroded across the southwestern portion of the 
circulation. There is no longer an eye-like feature as seen 
yesterday, and the system is taking on characteristics more similar 
to the comma-shaped cloud shield of a mid-latitude cyclone. The 
latest Dvorak intensity estimates suggest that Danielle is no longer 
a hurricane, and the initial intensity has been decreased to 60 kt 
for this advisory.
 
The cyclone is expected to quickly complete extratropical transition 
through this morning due to higher shear, interaction with a mid- to 
upper-level trough just to its west, and cool SSTs along its 
forecast track. These conditions are also expected to cause Danielle 
to continue weakening through the remainder of the forecast period. 
The latest NHC intensity forecast was once again tweaked slightly 
lower than the previous one, mainly to adjust for the lower initial 
intensity.
 
Danielle is moving northeastward at 14 kt, and this general motion 
should continue for the next few hours. A slow down and 
counterclockwise loop is expected to occur later today and Friday 
when the cyclone interacts with the trough that is expected to cut 
off. After that time, a faster motion to the southeast is forecast, 
which should take the extratropical cyclone toward western Europe by 
the end of the period. The NHC track forecast was adjusted a little 
to the right after the counterclockwise loop due to an overall shift 
in the model guidance. 
 
Danielle continues to produce a large area of very rough seas over
the central-north Atlantic.  More information can be found in the
High Seas Forecasts issued by the Ocean Prediction Center under
AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php. The UK Met Office also has
information in High Seas Forecasts for the west Central and east
Central sections issued under WMO header FQNT21 EGRR and on the web
at metoffice.gov.uk/weather/specialist-forecasts/coast-and-sea/high-
seas-forecast. Meteo France's High Seas Forecast also includes
information regarding Danielle at http://weather.gmdss.org/II.html.
