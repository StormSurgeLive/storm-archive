Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Fri Sep 9 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Earl, located a couple of hundred miles east-northeast of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic: <br/>
A gale-force low pressure system is located about 1100 miles east of <br/>
the Leeward Islands. Although the low has a well-defined center of <br/>
circulation, strong upper-level winds have caused most of the <br/>
disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity associated with the <br/>
low to be displaced well to its northeast. The strong upper-level <br/>
winds are forecast to persist for the next several days and it is <br/>
becoming less likely that a short-lived tropical storm will form. <br/>
Regardless of development, the disturbance is forecast to move <br/>
generally west-northwestward near 15 mph across the central <br/>
subtropical Atlantic. For more information on this system, including <br/>
gale warnings, please refer to the High Seas Forecasts issued by the <br/>
National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located several hundred miles south of the Cabo <br/>
Verde Islands is producing a disorganized area of showers and <br/>
thunderstorms.  Development of this system, if any, is expected to <br/>
be slow to occur while it moves westward or west-northwestward at <br/>
15 to 20 mph across the eastern and central tropical Atlantic <br/>
through the middle of next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Near the Coast of Africa:<br/>
Another tropical wave is forecast to move off the coast of Africa <br/>
by early next week. Some gradual development of the wave will be <br/>
possible after it moves over water and heads generally westward <br/>
over the far eastern Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Earl was located 
near latitude 33.4 North, longitude 61.7 West. Earl is moving toward 
the northeast near 18 mph (29 km/h). A faster northeastward motion 
is expected today and tonight. Earl is then forecast to slow down 
considerably Saturday night and Sunday. On the forecast track, Earl 
will continue to move northeastward away from Bermuda today and will 
move to the southeast of Newfoundland Saturday and Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Some strengthening is forecast through tonight. Earl is 
expected to complete its transition to a powerful hurricane-force 
extratropical low on Saturday and then gradually weaken through 
early Monday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from 
the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 
miles (335 km).
 
The minimum central pressure is 963 mb (28.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Earl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda for the 
next hour or so. Gusty winds are expected across the Avalon 
Peninsula of Newfoundland over the weekend after Earl becomes a 
post-tropical low.
 
RAINFALL:  Earl is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 1 to 3
inches (25 to 75 mm) across Bermuda through today.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Earl are affecting Bermuda and portions
of the U.S. East Coast and are expected to reach Nova Scotia and
Newfoundland tonight and on Saturday.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions through the
weekend.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Hurricane Earl Forecast Discussion Number 26</title>
<description>Issued at 500 AM AST Fri Sep 09 2022  <![CDATA[<pre>

WTNT41 KNHC 090847
TCDAT1
 
Hurricane Earl Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
500 AM AST Fri Sep 09 2022
 
Radar data from Bermuda and conventional satellite images show that 
Earl's structure has improved a bit overnight with the eye becoming 
better defined and the overall cloud envelope looking more 
symmetric.  An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft measured 
a peak 700-mb flight-level wind of 97 kt and SFMR winds as high as 
77 kt, with the central pressure down slightly to 963 mb.  Based on 
the typical reduction of the flight-level winds, and accounting for 
undersampling of the surface winds, Earl's initial intensity is 
raised back to 85 kt.  Reconnaissance and scatterometer data also 
indicate that Earl's wind field has continued to expand.

Earl is accelerating toward the north-northeast (030 degrees at 15 
kt) ahead of a shortwave trough approaching from the west near the 
New England coast.  The hurricane is forecast to turn northeastward 
today and continue accelerating to speeds of 25-30 kt within 24 
hours.  After that time, however, Earl will merge with the 
aforementioned trough, slowing down considerably to speeds of around 
5 kt to the southeast of Newfoundland in 60-72 hours.  By days 4 and 
5, the system should then move a little bit faster toward the east, 
embedded within the mid-latitude westerlies.  The track guidance is 
in generally good agreement for much of the 5-day forecast period, 
and no significant changes were made to the updated NHC track 
forecast.

Earl will remain over warm waters for another 24 hours or so, and 
the deep-layer shear should be low to moderate during the next 6 to 
12 hours.  As a result, some additional strengthening is anticipated 
through tonight, and the NHC intensity forecast is near the IVCN 
consensus during that period.  A few models, including SHIPS, LGEM, 
and HCCA, still bring Earl to major hurricane strength in 24 hours, 
but given that the cyclone will be starting to undergo extratropical 
transition by then, that scenario is becoming increasingly unlikely 
(although not impossible).  Global model fields indicate that Earl 
should complete the transition to a powerful extratropical low by 36 
hours and then gradually weaken through the remainder of the 
forecast period.  During the extratropical phase, the NHC intensity 
forecast is closest to the GFS solution.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are expected to diminish on Bermuda 
later this morning.
 
2.  Swells generated by Earl are affecting Bermuda and the U.S. East 
Coast and are expected to reach Nova Scotia and Newfoundland tonight 
and on Saturday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening 
surf and rip current conditions through the weekend.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
