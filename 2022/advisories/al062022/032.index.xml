...EARL BECOMES A HURRICANE-FORCE EXTRATROPICAL LOW...
...EXPECTED TO PRODUCE STRONG WINDS OVER EXTREME SOUTHEASTERN
NEWFOUNDLAND THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH SUNDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...43.6N 52.6W
ABOUT 215 MI...345 KM S OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...85 MPH...140 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 25 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...964 MB...28.47 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Earl
was located near latitude 43.6 North, longitude 52.6 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the north-northeast near 10
mph (17 km/h). A turn toward the northeast at a slow forward speed 
is expected tonight. Earl is expected to be southeast of 
Newfoundland Sunday through Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual weakening is expected, and Earl's winds are likely 
to fall below hurricane force tonight or early Sunday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 485
miles (780 km). A Canadian automated station near Cape Race 
recently reported a wind gust of 68 mph (109 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 964 mb (28.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Earl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
WIND:  Strong winds are expected across the Avalon Peninsula of
Newfoundland this afternoon through Sunday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Earl will affect Bermuda, portions
of the U.S. East Coast, and Nova Scotia and Newfoundland in
Canada during the next several days.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system. Additional information on this system can be 
found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather

Post-Tropical Cyclone Earl Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
500 PM AST Sat Sep 10 2022

Satellite imagery shows that Earl has completed extratropical 
transition, with well-developed frontal features and a central core 
that is void of deep convection.  While recent scatterometer 
overpasses did not sample the strongest winds, it showed that Earl 
remains both large and powerful as an extratropical low.  So, the 
initial intensity is set at 75 kt at this time.  The global models 
are in good agreement that the system should gradually weaken 
during the forecast period, with the maximum winds dropping below 
hurricane force between 12-24 h.  The intensity forecast follows 
the trend of the intensity guidance and has some minor adjustments 
from the previous forecast.

Earl has slowed its forward speed considerably since the last 
advisory, with the motion now 025/9 kt.  A slow movement toward the 
northeast is expected during the next 36 h as the system merges 
with a mid-latitude trough.  After that, the post-tropical cyclone 
is expected to move eastward through 96 h, followed by an 
east-northeastward motion.  The track guidance has shifted 
southward between 36-72 h, and the new forecast track is adjusted 
southward during that time as well.  The forecast slow motion, 
along with Earl's large wind field, will cause strong winds over 
the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland from this afternoon through 
Sunday. For additional information on impacts in Newfoundland, 
please monitor forecasts and warnings from Environment Canada.

The is the last advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center on 
Earl.  Additional information on this system can be found in High 
Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Strong winds are expected over the Avalon Peninsula of
Newfoundland this afternoon through Sunday.
 
2. Large swells generated by Earl will affect Bermuda, portions
of the U.S. East Coast, and Nova Scotia and Newfoundland during the
next several days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
