track, the center of Earl is expected to pass just north of the 
northern Leeward Islands today, and north of the Virgin Islands and 
Puerto Rico tonight and Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Slow strengthening is possible during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km), 
mainly to the north and east of the center.

Tropical Storm Earl Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062022
1100 AM AST Sat Sep 03 2022
 
Earl is a sheared tropical cyclone this morning, as the low-level 
center is fully exposed to the west of the convective mass. NOAA 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft data indicate the vortex remains tilted 
due to about 15 kt of deep-layer southwesterly shear over the 
cyclone. Recently, a more vigorous burst of convection has developed 
closer to the center. The initial intensity is held at 35 kt based 
on a blend of flight-level, SFMR, and dropsonde data from the 
aircraft. It is noted that the surface pressure near the center has 
fallen a couple of millibars since the previous advisory.

The cyclone remains on a west-northwestward heading as it is being 
steered by the subtropical ridge. The guidance remains in very good 
agreement that Earl will maintain a west-northwestward to 
northwestward motion with a decrease in forward speed over the next 
couple of days. As a weakness develops in the subtropical ridge 
early next week, Earl is forecast to turn slowly northward and then 
northeastward by days 3-5 as a mid- to upper-level trough develops 
over the western Atlantic. Although there is increasing spread in 
the track guidance during this period as to how quickly Earl 
recurves, there is good overall agreement that the cyclone track 
will remain over the open Atlantic waters. The official NHC forecast 
has been adjusted slightly to the right of the previous one during 
the 36-72 h window, based on similar trends noted in the guidance 
consensus aids.

It appears that moderate deep-layer shear will continue to impact 
Earl during the next couple of days. Therefore, only modest 
strengthening is forecast during this time as the cyclone could 
struggle to become vertically aligned and sustain convection near 
its center. The intensity forecast is of lower confidence later in 
the period once Earl begins turning northward. Although the vertical 
shear is expected to persist or even strengthen, the potential for 
favorable interaction with the upper trough should allow for 
additional strengthening during this period, while the wind field of 
the cyclone broadens. Most of the dynamical models support this 
strengthening trend, and the latest NHC intensity forecast has been 
adjusted upward some during this period. However, there remains 
large spread in the intensity guidance at days 3-5, and the NHC 
forecast remains on the lower end of the models.

Tropical-storm-force winds are forecast to remain on the northern 
and eastern side of the circulation, and as a result, are not 
expected to move across the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin 
Islands, or Puerto Rico.  However, gusty winds in squalls are 
possible at these locations over the weekend.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical Storm Earl is forecast to pass near or just to the
north of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico over the weekend.  Gusty winds, especially in squalls,
area possible on those islands over the next day or two.
 
2.  Heavy rainfall from Earl is expected to lead to limited flash, 
urban, and small stream flooding impacts over the Leeward Islands, 
U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico this weekend.   
Rapid rises on rivers and mudslides in areas of steep terrain are 
possible in Puerto Rico.

Tropical Storm Danielle Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052022
300 PM GMT Sat Sep 03 2022
 
Satellite images indicate that Danielle has generally changed little
during the past several hours.  The storm is still producing bands
of deep convection, especially on its north side, but there are dry
slots that have entrained into the south side of the circulation.
The Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB range from 55 to 65 kt, and
based on that data, the initial intensity is held at 60 kt.
 
Danielle has been moving very slowly to the west-northwest at 2 kt
and is back over the same location where it was 24-36 hours ago.  A
continued slow west-northwestward motion is expected through tonight
as the storm remains steered by a blocking ridge to its north.
However, a sharp turn to the north is forecast on Sunday followed by
a faster motion to the northeast after that as a trough currently
over eastern Canada approaches Danielle.  Although the models agree
on the overall scenario, there is a fair amount of spread on where
and how sharply the storm is expected to turn.  The NHC track
forecast is a little to the west of the previous one in the short
term, but ends up near the previous forecast from 48 to 120 h, and
it lies roughly near the middle of the guidance envelope.
 
Danielle has been over its own cool SSTs wake during the past 12-18 
hours, which possibly caused the observed slight weakening.  
However, as the storm pulls away from that area and remains in 
generally favorable atmospheric conditions, Danielle will likely 
restrengthen during the next couple of days.  Beyond that time, 
cooler waters, drier air, and an increase in shear should cause some 
weakening.  Danielle is expected to become an extratropical cyclone 
by the end of the forecast period when it merges with the 
approaching trough and moves over SSTs near 20C.  The NHC intensity 
forecast is just an update of the previous one and in line with the 
HCCA and IVCN consensus aids.
