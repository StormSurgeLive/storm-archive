500 PM PDT Mon Sep 19 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Madeline, located about 150 miles south of the southern tip <br/>
of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
1. South of Central America and Southeastern Mexico:<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms associated with a broad area <br/>
of low pressure continue just off the southern Mexico and Guatemala <br/>
coasts.  Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive for <br/>
gradual development while the system meanders off the coast of <br/>
southern Mexico through the week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
2. South of Southern Mexico:<br/>
Another area of low pressure could form south of the southern coast <br/>
of Mexico in a few days.  Development, if any, of this system should <br/>
be slow to occur thereafter while the disturbance moves slowly <br/>
west-northwestward near the coast of southern Mexico through the <br/>
week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

...MADELINE HEADING WEST-NORTHWEST...
...GUSTY WINDS CONTINUE TO BE REPORTED IN EXTREME SOUTHERN BAJA
CALIFORNIA...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM MDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.0N 110.8W
ABOUT 145 MI...230 KM SSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 285 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...997 MB...29.44 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM MDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Madeline was
located near latitude 21.0 North, longitude 110.8 West. Madeline is
moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h) and this
motion is expected to continue during the next day or so, followed
by a turn to the west by Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast, and Madeline is 
expected to become a post-tropical remnant low by early Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Outer bands from Madeline are forecast to produce
additional rainfall of 1 to 2 inches through late this evening over
the southern tip of Baja California.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Madeline will affect the southern Baja
California peninsula during the next couple of days.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM MDT.

Tropical Storm Madeline Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142022
900 PM MDT Mon Sep 19 2022
 
Madeline is on a gradual decline.  The deep convection that is 
confined to the west of the cyclone's low-level center is slowly 
decaying in the presence of 20 kt of east-northeasterly shear and 
marginal SSTs of 26 degrees C.  The latest Dvorak T-numbers from 
TAFB, SAB, and the UW-CIMSS ADT have decreased from 6 h ago, and a 
blend of their CI values suggest that the initial intensity has 
decreased to 45 kt.
 
Madeline continues to move west-northwestward, or 285/7 kt.  An 
ongoing west-northwestward motion is expected during the next day 
or so while the storm remains steered by a deep-layer ridge 
centered over southern Texas.  After that time, a turn to the west 
is expected when the system becomes shallow and moves within the 
low-level trade winds.  The NHC track forecast is little changed 
from the previous one and is near the various multi-model consensus 
tracks. 
 
The east-northeasterly shear is expected to persist while Madeline 
moves into a region of drier air and over cooler SSTs.  Therefore 
steady weakening is expected, and the cyclone is expected to 
degenerate into post-tropical remnant low, devoid of persistent 
organized deep convection, by early Wednesday.  The latest NHC 
intensity forecast was nudged slightly lower through 48 h due to the 
decrease in the initial intensity, but remains slightly higher than 
the HCCA and IVCN consensus.
