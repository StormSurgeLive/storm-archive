For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Madeline, located several hundred miles south-southeast of <br/>
the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
South of Central America and Southeastern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located over the far eastern portion <br/>
of the eastern North Pacific is producing disorganized shower and <br/>
thunderstorm activity.  Environmental conditions are forecast to be <br/>
conducive for slow development while the system moves slowly <br/>
northwestward near or offshore of the coasts of southern Mexico and <br/>
Guatemala through the week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico:<br/>
Another area of low pressure could form south of the southern <br/>
or southwestern coast of Mexico in a few days.  Some gradual <br/>
development is possible thereafter while the disturbance moves <br/>
generally west-northwestward off the coast of southwestern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Manzanillo northward to Cabo Corrientes
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case over the next 24 to 36
hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM MDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Madeline was
located near latitude 18.2 North, longitude 106.7 West. Madeline is
moving toward the north near 9 mph (15 km/h). A gradual turn toward
the northwest and then the west is expected through early this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some slight strengthening is possible over the next day or
so. Weakening is forecast to begin later this week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Madeline can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO
header WTPZ44 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml.
 
RAINFALL: Outer bands from Madeline are forecast to produce rainfall
totals of 3 to 6 inches with local maximum totals of 8 inches today
into Monday across mainly coastal portions of the following Mexican
States: Colima, Jalisco, and Nayarit.
 
These heavy rains may produce localized flash and urban flooding,
along with possible mudslides in areas of higher coastal terrain.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area today through Monday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Madeline will affect portions of the
southwest coast of Mexico for the next few days. High surf
associated with Madeline will spread northward and begin to affect
the coast of Baja California today into Monday. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.

Tropical Storm Madeline Discussion Number   3...Corrected
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142022
300 AM MDT Sun Sep 18 2022

Corrected numbering of key messages
 
Early this morning, Madeline still appears to be feeling the effects 
of more than 20 kt of easterly shear, with the deepest convective 
cloud tops located some 75 to 100 n mi southwest of the center. The 
center structure itself is rather broad, and several mesovortices 
can be seen rotating around the mean center location. The latest 
round of subjective Dvorak intensity estimates were T2.5/35-kt from 
SAB and T3.0/45-kt from TAFB. Thus, the initial intensity is being 
held at 40 kt for this advisory.
 
The estimated motion of Madeline has actually been a little bit 
right of the previous track, currently estimated a bit east of due 
north at 005/7 kt. The track reasoning in the short-term is a bit 
complicated. Madeline is currently embedded in large-scale monsoonal 
southwesterly flow which appears to be partially responsible for its 
short-term rightward deviation from the prior forecast track. 
Tropical cyclones (TCs) in this region, including recent TCs Kay 
and Lester, have been known to move a bit east of model guidance. 
Thus, the initial track forecast has been nudged a bit further east 
for the first 12-24 h while the larger-scale low-level flow has a 
stronger foothold on Madeline's motion. After that period, a 
building mid-level ridge centered over Texas is expected to cause 
Madeline to take a rather sharp turn to the northwest, resulting in 
Madeline passing south of the Baja California Peninsula. The track 
guidance this cycle is notably further north and east early on, but 
then shifts back towards the previous track by the end of the 
forecast period. Thus, the NHC track forecast was nudged in that 
direction, but is not quite as far to the north and east as the 
latest HCCA consensus aid. As noted in the previous advisory, 
across-track spread at the end of the forecast is rather large, so 
this track forecast is of lower confidence.
 
Intensity-wise, Madeline has only a brief window where the vertical 
wind shear is expected to drop below 20 kts, mainly between 12-30 h. 
In addition, Madeline is currently a broad tropical cyclone, with a 
fairly large radius of maximum wind. Thus, only some modest 
additional strengthening is forecast, in line with the upper-end of 
the intensity guidance. After 36 h, easterly shear is expected to 
increase substantially, and both the GFS and ECMWF simulated IR 
brightness show Madeline's convection quickly shearing away as the 
storm also crosses the 26 C sea-surface temperature isotherm by 48 
h. With the further northward track over cooler waters, the latest 
intensity guidance has trended downward, and the NHC intensity 
forecast follows suit, weakening Madeline to a depression in 60 h 
and making it a remnant low by 72 h. Based on the latest guidance 
though, this could occur sooner than forecast.
 
Madeline is producing a large area of rough surf and high waves, 
especially on its south and eastern flank. Given the current large 
34-kt radii on the south side of Madeline and the eastward shift in 
the forecast track this cycle, the government of Mexico has issued a 
Tropical Storm Watch from Manzanillo northward to Cabo Corrientes. 
Any further deviation to the right of Madeline's track could require 
these watches to be upgraded to a warning later today.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rains from Madeline are expected for portions of coastal
southwestern Mexico into Monday. This rainfall may produce flash and
urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher
coastal terrain.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible for the southwestern 
coast of Mexico from Manzanillo to Cabo Corrientes over the next 24 
to 36 hours.
