<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Madeline, located a few hundred miles south-southeast of <br/>
the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
South of Central America and Southeastern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located over the far eastern portion <br/>
of the eastern North Pacific is producing disorganized shower and <br/>
thunderstorm activity.  Environmental conditions are forecast to be <br/>
conducive for slow development while the system moves slowly <br/>
northwestward near or offshore of the coasts of southern Mexico and <br/>
Guatemala through the week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico:<br/>
Another area of low pressure could form south of the southern <br/>
or southwestern coast of Mexico in a few days.  Some gradual <br/>
development is possible thereafter while the disturbance moves <br/>
generally west-northwestward off the coast of southwestern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM MDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Madeline was
located near latitude 19.0 North, longitude 107.6 West.  Madeline is
moving toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A turn
toward the west-northwest at a similar forward speed is expected on
Monday, followed by a turn toward the west Tuesday night.  On the
forecast track, the center of Madeline will gradually move away from
the coast of Mexico through Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is expected during the next 24
hours. Weakening is expected to begin by Monday night, and Madeline
is forecast to become a remnant low on Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Madeline can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO
header WTPZ44 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml.
 
RAINFALL:  Outer bands from Madeline are forecast to produce 
rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with local maximum totals of 6 
inches into Monday across mainly coastal portions of the following 
Mexican States: Colima, Jalisco, and Nayarit.
 
These heavy rains may produce localized flash and urban flooding,
along with possible mudslides in areas of higher coastal terrain.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area through this evening.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Madeline will affect the southwestern
coast of Mexico for the next couple of days, and will spread
northward to the southern Baja California peninsula coast and the
coast of west-central Mexico tonight and Monday.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM MDT.

Tropical Storm Madeline Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142022
300 PM MDT Sun Sep 18 2022
 
Madeline still has an asymmetric convective pattern, with a large 
burst of deep convection mainly confined to the southwestern 
quadrant due to deep-layer easterly shear.  Visible satellite 
images also suggest that there are several low-level swirls 
rotating around a common center.  Intensity estimates have not 
changed since this morning, so the initial intensity remains 40 kt. 
Moderate to strong easterly shear is expected to continue for the 
next couple of days, and Madeline is also forecast to reach the 
cold ocean wake of former Hurricane Kay by late Monday.  There is 
some chance for slight strengthening before Madeline reaches the 
cold wake, but overall little change in intensity is forecast 
during the next 24 hours.  Weakening is anticipated after that 
time, and model-simulated satellite imagery indicate that Madeline 
should lose all of its deep convection, and hence become 
post-tropical, by 48 hours.

The initial motion is now north-northwestward, or 335/7 kt.  Track 
model guidance is in good agreement that Madeline will turn 
west-northwestward on Monday, and then westward by Tuesday night, 
when the weakening cyclone will come under the influence of 
lower-level steering winds.  The new NHC track forecast, which is 
just a bit to the southwest of the morning prediction, anticipates 
that Madeline will turn and move away from the coast of Mexico, 
including the southern Baja California peninsula, during the next 48 
hours.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rains from Madeline are expected for portions of coastal
southwestern Mexico into Monday.  This rainfall may produce flash
and urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher
coastal terrain.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible for the southwestern
coast of Mexico from Manzanillo to Cabo Corrientes through this 
evening.
