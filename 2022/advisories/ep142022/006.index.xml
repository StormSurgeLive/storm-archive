<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Madeline, located a few hundred miles south-southeast of <br/>
the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
South of Central America and Southeastern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located over the far eastern portion <br/>
of the eastern North Pacific is producing disorganized shower and <br/>
thunderstorm activity.  Environmental conditions are forecast to be <br/>
conducive for slow development while the system moves slowly <br/>
northwestward near or offshore of the coasts of southern Mexico and <br/>
Guatemala through the week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico:<br/>
Another area of low pressure could form south of the southern <br/>
or southwestern coast of Mexico in a few days.  Some gradual <br/>
development is possible thereafter while the disturbance moves <br/>
generally west-northwestward off the coast of southwestern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

...MADELINE TURNING NORTHWESTWARD AND IS A LITTLE STRONGER...
...LOCALIZED FLASH FLOODING POSSIBLE ALONG THE SOUTHWESTERN COAST
OF MEXICO THROUGH MONDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM MDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.3N 107.9W
ABOUT 160 MI...260 KM WSW OF CABO CORRIENTES MEXICO
ABOUT 280 MI...450 KM SSE OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 320 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...996 MB...29.42 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical Storm Watch
along the coast of southwest Mexico.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches and warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM MDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Madeline was 
located near latitude 19.3 North, longitude 107.9 West.  Madeline is 
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A turn toward the 
west-northwest at a similar forward speed is expected on Monday, 
followed by a turn toward the west by Tuesday night.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Madeline will gradually move away from 
the coast of Mexico through Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some slight strengthening is possible through Monday morning.
Weakening is expected to begin by Monday night, and Madeline is
forecast to become a remnant low on Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).

 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Madeline can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO
header WTPZ44 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml.
 
RAINFALL:  Outer bands from Madeline are forecast to produce 
rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with local maximum totals of 6 
inches into Monday across mainly coastal portions of the following 
Mexican States: Colima, Jalisco, and Nayarit.

These heavy rains may produce localized flash and urban flooding, 
along with possible mudslides in areas of higher coastal terrain. 

SURF:  Swells generated by Madeline will affect the southwestern
coast of Mexico for the next couple of days, and will spread
northward to the southern Baja California peninsula coast and the
coast of west-central Mexico tonight and Monday.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM MDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Madeline Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Madeline Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142022
900 PM MDT Sun Sep 18 2022
 
Madeline has increased in organization over the past several hours. 
The low-level center is now embedded underneath the northeastern 
portion of a mass of deep convection with cloud tops as cold as -85 
degrees Celsius. A recent SSMIS overpass also shows a well-defined 
curved band within the western semicircle. The latest subjective 
Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB are both T-3.0, and 
support raising the initial intensity to 45 kt for this advisory.

There is a small window of opportunity through Monday morning for 
Madeline to strengthen a little more, as the storm begins to move 
along the shear vector and remains over warm waters and within a 
favorable thermodynamic environment. However, by late Monday the 
cyclone is forecast to reach the 26 degrees C isotherm and begin to 
move into a progressively drier and more stable environment. 
Therefore, steady weakening is forecast to begin by that time. Both 
the GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite suggest that Madeline will 
become devoid of deep convection by Tuesday and degenerate into a 
remnant low. The latest NHC intensity forecast was increased through 
the next 24 h, but is the same as the previous advisory thereafter. 

Madeline is continuing its slow turn to the left, and is now moving 
northwestward at 8 kt to the southwest of a mid-level ridge. This 
motion is beginning to increase the cyclone's distance from the 
coast of southwestern Mexico. Based on this and surface 
observations, the government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical 
Storm Watch that was in effect for the portion of that coastline. 
Model guidance is in very good agreement that Madeline will turn to 
the west-northwest on Monday night and then west by Tuesday as the 
weakening cyclone becomes steered by the surrounding low-level flow. 
The combination of this track and a contracting wind field should 
keep tropical-storm-force winds well offshore of the southern Baja 
California peninsula as the system passes to the south through 
Monday night. The latest NHC track forecast is very little changed 
from the previous one and lies near the various multi-model 
consensus tracks.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rains from Madeline are expected for portions of coastal 
southwestern Mexico into Monday. This rainfall may produce flash and 
urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher 
coastal terrain.
