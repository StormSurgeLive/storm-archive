<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Madeline, located several hundred miles south-southeast of <br/>
the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
South of Central America and Southeastern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located over the far eastern portion <br/>
of the eastern North Pacific is producing disorganized shower and <br/>
thunderstorm activity.  Environmental conditions are forecast to be <br/>
conducive for slow development while the system moves slowly <br/>
northwestward near or offshore of the coasts of southern Mexico and <br/>
Guatemala through the week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico:<br/>
Another area of low pressure could form south of the southern <br/>
or southwestern coast of Mexico in a few days.  Some gradual <br/>
development is possible thereafter while the disturbance moves <br/>
generally west-northwestward off the coast of southwestern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Manzanillo northward to Cabo Corrientes
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case during the next 24
hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 PM MDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Madeline was
located near latitude 18.6 North, longitude 107.1 West.  Madeline is
moving toward the north-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A turn 
toward the northwest is expected by this evening, followed by a
turn toward the west-northwest and west on Monday and Tuesday. On
the forecast track, the center of Madeline is expected to turn away
from the coast of Mexico during the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast during the next day or
so. Weakening is expected to begin on Monday, and Madeline is likely
to degenerate into a post-tropical remnant low on Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Madeline can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO
header WTPZ44 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml.
 
RAINFALL:  Outer bands from Madeline are forecast to produce
rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with local maximum totals of 6
inches today into Monday across mainly coastal portions of the
following Mexican States: Colima, Jalisco, and Nayarit.
 
These heavy rains may produce localized flash and urban flooding,
along with possible mudslides in areas of higher coastal terrain.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area today and tonight.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Madeline will affect portions of the
southwest coast of Mexico for the next few days. High surf
associated with Madeline will spread northward and begin to affect
the coast of the Baja California peninsula today into Monday. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM MDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Madeline Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>

Tropical Storm Madeline Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142022
900 AM MDT Sun Sep 18 2022
 
A large burst of deep convection has developed southwest of 
Madeline's center during the past few hours, with another broken 
line of convection oriented parallel to the southwestern coast of 
Mexico.  The current intensity remains 40 kt as a blend of the 
latest Dvorak Current Intensity numbers from TAFB and SAB, and the 
latest UW-CIMSS SATCON estimate.

Madeline is located along the southwestern periphery of a large 
mid-tropospheric high, and to the southeast of a deep-layer trough 
to the west of California.  The initial motion is northward, or 
350/9 kt, but this steering set up should cause Madeline to 
gradually turn northwestward later today, and then 
west-northwestward and westward away from the coast of Mexico from 
36 hours and beyond.  The track guidance is tightly clustered 
through 48 hours, but there is more spread after that, with a few 
models keeping Madeline too strong and maintaining a northwestward 
motion.  These models are discounted, and the official forecast 
continues to show a westward bend, following the GFS, ECMWF, and 
model consensus solutions.

Madeline's broad circulation, and continued moderate to strong 
easterly shear, argue against much, if any, intensification during 
the next day or so.  The official forecast still allows for the 
possibility for some minimal strengthening during the next 24 hours 
while Madeline is over warm waters.  After 24 hours, the storm is 
forecast to begin moving across the cold wake left behind by former 
Hurricane Kay, which is expected to induce weakening.  The updated 
NHC intensity forecast is a little lower than the previous 
prediction, and it now shows Madeline degenerating into a 
post-tropical remnant low by 60 hours, when model simulated 
satellite imagery from the GFS and ECMWF indicate that all deep 
convection should have dissipated.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rains from Madeline are expected for portions of coastal
southwestern Mexico into Monday.  This rainfall may produce flash 
and urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher
coastal terrain.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible for the southwestern
coast of Mexico from Manzanillo to Cabo Corrientes today and 
tonight.
