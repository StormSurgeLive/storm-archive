For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Madeline, located several hundred miles south-southeast of <br/>
the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
South of Central America and Southeastern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure has formed in the far eastern portion <br/>
of the eastern North Pacific and is producing some shower and <br/>
thunderstorm activity. Environmental conditions are forecast to be <br/>
conducive for slow development while the system moves slowly <br/>
west-northwestward near or offshore the coast of southern Mexico <br/>
through mid-week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico:<br/>
Another area of low pressure could form south of the southern coast <br/>
of Mexico in a few days. Some gradual development is possible <br/>
thereafter while the disturbance moves generally west-northwestward <br/>
off the coast of southwestern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Madeline was 
located near latitude 17.7 North, longitude 106.6 West. Madeline is 
moving toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h). A gradual turn toward 
the northwest and then the west is expected through early this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some slight strengthening is possible over the next day or so. 
Weakening is forecast to begin later this week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Madeline can be found in the 
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO 
header WTPZ44 KNHC and on the web at 
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml. 

RAINFALL: Outer bands from Madeline are forecast to produce rainfall
totals of 3 to 6 inches with local maximum totals of 8 inches today
into Monday across mainly coastal portions of the following Mexican
States: Colima, Jalisco, and Nayarit.
 
These heavy rains may produce localized flash and urban flooding,
along with possible mudslides in areas of higher coastal terrain.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area today through Monday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Madeline will affect portions of the 
southwest coast of Mexico for the next few days. High surf 
associated with Madeline will spread northward and begin to affect 
the coast of Baja California today into Monday. These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 600 AM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.

Tropical Storm Madeline Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142022
900 PM MDT Sat Sep 17 2022
 
Madeline has changed little in appearance since earlier today. 
Moderate east-northeasterly vertical wind shear of 15-20 kt is 
keeping the center of circulation at the northeastern edge of 
the cyclone's deep convection. With the lack of any appreciable 
change to Madeline's structure, the initial advisory intensity is 
being kept at 40 kt for continuity.

The storm has made its anticipated acceleration to the north and is 
now moving at about 8 kt. A mid-level ridge over the Atlantic 
should keep Madeline on a northward to northwestward track for the 
next day or so. By Tuesday, another ridge building over Texas 
should cause the cyclone to turn westward. There was very little 
change to the latest NHC track forecast from the previous one, 
which lies near the various multi-model consensus tracks. It should 
be noted that there is over 300 n mi north to south model spread 
by day 4. Therefore, the track forecast during days 4-5 is of lower 
confidence.

Madeline's intensity forecast is fairly straightforward for the next 
few days, but is more complicated thereafter due to the uncertain 
track forecast. The moderate shear affecting the storm now is 
forecast to persist through early next week while the system remains 
embedded in a moist thermodynamic environment. The combination of 
these conditions should allow for some slight strengthening over the 
next couple of days. By 48 h, the SSTs beneath Madeline are expected 
to decrease to near 26 degrees Celsius, which in combination with 
the shear, should cause the system to begin weakening around that 
time.  By late in the forecast period, the shear is forecast to 
decrease while warmer waters are present just to the south of the 
forecasted path of the cyclone. Therefore, a deviation to the left 
of the forecast track could put Madeline in a more favorable 
environment for strengthening. However, the models suggest that 
regardless of the water temperatures, Madeline is expected to 
encounter drier and more stable air later in the forecast period. 
Based on these conditions, the NHC intensity forecast was lowered 
slightly from the previous one, and is near the various consensus 
aids. The latter part of the current intensity forecast is also low 
confidence.
