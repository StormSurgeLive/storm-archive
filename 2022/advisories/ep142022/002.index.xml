<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center has issued the last advisory <br/>
on Tropical Storm Lester, which dissipated over southern <br/>
Mexico. Advisories are now being issued on newly-developed Tropical <br/>
Storm Madeline, located several hundred miles south-southeast of <br/>
the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
South of Central America and Southeastern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure could form over the far eastern portion of <br/>
the eastern North Pacific basin early next week. Environmental <br/>
conditions are forecast to be conducive for some gradual development <br/>
while the system moves west-northwestward near or offshore the coast <br/>
of southern Mexico through mid-week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico:<br/>
Another area of low pressure is forecast to form south of the <br/>
southern coast of Mexico by the middle of next week. Some gradual <br/>
development is possible thereafter while the disturbance moves <br/>
generally west-northwestward off the coast of southwestern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Remnants Of Lester Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP132022
400 PM CDT Sat Sep 17 2022
 
Satellite imagery and surface observations from Mexico indicate that 
the surface circulation of Lester has dissipated. The center of 
Lester has been difficult to locate today, and it is possible that 
the cyclone moved inland faster and farther east than indicated by 
NHC's operational estimates. A more detailed analysis of Lester's 
position near the coast of Mexico will be conducted during the 
post-storm analysis. Heavy rain will continue to be a threat along 
the southwest coast of Mexico for the next few days. For additional 
information on heavy rainfall and flooding, please see products 
issued by your national meteorological service.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Lester will continue for portions of coastal
southern Mexico into Sunday. This rainfall may produce flash and
urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher
coastal terrain.

Tropical Storm Madeline Advisory Number   2

900 PM MDT Sat Sep 17 2022
 
...MADELINE HEADING NORTHWARD...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM MDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.9N 106.8W
ABOUT 460 MI...740 KM SSE OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 360 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM MDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Madeline was
located near latitude 16.9 North, longitude 106.8 West. Madeline is
moving toward the north near 9 mph (15 km/h). A gradual turn toward 
the northwest then west is expected through early next week. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some slight strengthening is forecast over the next day or so, 
with fluctuations in intensity possible after that. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Madeline will affect portions of the
southwest coast of Mexico for the next few days. High surf
associated with Madeline will spread northward and begin to affect
the coast of Baja California late this weekend or early next week.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 300 AM MDT.

Tropical Storm Madeline Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142022
900 PM MDT Sat Sep 17 2022
 
Madeline has changed little in appearance since earlier today. 
Moderate east-northeasterly vertical wind shear of 15-20 kt is 
keeping the center of circulation at the northeastern edge of 
the cyclone's deep convection. With the lack of any appreciable 
change to Madeline's structure, the initial advisory intensity is 
being kept at 40 kt for continuity.

The storm has made its anticipated acceleration to the north and is 
now moving at about 8 kt. A mid-level ridge over the Atlantic 
should keep Madeline on a northward to northwestward track for the 
next day or so. By Tuesday, another ridge building over Texas 
should cause the cyclone to turn westward. There was very little 
change to the latest NHC track forecast from the previous one, 
which lies near the various multi-model consensus tracks. It should 
be noted that there is over 300 n mi north to south model spread 
by day 4. Therefore, the track forecast during days 4-5 is of lower 
confidence.

Madeline's intensity forecast is fairly straightforward for the next 
few days, but is more complicated thereafter due to the uncertain 
track forecast. The moderate shear affecting the storm now is 
forecast to persist through early next week while the system remains 
embedded in a moist thermodynamic environment. The combination of 
these conditions should allow for some slight strengthening over the 
next couple of days. By 48 h, the SSTs beneath Madeline are expected 
to decrease to near 26 degrees Celsius, which in combination with 
the shear, should cause the system to begin weakening around that 
time.  By late in the forecast period, the shear is forecast to 
decrease while warmer waters are present just to the south of the 
forecasted path of the cyclone. Therefore, a deviation to the left 
of the forecast track could put Madeline in a more favorable 
environment for strengthening. However, the models suggest that 
regardless of the water temperatures, Madeline is expected to 
encounter drier and more stable air later in the forecast period. 
Based on these conditions, the NHC intensity forecast was lowered 
slightly from the previous one, and is near the various consensus 
aids. The latter part of the current intensity forecast is also low 
confidence.
