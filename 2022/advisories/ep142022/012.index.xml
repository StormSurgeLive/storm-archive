500 AM PDT Tue Sep 20 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Madeline, located about 150 miles southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
1. South of Southwestern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure is producing disorganized shower and <br/>
thunderstorm activity just off the coast of southwestern Mexico. <br/>
Some slow development of this system is possible while the <br/>
disturbance moves slowly west-northwestward near the coast of <br/>
southwestern Mexico during the next few days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
2. South of Central America and Southeastern Mexico:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a broad area <br/>
of low pressure just offshore of southern Mexico and Guatemala <br/>
remain disorganized. Development, if any, of this system should be <br/>
slow to occur while it meanders off the coast of southern <br/>
Mexico through the week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Madeline Advisory Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142022
900 AM MDT Tue Sep 20 2022
 
...MADELINE FORECAST TO BECOME POST-TROPICAL SOON...
...ROUGH SURF AND RIP CURRENT CONDITIONS AFFECTING PORTIONS OF
SOUTHERN BAJA CALIFORNIA...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM MDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.2N 112.0W
ABOUT 180 MI...285 KM SW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 270 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1002 MB...29.59 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Madeline
was located near latitude 21.2 North, longitude 112.0 West. The
depression is moving toward the west near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this
motion is expected to continue with a gradual turn
west-southwestward later this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h)
with higher gusts. Additional weakening is forecast, and Madeline
is expected to become a post-tropical remnant low by this evening.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Madeline will affect the southern Baja
California peninsula during the next couple of days.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM MDT.

Tropical Depression Madeline Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142022
900 AM MDT Tue Sep 20 2022
 
Madeline is close to becoming a post-tropical cyclone, having 
produced little deep convection overnight.  Satellite intensity 
estimates continue to decrease and, based on these and the earlier 
scatterometer data, the initial intensity has been lowered to 30 
kt.  The storm is predicted to become a post-tropical cyclone in 
12 hours or less due to persistent shear, dry air and cool waters.  
It is possible Madeline will produce occasional short-lived bursts 
of convection after it moves away from the cooler ocean waters 
stirred up by Kay.  However, model guidance suggests this 
convective activity will not be enough to redevelop Madeline as a 
tropical system.  The remnant low is expected to open up into a 
trough by the end of the forecast period.

Madeline is moving west at 7 kt.  This general motion is expected 
to continue with a gradual turn to the west-southwest in the 
low-level flow.  The NHC track forecast is slightly south of the 
previous advisory and close to the multi-model consensus aids.
