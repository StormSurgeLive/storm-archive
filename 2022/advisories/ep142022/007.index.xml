<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Madeline, located a few hundred miles south-southeast of <br/>
the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
South of Central America and Southeastern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located over the far eastern portion of <br/>
the eastern North Pacific continues to produce disorganized shower <br/>
and thunderstorm activity.  Environmental conditions are forecast to <br/>
be conducive for slow development while the system moves slowly <br/>
northwestward near or offshore of the coasts of southern Mexico and <br/>
Guatemala through the week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico:<br/>
Another area of low pressure could form south of the southern <br/>
or southwestern coast of Mexico in a few days.  Some gradual <br/>
development is possible thereafter while the disturbance moves <br/>
generally west-northwestward off the coast of southwestern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Madeline Advisory Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142022
300 AM MDT Mon Sep 19 2022
 
...MADELINE INTENSIFIES A BIT MORE...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM MDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.3N 108.2W
ABOUT 160 MI...260 KM W OF CABO CORRIENTES MEXICO
ABOUT 210 MI...340 KM SSE OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 320 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...993 MB...29.33 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Madeline was 
located near latitude 20.3 North, longitude 108.2 West. Madeline is 
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A gradual turn 
toward the west-northwest and then west is expected over the next 
24-36 hours. On the forecast track, the center of Madeline will 
gradually move away from the coast of Mexico and pass to the south 
of the Baja California peninsula by tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with
higher gusts. Little change in strength is expected today, followed
by weakening expected to begin tonight. Madeline is forecast to
become a remnant low on Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 993 mb (29.33 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Outer bands from Madeline are forecast to produce 
additional rainfall of 1 to 3 inches along the Jalisco coast into 
this afternoon and 1 to 2 inches this evening over the southern tip 
of Baja California.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Madeline will affect the southwestern
coast of Mexico for the next couple of days, and will spread
northward to the southern Baja California peninsula coast and the
coast of west-central Mexico later today.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.

Tropical Storm Madeline Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142022
300 AM MDT Mon Sep 19 2022
 
Madeline continues to produce an healthy area of deep convection, 
though this activity continues to be somewhat displaced to the 
southwest of the center due to moderate northeasterly shear. We 
finally received some long awaited scatterometer data at 0357 UTC, 
which had a peak wind retrieval of 48-kt in the southern semicircle 
of Madeline's circulation. Satellite estimates were also somewhat 
higher, with TAFB at T3.5/55-kt, SAB at T3.0/45-kt, and ADT at 
T3.2/49-kt. A combination of these intensity estimates support 
raising the intensity to 50 kt for this advisory.
 
Fixes from both scatterometer and microwave data indicate that 
Madeline is continuing its northwest heading, estimated at 320/8 kt. 
As mid-level ridging builds in to the north, the storm is expected 
to turn toward the west-northwest later today and gradually bend 
more westward through the end of its lifespan as a tropical cyclone. 
While a lot of the guidance continues to be tightly clustered, there 
remain a few outliers that are further to the north (HWRF/ 
Experimental HAFS-S). The latest track forecast was nudged a bit 
further north, mostly related to the initial position and motion, 
but after 24 hours is very close to the previous forecast track, but 
just a touch faster, in agreement with the TVCE and HCCA consensus 
aids.
 
While I cannot rule out that Madeline might intensify a bit more in 
the next 6-12 h, the easterly vertical wind shear that has been 
plaguing the storm is forecast to increase further later today, as 
the storm moves over rapidly cooling sea-surface temperatures, 
crossing the 26 C isotherm in about 24 hours. Thus, weakening is 
expected to begin by tonight, and simulated satellite imagery 
suggests organized deep convection will cease in 36-48 hours, with 
the latest forecast still showing Madeline becoming a remnant low by 
that time. The latest NHC intensity forecast is in good agreement 
with the intensity consensus aids.
