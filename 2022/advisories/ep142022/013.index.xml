Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD<br/>
1100 AM PDT Tue Sep 20 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on <br/>
recently downgraded Tropical Depression Madeline, located a couple <br/>
of hundred miles southwest of the southern tip of the Baja <br/>
California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
1. South of Southwestern Mexico:<br/>
A trough of low pressure is producing disorganized shower and <br/>
thunderstorm activity just off the coast of southwestern Mexico. <br/>
Some slow development of this system is possible while the <br/>
disturbance moves slowly west-northwestward near the coast of <br/>
southwestern Mexico during the next few days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
2. South of Southern Mexico:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a broad area <br/>
of low pressure just offshore of southern Mexico remain <br/>
disorganized. Development, if any, of this system should be <br/>
slow to occur while it meanders off the coast of southern <br/>
Mexico through the week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Post-Tropical Cyclone Madeline Advisory Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142022
300 PM MDT Tue Sep 20 2022
 
...MADELINE DEGENERATES INTO A REMNANT LOW...
...THIS IS THE LAST NHC ADVISORY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM MDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.3N 112.5W
ABOUT 200 MI...320 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 280 DEGREES AT 6 MPH...9 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1004 MB...29.65 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM MDT (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone 
Madeline was located near latitude 21.3 North, longitude 112.5 West. 
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the west near 6 mph (9 
km/h), and this motion is expected to continue with a gradual turn 
west-southwestward later this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Additional weakening is forecast, and the remnant low is likely to 
dissipate by the end the week.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Madeline will affect the southern Baja
California peninsula through this evening.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Madeline Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142022
300 PM MDT Tue Sep 20 2022
 
Madeline has lacked organized deep convection for about 16 hours and 
it is unlikely to redevelop any in the future.  Therefore, the 
system has become a post-tropical remnant low and this will be the 
final NHC advisory on Madeline.  A recent scatterometer overpass 
supports maintaining the initial intensity at 30 kt for this 
advisory.  The remnant low should gradually spin down over the next 
few days and is expected to open up into a trough by the end of the 
forecast period.
 
The depression is moving just north of west at 280/5 kt. This 
general motion is expected to continue with a gradual turn to the 
west-southwest moving with the low-level steering flow. The NHC 
track forecast remains close to the multi-model consensus aids.

This is the final NHC advisory for Madeline.  For additional 
information on the remnant, please see High Seas Forecasts issued by 
the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO 
header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php.
