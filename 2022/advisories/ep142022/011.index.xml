Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 PM PDT Mon Sep 19 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Madeline, located more than 150 miles south-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
1. South of Southern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure appears to be forming to the south of the <br/>
southern coast of Mexico, where shower and thunderstorm activity has <br/>
increased. Some slow development of this system is possible while <br/>
the disturbance moves slowly west-northwestward near the coast of <br/>
southern Mexico through the week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
2. South of Central America and Southeastern Mexico:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a broad area <br/>
of low pressure just offshore of southern Mexico and Guatemala <br/>
remain disorganized. Development, if any, of this system should be <br/>
slow to occur while it meanders off the coast of southern <br/>
Mexico through the week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

...MADELINE WEAKENING QUICKLY AS IT BENDS MORE WESTWARD...
...FORECAST TO BECOME A REMNANT LOW IN 24 HOURS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM MDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.2N 111.3W
ABOUT 150 MI...240 KM SW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 280 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Madeline was
located near latitude 21.2 North, longitude 111.3 West. Madeline is
moving toward the west near 8 mph (13 km/h) and this motion is
expected to continue with a gradual turn west-southwestward later 
this week. 
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional weakening is forecast, and Madeline 
is expected to become a post-tropical remnant low in about 24 
hours. 

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Madeline will affect the southern Baja
California peninsula during the next couple of days.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.

Tropical Storm Madeline Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142022
900 PM MDT Mon Sep 19 2022
 
Madeline is on a gradual decline.  The deep convection that is 
confined to the west of the cyclone's low-level center is slowly 
decaying in the presence of 20 kt of east-northeasterly shear and 
marginal SSTs of 26 degrees C.  The latest Dvorak T-numbers from 
TAFB, SAB, and the UW-CIMSS ADT have decreased from 6 h ago, and a 
blend of their CI values suggest that the initial intensity has 
decreased to 45 kt.
 
Madeline continues to move west-northwestward, or 285/7 kt.  An 
ongoing west-northwestward motion is expected during the next day 
or so while the storm remains steered by a deep-layer ridge 
centered over southern Texas.  After that time, a turn to the west 
is expected when the system becomes shallow and moves within the 
low-level trade winds.  The NHC track forecast is little changed 
from the previous one and is near the various multi-model consensus 
tracks. 
 
The east-northeasterly shear is expected to persist while Madeline 
moves into a region of drier air and over cooler SSTs.  Therefore 
steady weakening is expected, and the cyclone is expected to 
degenerate into post-tropical remnant low, devoid of persistent 
organized deep convection, by early Wednesday.  The latest NHC 
intensity forecast was nudged slightly lower through 48 h due to the 
decrease in the initial intensity, but remains slightly higher than 
the HCCA and IVCN consensus.
