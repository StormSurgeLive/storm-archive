<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Madeline, located about 150 miles south of the southern tip <br/>
of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
South of Central America and Southeastern Mexico:<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms associated with a broad area <br/>
of low pressure continue just off the southern Mexico and Guatemala <br/>
coasts.  Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive for <br/>
gradual development while the system moves slowly <br/>
west-northwestward near the coast of southern Mexico through the <br/>
week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico:<br/>
Another area of low pressure could form south of the southern <br/>
coast of Mexico in a few days.  Development, if any, of this system <br/>
should be slow to occur thereafter while the disturbance meanders <br/>
off the coast of southern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM MDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Madeline was
located near latitude 20.9 North, longitude 109.8 West. Madeline is
moving toward the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h) and this
motion is expected to continue during the next day or so, followed 
by a turn to the west by Wednesday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual weakening is forecast, and Madeline is expected to become a 
post-tropical cyclone by early Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Outer bands from Madeline are forecast to produce
additional rainfall of 1 to 2 inches this evening over the southern
tip of Baja California.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Madeline will affect the southern Baja
California peninsula during the next couple of days.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM MDT.

Tropical Storm Madeline Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142022
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM MDT Mon Sep 19 2022
 
The expected weakening trend of Madeline appears to have begun.
Although convection remains quite deep on the system's west side,
it is becoming increasingly detached from the low-level center due
to about 20 kt of east-northeasterly vertical wind shear.  There is
a wide range in the current Dvorak estimates, but since the storm
appears a little less organized, the initial intensity is nudged
down to 50 kt.  This also agrees with a partial ASCAT pass that
showed 40-45 kt winds on Madeline's southeast side.  The center
is currently a little more than 100 n mi south of Cabo San Lucas, 
and there have been wind gusts to tropical storm force reported 
there during the past couple of hours.
 
Madeline is gradually turning to the left, with the initial motion
now estimated to be 295/9 kt.  A continued west-northwestward
motion is expected during the next day or so while the storm
remains steered by a deep-layer ridge centered over southern Texas.
After that time, a turn to the west is expected when the system
becomes shallow and moves within the low-level trade winds.  The
NHC track forecast is a little to the south and slightly faster
than the previous one, trending toward the latest consensus models.
 
Since east-northeasterly shear is expected to persist while
Madeline moves into a region of drier air and over cooler SSTs, 
steady weakening is expected.  Madeline is forecast to become a 
post-tropical cyclone in about 36 hours when it predicted to be  
over 24 to 25 degree C waters.  The NHC intensity forecast is a 
little lower than the previous one in the short term, but is 
otherwise unchanged.
