<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Fiona, located near the Turks and Caicos islands, and on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gaston, located over the north-central Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is producing shower and thunderstorm activity a few <br/>
hundred miles east of the Windward Islands. The system continues to <br/>
show signs of organization and it will likely become a tropical <br/>
depression within the next two or three days. The disturbance is <br/>
forecast to move west-northwestward across the southern Windward <br/>
Islands late Wednesday and then move toward the central Caribbean <br/>
Sea late this week. Interests in the Windward Islands should closely <br/>
monitor the progress of this system as heavy rainfall and gusty <br/>
winds could affect these islands beginning on Wednesday.  <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is forecast to move off the west coast of Africa on <br/>
Thursday. Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive for <br/>
at least gradual development of the system for a couple days <br/>
thereafter while the system moves slowly northward between west <br/>
Africa and the Cabo Verde Islands through the end of the week. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Fiona was located
near latitude 23.2 North, longitude 71.8 West. Fiona is moving
toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h).  This general motion is 
expected to continue through Wednesday.  A turn toward the

Thursday.  On the forecast track, the center of Fiona will continue 
to move away from the Turks and Caicos tonight and Wednesday, and 
approach Bermuda late on Thursday.
 
Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the 
maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Fiona is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Strengthening is forecast during the 
next day or so. Some fluctuations in intensity are possible 
Wednesday night and Thursday. 

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles
(260 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure reported by the NOAA 
reconnaissance aircraft is 947 mb (27.97 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Hurricane Fiona Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
1100 PM EDT Tue Sep 20 2022
 
Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft that has been 
investigating Fiona this evening show that the hurricane has 
strengthened since this afternoon.  The aircraft has measured peak 
700-mb flight-level winds of 120 kt, and SFMR winds of around 110 kt 
earlier in the evening. Based on those data, the intensity was 
increased to 110 kt on the intermediate advisory at 0000 UTC.  Since 
that time, the satellite presentation has continued to improve with 
the eye becoming better defined and the surrounding ring of deep 
convection expanding with colder cloud top temperatures. The 
pressure has fallen a few more millibars and is now down to 947 mb, 
however the plane has not found any higher winds during several 
passes through the northeastern and northern portion of the eyewall. 
It is worth noting that the latest subjective and objective 
satellite estimates suggest a stronger intensity, and this may be a 
case in which the winds are lagging the improved satellite 
presentation, which is not too uncommon. 

The vertical wind shear over the hurricane is expected to remain low 
to moderate during the next couple of days.  During that time, the 
hurricane will be traversing SSTs of 29-30 degrees Celsius, and 
remain in a moist environment.  These conditions should allow for 
some additional strengthening during the next 12 to 24 hours, but 
after that time, difficult-to-predict eyewall replacement cycles are 
likely to cause some fluctuations in intensity.  By day 3, the 
system is forecast to interact with a vigorous mid-troposphere 
trough and the system is expected to become a large and powerful 
extratropical cyclone near Atlantic Canada.
 
The latest satellite and aircraft fixes indicate that the hurricane 
is now moving just west of due north or 350/7 kt. Fiona should move 
generally northward around the western periphery of a mid-level 
ridge during the next 24 hours.  After that time, the hurricane is 
forecast to turn north-northeastward and begin to gradually 
accelerate as the aforementioned trough approaches from the 
northwest. Very little cross-track changes were made to the latest 
NHC forecast, but it is slightly slower than the previous advisory 
to be in better agreement with the bulk of the dynamical models. 

 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Heavy rains south of Fiona will continue to impact the Turks and 
Caicos through tonight with additional flooding possible.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda by late
Thursday.
 
3. Fiona is expected to affect portions of Atlantic Canada as a
powerful hurricane-force cyclone late Friday and Saturday, and could
produce significant impacts from high winds, storm surge, and heavy
rainfall. Interests in these areas should closely monitor the
progress of Fiona and updates to the forecast.

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
900 PM GMT Tue Sep 20 2022

Satellite images indicate that deep convection is persisting near 
and to the north of the center of the cyclone during the past 
several hours. Drifting buoy 44857 recently reported a minimum 
pressure of 1009 mb near the center of the low, which is a 8 mb 
decrease from earlier today. An ASCAT-C pass from several hours ago 
showed maximum winds of about 35 kt in the northeast and northwest 
quadrants.  Based on that data, the initial intensity is increased 
to 35 kt, making the system Tropical Storm Gaston.
 
Gaston has turned north-northeastward and is moving a little faster 
than before.  The initial motion estimate is 020/15 kt.  A turn to 
the east is expected in a couple of days when the tropical storm 
moves along the northern periphery of a subtropical ridge.  By the 
end of the week, however, Gaston is expected to stall to the west of 
the Azores in weak steering currents as high pressure builds near 
and to the north of the cyclone.  After that time, a turn to the 
northwest or north is expected as Gaston moves in the flow between 
Hurricane Fiona and the ridge.  The models have trended a little 
faster this cycle, and the NHC track forecast has been adjusted 
accordingly.

Gaston is currently moving over relatively warm water, in a region 
of upper-level diffluence within a somewhat favorable moist 
environment. These factors should allow the system to strengthen 
slowly during the next day or two.  However, after that time, 
much cooler SSTs, drier air, and an increase in westerly shear 
should end the strengthening trend.  The system is expected to 
become extratropical on Saturday when it moves over SSTs just 
above 20C and merges with a mid- to upper-level trough.  The NHC 
intensity forecast is about the same as the previous one and near 
the middle of the guidance envelope. 

Interests in the Azores should monitor the forecast for Gaston.
