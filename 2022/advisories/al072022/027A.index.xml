<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Fiona, located near the Turks and Caicos islands, and on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gaston, located over the north-central Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is producing shower and thunderstorm activity a few <br/>
hundred miles east of the Windward Islands. The system continues to <br/>
show signs of organization and it will likely become a tropical <br/>
depression within the next two or three days. The disturbance is <br/>
forecast to move west-northwestward across the southern Windward <br/>
Islands late Wednesday and then move toward the central Caribbean <br/>
Sea late this week. Interests in the Windward Islands should closely <br/>
monitor the progress of this system as heavy rainfall and gusty <br/>
winds could affect these islands beginning on Wednesday.  <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is forecast to move off the west coast of Africa on <br/>
Thursday. Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive for <br/>
at least gradual development of the system for a couple days <br/>
thereafter while the system moves slowly northward between west <br/>
Africa and the Cabo Verde Islands through the end of the week. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Fiona Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
1100 PM EDT Tue Sep 20 2022
 
Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft that has been 
investigating Fiona this evening show that the hurricane has 
strengthened since this afternoon.  The aircraft has measured peak 
700-mb flight-level winds of 120 kt, and SFMR winds of around 110 kt 
earlier in the evening. Based on those data, the intensity was 
increased to 110 kt on the intermediate advisory at 0000 UTC.  Since 
that time, the satellite presentation has continued to improve with 
the eye becoming better defined and the surrounding ring of deep 
convection expanding with colder cloud top temperatures. The 
pressure has fallen a few more millibars and is now down to 947 mb, 
however the plane has not found any higher winds during several 
passes through the northeastern and northern portion of the eyewall. 
It is worth noting that the latest subjective and objective 
satellite estimates suggest a stronger intensity, and this may be a 
case in which the winds are lagging the improved satellite 
presentation, which is not too uncommon. 

The vertical wind shear over the hurricane is expected to remain low 
to moderate during the next couple of days.  During that time, the 
hurricane will be traversing SSTs of 29-30 degrees Celsius, and 
remain in a moist environment.  These conditions should allow for 
some additional strengthening during the next 12 to 24 hours, but 
after that time, difficult-to-predict eyewall replacement cycles are 
likely to cause some fluctuations in intensity.  By day 3, the 
system is forecast to interact with a vigorous mid-troposphere 
trough and the system is expected to become a large and powerful 
extratropical cyclone near Atlantic Canada.
 
The latest satellite and aircraft fixes indicate that the hurricane 
is now moving just west of due north or 350/7 kt. Fiona should move 
generally northward around the western periphery of a mid-level 
ridge during the next 24 hours.  After that time, the hurricane is 
forecast to turn north-northeastward and begin to gradually 
accelerate as the aforementioned trough approaches from the 
northwest. Very little cross-track changes were made to the latest 
NHC forecast, but it is slightly slower than the previous advisory 
to be in better agreement with the bulk of the dynamical models. 

 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Heavy rains south of Fiona will continue to impact the Turks and 
Caicos through tonight with additional flooding possible.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda by late
Thursday.
 
3. Fiona is expected to affect portions of Atlantic Canada as a
powerful hurricane-force cyclone late Friday and Saturday, and could
produce significant impacts from high winds, storm surge, and heavy
rainfall. Interests in these areas should closely monitor the
progress of Fiona and updates to the forecast.

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
300 AM GMT Wed Sep 21 2022
 
The satellite presentation of Gaston has improved slightly since 
the previous advisory, with deep convection persisting over the 
low-level circulation center. The latest current intensity 
estimates reflect what has been seen in the satellite imagery, with 
TAFB and SAB coming in at 45 knots, while the ADT and AiDT values 
from UW-CIMSS showing 35 knots and 46 knots respectively. Based on 
a blend of these data along with the improved satellite appearance, 
the initial intensity has been raised to 45 knots.
 
Gaston continues on a path toward the north-northeast, 
with the initial motion estimated to be 020/16 kt.  A turn to 
northeast is expected today, followed by a turn to the east by 
Thursday as the tropical storm moves along the the northern 
periphery of a subtropical ridge. By late this week, Gaston is 
expected to stall to the west of the Azores in weak steering 
currents as a mid-level ridge builds to the north of cyclone. A turn 
to the northwest or north is expected over the weekend as Gaston 
moves in the steering flow between Hurricane Fiona to the west and 
the building mid-level ridge to the east. The latest NHC track 
forecast has changed little and lies very close to the previous 
advisory track, and closely follows the consensus track guidance.
 
The period for additional intensification is quickly closing, as 
Gaston is moving over the 26C isotherm, and will move over 
progressively cooler water through the remainder of the forecast 
period. Additionally, the impact of the vertical wind shear will 
increase in a couple days as the tropical cyclone stalls out while 
westerly shear holds in the 25 to 30 knot range. As a result, the 
intensity forecast calls for slight strengthening today, followed by 
little change in strength for another day or so after that. The 
combination of cool SSTs, dry mid-level air, and increasing vertical 
wind shear should then lead to slow weakening through the remainder 
of the week. The latest NHC was adjusted upward through the first 24 
hours to account for the strengthening which has already occurred, 
with only minor adjustments made through the remainder of the 
forecast period, closely following the consensus intensity aids.  
 
Interests in the Azores should continue to monitor the forecast for 
Gaston.
