800 AM EDT Wed Sep 21 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Fiona, located northeast of the southeastern Bahamas, and on <br/>
Tropical Storm Gaston, located over the north-central Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Western Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is producing shower and thunderstorm activity a <br/>
couple hundred miles east of the southern Windward Islands. The <br/>
system continues to show signs of organization, and it will likely <br/>
become a tropical depression within the next couple of days. The <br/>
disturbance is forecast to move west-northwestward across the <br/>
southern Windward Islands today and then move toward the central <br/>
Caribbean Sea later this week. Interests in the Windward Islands <br/>
should closely monitor the progress of this system as heavy rainfall <br/>
and gusty winds are affecting these islands.  Regardless of <br/>
development, heavy rainfall is forecast to affect northwestern <br/>
Venezuela, northeastern Colombia, and the ABC island chain later <br/>
this week.  <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is forecast to move off the west coast of Africa on <br/>
Thursday. Thereafter, environmental conditions are forecast to be <br/>
conducive for some development, and a tropical depression could <br/>
form this weekend while the system moves slowly northward, between <br/>
west Africa and the Cabo Verde Islands. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
East Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity has increased  in association with <br/>
a tropical wave located several hundred miles west-southwest of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands.  Despite a dry environment, slow development <br/>
of this system is possible over the next several days as it moves <br/>
northwestward and then westward over the tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Fiona was located by 
an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 24.2 North, 
longitude 71.7 West.  Fiona is moving toward the north near 8 mph 
(13 km/h).  This general motion is expected to continue through

in forward speed is expected by Thursday.  On the forecast track, 
the center of Fiona will continue to move away from the Turks and 
Caicos today, and approach Bermuda late on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Fiona is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some additional strengthening is forecast 
through tonight, with some fluctuations in intensity possible on 
Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160
miles (260 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft observations is 937 mb (27.67 inches).

Hurricane Fiona Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
500 AM EDT Wed Sep 21 2022

An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft has recently 
reported 700-mb flight-level winds of 128 kt, and reliable surface 
winds estimates from the SFMR of 115 kt.  The central pressure 
inside the 25 n mi wide eye has fallen to 939 mb.  Based on these 
data, the initial intensity is set at 115 kt, making Fiona a 
category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.

There is little change to the intensity forecast philosophy since 
the last advisory. The vertical wind shear over Fiona is expected 
to remain low to moderate during the next couple of days.  During 
that time, the hurricane will be traversing warm sea surface 
temperatures and remain in a moist environment.  These conditions 
should allow for some additional strengthening during the next 12 
to 24 hours, and the new intensity forecast calls for a peak 
intensity of 120 kt during that time.  After that time, difficult- 
to-predict eyewall replacement cycles are likely to cause some 
fluctuations in intensity.  Starting near 72 h, Fiona is expected 
to 
interact with a vigorous mid-latitude trough, which should lead to 
transition into an intense extratropical low between 72-96 h.  
After 96 h, the system is expected to weaken.

The initial motion is now 360/7.  Fiona should move generally 
northward around the western periphery of a mid-level ridge during 
the next 12-24 hours.  After that time, the hurricane is forecast 
to turn north-northeastward and begin to gradually accelerate as 
the aforementioned trough approaches from the northwest.  There 
were no no significant changes to the guidance from the last 
advisory, and the new forecast track is an update of the previous 
track.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Heavy rains south of Fiona will continue to impact the Turks and
Caicos through this morning with additional flooding possible.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda by late
Thursday.
 
3. Fiona is expected to affect portions of Atlantic Canada as a
powerful hurricane-force cyclone late Friday and Saturday, and could
produce significant impacts from high winds, storm surge, and heavy
rainfall. Interests in these areas should closely monitor the
progress of Fiona and updates to the forecast.

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
900 AM GMT Wed Sep 21 2022

Gaston has continued to improve on satellite imagery overnight. 
Curved bands can be seen rotating fully around the southwestern 
side 
of the tropical cyclone with a warm spot occasionally apparent near 
where the center is. I was somewhat skeptical that this structure 
was indicative of a formative inner core, but a helpful GMI 
microwave pass at 0407 UTC revealed this was no illusion, with a 
nearly closed ring of convection on both 89 and 37 GHz channels. 
Subjective Dvorak classifications from SAB were T3.0/45-kt and 
TAFB T3.5/55-kt. Given the improvement in structure tonight, the 
winds have been increased to 55-kt this advisory.

Gaston continues to move to the north-northeast at 025/16 kt. A 
turn 
north northeastward is expected later today followed by a more 
eastward motion by Thursday. By the latter part of this week, 
Gaston 
is forecast to come to near screeching halt to the west of the 
Azores in weak steering currents as a mid-level ridge builds 
northward, related to Fiona's downstream diabatic induced ridging. 
A 
turn to the northwest or north is expected over the weekend as 
Gaston moves in the steering flow between Hurricane Fiona to the 
west and the building mid-level ridge to the east. The latest NHC 
track forecast has changed little and lies very close to the 
previous advisory track. 

Based on the current structure, Gaston might be able to intensify a 
bit more today. However as Gaston slows down the westerly 
upper-level flow the storm is embedded will likely cause the 
structure to deteriorate, with both the GFS and ECMWF simulated 
satellite imagery suggesting the convection could de-couple from 
the storm in about 48-60 hours. Thus, the latest forecast shows 
weakening during this time period, and Gaston could become a 
post-tropical extratropical cyclone as soon as 72 hours. The latest 
NHC intensity forecast is a bit higher, owing to the initial 
intensity, but remains fairly close to the previous forecast after 
60 hours.
 
Interests in the Azores should continue to monitor the forecast for
Gaston.
