DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Fiona
was located near latitude 47.3 North, longitude 61.5 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the north near 23 mph (37
km/h).  A slower north-northeast or northward motion is expected
through Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Fiona will
move across the Gulf of St. Lawrence this morning, and then move 
across Labrador and over the Labrador Sea on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Although gradual weakening is forecast during the next
couple of days, Fiona is expected to maintain hurricane-force winds
until this afternoon.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 405
miles (650 km).  An observation on St. Paul Island recently 
reported a sustained wind of 76 mph (122 km/h) and a gust to 90 
(145 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface 
observations is 937 mb (27.67 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Fiona can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are occurring in portions of the
hurricane warning area in Canada. Tropical storm conditions are
occurring in portions of the tropical storm warning area in Canada.
These conditions should persist through this evening. Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the watch area in Labrador on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and western Newfoundland: 3 to 6
inches (75 to 150 mm), with local maxima of up to 10 inches (250
mm). Flooding is expected, some of which could be significant.
 
Labrador and eastern Quebec:  2 to 5 inches (50 to 125 mm).
 
Eastern New Brunswick: 1 to 3 inches (25 to 75 mm).
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding within the warning areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of
onshore winds. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting Atlantic Canada, the
northeastern United States coast, and Bermuda. The swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Fiona Discussion Number  40
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
500 AM AST Sat Sep 24 2022

Around 07Z, the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Fiona made landfall 
on the Canso Peninsula of Nova Scotia near Hart Island and 
Guysborough.  Surface observations indicate that the minimum 
pressure at landfall was near 931 mb.  The initial intensity is 
decreased to a somewhat uncertain 80 kt based on earlier 
scatterometer data, with these winds occurring primarily to the 
east and southeast of the center.

Fiona is starting to slow its forward motion, with the initial 
motion now 360/23 kt.  A general northward to north-northeastward 
motion with some additional decrease in forward speed is expected 
during the next 60 h.  A subsequent northeastward motion is then 
forecast until the cyclone dissipates just after 72 h.  The new 
forecast track is similar to the previous track, but it lies a 
little west of the previous track at 24-36 h.  The new forecast 
track is close to the various consensus models.
 
Gradual weakening is anticipated during the next couple of days,  
and Fiona's winds should drop below hurricane strength in just over 
12 h.  After that, winds should decrease below gale force by 72 h 
while the system is over the Labrador Sea.  The new intensity 
forecast follows the trend of the intensity guidance and lies on 
the upper edge of the guidance.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Fiona is expected to affect portions of Atlantic Canada as a
powerful hurricane-force cyclone today, and significant impacts
from high winds, storm surge, and heavy rainfall are expected.
Hurricane and Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect for much of
Atlantic Canada.
 
2. Large swells generated by Fiona are expected to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along much of the
east coast of the United States, the northwestern Bahamas, Bermuda,
and Atlantic Canada during the next couple of days.

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
900 AM GMT Sat Sep 24 2022
 
Since yesterday, Gaston has been transitioning to an asymmetric 
warm core post-tropical cyclone.  A Friday morning 1227Z METOP-C 
scatterometer data confirmed that the transition had begun by 
depicting growing asymmetry in the wind field with a hundred-mile 
increase in gale-force winds in the northwest quadrant.  Subsequent 
surface winds less than 60 miles from the center were 20 kt or 
less, all characteristics of a post-tropical/extratropical cyclone 
wind profile.  The initial intensity is set at a generous 45 kt and 
is above the various subjective and objective satellite intensity 
estimates.
 
As a result of increasing deep-layer shear and decreasing sea
surface temperature beneath the cyclone, Gaston's organized deep
convection has diminished considerably.  Only a few convective 
fragments remain well displaced to the southeast of the surface 
center.  Accordingly, further weakening is expected, and Gaston 
should complete its post-tropical transition later today.  A couple 
of the global models, however, indicate a mid-latitude shortwave 
trough/baroclinic zone interacting with post-tropical Gaston early 
Sunday morning, which could create a flare-up of deep convection, 
but this should be a short-lived event.
 
Gaston's initial motion is estimated to be west-southwestward, or 
250/8 kt.  Building high pressure over the northeast Atlantic 
should continue to steer the post-tropical cyclone westward through 
Monday morning, and west-southwestward until dissipation occurs 
toward the end of the week.  The official track forecast is a 
little faster than the previous advisory and is nudged to the 
south beyond 48 hours to agree more with the NOAA HFIP HCCA model.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions over the western and central Azores 
today should diminish this evening as Gaston moves away from the 
islands.
 
2. Gaston is expected to produce heavy rainfall over the western 
and central Azores through Saturday.  This rainfall may result in 
landslides and areas of flooding.

Florida peninsula should monitor the progress of Ian.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ian was
located near latitude 14.2 North, longitude 74.5 West. Ian is moving
toward the west-southwest near 15 mph (24 km/h). A westward to
west-northwestward motion is expected through early Sunday. A turn
toward the northwest is forecast late Sunday, followed by a
north-northwestward turn by late Monday. On the forecast track, the
center of Ian is forecast to move across the central Caribbean Sea
today, pass southwest of Jamaica on Sunday, and pass near or over
the Cayman Islands Sunday night and early Monday. Ian will then
approach western Cuba on Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Strengthening is forecast during the next few days, and Ian is 
expected to become a hurricane late Sunday or Sunday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible in the Cayman Islands by
early Monday, with tropical storm conditions possible by Sunday
night. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Jamaica on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce the following rainfall:
 
Southern Haiti and Southern Dominican Republic: 2 to 4 inches, with
local maximum up to 6 inches
 
Jamaica and the Cayman Islands: 4 to 8 inches, with local maximum up
to 12 inches
 
Western to central Cuba: 6 to 10 inches, with local maximum up to 14
inches
 
These rains may produce flash flooding and mudslides in areas of
higher terrain, particularly over Jamaica and Cuba.
 
Florida Keys and South Florida: Heavy rains could begin as early as
Monday. Limited flash and urban flooding is possible with this
rainfall.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to
3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas
of onshore winds in the Cayman Islands Sunday night into Monday.
 
Localized coastal flooding is possible along the coast of Jamaica in
areas of onshore winds on Sunday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ian will begin affecting Jamaica, the
Cayman Islands, and Cuba over the next several days. These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Ian Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
500 AM EDT Sat Sep 24 2022

Ian is still being affected by some north-northeasterly, however 
short-wave infrared imagery suggests that the center is located 
beneath the eastern edge of the colder convective cloud tops.  
Deep convection over the western portion of the circulation has 
increased overnight but there is still little banding evident in 
conventional satellite imagery.  Subjective Dvorak satellite 
classifications from TAFB and SAB, and objective estimates from 
UW-CIMSS have changed little this cycle, but given that the center 
is more involved with the deep convection, the initial intensity 
has been increased to 40 kt, which is between the objective 
estimates and a TAFB Dvorak T-number of 3.0 or 45 kt.  A NOAA 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate Ian this 
morning, and should provide additional data on Ian's structure 
and intensity.
 
Recent satellite fixes indicate that Ian has turned westward 
(270/12 kt) overnight to the south of a narrow ridge centered 
near Hispaniola.  By early Sunday, Ian is expected to reach the 
western portion of the ridge, and the storm should turn 
west-northwestward, and then northwestward over the northwestern 
Caribbean in 36 to 48 hours.  After that time, Ian is forecast to 
turn north-northwestward and northward around the western portion 
of the ridge.  This will bring Ian near or over Western Cuba and 
into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico.  Late in the period, the 
guidance indicates the storm will begin to recurve toward Florida.  
As mentioned before, the track models are in general agreement with 
this scenario, however there is a large amount of cross-track 
spread at 72 hours and beyond.  In fact, the east-west spread in 
the guidance at 96 hours is about 180 n mi, with the CTCI and ECMWF 
along the eastern side of the envelope, and the GFS, HWRF, and GFS 
ensemble mean along the western side.  The overall guidance 
envelope has shifted slightly westward this cycle, and the NHC 
track has been nudged in that direction and lies just east of the 
various consensus aids.  Given the spread in the guidance, and 
the still shifting dynamical models, additional adjustments to the 
track forecast may be needed in subsequent advisories.  Users are 
reminded that the long-term average NHC 4- and 5-day track errors 
are around 150 and 200 n mi, respectively. 

The shear that has been plaguing Ian is forecast to continue to 
decrease over the next day or two while the cyclone moves over the 
warm waters of the central and northwestern Caribbean Sea. This 
should allow for strengthening, with steady to rapid 
intensification (RI) quite possible once an inner core becomes 
established. Although the updated NHC forecast is just shy of 
forecasting RI (30 kt or greater increase over 24 h) during any 24-h 
period over the next few days, it calls a 45-kt increase in wind 
speed between 24 and 72 hours, and Ian is likely to be near major 
hurricane intensity when it approaches western Cuba.  Since Ian is 
not expected to remain over Cuba long, little weakening is expected 
due to that land interaction, and the forecast again shows Ian as a 
major hurricane over the eastern Gulf when it is approaching the 
west coast of Florida.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Ian is expected to produce heavy rainfall and instances of
flash flooding and possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain,
particularly over Jamaica and Cuba.
 
2.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the Cayman Islands by
early Monday, with tropical storm conditions possible by late
Sunday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible in Jamaica on
Sunday.
 
3.  Early next week, Ian is forecast to move near or over western
Cuba as a strengthening hurricane and then approach the Florida
peninsula at or near major hurricane strength, with the potential
for significant impacts from storm surge, hurricane-force winds,
and heavy rainfall.  While it is too soon to determine the
exact magnitude and location of these impacts, residents in Cuba,
the Florida Keys, and the Florida peninsula should ensure they have
their hurricane plan in place and closely monitor forecast updates
through the weekend.

Tropical Storm Hermine Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102022
800 AM CVT Sat Sep 24 2022
 
Hermine is barely holding on as a tropical storm.  This morning's 
satellite presentation consists of an exposed surface circulation 
situated well to the south-southwest of the deep convective mass.  
The initial intensity is set at a generous 35 kt.
 
The southwesterly shear is currently affecting Hermine's cloud 
pattern is predicted to increase while the thermodynamic 
surrounding environment becomes progressively inhibiting.  
Therefore, Hermine may hang on as a tropical storm today, but 
weakening is expected to occur soon, and the cyclone should 
degenerate into a remnant low-pressure system on Monday.
The latest NHC intensity forecast is unchanged from the previous 
one, and is on the high end of the guidance.
 
The 0900 UTC position is based on a centroid point between 
multiple surface swirls, one well to the south of the 
convection and another near the edge of the convective canopy. 
Hermine's initial motion is estimated to be northward, or 355/9 kt.
Hermine is expected to turn toward the northeast around the
northwest periphery of the east Atlantic subtropical ridge Sunday 
evening.  By Monday evening, the vertically shallow remnant low 
should turn toward the northwest in the east Atlantic trade wind 
flow.  No significant changes were made to the NHC track forecast, 
which lies in the middle of the model guidance suite.
