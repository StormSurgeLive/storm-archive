<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Fiona, located just north of the northern coast of the Dominican <br/>
Republic.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic:<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity has increased slightly this evening <br/>
in association with an area of low pressure located over the central <br/>
subtropical Atlantic.  Some slow development is possible during the <br/>
next couple of days, and a tropical depression could form during <br/>
that time before environmental conditions become less conducive <br/>
later this week.  The system should generally move northward or <br/>
northeastward while remaining over the open waters of central <br/>
subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located several hundred miles east of the Windward <br/>
Islands is producing an area of disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms.  Some gradual development of this system is possible <br/>
during the next several days while the system approaches the <br/>
Windward Islands toward the end of the week and moves over the <br/>
eastern Caribbean sea over the weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Fiona was located
near latitude 20.9 North, longitude 70.8 West. Fiona is moving
toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). This general
motion is expected to continue through today, followed by a turn
toward the north tonight or Wednesday. On the forecast track,
the center of Fiona will pass near the easternmost Turks and Caicos 
during the next several hours.
 
Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that the maximum sustained winds have increased to near 115 mph (185 
km/h) with higher gusts. Fiona is now a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Additional strengthening is 
expected during the next couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150
miles (240 km).  Weather reports relayed by amateur radio indicate 
that sustained tropical-storm-force winds are occurring over 
portions of the Turks and Caicos islands.
 
The latest minimum central pressure reported by the Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft is 967 mb (28.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Fiona can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header
WTNT42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the Turks and Caicos
starting in the next several hours.  Tropical storm and hurricane 
conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area in the 
Dominican Republic for a few more hours.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the
southeastern Bahamas starting in the next several hours.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands: Additional 2 to 4 inches. Storm
Total up to 10 inches on St. Croix.
 
Southern Puerto Rico: Additional 3 to 6 inches with local maximum of
8 inches. Storm Total 12 to 20 inches with local maximum of over 30
inches.
 
Northern Puerto Rico: Additional 1 to 3 inches with local maximum of
5 inches. Storm Total 4 to 12 inches with local maximum of 20
inches.
 
Northern and Eastern Dominican Republic: Additional 4 to 8 inches
with local maximum of 10 inches. Storm Total up to 20 inches in the
eastern section.
 
Rest of Dominican Republic and Eastern Haiti: 3 to 6 inches.
 
Turks and Caicos: 4 to 8 inches.
 
Southeast Bahamas: 1 to 3 inches.
 
These rains will continue to produce life-threatening and
catastrophic flooding along with mudslides and landslides across
Puerto Rico. Life-threatening flash and urban flooding is likely for
eastern portions of the Dominican Republic.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 5 to 8 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Turks and Caicos through today.
 
Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Dominican Republic.
 
Localized coastal flooding is possible for the Southeastern Bahamas
in areas of onshore winds through today.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Virgin Islands,
Puerto Rico, the northern coast of Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos
Islands, and the southeastern Bahamas.  These swells will continue
to spread westward across the southwestern Atlantic toward the
central and northwestern Bahamas and the east coast of the United
States through midweek.  The swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.

Hurricane Fiona Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
1100 PM EDT Mon Sep 19 2022
 
The satellite presentation of the hurricane has improved 
significantly this evening.  The eye has warmed and become more 
distinct and the surrounding ring of deep convection has cooled and 
is more symmetric.  More recently, the eye has become smaller in 
size and this has also been observed by both NOAA and Air Force 
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft that have been sampling the storm 
this evening. The aircraft have reported that the eye has shrunk to 
around 10 n mi in diameter.  The NOAA plane has measured a peak 
flight level wind of 104 kt at around 8000 ft, while the Air Force 
aircraft has reported a peak 700-mb flight-level wind of 93 kt.  
Peak SFMR winds of 94-96 kt have also been found, and these data 
support increasing the initial intensity to 95 kt. 
 
The hurricane's outflow is somewhat restricted over the western
portion of the circulation owing to some moderate southwesterly
shear of the storm.  Although this shear is not forecast to abate
much, the intensity guidance indicates that warm water and a moist
atmosphere should allow for continued intensification during the
next 24 to 48 hours.  Given the recent improvement in structure,
the updated NHC intensity forecast calls for a slightly faster rate
of strengthening during the next 12 to 24 hours, and it is at the
upper end of the intensity guidance.  The official forecast shows
Fiona becoming a major hurricane overnight, and brings the
hurricane to category 4 status in a day or so.  Eyewall replacement
cycles are likely to cause some fluctuations in intensity in the
24-72 h time period.  By day 4, the hurricane is forecast to
interact with a strong mid-tropospheric trough, which will start
the system's extratropical transition.  The process is forecast to 
be complete by the end of the period, and Fiona is expected to 
remain a powerful extratropical cyclone through day 5. 
 
The initial motion estimate is 330/9 kt. There track forecast 
philosophy again remains the same as the previous few forecast 
cycles. The hurricane should gradually turn north while moving 
around the western periphery of a mid-level ridge. After 72 hours,  
Fiona is forecast to turn north-northeastward and accelerate as a 
strong mid-level trough nears the northeastern United States. The 
track guidance remains tightly clustered and the NHC forecast is 
similar to the previous advisory, near the middle of the guidance 
envelope. 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Heavy rains from Fiona will continue across parts of Puerto Rico 
and across northern and eastern Dominican Republic through tonight. 
These rainfall amounts will continue to produce life-threatening 
and catastrophic flooding along with mudslides and landslides 
across Puerto Rico. Life-threatening flash and urban flooding is 
likely for eastern portions of the Dominican Republic.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are expected over the Turks and Caicos, with
tropical storm conditions over the southeastern Bahamas, beginning
late tonight or early Tuesday.
 
3.  Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Fiona.
