DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fiona was
located by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near 
latitude 16.6 North, longitude 64.1 West.  Fiona is moving toward 
the west near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A west-northwestward motion at a 
similar forward speed is expected to begin later today, followed by 
a turn toward the northwest by Sunday evening.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Fiona is expected to move near or south of the 
Virgin Islands this evening, approach Puerto Rico tonight, and move 
near or over Puerto Rico Sunday night.  Fiona should then move near 
the Dominican Republic on Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next few days, and Fiona
is expected to become a hurricane by Sunday or Sunday night while
moving near Puerto Rico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
Data from the reconnaissance aircraft indicate that the minimum
central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Fiona can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header
WTNT42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected on Puerto Rico Sunday and
Sunday night and are possible in the U.S. Virgin Islands tonight.
Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area in
the Dominican Republic Sunday night and Monday.
 
Tropical storm conditions will continue across portions of the
Leeward Islands within the warning area through this afternoon.
Tropical storm conditions will reach the U.S. and British Virgin
Islands this afternoon, spread westward across Puerto Rico tonight,
and reach portions of the Dominican Republic Sunday night.
Tropical storm conditions are possible across the watch
area in the Dominican Republic Sunday night.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
Leeward Islands and Northern Windward Islands: Additional 2 to 4
inches.
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands: 4 to 6 inches with local maximum of
10 inches possible.
 
Puerto Rico: 12 to 16 inches with local maximum of 20 inches
possible, particularly across eastern and southern Puerto Rico.
 
Dominican Republic: 4 to 8 inches with local maximum of 12 inches
possible, particularly on the far eastern coast.
 
Haiti: 1 to 3 inches with isolated maximum totals of 4 inches.
 
Turks and Caicos: 4 to 6 inches.
 
These rains are likely to produce flash and urban flooding, along
with mudslides in areas of higher terrain, particularly southern and
eastern Puerto Rico and the eastern Dominican Republic.

Very heavy rains and flooding have occurred over portions of the 
Leeward Islands since Friday.  A station at St. Claude Matouba Irfa, 
in the mountains in southwestern Guadeloupe, recently measured a 
24-hour rainfall total of 19.46 inches (494.3 mm).
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas
in areas of onshore winds if the peak surge occurs at the time of
high tide...
 
Southern coast of Puerto Rico...1 to 3 ft
Vieques and Culebra...1 to 3 ft
U.S. Virgin Islands...1 to 2 ft
 
Localized coastal flooding is also possible elsewhere in Puerto
Rico.  For information specific to your area, please see products
issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Dominican Republic.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Leeward Islands,
the northern Windward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the
northern coast of the Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos
Islands, and the southeastern Bahamas.  These conditions could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Fiona Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
1100 AM AST Sat Sep 17 2022
 
Fiona is going through some structural changes this morning.  From 
a zoomed-out view on satellite imagery, Fiona appears better 
organized compared to previous days, with the convective envelope 
becoming more symmetric, and upper-level outflow expanding around 
most of the storm.  However, Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft data indicate that the central part of the 
circulation still lacks some vertical coherency.  From the best we 
can tell from the aircraft data, the low-level center appears to be 
re-forming farther east near a recent burst of deep convection.  
The central pressure may have risen a bit during this 
re-organization process, but maximum winds are still estimated to 
be 50 kt.

With the center re-formation, the initial motion has become more 
uncertain, although Fiona has definitely slowed down from 
yesterday.  The longer-term average motion is 275/7 kt.  The track 
forecast reasoning remains unchanged, with Fiona expected to 
gradually recurve around the western extent of the western 
Atlantic subtropical ridge through the 5-day forecast period.  The 
big change, however, is that the adjusted initial position due to 
the center re-formation has tugged all of the guidance eastward on 
this cycle.  The new NHC forecast is also east of the previous one 
and lies close to the HCCA and TVCN consensus aids, now showing a 
track near or over the western part of Puerto Rico in about 36 
hours.  The caveat to this forecast is that additional center 
re-formations could cause models to shift again, and therefore 
there's quite a bit of uncertainty in the short-term track 
forecast.  Especially in cases like this, users are reminded to not 
focus solely on the track forecast itself, and to account for 
potential shifts in the track east or west.

The upper-level environment over Fiona has improved, and deep-layer 
shear is expected to be light to moderate for the next several 
days.  In fact, along with a favorable thermodynamic environment, 
the Rapid Intensification Indices have increased, and now show a 
1-in-3 chance of a 30-kt increase over the next 24 hours.  There is 
some uncertainty as to how quickly Fiona can take advantage of 
these favorable conditions given its current structure.  But either 
way, intensification is anticipated, and Fiona is likely to be near 
or at hurricane strength while it moves near Puerto Rico on Sunday. 
The NHC intensity forecast has been increased from the previous 
prediction, but it still lies below the intensity consensus aids.  
If Fiona gets better organized today, then it's possible that 
additional increases to the intensity forecast will be forthcoming 
later today. 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Hurricane conditions are expected across portions of Puerto 
Rico Sunday and Sunday night, and are possible across the U.S. 
Virgin Islands tonight and Sunday.  Tropical storm conditions will 
continue to affect portions of the Leeward Islands today and will 
spread westward to the U.S. and British Virgin Islands later 
today, and to Puerto Rico tonight.  Tropical storm conditions will 
reach the Dominican Republic by Sunday night.
 
2. Heavy rains from Fiona will spread west to the British and U.S. 
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico today, the Dominican Republic Sunday, 
and the Turks and Caicos Monday night. This rainfall is likely to 
produce considerable flood impacts including flash and urban 
flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain, 
particularly in Puerto Rico.
 
3. Fiona is forecast to strengthen while moving near Puerto Rico 
and the Dominican Republic through Monday, and interests in the 
Turks and Caicos Islands and southeastern Bahamas should continue to 
monitor forecasts for the storm.
