Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Wed Sep 21 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Fiona, located several hundred miles southwest of Bermuda, and on <br/>
Tropical Storm Gaston, located several hundred miles west of the <br/>
Azores. <br/>
<br/>
Southeastern Caribbean Sea:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave located <br/>
over the far southeastern Caribbean Sea have changed little in <br/>
organization since this morning.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to become more conducive for development, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form within the next couple of days.  The  <br/>
disturbance is forecast to move west-northwestward across the <br/>
eastern Caribbean Sea during the next day or two, and be over the <br/>
central Caribbean Sea this weekend.  Regardless of development, <br/>
locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds are likely to affect the <br/>
Windward Islands tonight, and northern Venezuela, northeastern <br/>
Colombia, and the ABC island chain during the next couple of days.  <br/>
An Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft is currently surveying <br/>
the system, and data from this mission will be assimilated into <br/>
tonight's forecast models.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms located near the west coast of Africa are <br/>
associated with a tropical wave that is forecast to move over the <br/>
far eastern Atlantic waters on Thursday.  Thereafter, environmental <br/>
conditions are forecast to be conducive for some development, and a <br/>
tropical depression could form by this weekend while the system <br/>
moves slowly northward, between west Africa and the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
East Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands continues to produce <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Despite a dry environment, <br/>
slow development of this system is possible over the next several <br/>
days as it moves slowly northwestward or northward over the <br/>
tropical Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Fiona was located
by a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 25.9 North, 
longitude 71.4 West.  Fiona is moving toward the north near 9 mph 
(15 km/h).  This general motion is expected to continue through this 
evening.  A turn toward the north-northeast with an increase in 
forward speed is expected by Thursday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Fiona will approach Bermuda late tomorrow, and approach 
Atlantic Canada late Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Fiona is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some strengthening is forecast through
tonight, with some fluctuations in intensity possible on Thursday.
Fiona is forecast to be a hurricane-force cyclone through Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195
miles (315 km).
 
Data from the NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the 
minimum central pressure is 934 mb (27.58 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Hurricane Fiona Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
500 PM EDT Wed Sep 21 2022
 
Fiona continues to have a fairly impressive presentation on 
satellite images, although the eye has become partially cloud-
filled.  The central convection continues to have very cold cloud 
tops to near -80 deg C,  and the Central Dense Overcast is 
surrounded by numerous banding features, especially over the 
eastern semicircle.  Upper-tropospheric outflow is strong over the 
northern and eastern portions of the circulation.  The current 
intensity is held at 115 kt, i.e. Category 4, in agreement with a 
subjective Dvorak estimate from SAB. 

The hurricane should remain over warm waters for the next 48 hours, 
and in a moist and unstable air mass.  Some strengthening is still 
possible within the next day or so.  Eyewall replacement cycles 
could cause some intensity fluctuations, but these are difficult to 
predict.  Fiona is expected to interact with a strong 
mid-tropospheric trough moving off the northeastern United States 
coast in around 60 hours.  This interaction should lead to the 
system transforming into an intense extratropical cyclone, with 
hurricane-force winds, before it reaches Atlantic Canada.

Fiona's motion is beginning to show signs of a turn toward the 
north-northeast as the eye has been leaning toward the right 
over the past few hours.  The initial motion is just east of 
north or about 010/8 kt.  There are no significant changes to the 
track forecast or its reasoning.  During the next 12 to 24 
hours, the hurricane is expected to move northward to 
north-northeastward along the western periphery of a mid-level 
subtropical high pressure area.  Thereafter, Fiona is forecast to
gradually accelerate northeastward to north-northeastward in 
the flow ahead of the aforementioned trough.  The official track 
forecast remains close to both the simple and corrected 
dynamical model consensus, TVCN and HCCA, respectively.

Based on an earlier ASCAT overpass, the wind radii have been 
expanded.  The model guidance indicates that Fiona will grow even 
larger in size during the next few days.  
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane conditions are possible, and tropical storm conditions
are expected, on Bermuda by late tomorrow.
 
2. Fiona is expected to affect portions of Atlantic Canada as a
powerful hurricane-force cyclone late Friday and Saturday, and could
produce significant impacts from high winds, storm surge, and heavy
rainfall. Interests in these areas should closely monitor the
progress of Fiona and updates to the forecast.

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
900 PM GMT Wed Sep 21 2022

There has been little change associated with Gaston during the past 
several hours.  The system continues to produce an area of deep 
convection near the center and exhibits well-defined outflow over 
the western semicircle.  However, drier air is entraining into 
the eastern portion of the circulation.  The Dvorak CI-numbers from 
TAFB and SAB continue to support an initial intensity of 55 kt. 
 
Gaston continues to track northeastward over the north-central
Atlantic, with the latest initial motion estimated to be 045/12 kt.
Although there is no significant change to the forecast reasoning,
there is a considerable amount of model spread in the details of the
future steering pattern.  An amplifying ridge associated with Fiona 
is expected to trap Gaston's circulation late this week and this 
weekend.  This could result in a clockwise loop and an eventual 
turn westward.  The new NHC track forecast is a little to the south 
and faster than the previous one, trending toward the latest 
consensus models. 
 
It appears that the opportunity for strengthening has ended.  A slow 
weakening trend should begin in the next day or so when Gaston moves 
over cooler waters and into a region of drier air and slightly 
stronger westerly vertical wind shear.  An approaching mid-level 
trough should aid in the system's transition to an extratropical 
cyclone in a couple of days or so.  The NHC intensity forecast 
remains near the middle of the guidance envelope.
 
Interests in the Azores should continue to monitor the forecast for
Gaston.  For additional information, see warnings and products
issued by the meteorological service in the Azores.
