DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Fiona was located
near latitude 18.1 North, longitude 67.8 West.  Fiona has jogged 
westward over the past few hours, but a northwestward motion near
9 mph (15 km/h) should resume later this evening.  A northwestward 
motion is forecast to continue through Monday, followed by a turn 
toward the north-northwest on Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Fiona will move near the eastern and northern coasts of 
the Dominican Republic tonight and Monday, and near or to the east 
of the Turks and Caicos Islands on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140
miles (220 km). A wind gust to 55 mph (89 km/h) was recently 
reported at Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico. A sustained wind of 44 mph 
(70 km/h) with a gust to 55 mph (89 km/h) has been measured at Los 
Mareas in Puerto Rico within the past couple of hours. 
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Reserve 
reconnaissance aircraft data is 984 mb (29.06 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Fiona can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header
WTNT42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are occurring on portions of Puerto
Rico, and are expected in portions of the eastern Dominican Republic
tonight and Monday.  Hurricane conditions are possible within the
hurricane watch area in the Dominican Republic late tonight and 
Monday.
 
Tropical storm conditions will continue to spread over portions of 
the Dominican Republic within the warning areas through Monday. 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Turks and Caicos 
Islands and portions of the southeastern Bahamas by early Tuesday. 
Tropical storm conditions are possible across the watch area in the 
Dominican Republic tonight and Monday.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
Leeward Islands: Additional 2 inches or less.
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands: 4 to 6 inches, maximum of 10 inches
on St. Croix.
 
Puerto Rico: 12 to 18 inches with local maximum of 30 inches,
particularly across eastern and southern Puerto Rico.
 
Northern and Eastern Dominican Republic: 4 to 8 inches with local
maximum 12 inches, particularly along the northeast coast.
 
Rest of Dominican Republic and Haiti: 1 to 3 inches.
 
Turks and Caicos: 3 to 6 inches.
 
These rains will produce life-threatening and catastrophic flash and
urban flooding across Puerto Rico and the eastern Dominican
Republic, along with mudslides and landslides in areas of higher
terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas
in areas of onshore winds if the peak surge occurs at the time of
high tide...
 
Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico to Guayama, Puerto Rico...1 to 3 ft
Guayama, Puerto Rico to Fajardo, Puerto Rico including the islands
of Vieques and Culebra...1 to 2 ft
 
Localized coastal flooding is also possible elsewhere in Puerto
Rico.  For information specific to your area, please see products
issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 3 to 5 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Dominican Republic.
 
Localized coastal flooding will be possible along the coasts of the
Turks and Caicos in areas of onshore winds Monday night into
Tuesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Leeward Islands,
the northern Windward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the
northern coast of the Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos
Islands, and the southeastern Bahamas. These conditions could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Fiona Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
500 PM AST Sun Sep 18 2022
 
The eye of Fiona made landfall over extreme southwestern Puerto 
Rico around 1920 UTC, and the center of the hurricane is now moving 
into the Mona Passage between Puerto Rico and the Dominican 
Republic.  Earlier observations from Hurricane Hunter aircraft and 
WSR-88D radar velocity data indicate that the maximum winds were 
near 75 kt.  Since there has been little change in the organization 
of the system since the aircraft missions earlier today, the 
intensity is kept at that value for now.  A NOAA Saildrone went 
through the eye of Hurricane Fiona earlier today and the data from 
that vessel indicated a minimum central pressure of 986 mb.  
Another Air Force Hurricane Hunter mission into Fiona is scheduled 
for this evening.

The hurricane will be moving through a fairly moist air mass and 
over SSTs warmer than 29 deg C for the next few days.  It should be 
noted that the SHIPS output shows 15-20 kt of vertical wind shear 
over Fiona for the next several days.  However that same guidance 
model shows steady strengthening with the system becoming a major 
hurricane in about 48 hours.  Based on the bulk of the numerical 
guidance, the official intensity forecast is increased slightly from 
the previous NHC prediction, and is near or a little below the 
model consensus.
 
Center fixes indicate that Fiona's motion is between 
west-northwest and northwest, or about 305/8 kt.  There has been 
little change to the track model guidance, which is fairly tightly 
clustered albeit with some differences in forward speed.  The 
cyclone should move along the western periphery of a subtropical 
high pressure area for the next 3-4 days.  Later in the forecast 
period, Fiona is expected to accelerate northeastward and 
north-northeastward as it encounter the faster high-latitude flow.  
The official track forecast has not been changed significantly, 
and remains in close agreement with the TVCA dynamical model.
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Hurricane conditions are expected to begin in portions of the 
warning area in the Dominican Republic tonight and Monday.  Tropical 
storm conditions will reach the Dominican Republic this evening.
 
2. Heavy rains from Fiona will continue across Puerto Rico through
tonight and occur over the Dominican Republic later today into
Monday. These rainfall amounts will produce catastrophic 
life-threatening flash floods and urban flooding across Puerto Rico 
and portions of the eastern Dominican Republic, along with mudslides 
and landslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
3. Fiona is forecast to continue to strengthen after moving away
from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. Tropical storm
conditions are expected in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the
southeastern Bahamas by late Monday or early Tuesday.
