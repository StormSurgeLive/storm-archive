<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands continues to produce some <br/>
disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity. Despite marginal <br/>
environmental conditions, some slow development of this system is <br/>
possible over the next several days while it drifts northwestward or <br/>
northward over the central tropical Atlantic. <br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Fiona was located
near latitude 35.9 North, longitude 64.2 West. Fiona is moving
toward the northeast near 35 mph (56 km/h).  A slower 
north-northeast or north motion is expected later today through 
Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Fiona will approach 
Nova Scotia later today, move across Nova Scotia and into the Gulf 
of St. Lawrence on Saturday, and then across Labrador and over the
Labrador Sea on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Fiona is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Although gradual weakening is forecast, 
Fiona is expected to be a powerful hurricane-force cyclone when it 
moves across Atlantic Canada.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 345
miles (555 km).
 
The minimum central pressure based on data from an Air Force 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 936 mb (27.64 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Fiona can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda during the
next few hours.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in portions of the hurricane
warning area in Canada late tonight or early Saturday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the tropical
storm warning area in Canada later today.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the watch area in Labrador on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
Bermuda: Rainfall is diminishing.  No additional significant
rainfall expected.
 
Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and western Newfoundland: 3 to 6
inches (75 to 150 mm), with local maximum up to 10 inches (250 mm).
This rainfall could result in areas of flooding, some of which may
be significant in nature.
 
Newfoundland and eastern Quebec:  2 to 5 inches (50 to 125 mm).
 
Eastern New Brunswick: 1 to 3 inches (25 to 75 mm).
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge could produce coastal flooding
within the warning areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of onshore
winds. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Turks and
Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, the southeastern United States
coast, and Bermuda.  These swells will continue to spread
northwestward across the western Atlantic toward the mid-Atlantic
and northeast coasts of the United States and Atlantic Canada
today.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.

Hurricane Fiona Discussion Number  37
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
1100 AM AST Fri Sep 23 2022

Fiona is pulling away from Bermuda and racing toward Atlantic 
Canada.  Although the core of Fiona missed Bermuda, the Bermuda 
Weather Service reported that there were wind gusts up to 100 kt on 
the island early this morning.  The Air Force Hurricane Hunters have 
been investigating the major hurricane and have found that it 
remains powerful and very large.  The maximum flight-level wind at 
700 mb was 144 kt in the southeast quadrant and the peak SFMR wind 
was 109 kt.  Based on these data, the initial intensity is nudged up 
to 115 kt, which makes Fiona a very dangerous category 4 hurricane 
on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Satellite images show 
that Fiona still has a relatively well-defined eye and deep 
convection over the eastern portion of the circulation, but dry air 
and westerly vertical wind shear are beginning to affect the system.
 
Satellite and aircraft fixes indicate that Fiona is moving very
quickly to the northeast at about 30 kt.  The hurricane is expected
to turn slightly to the left and slow down as it interacts and
merges with a nearby mid- to upper-level trough.  The center of
Fiona is expected to make landfall in Atlantic Canada late tonight
or early Saturday, but wind, rain, and surge impacts will begin
well before that time given the large size of the hurricane.  The
models suggest that Fiona will slow down significantly, but
continue a generally northward motion through the weekend and into
early next week.  The NHC track forecast lies close to the middle of
the guidance envelope.
 
Although Fiona is expected to begin weakening soon given the
increasing shear and dry air entrainment, there is high confidence
that Fiona will be a powerful cyclone when it moves across Atlantic
Canada.  The system is forecast to complete extratropical
transition when it merges with the trough just before or around the
time it makes landfall.  The NHC intensity forecast lies near the
high end of the guidance in the short term, but falls in line with
the IVCN and HCCA models after that.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Fiona is expected to affect portions of Atlantic Canada as a
powerful hurricane-force cyclone tonight and Saturday, and
significant impacts from high winds, storm surge, and heavy rainfall
are expected. Hurricane and Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect
for much of Atlantic Canada.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions will likely continue for a few
more hours in Bermuda.
 
3. Large swells generated by Fiona are expected to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along much of the
east coast of the United States, the Bahamas, Bermuda, and Atlantic
Canada during the next couple of days.

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
900 AM GMT Fri Sep 23 2022
 
Gaston's cloud pattern has changed considerably in appearance 
since yesterday.  A tropical cyclone axisymmetric wind 
field that is typically concentrated about the surface center has 
transformed to a more asymmetric pattern with considerable 
expansion to the northeast due to the brisk mid-latitude 
westerlies and the sub-25C cool oceanic surface temperatures.  
Involvement between Gaston and a major shortwave trough/baroclinic 
zone noted in water vapor imagery and a recent AMSR2 microwave pass 
has resulted in a delta rain shield north of the exposed surface 
circulation.  A subsequent polar jet finger is visible in imagery 
northeast of the center, with possible warm seclusion development.  
All these attributes may well be leading to post-tropical cyclone 
transition.  The subjective satellite intensity estimates and a 
recent UW-CIMSS SATCON analysis yield an initial intensity of 50 kt 
for this advisory.  Gaston is forecast to slowly weaken while the 
cyclone completes its post-tropical transition in about 36 hours or 
so.  The official intensity forecast is similar to the previous one 
and is in line with the IVCN intensity consensus model.
 
Gaston has begun its anticyclonic loop and is moving 
east-southeastward, or 115/8 kt.  The cyclone is expected to turn 
toward the southeast today and southward along the southern 
periphery of mid-tropospheric ridge building to the north through 
Saturday morning while moving near the westernmost Azores.  
Afterward, Gaston should generally move toward the west-southwest 
and westward through the end of the period.  The official forecast 
is nudged slightly to the north of the previous one in the short 
term, but closer after that, and is based on the various consensus 
aids.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of the
western Azores, and will likely spread to the central Azores later
today.
 
2. Gaston is expected to produce heavy rainfall over the western 
and central Azores today through Saturday.  This rainfall may 
result in landslides and areas of flooding.

Tropical Depression Nine Discussion Number   1...Corrected
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
500 AM AST Fri Sep 23 2022

Corrected locations of convection in first paragraph. 
 
Convection this morning has increased primarily to the west of the 
area of low pressure we have been monitoring in the central 
Caribbean Sea, currently passing by to the north of Curacao island. 
The system already possessed a well-defined circulation for the last 
12 to 18 hours, but it was only overnight that the ongoing 
convective activity was able to persist long enough near the center 
to be considered a tropical cyclone. The most recent satellite 
intensity estimate from TAFB was up to T2.5/35-kt. However the 
GOES-16 derived motion winds from the meso sector over the system 
have only been 25-30 kt in the 925-850 mb layer on the northeastern 
periphery of the circulation. In addition, buoy 42059 located to the 
northeast of the center has been reporting winds up to only 27-kt. 
The combination of all these data provide enough justification to 
upgrade this system to Tropical Depression Nine, with the initial 
winds set at 30 kt for this advisory. An Air Force Reserve 
Reconnaissance mission will be investigating the system later this 
morning to provide more in-situ information of the system's 
structure and intensity.
 
The current motion right now is estimated to be off to the 
west-northwest at 290/12 kt. In the short-term, the depression is 
forecast to bend back more westward as a narrow east-to-west 
oriented mid-level ridge builds in behind the weakness left behind 
from Fiona. The current westward displaced convection may also tug 
the broad center in that direction as well. However, after 48 hours, 
this ridge will start to decay as a longwave deep-layer trough over 
the eastern United States begins to amplify southward. This synoptic 
evolution should then allow the cyclone to begin gaining latitude, 
though the exact timing at which this occurs could be somewhat 
related to the vertical depth of the cyclone and how it interacts 
with a weak upper-level trough expected to be over the far western 
Caribbean in the day 3-4 time-frame. The model guidance early on is 
in fairly good agreement, but larger across-track spread begins to 
take shape by 48 hours, with the GFS and its ensemble mean located 
further south and west, and with the ECMWF and its ensemble mean 
located further north and east. The initial track forecast has 
decided to split the difference between these two model suites, and 
lies fairly close to the consensus aids TVCN and HCCA. There is 
still a healthy amount of uncertainty in the track forecast at the 
day 4-5 timeframe. 
 
Currently the structure of the depression is quite disheveled, with
the low-level circulation mostly exposed, with deep convective
activity displaced to its west-southwest. This structure is due to
25-30 kt of northeasterly 200-850 mb vertical wind shear caused from
the equatorward outflow channel of Fiona, resulting in significant
upper-level flow over the system. However, as the depression moves
westward, it will move out form under this unfavorable flow and into
a lighter upper-level northeasterlies. However, it may take time for
the low-level center to become better aligned with the convective
activity, and thus only slow intensification is forecast over the
next 24-48 hours. After that period, most of the guidance shows
environmental conditions becoming much more favorable as shear drops
under 10 kt and the cyclone is over the warm 29-30 C waters of the
northwestern Caribbean. Thereafter, potential land interaction with
Cuba, and the potential for an increase in southerly shear at
day 5 may cap off the intensity at the end of the forecast. The
initial NHC forecast shows the depression intensifying up to a
category 2 hurricane by the time it nears the coast of Cuba.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical Depression Nine is expected to produce heavy rainfall 
and instances of flash flooding and possible mudslides in areas of 
higher terrain in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao. Heavy rains are also 
likely to spread into Jamaica and the Cayman Islands in the coming 
days. 
 
2. The depression is expected to approach Jamaica and the Cayman
islands as an intensifying tropical storm. Watches and warnings for
these locations may be required in subsequent forecast cycles.
 
3. This system is forecast to approach western Cuba and enter the
southeastern Gulf of Mexico by the end of the forecast period.
Interests in Cuba and those along the Eastern Gulf Coast of the
United States should closely monitor this system, though at this
juncture forecast uncertainty remains fairly high.

Tropical Depression Ten Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102022
200 PM CVT Fri Sep 23 2022

Satellite images indicate that the strong tropical wave that NHC has 
been tracking for several days over western Africa has developed a 
well-defined surface center over the far eastern Atlantic with 
organized bands of convection.  Dropsonde data from a DC-8 aircraft 
with the NASA field program Convective Processes EXperiment-Cabo 
Verde (CPEX-CV) has been quite useful in determining the central 
pressure and surface circulation definition of the low, with the 
central pressure of 1003 mb based on the dropsondes.  The initial 
wind speed is set to 30 kt, perhaps conservatively since the eastern 
side of the circulation has not been sampled by scatterometer or 
aircraft data.

The system is moving north-northwestward at about 10 kt.  A large 
break in the eastern Atlantic subtropical ridge should cause this 
system to move generally northward ahead of a mid-level trough 
before turning westward and accelerating as a shallow system beneath 
the low-level ridge.  The forecast is close to the model consensus, 
with heavier weight being placed on the global models than the 
regional hurricane track models. 

The depression has about a day over warm water in light to moderate 
shear before all the models blast the system with strong upper- 
level southwesterly winds.  Most of the guidance shows this system 
becoming a tropical storm before weakening significantly by late 
this weekend and dissipating early next week.  The official wind 
speed prediction is near the NOAA corrected-consensus guidance HCCA.

Note that 2 to 4 inches of rain is possible over the Canary Islands 
through this weekend due to a combination of the mid-level trough 
and moisture from this system, which is a bit unusual for that area.
