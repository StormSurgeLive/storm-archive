<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Fiona, located very near Guadeloupe in the Leeward Islands.<br/>
<br/>
Western Atlantic:<br/>
A frontal low over the western Atlantic Ocean a couple of hundred <br/>
miles northwest of Bermuda continues to produce disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms.  This low is expected to move eastward <br/>
to east-southeastward at 10 to 15 mph, and development into a <br/>
tropical cyclone is not anticipated due to strong upper-level winds.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Atlantic:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms remain disorganized in association with <br/>
the northern end of a tropical wave over the central Atlantic.  <br/>
Some slow development of this system is possible early next week <br/>
while it moves northwestward to northward.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fiona was
located near latitude 16.6 North, longitude 62.2 West. Fiona is
moving toward the west near 14 mph (22 km/h). A westward to
west-northwestward motion with a decrease in forward speed is
expected through Sunday night.  A turn toward the northwest is
forecast on Monday.  On the forecast track, the center of
Fiona is expected to move near or just south of the Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico Saturday into Sunday, and approach the southern or
eastern coast of the Dominican Republic Sunday afternoon.  Fiona is
forecast to move across the Dominican Republic Sunday night and
Monday.
 
Data from an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the 
maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Gradual strengthening is forecast, and Fiona could be 
near hurricane strength when it reaches the Dominican Republic on 
Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.  A wind gust of 44 mph (70 km/h) was recently 
reported at VC Bird International Airport in Antigua.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Fiona can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header
WTNT42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue across portions of 
the Leeward Islands within the warning area through Saturday 
afternoon.  Tropical storm conditions will spread westward to the 
U.S. and British Virgin Islands Saturday morning, and across Puerto 
Rico Saturday afternoon and Saturday night, and across portions of 
the Dominican Republic early Sunday.  Tropical storm conditions are 
possible on Dominica during the next several hours and across the 
watch area in the Dominican Republic beginning Sunday afternoon.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall
totals:
 
Leeward Islands and Northern Windward Islands: 3 to 6 inches.
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands: 4 to 6 inches.
 
Puerto Rico: 4 to 8 inches with maximum totals of 12 inches,
particularly across eastern and southern Puerto Rico.
 
Dominican Republic: 6 to 10 inches with maximum totals of 16 inches
possible.
 
Haiti: 1 to 3 inches with isolated maximum totals of 5 inches.
 
Turks and Caicos: 4 to 8 inches.
 
These rains may produce flash and urban flooding, along with
mudslides in areas of higher terrain, particularly southern and
eastern Puerto Rico and the eastern Dominican Republic.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas
in areas of onshore winds if the peak surge occurs at the time of
high tide...
 
Southern coast of Puerto Rico...1 to 2 ft
 
Localized coastal flooding is also possible elsewhere in Puerto
Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet
above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds in the Dominican Republic.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Leeward Islands,
the northern Windward Islands, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.
Swells will reach the northern coast of Hispaniola, the Turks and
Caicos Islands, and the southeastern Bahamas over the weekend.
These conditions could cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Fiona Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
1100 PM AST Fri Sep 16 2022
 
The center of Fiona moved across the island of Guadeloupe a few
hours ago and it is now over the far northeastern Caribbean Sea.
Deep convection has been increasing near the center, and reports
from the Air Force Hurricane Hunters indicate that Fiona is a
little stronger.  The maximum SFMR winds recorded on the flight so
far were 50 kt and peak flight-level winds measured were 61 kt.
This supports nudging the initial intensity back up to 50 kt.  The
minimum pressure of 1002 mb is based on a surface observation from
Guadeloupe. Tropical-storm-force winds and heavy rains are expected
to continue across the Leeward Islands through Saturday afternoon.
 
Fiona continues to move just north of due west, or 280 degrees, at
13 kt on the south side of a deep-layer ridge.  A west to
west-northwest motion is expected during the next day or so, and
that should take Fiona near the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico
during that time.  The cyclone is expected to slow down and make a
turn to the northwest when it is near or over the Dominican Republic
on Monday as it moves toward a weakness in the ridge.  A northward
motion near the southeastern Bahamas is expected during the early
and middle portions of next week.  The models generally show a
similar theme, but there are notable differences in where, when, and
how sharply Fiona makes the northwestward and northward turns.  The
NHC track forecast is essentially the same as the previous one
through 60 h, but a touch to the east of the previous track from
days 3 to 5.  This forecast lies close to the various consensus
aids.
 
Fiona is still feeling some effects of westerly vertical wind shear
and dry air entrainment, but the models suggest that the storm could
be moving into a region of higher moisture and slightly less shear.
These conditions should support slow strengthening and Fiona could
be near hurricane strength when it approaches the Dominican
Republic.  Some weakening is expected due to the interaction with
the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola, but re-strengthening is
forecast when it moves north of that island.  Fiona is expected to
reorganize over the southwestern Atlantic and become a hurricane in
about 4 days with additional strengthening after that.  The NHC 
intensity forecast is a little higher than the previous one at days 
4 and 5, but still below the IVCN and HCCA models.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions will continue to affect portions of the 
Leeward Islands through Saturday morning.  Tropical storm conditions 
will spread westward across the U.S. and British Virgin Islands on 
Saturday and Puerto Rico late Saturday and Saturday night.  Tropical 
storm conditions are possible over Dominica overnight. 
 
2. Heavy rains from Fiona are beginning in the Leeward Islands, and 
will spread to the British and U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto
Rico Saturday, reaching the Dominican Republic Sunday, and Haiti
and the Turks and Caicos Monday through Tuesday.  This rainfall
may produce considerable flood impacts including flash and urban
flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
3. Fiona is expected to strengthen gradually over the northeastern
Caribbean Sea, and it could be near hurricane strength as it
approaches the southern or eastern coast of the Dominican Republic
Sunday afternoon.  A Tropical Storm Warning has been issued for 
portions of the island and additional watches or warnings could be 
required on Saturday.
 
4. Fiona is forecast to strengthen after moving across Hispaniola
early next week, and interests in the Turks and Caicos Islands and
southeastern Bahamas should continue to monitor forecasts for the
storm.
