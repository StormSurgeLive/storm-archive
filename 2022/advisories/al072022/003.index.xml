* St. Maarten
* Antigua, Barbuda, St. Kitts, Nevis, Montserrat, and Anguilla
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin 
Islands, Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola should monitor the progress of 
this system, as additional tropical storm watches or warnings will 
be required for portions of those areas on Thursday.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products 
issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fiona was
located near latitude 16.7 North, longitude 52.0 West. Fiona is
moving toward the west-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h) and
this general motion is expected to continue during the next few
days.  On the forecast track, the center of the storm is forecast 
to move through the Leeward Islands late Friday and Friday night, 
and be near the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico this weekend.
 
Satellite-derived wind data indicate that maximum sustained winds 
have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. Some slow 
strengthening is possible during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible across portions of the
northern Leeward Islands by Friday night, where a Tropical Storm
Watch has been issued.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations 
of 3 to 5 inches with maximum totals of 8 inches across the northern 
Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico 
and eastern Hispaniola.   These rains may produce isolated flash and 
urban flooding, along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher 
terrain. 
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are expected to begin affecting the 
northern Leeward Islands on Friday. These swells could cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Tropical Storm Fiona Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 14 2022
 
Although the system still appears ragged-looking in satellite 
images, a very recent ASCAT-B pass indicated that the tropical 
cyclone has strengthened.  Maximum winds in the pass were around 45 
kt and therefore, the initial intensity has been increased to that 
value. It should be noted that Fiona is an asymmetric storm with all 
of its thunderstorms and strong winds currently located on the 
system's east side.  The lopsided structure is due to moderate 
west-southwesterly vertical wind shear.
 
Fiona continues to move westward at 12 kt. The steering pattern 
seems relatively straightforward.  A low- to mid-level subtropical 
ridge situated over the central Atlantic should steer the system 
westward to west-northwestward during the next several days, taking 
the cyclone across the northern Leeward Islands by Friday night, 
near the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Saturday, and near 
Hispaniola on Sunday and Monday.  There will likely be a turn to the 
northwest by the end of the period when the system reaches the 
western periphery of the ridge.  The models all show a similar 
theme, but there are notable speed differences with the ECMWF model 
faster than the remainder of the guidance.  The NHC track forecast 
is quite similar to the previous one and near a consensus of the GFS 
and ECMWF models.
 
Given the current tilted and asymmetric structure, continued 
influences of shear, and some dry air, any strengthening of the 
storm will likely be slow to occur during the next day or so. 
However, some of the models show Fiona moving into a less hostile 
environment in a couple of days, and it could have an opportunity to 
become a little stronger this weekend if it avoids the landmasses of 
Puerto Rico and Hispaniola.  Given the uncertainty of the system's 
future environment and potential land interaction, little change in 
strength is shown through most of the period. However, it should be 
noted that the intensity forecast is of low confidence given those 
complexities.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are possible in portions of the 
northern Leeward Islands by Friday night, where a Tropical Storm 
Watch has been issued.
 
2. Heavy rains will begin to affect the northern Leeward Islands 
late Friday, spreading into the British and U.S. Virgin Islands and 
Puerto Rico over the weekend. This rainfall may produce isolated 
flash and urban flooding, along with isolated mudslides in areas of 
higher terrain.
 
3. Fiona is expected to move near the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, 
and Hispaniola this weekend and early next week, and Tropical Storm 
Watches will likely be issued for some of those areas on Thursday.
