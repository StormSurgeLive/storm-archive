The Hurricane Watch for the U.S. Virgin Islands is discontinued.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Puerto Rico, including Vieques and Culebra
* The coast of the Dominican Republic from Cabo Caucedo to Cabo
Frances Viejo

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Fiona was located
near latitude 17.3 North, longitude 66.5 West. Fiona is moving
toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A northwestward
motion is expected to begin later today and continue through
Monday, followed by a turn toward the north-northwest on Tuesday.
On the forecast track, the center of Fiona will approach Puerto Rico
this morning, and move near or over Puerto Rico this afternoon or
evening.  Fiona will then move near the northern coast of the
Dominican Republic tonight and Monday, and near or to the east of
the Turks and Caicos Islands on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 80 mph (130 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast during
the next 48 hours while Fiona moves near Puerto Rico, the Dominican
Republic and over the southwestern Atlantic.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km) 
and hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) 
from the center.  A weather station at Las Mareas, Puerto Rico, 
recently reported sustained winds of 62 mph (100 km/h) with a gust 
to 75 mph (120 km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft observations is 987 mb (29.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Fiona can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header
WTNT42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected on Puerto Rico today, and
are expected in portions of the eastern Dominican Republic tonight
and Monday.  Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane
watch area in the Dominican Republic tonight and Monday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are occurring in the U.S. and British
Virgin Islands and are spreading westward across Puerto Rico. These
conditions are expected to reach portions of the Dominican Republic
later today.  Tropical storm conditions are possible across the
watch area in the Dominican Republic tonight, and in the Turks and
Caicos Islands and southeastern Bahamas by early Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
Leeward Islands: Additional 2 inches or less.
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands: 4 to 6 inches, maximum of 10 inches
on St. Croix.
 
Puerto Rico: 12 to 16 inches with local maximum of 25 inches,
particularly across eastern and southern Puerto Rico.
 
Northern and Eastern Dominican Republic: 4 to 8 inches with local
maximum 12 inches, particularly along the northeast coast.
 
Rest of Dominican Republic and Haiti: 1 to 3 inches.
 
Turks and Caicos: 3 to 6 inches.
 
These rains will produce life-threatening flash flooding and urban
flooding across Puerto Rico and the eastern Dominican Republic,
along with mudslides and landslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas
in areas of onshore winds if the peak surge occurs at the time of
high tide...
 
Southern coast of Puerto Rico...1 to 3 ft
Vieques and Culebra...1 to 3 ft
 
Localized coastal flooding is also possible elsewhere in Puerto
Rico.  For information specific to your area, please see products
issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Dominican Republic.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Leeward Islands,
the northern Windward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the
northern coast of the Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos
Islands, and the southeastern Bahamas. These conditions could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Fiona Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
1100 AM AST Sun Sep 18 2022
 
Observations from Air Force and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft
and Doppler velocities from the San Juan WSR-88D radar indicate
that Fiona is strengthening, and is now a hurricane.  The aircraft
and radar data support a current intensity of 70 kt.  Satellite
imagery shows an expanding upper-level outflow pattern over the
system.
 
Fiona should be moving in an environment of moderate vertical
shear, over warm SSTs, and within a fairly moist air mass for the
next few days.  The only obvious impediments to strengthening
should be the interaction with the land masses of Puerto Rico and
Hispaniola during the next day or so.  The official forecast is
above the previous one, but still a little below the model
consensus.  It appears likely that Fiona will become the first
major hurricane of this Atlantic season in a few days.
 
Although the movement has still been a little irregular based on
recent aircraft center fixes, a smoothed initial motion is still
west-northwestward, or 285/7 kt.  There has been little change to
the track forecast reasoning.  Over the next few days, the
hurricane should move along the western periphery of a
mid-tropospheric anticyclone.  Thereafter, Fiona is likely to turn
north-northeastward and accelerate later in the forecast period as
it comes under the influence of higher-latitude westerlies.  The
official forecast is just a little bit to the left of, and
slightly slower than, the previous NHC track during the first 12 to
24 hours and very close to it thereafter.  This is very
similar to the latest dynamical model consensus aid, TVCA.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Hurricane conditions are expected across portions of Puerto Rico
today and in portions of the Dominican Republic tonight and Monday. 
Tropical storm conditions are occurring across the U.S. and British 
Virgin Islands and will reach the Dominican Republic later today 
and tonight.
 
2. Heavy rains from Fiona will continue across Puerto Rico through
tonight and occur over the Dominican Republic later today into
Monday. These rainfall amounts will produce life-threatening flash
floods and urban flooding across Puerto Rico and portions of the
eastern Dominican Republic, along with mudslides and landslides in
areas of higher terrain.
 
3. Fiona is forecast to continue to strengthen after moving away
from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the
southeastern Bahamas by late Monday or early Tuesday.
