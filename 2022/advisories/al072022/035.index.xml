Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Thu Sep 22 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Fiona, located a few hundred miles west-southwest of Bermuda, <br/>
and on Tropical Storm Gaston, located a couple of hundred miles <br/>
northwest of the central Azores. <br/>
<br/>
Southeastern Caribbean Sea:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms remain disorganized in association with a <br/>
low pressure system located over the southeastern Caribbean Sea <br/>
about 150 miles east-northeast of Curacao.  The upper-level wind <br/>
environment over the low is expected to become more conducive for <br/>
development, and a tropical depression is expected to form during <br/>
the next day or two while moving west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph <br/>
across the central Caribbean Sea.  Locally heavy rainfall and gusty <br/>
winds are likely to affect northwestern Venezuela, the ABC island <br/>
chain, and northeastern Colombia through Friday.  Interests in <br/>
Jamaica and the Cayman Islands should closely monitor the progress <br/>
of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure, associated with a tropical wave and <br/>
located about 100 miles west of Dakar, Senegal, is producing a <br/>
disorganized area of showers and thunderstorms off the coasts of <br/>
Senegal and Mauritania.  Although the system is pulling in nearby <br/>
dry air, environmental conditions are forecast to otherwise be <br/>
conducive for some development, and a tropical depression could form <br/>
by this weekend while the system moves northward at about 10 mph, <br/>
parallel to the coast of west Africa. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity has decreased since earlier today <br/>
in association with a broad area of low pressure located several <br/>
hundred miles west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands.  Despite <br/>
marginal environmental conditions, some slow development of this <br/>
system is possible over the next several days while it drifts <br/>
northwestward or northward over the central tropical Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Fiona was located
near latitude 31.9 North, longitude 68.1 West.  Fiona is moving
toward the north-northeast near 21 mph (33 km/h).  A north-northeast
or northeastward motion with an increase in forward speed is
expected through Friday.  Some reduction in forward speed with a
turn toward the north is forecast Friday night through Sunday.  On
the forecast track, the center of Fiona will pass just to the west
of Bermuda overnight.  Fiona's center will then approach Nova
Scotia on Friday, move across Nova Scotia and into the Gulf of
St. Lawrence on Saturday, and then across Labrador over the
Labrador Sea on Sunday.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate
that Maximum sustained winds remain near 130 mph (215 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Fiona is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some slight weakening is forecast to begin
tonight or on Friday, however Fiona is forecast to be a large and
powerful post-tropical cyclone with hurricane-force winds when it
approaches and moves over Nova Scotia Friday night and Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275
miles (445 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 932 mb (27.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Fiona can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions have begun on Bermuda, with
hurricane conditions expected overnight.  Tropical storm conditions
should diminish during the day on Friday.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in portions of the hurricane
warning area in Canada by late Friday night or early Saturday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the tropical
storm warning area in Canada by late Friday.  Tropical storm 
conditions are possible in the watch area in Labrador on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
Bermuda: 2 to 4 inches (50 to 100 mm).
 
Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and western Newfoundland: 3 to 6
inches (75 to 150 mm), with local maximum up to 10 inches (250 mm).
This rainfall could result in areas of flooding, some of which may
be significant in nature.
 
Eastern Newfoundland: 1 to 3 inches (25 to 75 mm).
 
Eastern Quebec: 2 to 5 inches (50 to 125 mm).
 
Eastern New Brunswick: 1 to 3 inches (25 to 75 mm).
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will cause elevated water levels along
the coast of Bermuda in areas of onshore winds beginning tonight.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
A dangerous storm surge could produce coastal flooding within the
warning areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of onshore winds. Near 
the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive 
waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Turks and
Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, the southeastern United States
coast, and Bermuda.  These swells will continue to spread
northwestward across the western Atlantic toward the mid-Atlantic
and northeast coasts of the United States and Atlantic Canada
tonight and on Friday.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Fiona Discussion Number  35
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
1100 PM AST Thu Sep 22 2022
 
Fiona's satellite appearance looks a little more asymmetric this
evening, with deep convection and upper-level outflow becoming more 
restricted on the western side.  That said, the hurricane has not 
yet lost any intensity.  An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter 
mission measured a peak 700-mb flight-level wind of 123 kt and SFMR 
winds as high as 110 kt, which support maintaining a 115-kt 
intensity on this advisory.  In addition, dropsonde data indicate 
that the central pressure has fallen further to 932 mb, and the 
SFMR instrument measured hurricane-force winds now extending 100 n 
mi to the southeast of the center.
 
The hurricane is still accelerating toward the north-northeast with
an initial motion estimate of 030/18 kt.  Fiona is getting closer
to a deep-layer trough currently located over the northeastern
United States, and this feature is expected to cause the hurricane
to speed up further during the next day or so, reaching peak speeds
of 30-35 kt by 24 hours as it approaches Nova Scotia.  Fiona should
merge with the trough soon after 24 hours, slow down a bit, but
continue moving northward across Atlantic Canada to the Labrador
Sea.  The previous official forecast appears on track based on the
latest guidance, and no significant changes were made to the new
forecast.
 
Fiona is forecast to remain over warm waters, including within the
Gulf Stream current, during the next 24 hours, although deep-layer
shear is forecast to increase substantially in 12-24 hours.  Given
the hurricane's current appearance, some gradual weakening is
anticipated during the next day or so.  Extratropical transition 
should begin on Friday, and that process is expected to be quick,
with Fiona becoming a warm-seclusion-type extratropical low Friday
night before the center reaches Nova Scotia.  Although continued
weakening is forecast thereafter, Fiona is expected to maintain
hurricane-force winds through 48 hours while it moves across the
Gulf of St. Lawrence.  Winds could drop below gale force by day 5
when the post-tropical low is over the Labrador Sea.  After 24
hours, the NHC intensity forecast is a blend of the GFS and ECMWF
global model solutions.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane conditions are expected on Bermuda overnight.
Conditions should diminish below tropical storm force during the
day on Friday.
 
2. Fiona is expected to affect portions of Atlantic Canada as a
powerful hurricane-force cyclone late Friday and Saturday, and
significant impacts from high winds, storm surge, and heavy rainfall
are likely. Hurricane and Tropical Storm Warnings have now been 
issued for much of Atlantic Canada.
 
3. Large swells generated by Fiona are expected to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along much of the
east coast of the United States, the Bahamas, Bermuda, and Atlantic
Canada during the next few days.

<title>Tropical Storm Gaston Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
300 AM GMT Fri Sep 23 2022
 
Gaston's cloud pattern is showing signs of disruption by westerly 
shear with the center located near the western edge of the main 
area of convection.  This was confirmed by a recent scatterometer 
overpass, which showed that the intensity was, somewhat 
surprisingly, still near 55 kt.  This intensity is also in 
agreement with a Dvorak classification from TAFB, and so the 
advisory's initial wind speed is held at that value.

The storm has continued to slow its forward speed, with the latest 
initial motion estimated to be eastward at around 10 kt.  
During the next day or so, Gaston is expected to move on a 
clockwise loop along the southern side of a blocking mid-level 
ridge.  The official track forecast follows the multi-model 
consensus prediction.  This is fairly close to the previous NHC 
forecast, except shifted a little northward in the latter part of 
the period.

Gaston is expected to remain in an environment of dry air, over 
relatively cool SSTs, and under the influence of strong westerly 
shear for the next couple of days.  These factors should lead to 
gradual weakening and loss of tropical characteristics in 48 hours 
or so.  The official intensity forecast is similar to the previous 
one and is close to the latest Decay-SHIPS prediction.


Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of the 
western Azores, and will likely spread to the central Azores later 
today.
 
2. Gaston is expected to produce heavy rainfall over the western and 
central Azores today into Saturday. This rainfall may result in 
landslides and areas of flooding.
