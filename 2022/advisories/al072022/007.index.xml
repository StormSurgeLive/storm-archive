DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fiona was
located near latitude 16.0 North, longitude 56.9 West. Fiona is
moving toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h).  A westward motion
with some decrease in forward speed is expected through Saturday
night, with a turn toward the west-northwest possible on Sunday.  On
the forecast track, the center of Fiona is expected to move across
the Leeward Islands Friday night and early Saturday, and move near
the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico late Saturday into Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Slight strengthening is possible during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected across portions of
the northern Leeward Islands within the warning area beginning
Friday evening.  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the
watch area across the Virgin Islands on Saturday and in Puerto Rico
late Saturday or Saturday night.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is expected to produce the following rainfall
totals:
 
Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto
Rico:  4 to 6 inches with isolated maximum totals of 10
inches across eastern Puerto Rico.
 
Eastern Hispaniola: 4 to 8 inches with isolated maximum totals of
12 inches.
 
These rains may produce flash and urban flooding, along with
isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain. Considerable flood
impacts are possible across eastern portions of Puerto Rico.
 
STORM SURGE:  Localized coastal flooding will be possible along the
coasts of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico in areas of
onshore winds Saturday into Sunday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Leeward Islands,
and are expected to spread westward to the Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico on Friday and Saturday. These conditions could
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Fiona Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
1100 PM AST Thu Sep 15 2022
 
Although Fiona remains a strongly sheared tropical storm, deep
convection has been inching closer to the center of circulation
during the past several hours.  Cloud tops remain quite cold on the
system's east side.  The initial intensity is held at 50 kt based on
the earlier aircraft data.  Another Air Force reconnaissance
aircraft is scheduled to investigate Fiona overnight.
 
Satellite and aircraft fixes indicate that Fiona has been slowly
losing latitude over the past 24 hours or so, and the initial motion
is estimated to be 265/13 kt.  A low- to mid-level subtropical ridge
to the north of Fiona should steer the system generally westward for
the next few days, taking the storm across the northern Leeward
Islands Friday night and near the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on
Saturday through early Sunday.  A turn to the west-northwest and
then the northwest near Hispaniola seems likely late this weekend
and into early next week as the system nears a weakness in the
subtropical ridge. The NHC track forecast has been adjusted
to the left this cycle, based on the initial position and trending
toward the latest model guidance.
 
Fiona has been quite resilient even though it continues to be
affected by westerly vertical wind shear and intrusions of dry air.
The models suggest that the upper-level wind pattern could become a
little more conducive for strengthening during the next couple of
days, which might allow the storm to become more symmetric and
strengthen slightly.  However, after that time, the intensity of
Fiona will become highly dependent on how much the storm interacts
with Puerto Rico and Hispaniola.  Since there is uncertainty on the
details of the exact track, the NHC intensity forecast during the
days 2-5 time frame is uncertain.  This prediction lies near the
middle of the guidance envelope at most forecast times.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Leeward Islands
within the warning area by Friday evening.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible within the watch area across the Virgin
Islands beginning on Saturday, and then reaching Puerto Rico late
Saturday and Saturday night.
 
2. Heavy rains from Fiona will reach the Leeward Islands Friday 
afternoon, spreading to the British and U.S. Virgin Islands and 
Puerto Rico Saturday into Sunday morning, and reaching eastern 
Hispaniola Sunday.  This rainfall may produce considerable flood 
impacts including flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in 
areas of higher terrain. 
 
3. Fiona is expected to move near Hispaniola early next week, and
watches could be required for parts of the island on Friday.
