Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Thu Sep 22 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Fiona, located several hundred miles southwest of Bermuda, and on <br/>
Tropical Storm Gaston, located several hundred miles west of the <br/>
Azores. <br/>
<br/>
Southeastern Caribbean Sea:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue in association with a tropical <br/>
wave located over the far southeastern Caribbean Sea.  Although <br/>
upper-level winds are currently inhibiting development, the <br/>
upper-level wind pattern ahead of the system is forecast to become a <br/>
little more favorable in a couple of days, and a tropical depression <br/>
is likely to form at that time.  The disturbance is forecast to move <br/>
west-northwestward across the eastern Caribbean Sea during the next <br/>
day or two, and be over the central Caribbean Sea this weekend.  <br/>
Regardless of development, locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds <br/>
are likely to affect the Windward Islands this morning. These <br/>
impacts are likely to spread to northern Venezuela, northeastern <br/>
Colombia, and the ABC island chain during the next couple of days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms located near the west coast of Africa are <br/>
associated with a tropical wave that is expected to move over the <br/>
warm waters of the far eastern Atlantic later today.  Thereafter, <br/>
environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive for some <br/>
development, and a tropical depression could form by this weekend <br/>
while the system moves slowly northward, between west Africa and the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
East Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands continues to produce <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Despite marginal <br/>
environmental conditions, some slow development of this system is <br/>
possible over the next several days while it moves slowly <br/>
northwestward or northward over the tropical Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within
24 to 36 hours.
 
Interests in Atlantic Canada should monitor the progress of this
system.  Watches may be required for portions of Atlantic Canada
later this morning.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Fiona was located
near latitude 26.8 North, longitude 71.1 West.  Fiona is moving
toward the north near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A north-northeastward or
northeastward motion with an increase in forward speed is expected
later today through Friday, followed by a somewhat slower northward 
motion beginning Friday night or Saturday.  On the forecast track, 
the center of Fiona will pass just to the west of Bermuda tonight, 
approach Nova Scotia on Friday, and move across Nova Scotia
and into the Gulf of St. Lawrence on Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Fiona is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in strength is expected through 
early Friday.  Some weakening is expected to begin later on Friday, 
but Fiona is forecast to still be producing hurricane-force winds 
Friday night and Saturday after it has become post-tropical.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km).  NOAA buoy 41047, about 45 miles north-northwest of
the center of Fiona, recently reported a sustained wind of 62 mph
(100 km/h) and a gust to 76 mph (122 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 934 mb (27.58 inches). 
NOAA buoy 41047 recently reported a pressure of 984.5 mb      
(29.07 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Fiona can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header
WTNT42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected, and hurricane
conditions are possible, on Bermuda beginning this evening and
continuing through Friday morning.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
Bermuda: 2 to 4 inches.
 
Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and western Newfoundland: 3 to 6
inches, with local maximum up to 10 inches. This rainfall could
result in areas of flooding, some of which may be significant in
nature.
 
Eastern Quebec: 2 to 5 inches.
 
New Brunswick: 1 to 3 inches.
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will cause elevated water levels along 
the coast of Bermuda in areas of onshore winds beginning tonight.  
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and 
destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the northern coast
of Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the Bahamas.
These swells will continue to spread westward across the
southwestern Atlantic toward the east coast of the United States
and Atlantic Canada during the next day or two.  Swells from Fiona
are expected to reach Bermuda this morning.  The swells could
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Hurricane Fiona Forecast Discussion Number 31</title>

Hurricane Fiona Discussion Number  31
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
1100 PM EDT Wed Sep 21 2022

Just after the last advisory, a white ring in the Dvorak curve 
completely surrounded the eye, with cloud-top temperatures as cold 
as about -80 degrees Celsius.  These temperatures have warmed a bit 
since then, and the eye is not as warm as it was.  A NOAA Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft flew two passes through the eye and measured a peak 
700-mb flight-level of 119 kt and SFMR winds of 100-105 kt, but 
also found that Fiona's central pressure has fallen to 934 mb.  
Given the pressure drop, and the fact that satellite intensity 
estimates are not much lower than before, the initial intensity 
remains 115 kt (but this could be a little generous).  The plane 
also found that the 50- and 64-kt wind radii have increased in size.

Fiona is still moving just east of due north, or 010/9 kt.  The 
hurricane is expected to accelerate toward the north-northeast 
during the next 24 hours while located along the western periphery 
of the Azores-Bermuda high.  After that time, an even faster motion 
toward the northeast and north-northeast is forecast as a 
progressive deep-layer trough moves off the northeastern U.S. coast 
Thursday night and Friday, propelling Fiona toward Atlantic Canada 
at speeds of 25-30 kt.  A slower northward motion is expected by 72 
hours, with Fiona continuing across the Gulf of St. Lawrence and 
Labrador, and then over the Labrador Sea by days 4 and 5.  The 
track guidance is very tightly clustered, and the new NHC track 
forecast is mainly an update of the previous prediction.

Little change, or perhaps some fluctuations, in intensity are 
expected during the next 24 hours while Fiona remains over warm 
waters of 29-30 degrees Celsius and in a generally low-shear 
environment.  Shear increases substantially in 36-48 hours, which 
should cause some gradual weakening, and extratropical transition 
due to the aforementioned trough is expected to be complete just 
after 48 hours as the center of Fiona is approaching Nova Scotia.  
The extratropical low is forecast to continue producing 
hurricane-force winds as it crosses Nova Scotia and moves into the 
Gulf of St. Lawrence through day 3, and it is expected to continue 
producing gale-force winds as it moves across Newfoundland and 
Labrador.  The NHC intensity forecast is close to the IVCN and HCCA 
consensus aids during Fiona's tropical phase through 48 hours.  
After that time, the official forecast more closely follows the GFS 
and ECMWF global models solutions.
 
Based on the NOAA Hurricane Hunter data, the wind radii have been
expanded at the initial time and within the forecast.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane conditions are possible, and tropical storm conditions
are expected, on Bermuda beginning Thursday evening and continuing 
through Friday morning.
 
2. Fiona is expected to affect portions of Atlantic Canada as a
powerful hurricane-force cyclone late Friday and Saturday, and 
significant impacts from high winds, storm surge, and heavy
rainfall are becoming increasingly likely.  Interests in these 
areas should closely monitor the progress of Fiona and updates to 
the forecast.

3. Large swells generated by Fiona are expected to cause dangerous 
and possibly life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along 
the east coast of the United States, the Bahamas, Bermuda, and 
Atlantic Canada during the next few days.  Please consult products 
from your local weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Gaston Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
300 AM GMT Thu Sep 22 2022
 
Convective bursts continue near the center of Gaston with some 
banding evident over the western portions of the circulation. Dvorak 
CI-numbers from SAB and TAFB still support an initial intensity of 
55 kt.  Unfortunately, ASCAT missed the system earlier, and there 
has been no recent scatterometer data to provide a better assessment 
of the system's strength and wind field. 

Gaston as turned east-northeastward and is not moving at 065/15 kt. 
The overall track forecast reasoning remains unchanged but there 
has been a shift in the models toward a faster and more southerly 
track, primarily after 48 hours. The cyclone should continue 
east-northeastward to eastward during the next day or so.  After 
that time, an amplifying ridge is expected to cause Gaston to slow 
down and turn southward.  After 48 hours, the track guidance now 
shows a faster southwestward or westward motion as the ridge builds 
and shifts northeastward.  The updated NHC track has been adjusted 
accordingly, but it is still north of the latest consensus aids.  
Therefore, additional modifications to the official forecast is 
possible in future advisories. 

Little change in strength is predicted in the short term, but 
gradual weakening is expected after that time as Gaston moves over 
cooler waters and into a drier air mass. Gaston is likely to become 
a post-tropical cyclone in 60-72 hours due to these more 
unfavorable conditions.  
 
Gaston could produce tropical-storm-force winds in portions of the 
western Azores beginning tonight.  Interests there should continue 
to monitor the forecasts for this system.  For additional 
information, see warnings and products issued by the meteorological 
service in the Azores.
