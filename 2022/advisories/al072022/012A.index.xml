DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fiona was
located by an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft near 
latitude 16.1 North, longitude 63.4 West.  Fiona is moving toward 
the west near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A westward to west-northwestward 
motion with a decrease in forward speed is expected through Sunday 
night.  A turn toward the northwest is forecast early next week. On 
the forecast track, the center of Fiona is expected to move near or 
just south of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico today through 
Sunday, and approach the southern or eastern coast of the Dominican 
Republic Sunday night and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some strengthening is forecast, and Fiona could be at or near 
hurricane strength when it moves near Puerto Rico and the Dominican 
Republic over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
Data from the Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that the minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Fiona can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header
WTNT42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible on Puerto Rico late 
tonight or on Sunday, and within the hurricane watch area in the 
Dominican Republic late Sunday through Monday. 

Tropical storm conditions will continue across portions of the 
Leeward Islands within the warning area through this morning. 
Tropical storm conditions will reach the U.S. and British Virgin 
Islands later this morning, spread westward across Puerto Rico this 
afternoon and tonight, and reach portions of the Dominican Republic 
on Sunday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible across the watch 
area in the Dominican Republic beginning Sunday afternoon.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
Leeward Islands and Northern Windward Islands: Additional 2 to 4
inches.
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands: 4 to 6 inches with local 10 inches
possible.
 
Puerto Rico: 5 to 10 inches with local 16 inches possible,
particularly across eastern and southern Puerto Rico.
 
Dominican Republic: 4 to 8 inches with 12 inches possible,
particularly on the far eastern coast.
 
Haiti: 1 to 3 inches with isolated maximum totals of 4 inches.
 
Turks and Caicos: 4 to 10 inches.
 
These rains are likely to produce flash and urban flooding, along
with mudslides in areas of higher terrain, particularly in southern
and eastern Puerto Rico and the eastern Dominican Republic.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas
in areas of onshore winds if the peak surge occurs at the time of
high tide...
 
Southern coast of Puerto Rico...1 to 3 ft
 
Localized coastal flooding is also possible elsewhere in Puerto Rico
and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  For information specific to your area,
please see products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office.
 
Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Dominican Republic.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Leeward Islands,
the northern Windward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.
Swells will spread westward to the northern coast of Hispaniola, the
Turks and Caicos Islands, and the southeastern Bahamas over the
weekend. These conditions could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.

Tropical Storm Fiona Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
500 AM AST Sat Sep 17 2022
 
While the center of Fiona is moving westward over the northeastern
Caribbean Sea, the strongest winds and heaviest rains associated
with the storm are still displaced to the east of the center by some
westerly shear. Tropical storm conditions are ongoing over portions
of the Leeward Islands. Earlier data from an Air Force Hurricane
Hunter aircraft indicated the minimum pressure had fallen slightly
to 1000 mb, but the aircraft winds on the final passes did not show
signs of additional strengthening. A blend of the latest satellite
intensity estimates and the earlier aircraft data support an initial
intensity of 50 kt for this advisory. NOAA and Air Force Hurricane
Hunter aircraft are scheduled to investigate Fiona this morning.
 
The center of Fiona was adjusted a bit south of the previous track 
based on aircraft and radar data, and the initial motion is westward 
at 275/11 kt. A westward to west-northwestward motion is expected 
through Sunday, which brings the center of Fiona near or just south 
of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico and toward the eastern portion 
of the Dominican Republic. Although some of the track guidance 
shifted a bit right this cycle, the adjusted initial position 
resulted in little net change to the NHC track forecast with regard 
to Fiona's closest approach to Puerto Rico. However, it is noted 
that the latest track forecast is somewhat slower than the previous 
one based on the latest guidance trends. After passing near or over 
the Dominican Republic, a northwestward and northward turn is 
expected next week over the southwestern Atlantic. The forecast 
track at days 3-5 was nudged a bit eastward based on the consensus 
aids.
 
Fiona is expected to encounter slightly more favorable environmental
conditions over the next 24-48 h. In particular, the westerly shear
that has plagued Fiona for days is forecast to weaken, which could
allow the cyclone's structure to improve and become more vertically
aligned. The latest intensity guidance is stronger than the previous
cycle, and the NHC forecast has been adjusted upward during the
first 36 h of the period. Fiona could be at or near hurricane force
when it passes near Puerto Rico later this weekend, and a Hurricane
Watch has been issued to account for this potential. If current
trends continue, further increases to the intensity forecast may be
necessary on future cycles. Some brief weakening is possible due to
interaction with the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola, but
re-strengthening seems likely once Fiona moves over the southwestern
Atlantic next week. The NHC intensity forecast has been raised on 
days 3-5 in line with the latest consensus aids.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions will continue to affect portions of the
Leeward Islands through this morning. Tropical storm conditions
will reach the U.S. and British Virgin Islands this morning and 
spread westward across Puerto Rico later today and tonight. Fiona 
could be near hurricane strength as it moves near Puerto Rico late 
tonight and on Sunday, and a Hurricane Watch has been issued. 
Additional watches or warnings could be required later today for 
portions of the Dominican Republic.
 
2. Heavy rains from Fiona will spread west to British and U.S. 
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico today, the Dominican Republic Sunday, 
and the Turks and Caicos Monday night. This rainfall is likely to 
produce considerable flood impacts including flash and urban 
flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain, 
particularly in Puerto Rico.
 
3. Fiona is forecast to strengthen after moving across Hispaniola
early next week, and interests in the Turks and Caicos Islands and
southeastern Bahamas should continue to monitor forecasts for the
storm.
