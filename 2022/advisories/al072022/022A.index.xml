<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Fiona, located just north of the northern coast of the Dominican <br/>
Republic.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic:<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity has increased slightly this evening <br/>
in association with an area of low pressure located over the central <br/>
subtropical Atlantic.  Some slow development is possible during the <br/>
next couple of days, and a tropical depression could form during <br/>
that time before environmental conditions become less conducive <br/>
later this week.  The system should generally move northward or <br/>
northeastward while remaining over the open waters of central <br/>
subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located several hundred miles east of the Windward <br/>
Islands is producing an area of disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms.  Some gradual development of this system is possible <br/>
during the next several days while the system approaches the <br/>
Windward Islands toward the end of the week and moves over the <br/>
eastern Caribbean sea over the weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Fiona was located
near latitude 20.2 North, longitude 70.1 West. Fiona is moving
toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  This general motion is
expected to continue through tonight, followed by a turn toward the
north-northwest on Tuesday and to the north on Wednesday.  On the
forecast track, the center of Fiona will pass near or just east of
the Turks and Caicos on Tuesday.
 
Data from both Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft indicate that the maximum sustained winds have increased 
to near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher gusts.  Steady strengthening 
is expected during the next couple of days, and Fiona is forecast 
to become a major hurricane later tonight or on Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140
miles (220 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure reported by a NOAA 
reconnaissance aircraft is 974 mb (28.76 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Fiona can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header
WTNT42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the Turks and Caicos
beginning late tonight or early Tuesday.  Tropical storm and 
hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area 
in the Dominican Republic tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the 
southeastern Bahamas by early Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands: Additional 2 to 4 inches.  Storm
Total up to 10 inches on St. Croix.
 
Southern Puerto Rico: Additional 4 to 8 inches with local maximum of
15 inches.  Storm Total 12 to 20 inches with local maximum of over
30 inches.
 
Northern Puerto Rico: Additional 1 to 4 inches with local maximum of
6 inches.  Storm Total 4 to 12 inches with local maximum of 20
inches.
 
Northern and Eastern Dominican Republic: Additional 4 to 8 inches
with local maximum of 10 inches.  Storm Total up to 20 inches in
the eastern section.
 
Rest of Dominican Republic and Eastern Haiti: 3 to 6 inches.
 
Turks and Caicos: 4 to 8 inches.
 
Southeast Bahamas: 1 to 3 inches.
 
These rains will continue to produce life-threatening and
catastrophic flooding along with mudslides and landslides across
Puerto Rico.  Life-threatening flash and urban flooding is likely
for eastern portions of the Dominican Republic.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.

Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3 to 5 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Turks and Caicos tonight into Tuesday.
 
Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Dominican Republic.
 
Localized coastal flooding is possible for the Southeastern Bahamas
in areas of onshore winds tonight into Tuesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Virgin Islands,
Puerto Rico, the northern coast of Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos
Islands, and the southeastern Bahamas.  These swells will continue
to spread westward across the southwestern Atlantic toward the
central and northwestern Bahamas and the east coast of the United
States through midweek.  The swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Fiona Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
500 PM AST Mon Sep 19 2022
 
The hurricane is beginning to move away from the Dominican Republic
and over the warm waters of the Atlantic north of Hispaniola.
Fiona's cloud pattern is well organized and its inner core is
becoming better defined with very cold cloud tops becoming
concentrated near the eye.  Upper-level outflow is strong over most
of the circulation.  The current intensity estimate is set at 85 kt
which is a little below the latest Dvorak estimates from TAFB and
SAB.  An Air Force Reserve Unit Hurricane Hunter aircraft is
scheduled to investigate the system in a few hours, and assess its
structure and intensity.
 
Fiona continues to move northwestward, at a slightly faster forward
speed, or at about 325/9 kt.  There is little change to the track
forecast philosophy from the previous few advisory packages.
During the next couple of days, the hurricane is expected to
gradually turn toward the north while moving along the western
periphery of a mid-level subtropical anticyclone.  In 3-5 days,
Fiona should turn toward the north-northeast and accelerate in
response to a vigorous mid-tropospheric trough near the northeast
coast of the United States.
 
Global model forecasts continue to show moderate upper-level 
west-southwesterly flow over Fiona while it moves over the 
southwestern Atlantic early this week.  Although this flow should 
cause some shear over the hurricane during the next couple of
days, the intensity guidance models indicate that this shear will
not be strong enough to prevent further intensification.  The
official intensity forecast has been increased a little more for
this advisory and is in good agreement with the latest LGEM
guidance.  It now appears that Fiona will become a major hurricane
sooner than previously forecast.
 
Near the end of the forecast period, as the system becomes more
embedded within the  mid-latitude flow and interacts with the
strong mid-tropospheric trough, it should be making the transition
into a vigorous extratropical cyclone.  This is also suggested by
the latest FSU cyclone phases analyses.
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Heavy rains from the trailing bands of Fiona will continue 
across Puerto Rico through this evening, and across the eastern 
Dominican Republic through tonight.  These rains could produce 
life-threatening and catastrophic flooding along with mudslides and 
landslides across Puerto Rico and eastern portions of the Dominican 
Republic.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are expected over the Turks and Caicos, with 
tropical storm conditions over the southeastern Bahamas, beginning 
late tonight or early Tuesday.

3.  Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Fiona.
