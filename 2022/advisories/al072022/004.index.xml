A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Saba and St. Eustatius
* St. Maarten
* Antigua, Barbuda, St. Kitts, Nevis, Montserrat, and Anguilla
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola should monitor the progress of
this system. Additional tropical storm watches or warnings will
likely be required for portions of these areas later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fiona was 
located near latitude 16.6 North, longitude 53.0 West. Fiona is 
moving toward the west near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue for the next several days. On the 
forecast track, the center of Fiona is forecast to move through the 
Leeward Islands late Friday and Friday night, and move near the 
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico this weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Little change in strength is forecast during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km) 
east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible across portions of the
northern Leeward Islands by Friday night, where a Tropical Storm
Watch is in effect.
 
RAINFALL: Fiona is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations 
of 3 to 6 inches with isolated higher amounts across the northern 
Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico 
and eastern Hispaniola.  These rains may produce flash and urban 
flooding, along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain. 
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are expected to begin affecting the
northern Leeward Islands by early Friday. These swells could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Fiona Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>

Tropical Storm Fiona Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
500 AM AST Thu Sep 15 2022
 
The satellite presentation of Fiona has not changed much overnight. 
The low-level center of the storm is still displaced to the west of 
a deep convective mass with very cold infrared cloud tops. Earlier 
scatterometer data showed a broad area of tropical-storm-force winds 
over the eastern portion of the circulation, with reliable peak 
winds in the 40-45 kt range. Therefore, the initial intensity is 
held at 45 kt for this advisory. An Air Force Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft is scheduled to investigate Fiona later today.

Fiona is moving westward at 270/11 kt. The cyclone is expected to 
generally maintain a westward heading for the next few days as it is 
steered by the subtropical ridge over the central Atlantic. However, 
there are still significant along-track differences among some of 
the model solutions, with the GFS and ECMWF almost 250 n mi apart at 
72 h. The latest NHC track forecast lies slightly south of the 
previous one and is a bit slower through the first 72 h, remaining 
closer to the latest GFEX and HCCA aids. This track brings Fiona 
across the northern Leeward Islands by Friday night, near the Virgin 
Islands and Puerto Rico this weekend, and near Hispaniola early next 
week. From there, the deterministic guidance and most GFS and ECMWF 
ensemble members agree that Fiona should turn northwestward by days 
4-5 as a weakness develops in the steering ridge over the western 
Atlantic. The stronger GFS and HWRF runs show a sharper recurvature 
than the rest of the guidance, but the NHC forecast shows a more 
gradual turn generally in line with the HCCA aid. 

The sheared, asymmetric structure of Fiona does not appear conducive 
for much strengthening in the near term. In fact, the SHIPS guidance 
suggests that moderate to strong westerly to northwesterly shear 
will persist for the next several days over Fiona. This, combined 
with some drier mid-level air to the west of the storm, could make 
it difficult for Fiona's inner-core structure to become better 
organized. The intensity forecast is also complicated by the 
potential for land interaction as the storm moves near or over 
portions of the Greater Antilles this weekend and early next week. 
Given the less-than-ideal conditions, the official NHC intensity 
forecast does not show much strengthening over the next several 
days, and it lies slightly below the intensity consensus aids. 

Additional tropical storm watches or warnings will likely be 
required later today for portions of the northern Leeward Islands, 
Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, and interests in these 
locations should monitor the latest forecast updates.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are possible in portions of the
northern Leeward Islands by Friday night, where a Tropical Storm
Watch has been issued.
 
2. Heavy rains from Fiona will reach the northern Leeward Islands 
Friday afternoon, spreading to the British and U.S. Virgin Islands 
and Puerto Rico Saturday into Sunday morning, and reaching eastern 
Hispaniola Sunday. This rainfall may produce flash and urban 
flooding, along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
3. Fiona is expected to move near the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
and Hispaniola this weekend and early next week, and Tropical Storm
Watches will likely be issued for some of those areas later today.
