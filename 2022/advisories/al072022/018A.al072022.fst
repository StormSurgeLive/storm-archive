DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Fiona was located
near latitude 18.1 North, longitude 67.8 West.  Fiona has jogged 
westward over the past few hours, but a northwestward motion near
9 mph (15 km/h) should resume later this evening.  A northwestward 
motion is forecast to continue through Monday, followed by a turn 
toward the north-northwest on Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Fiona will move near the eastern and northern coasts of 
the Dominican Republic tonight and Monday, and near or to the east 
of the Turks and Caicos Islands on Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140
miles (220 km). A wind gust to 55 mph (89 km/h) was recently 
reported at Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico. A sustained wind of 44 mph 
(70 km/h) with a gust to 55 mph (89 km/h) has been measured at Los 
Mareas in Puerto Rico within the past couple of hours. 

The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Reserve 
reconnaissance aircraft data is 984 mb (29.06 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Fiona can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header
WTNT42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are occurring on portions of Puerto
Rico, and are expected in portions of the eastern Dominican Republic
tonight and Monday.  Hurricane conditions are possible within the
hurricane watch area in the Dominican Republic late tonight and 
Monday.

Tropical storm conditions will continue to spread over portions of 
the Dominican Republic within the warning areas through Monday. 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Turks and Caicos 
Islands and portions of the southeastern Bahamas by early Tuesday. 
Tropical storm conditions are possible across the watch area in the 
Dominican Republic tonight and Monday.

RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:

Leeward Islands: Additional 2 inches or less.

British and U.S. Virgin Islands: 4 to 6 inches, maximum of 10 inches
on St. Croix.

Puerto Rico: 12 to 18 inches with local maximum of 30 inches,
particularly across eastern and southern Puerto Rico.

Northern and Eastern Dominican Republic: 4 to 8 inches with local
maximum 12 inches, particularly along the northeast coast.

Rest of Dominican Republic and Haiti: 1 to 3 inches.

Turks and Caicos: 3 to 6 inches.

These rains will produce life-threatening and catastrophic flash and
urban flooding across Puerto Rico and the eastern Dominican
Republic, along with mudslides and landslides in areas of higher
terrain.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas
in areas of onshore winds if the peak surge occurs at the time of
high tide...

Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico to Guayama, Puerto Rico...1 to 3 ft
Guayama, Puerto Rico to Fajardo, Puerto Rico including the islands
of Vieques and Culebra...1 to 2 ft

Localized coastal flooding is also possible elsewhere in Puerto
Rico.  For information specific to your area, please see products
issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office.

Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 3 to 5 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Dominican Republic.

Localized coastal flooding will be possible along the coasts of the
Turks and Caicos in areas of onshore winds Monday night into
Tuesday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Leeward Islands,
the northern Windward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the
northern coast of the Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos
Islands, and the southeastern Bahamas. These conditions could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
