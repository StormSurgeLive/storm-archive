Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Thu Sep 22 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Fiona, located several hundred miles southwest of Bermuda, and on <br/>
Tropical Storm Gaston, located a few hundred miles west-southwest of <br/>
the Azores. <br/>
<br/>
Southeastern Caribbean Sea:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue in association with a tropical <br/>
wave located over the southeastern Caribbean Sea.  Although <br/>
upper-level winds are currently inhibiting development, the <br/>
environment is forecast to gradually become more favorable in a <br/>
couple of days, and a tropical depression is likely to form at that <br/>
time.  The disturbance is forecast to move west-northwestward across <br/>
the eastern Caribbean Sea during the next day or two, and be over <br/>
the central Caribbean Sea this weekend.  Regardless of development, <br/>
locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds are likely to affect the <br/>
Windward Islands, northern Venezuela, and the ABC island chain <br/>
today. These impacts are likely to spread to northeastern Colombia <br/>
later this evening.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms located near the west coast of Africa are <br/>
associated with a tropical wave that has emerged over the warm <br/>
waters of the far eastern Atlantic.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to be conducive for some development, and a tropical <br/>
depression could form by this weekend while the system moves slowly <br/>
northward, between west Africa and the Cabo Verde Islands. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
East Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands continues to produce <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Despite marginal <br/>
environmental conditions, some slow development of this system is <br/>
possible over the next several days while it moves slowly <br/>
northwestward or northward over the tropical Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Fiona was located
near latitude 28.0 North, longitude 70.6 West. Fiona is moving
toward the north-northeast near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A north-
northeastward or northeastward motion with an increase in forward
speed is expected today through Friday, followed by a somewhat
slower northward motion beginning Friday night or Saturday.  On the
forecast track, the center of Fiona will pass just to the west of
Bermuda tonight, approach Nova Scotia on Friday, and move across
Nova Scotia and into the Gulf of St. Lawrence on Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Fiona is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in strength is expected through
tonight.  Some weakening is expected to begin on Friday, but Fiona
is forecast be a large and powerful post-tropical cyclone with 
hurricane-force winds when it moves over Nova Scotia Friday night 
and Saturday. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km). NOAA buoy 41047, about 65 miles west-southwest of
the center of Fiona, recently reported a sustained wind of 52 mph
(83 km/h) and a gust to 67 mph (107 km/h) within the past hour or 
two. A NOAA Saildrone located about 75 miles east-northeast of the 
center has recently reported sustained winds of 56 mph (91 km/h). 
 
The estimted minimum central pressure is 934 mb (27.58 inches).

 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Fiona can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header
WTNT42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
tonight and continuing through Friday morning.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
Bermuda: 2 to 4 inches.
 
Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and western Newfoundland: 3 to 6
inches, with local maximum up to 10 inches. This rainfall could
result in areas of flooding, some of which may be significant in
nature.
 
Eastern Quebec: 2 to 5 inches.
 
Eastern New Brunswick: 1 to 3 inches.
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will cause elevated water levels along
the coast of Bermuda in areas of onshore winds beginning tonight.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Turks and 
Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, the southeastern United States 
coast, and Bermuda.  These swells will continue to spread 
northwestward across the western Atlantic toward the mid-Atlantic 
and northeast coasts of the United States over the next day or so.  
The swells will also reach Atlantic Canada on Friday. These swells 
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Hurricane Fiona Forecast Discussion Number 32</title>

Hurricane Fiona Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
500 AM EDT Thu Sep 22 2022

Fiona is showing signs of slow decay in satellite imagery, with the 
eye gradually becoming cloud filled and the eyewall convection 
becoming more ragged.  However, this has not yet led to a 
significant decrease in the satellite intensity estimates, which 
range from 100-130 kt.  The initial intensity is held at 115 kt 
pending the arrival of the next Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft, but this could be a little generous.

The hurricane has turned north-northeastward during the past several 
hours with the initial motion now 025/11 kt.  Fiona is expected to 
accelerate in a generally north-northeasterly direction for the next 
24 h or so as it is steered along the southern edge of the 
mid-latitude westerlies.  This motion should take the center 
northwest of Bermuda in 24-30 h.  After that time, an even faster 
motion is forecast as the hurricane interacts with a powerful 
deep-layer trough moving into the Atlantic from the northeastern 
United States. This interaction should steer the cyclone toward 
Atlantic Canada later Friday and Friday night.  After 48 h, a 
northward motion at a decreasing forward speed is expected, with the 
center moving near or over, eastern Nova Scotia, the Gulf of St. 
Lawrence, and portions of Newfoundland and Labrador into the 
Labrador Sea by days 4 and 5.  The track guidance remains very 
tightly clustered, and the new NHC track forecast is again mainly an 
update of the previous prediction.

Little change, or perhaps a slow decrease in intensity is expected 
during the next 24 h or so while Fiona remains over warm waters of 
29-30 degrees Celsius and in a generally low-shear environment.  
After that, interaction with the aforementioned mid-latitude trough 
should begin the process of extratropical transition, which should 
complete between 48-60 h as the center of Fiona approaches Nova 
Scotia.  The extratropical low is forecast to continue producing 
hurricane-force winds as it crosses Nova Scotia and moves into the 
Gulf of St. Lawrence through 60 h, and it is expected to continue 
producing gale-force winds as it moves across Newfoundland and 
Labrador until near the end of the forecast period.  There is little 
change in the intensity guidance from the previous advisory, and 
there are only minor changes in the intensity forecast.

The wind radii were modified based on a combination of 
scatterometer and synthetic aperture radar data.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane conditions are expected on Bermuda tonight through 
Friday morning, and a Hurricane Warning has been issued for the 
island.
 
2. Fiona is expected to affect portions of Atlantic Canada as a
powerful hurricane-force cyclone late Friday and Saturday, and
significant impacts from high winds, storm surge, and heavy
rainfall are becoming increasingly likely.  Interests in these
areas should closely monitor the progress of Fiona and updates to
the forecast.
 
3. Large swells generated by Fiona are expected to cause dangerous
and possibly life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along
the east coast of the United States, the Bahamas, Bermuda, and
Atlantic Canada during the next few days.  Please consult products
from your local weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Gaston Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
900 AM GMT Thu Sep 22 2022
 
GOES-16 Enhanced BD-curve infrared imagery and a recent GMI
microwave pass showed that Gaston had maintained a deep convective
inner core during the past several hours.  Subsequently, a 
primary curved band with -66C cloud tops has developed in the 
western semicircle.  A compromise of the subjective satellite 
intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB, along with a UW-CIMSS AiDT 
estimated, yields an initial intensity of 55 kt for this advisory.
 
Although the intensity guidance agrees that Gaston will commence a 
slow weakening trend soon, predicting when Gaston will become a 
post-tropical cyclone or if it transitions into an extratropical low 
is problematic. The GFS and ECMWF-SHIPS statistical diagnostics 
indicate that Gaston will complete extratropical transition in just 
6 hours, which appears unrealistic.  On the other hand, the FSU 
Cyclone phase forecast for the GFS and UKMET suggest that the system 
will maintain a symmetric lower-tropospheric warm core while moving 
south of the upper westerlies on Friday.  The latter scenario seems 
more reasonable since Gaston is sustaining inner core convection and 
the wind flow aloft becomes a bit more diffluent as it approaches 
the Azores Islands. Afterwards, the global simulated IR forecasts 
show Gaston becoming a post-tropical cyclone (loss of tropical cloud 
pattern characteristics) in 48 hours due to sub-24C SSTs, an 
increasing stable/dry surrounding atmosphere, and strong northerly 
shear.  The NHC forecast is based on the above mentioned global 
model guidance and shows Gaston becoming a post-tropical cyclone on 
Saturday.
 
Gaston's initial motion is estimated to be east-northeastward, or 
070/15 kt.  The are no significant changes to the previous track 
forecast or synoptic reasoning.  Gaston is expected to move 
east-northeastward to eastward through Friday morning.  
Afterward, the Azores high is predicted to strengthen and cause 
Gaston to gradually turn southward.  Beyond 48 hours, the 
global and hurricane models indicate that the cyclone will turn 
toward the west-southwest to west in response to the aforementioned 
high-pressure building to the north and northeast of the system.  
The NHC forecast is based on this scenario and lies between the TVCA 
and HCCA consensus models.

Because the latest forecast track of Gaston brings the cyclone near 
or over the western and central Azores islands before becoming 
post-tropical, The Azores Meteorological Service has issued a 
Tropical Storm Warning for their western and central island chains.
