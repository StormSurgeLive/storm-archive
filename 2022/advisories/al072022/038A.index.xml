DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Fiona was located
near latitude 42.3 North, longitude 60.7 West.  Fiona is moving
toward the north near 46 mph (74 km/h).  A slower
north-northeast or northward motion is expected through Sunday.  On
the forecast track, the center of Fiona will approach Nova Scotia
tonight, move across Nova Scotia and into the Gulf of St.
Lawrence on Saturday, and then move across Labrador and over the 
Labrador Sea by late Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Fiona is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Although gradual weakening is forecast during
the next couple of days, Fiona is expected to be a powerful
hurricane-force cyclone when it moves across Atlantic Canada.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 345
miles (555 km).  Sable Island, Nova Scotia, reported a wind gust of 
43 mph (69 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 935 mb (27.61 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Fiona can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in portions of the
hurricane warning area in Canada late tonight or early Saturday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in portions of the
tropical storm warning area in Canada tonight.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the watch area in Labrador on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and western Newfoundland: 3 to 6
inches (75 to 150 mm), with local maxima of up to 10 inches (250
mm).  This rainfall could result in areas of flooding, some of
which may be significant in nature.
 
Labrador and eastern Quebec:  2 to 5 inches (50 to 125 mm).
 
Eastern New Brunswick: 1 to 3 inches (25 to 75 mm).
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding within the warning areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of
onshore winds. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the northwestern
Bahamas, the eastern United States coast, and Bermuda.  These
swells are now reaching Atlantic Canada this evening.  The swells 
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Fiona Discussion Number  38
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
500 PM AST Fri Sep 23 2022

Fiona is beginning to take on the appearance of an extratropical 
cyclone.  The cloud pattern is becoming more elongated and 
asymmetrical, with cooler-air stratocumulus clouds near the western 
semicircle of the cyclone.  The eye became obscured a few hours ago 
and, assuming gradual weakening since the last Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft mission into the system, the current intensity is set at 
110 kt.

Satellite center fixes indicate that Fiona has been moving very 
rapidly toward the north-northeast, or about 030/35 kt.  The 
numerical guidance is in good agreement that the cyclone will slow 
its forward speed during the next few days while it interacts with 
a mid- to upper-level trough.  The center of Fiona is expected to 
make landfall in Atlantic Canada by Saturday morning, but wind, 
rain, and surge impacts will begin well before that time given the 
large size of the hurricane. The NHC track forecast is mainly a 
blend of the GFS and ECMWF global model solutions, and similar to 
the previous official track prediction.
 
Fiona is expected to slowly weaken during the next few days due to 
increasing shear and dry air entrainment.  In 12 hours, the 
system should become embedded within a baroclinic zone, and 
be transformed into an extratropical cyclone.  This is also 
indicated by simulated infrared satellite imagery from the global 
models.  However, there is high confidence that Fiona will remain a 
powerful cyclone, with hurricane-force winds, when it moves across 
Atlantic Canada.  The system should wind down into a gale center by 
the time it reaches the southeastern Labrador Sea.  The official 
forecast is near the high end of the model guidance.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Fiona is expected to affect portions of Atlantic Canada as a
powerful hurricane-force cyclone tonight and Saturday, and
significant impacts from high winds, storm surge, and heavy rainfall
are expected. Hurricane and Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect
for much of Atlantic Canada.
 
2. Large swells generated by Fiona are expected to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along much of the
east coast of the United States, the northwestern Bahamas, Bermuda, 
and Atlantic Canada during the next couple of days.

At 1200 AM GMT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gaston was
located near latitude 39.1 North, longitude 29.0 West. Gaston is
moving toward the south near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A turn to the
southwest is forecast this morning, and a westward motion is
anticipated by this evening or Sunday.  On the forecast track,
the center of Gaston will move near or over portions of the Azores
through this morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Gradual weakening is expected over the next few days, and Gaston 
could become a post-tropical cyclone late on Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center. A weather station at Horta on Faial Island 
recently measured a wind gust to 41 mph (66 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gaston can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
900 PM GMT Fri Sep 23 2022
 
Convection has been sputtering in recent hours in the core of
Gaston.  It appears the effects of strong vertical wind shear, dry
middle-level humidities and cool sea surface temperatures have
weakened the storm.  Satellite Dvorak estimates from both TAFB and
SAB suggest the storm is now 45 kt while and earlier scatterometer
pass showed a decent area of 50-55 kt winds.  The initial intensity
has been lowered to 50 kt to represent a blend of these estimates.
 
Gaston is moving southward at about 8 kt toward the central
Azores.  A building mid-tropospheric ridge to the north is
expected to turn the storm towards the southwest early tomorrow. 
The ridge will eventually steer Gaston westward in about a day
or so, and this motion is forecast to continue until the end of the
period.  The official forecast track is very similar to the
previous advisory prediction except being slightly farther east in
the first 12 hours due to the present location and motion.
 
The tropical nature of Gaston seems to be winding down quickly.
Simulated satellite imagery from global models suggests the storm
will become fully post-tropical in about 36 hours.  Statistical
model guidance insists that, despite strong to moderate vertical 
wind shear and dry air, Gaston should only gradually weaken.  The 
NHC intensity forecast reflects this and is close the multi-model
consensus guidance and slightly lower than the previous forecast.
However, it is entirely possible Gaston could weaken more rapidly 
than expected.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
western and central Azores.
 
2. Gaston is expected to produce heavy rainfall over the western
and central Azores Friday into Saturday.  This rainfall may
result in landslides and areas of flooding.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Nine was
located near latitude 14.8 North, longitude 71.5 West.  The
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24
km/h).  A westward motion is expected to begin tonight and continue
through Saturday night, followed by a turn toward the northwest and
north-northwest on Sunday and Monday.  On the forecast track, the
center of the cyclone is forecast to move across the central
Caribbean Sea through Saturday, pass south of Jamaica on Saturday
night and Sunday, and approach the Cayman Islands on Sunday night
and early Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some slow strengthening is forecast during the next day or
so, and the depression is expected to become a tropical storm 
tonight or on Saturday.  More significant intensification is 
forecast on Sunday and Monday, and the system is forecast to become 
a hurricane by early Monday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Nine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible in the Cayman Islands by
early Monday, with tropical storm conditions possible by late
Sunday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible on Jamaica by
Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Nine is expected to produce the
following rainfall:
 
Southern Haiti and Southern Dominican Republic: 2 to 4 inches, with
local maximum up to 6 inches
 
Jamaica and the Cayman Islands: 4 to 8 inches, with local maximum up
to 12 inches
 
Western to central Cuba: 6 to 10 inches, with local maximum up to 14
inches.
 
Heavy rains may begin to affect South Florida on Monday. Limited
flash and urban flood impacts may be possible with this rainfall.
 
These rains may produce flash flooding and mudslides in areas of
higher terrain, particularly over Jamaica and Cuba.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to
3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas
of onshore winds in the Cayman Islands Sunday night into Monday.
 
Localized coastal flooding is possible along the coast of Jamaica in
areas of onshore winds on Sunday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by this system will begin affecting Jamaica,
the Cayman Islands, and Cuba over the next several days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Depression Nine Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
500 PM EDT Fri Sep 23 2022

The organization of the depression has slightly improved since this 
morning. The low-level center has been decoupled from the deep 
convection for much of the day, but in recent satellite imagery 
it appears the center may be drawing closer to a more recent burst 
of convective activity. Unfortunately, earlier scatterometer data 
missed the center of the cyclone, and the satellite intensity 
estimates still range from 25-35 kt. The initial intensity is held 
at 30 kt for this advisory, and an Air Force Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft is on its way to investigate the system this evening.

The system is still moving west-northwestward at 290/13 kt, but it 
is expected to turn westward tonight and continue on that heading 
through Saturday as a ridge develops to its north. Then, a deep- 
layer trough over the eastern U.S. is forecast to erode the ridge 
into early next week. This should result in a turn toward the 
northwest and north-northwest while the cyclone passes near the 
Cayman Islands early Monday and approaches western Cuba Monday 
night. Once again, the global models have shifted westward this 
cycle during this period, and there remains increased track 
uncertainty late in the forecast period once the cyclone emerges 
into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. The latest NHC track forecast 
has been adjusted westward from 48-120 h, and it lies near or 
slightly east of the latest track consensus aids.

Recent satellite trends suggest the cyclone may already be nearing 
a lower shear environment, and once that occurs, the atmospheric 
and oceanic conditions appear very conducive for strengthening 
through early next week. As the cyclone moves within a moist and 
unstable environment over sea-surface temperatures greater than 30 
deg C, it is forecast to rapidly intensify over the northwestern 
Caribbean Sea and continue strengthening while it approaches 
western Cuba on Monday night. The very warm waters of the 
southeastern Gulf of Mexico should allow for more strengthening 
once it crosses Cuba, and the NHC forecast once again shows the 
system approaching the Florida peninsula as a major hurricane by 
the middle of next week.

Based on the latest forecast, a Hurricane Watch has been issued 
for the Cayman Islands, and a Tropical Storm Watch has been 
issued for Jamaica.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. The depression is expected to produce heavy rainfall, flash 
flooding and possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain in 
Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao. Heavy rains are also likely to spread 
into Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, and Cuba in the coming days.
 
2. A Tropical Storm Watch has been issued for Jamaica, with 
tropical storm conditions possible on the island by Sunday. A 
Hurricane Watch has been issued for the Cayman Islands, with 
hurricane conditions possible by early Monday and tropical storm 
conditions possible by late Sunday.
 
3. Early next week the system is forecast to move near or over
western Cuba as a strengthening hurricane and then approach the
Florida peninsula at or near major hurricane strength, with the
potential for significant impacts from storm surge, hurricane-force
winds, and heavy rainfall. While it is too soon to determine the
exact magnitude and location of these impacts, residents in Cuba,
the Florida Keys, and the Florida peninsula should ensure they have
their hurricane plan in place and closely monitor forecast updates
through the weekend.

located near latitude 18.6 North, longitude 20.5 West. Hermine is
moving toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this 
general motion with some decrease in forward speed is forecast this 
weekend, with a turn to the northwest possible early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Some strengthening is possible through 
tomorrow, with weakening expected on Sunday, and Hermine could 
become a remnant low on Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Hermine is forecast to produce 2 to 4 inches (50 to 100 
mm) of rain, with isolated totals of 6 inches (150 mm), over the 
Canary Islands through this weekend. This rainfall could cause some 
flash flooding in areas of higher terrain.

Tropical Storm Hermine Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102022
800 PM CVT Fri Sep 23 2022

A large burst of convection has been occurring in the northeastern 
quadrant of the system today, with other shallow banding features 
to the southeast of the center.  Overall, the cyclone looks better 
than this morning and resembles a sheared tropical storm, which is 
confirmed by the Dvorak pattern-T of 2.5 (35 kt) from SAB.  Thus 
the wind speed is set to 35 kt, making this system the 8th tropical 
storm of the season.  
  
Hermine continues moving north-northwestward, now about 10 kt.  
Global model guidance is consistent on the cyclone moving northward 
through a large break in the eastern Atlantic subtropical ridge.  
The most significant change is that the storm could hold together a 
little longer in a marginal environment, which causes the forecast 
track to tug a little to the northeast before a weakening Hermine 
would move westward as a shallow system beneath the low-level ridge. 
The new forecast is shifted to the north and east, but is not as 
far northeast as the GFS or HWRF models.  
 
The storm has about a day over lukewarm water before all the models 
hit the system with strong upper-level southwesterly winds.  There 
is a minority solution in the models where the upper-trough cuts 
off, somewhat lessening the shear, but for now the NHC forecast 
stays closer to the faster dissipation scenario. Either way, Hermine 
should dissipate early next week due to very strong shear and dry 
air entrainment cutting off any deep convection. The official 
intensity forecast is a little higher than the last one, near the 
various consensus aids.
 
Note that 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated totals of 6 inches, 
are possible over the Canary Islands through this weekend due to a 
combination of a mid-latitude trough and moisture from Hermine.  
This rainfall could cause some flash flooding in areas of higher 
terrain.
