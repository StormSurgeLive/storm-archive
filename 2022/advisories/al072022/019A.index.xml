producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms. There is a short <br/>
window for this system to develop further over the next day or two <br/>
before environmental conditions become less favorable later this <br/>
week. The system should move generally northward or northeastward <br/>
while remaining over the open central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Fiona was located 
near latitude 18.2 North, longitude 68.4 West. Fiona is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A northwestward 
motion is expected to begin this morning, followed by a turn toward 
the north-northwest on Tuesday and the north on Wednesday. On the 
forecast track, the center of Fiona will move over the eastern 
portion of the Dominican Republic this morning, and near or to the 
east of the Turks and Caicos Islands on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Some strengthening is expected during the next few days, and 
Fiona is forecast to become a major hurricane by Wednesday. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles 
(220 km). A wind gust of 58 mph (93 km/h) was recently reported at 
the Punta Cana International Airport in the Dominican Republic.
 
The minimum central pressure based on data from an Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Fiona can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header
WTNT42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm and hurricane conditions will likely continue 
on portions of Puerto Rico into this morning. Hurricane 
conditions are expected in portions of the eastern Dominican 
Republic within the warning area today, and in the Turks and Caicos 
on Tuesday. Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane 
watch area in the Dominican Republic later today.
 
Tropical storm conditions will continue to spread over portions of 
the Dominican Republic within the warning areas through today. 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the 
southeastern Bahamas by early Tuesday. Tropical storm conditions are 
possible across the watch area in the Dominican Republic today.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
Leeward Islands: Additional 2 inches or less.
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands: 4 to 6 inches, maximum of 10 inches
on St. Croix.
 
Puerto Rico: 12 to 20 inches with local maximum of 30 inches,
particularly across eastern and southern Puerto Rico.
 
Northern and Eastern Dominican Republic: 4 to 8 inches with local
maximum 12 inches, particularly along the northeast coast.
 
Rest of Dominican Republic and Haiti: 1 to 3 inches.
 
Turks and Caicos: 3 to 6 inches.
 
Southeast Bahamas: 1 to 3 inches.
 
These rains will continue to produce life-threatening and
catastrophic flash and urban flooding across Puerto Rico and the
eastern Dominican Republic, along with mudslides and landslides in
areas of higher terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  

Localized coastal flooding remains possible along the southern coast 
of Puerto Rico.  For information specific to your area, please see 
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast 
office.

Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 3 to 5 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Dominican Republic.

Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Turks and Caicos Monday night into Tuesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Virgin Islands, 
Puerto Rico, the northern coast of the Dominican Republic, the Turks 
and Caicos Islands, and the southeastern Bahamas. These swells will 
continue to spread westward across the southwestern Atlantic toward 
the central and northwestern Bahamas and the east coast of the 
United States through midweek. These conditions could cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Fiona Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
1100 PM AST Sun Sep 18 2022
 
Radar imagery and recent fixes from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft show that Fiona has jogged westward over the Mona 
Passage, in between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic this 
evening.  Radar, microwave imagery, and observations from the 
aircraft indicate that the eye has become smaller, with the radius 
of maximum winds decreasing to 10-15 n mi. There has been some 
warming of the clouds tops in the band just outside the CDO, but the 
conventional satellite presentation has not changed much since late 
this afternoon.  The aircraft has measured a peak 700-mb flight- 
level wind of 75 kt, and SFMR winds of around 70 kt. A dropwindsonde 
in the northwestern eyewall measured a mean wind of 89 kt in the 
lowest 150 m of the profile, which supports the 75 kt initial 
intensity. The aircraft just reported a minimum pressure of 982 mb 
on it latest pass through the center just a short time ago.
 
As mentioned above, Fiona has been moving more westward this
evening, but the longer-term motion estimate is 300/9 kt. With this
westward jog, the center is likely to make landfall in the eastern
portion of the Dominican Republic overnight, and the early portion
of the track forecast has been adjusted accordingly.  The dynamical
model guidance insists that a northwestward motion should begin
soon, and the models are in good agreement that Fiona will move
around the western periphery of a subtropical ridge over the next
several days.  Later in the forecast period, Fiona is forecast to
accelerate northeastward, and north-northeastward ahead of a trough
that is expected to move across the northeastern United States by
the end of the week. The official forecast is near the center of
the guidance envelope, but is slightly slower than the previous
forecast at days 4 and 5 to be closer to the latest consensus aids.
 
Fiona could strengthen slightly within the next few hours before it
reaches the coast of the Dominican Republic overnight.  After that
time, some weakening could occur while the center remains near
eastern Hispaniola.   Once Fiona moves over the Atlantic waters
north of the Dominican Republic, the hurricane will be over warm
water and in fairly moist environment.  Although there is likely to
be some moderate shear over the hurricane, nearly all of the
intensity models suggest the cyclone will strengthen, and the
official forecast again calls for Fiona to become a major hurricane
in a couple of days.  The NHC intensity forecast is close to the
IVCN intensity aid, and is similar to the previous wind speed
forecast.

Based on Fiona's latest forecast track, the government of the 
Bahamas has issued a Hurricane Warning for the Turks and Caicos 
Islands.  
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Hurricane conditions are expected to begin in portions of the 
warning area in the Dominican Republic within the next few hours. 
Tropical storm conditions will continue to spread over portions of 
the Dominican Republic within the warning area through Monday.
 
2. Heavy rains from Fiona will continue across Puerto Rico overnight
tonight and spread over the Dominican Republic through Monday.
These rains will continue to produce life-threatening and
catastrophic flash and urban flooding across Puerto Rico and
portions of the eastern Dominican Republic, along with mudslides and
landslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
3. Fiona is forecast to continue to strengthen after moving away
from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.  Hurricane conditions
are expected in portions of the Turks and Caicos Islands on Tuesday,
and tropical storm conditions are expected in the southeastern
Bahamas by late Monday or early Tuesday.
