<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Fiona, located near the Turks and Caicos islands, and on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gaston, located over the north-central Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is producing shower and thunderstorm activity a few <br/>
hundred miles east of the Windward Islands. The system continues to <br/>
show signs of organization and it will likely become a tropical <br/>
depression within the next two or three days. The disturbance is <br/>
forecast to move west-northwestward across the southern Windward <br/>
Islands late Wednesday and then move toward the central Caribbean <br/>
Sea late this week. Interests in the Windward Islands should closely <br/>
monitor the progress of this system as heavy rainfall and gusty <br/>
winds could affect these islands beginning on Wednesday.  <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is forecast to move off the west coast of Africa on <br/>
Thursday. Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive for <br/>
at least gradual development of the system for a couple days <br/>
thereafter while the system moves slowly northward between west <br/>
Africa and the Cabo Verde Islands through the end of the week. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Fiona was located
near latitude 22.9 North, longitude 71.7 West. Fiona is moving
toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  This general
motion is expected to continue tonight, followed by a turn toward 
the north on Wednesday.  A turn toward the north-northeast with an 
increase in forward speed is expected on Thursday.  On the
forecast track, the center of Fiona will gradually move away from
the Turks and Caicos tonight and Wednesday, and approach Bermuda
late on Thursday.
 
Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the 
maximum sustained winds have increased to near 125 mph (205 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Fiona is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Strengthening is forecast 
during the next couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150
miles (240 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure reported by the NOAA 
reconnaissance aircraft is 951 mb (28.08 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Fiona can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header
WTNT42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Tropical storm and hurricane conditions are occurring over 
portions of Turks and Caicos and these conditions should continue 
for the next few hours.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
southeastern Bahamas for the next several hours. 

Tropical storm conditions could reach Bermuda by late Thursday or 
early Friday.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands: Up to an additional local 1 to 2
inches.
 
Puerto Rico: Up to an additional local 1 to 2 inches. Storm Total 12
to 20 inches with local maximum of 35 inches.
 
Dominican Republic: Up to an additional local 1 to 2 inches. Storm
Total up to 20 inches in the eastern section.
 
Turks and Caicos: Additional 2 to 4 inches with storm totals of 5
to 10 inches.
 
Southeast Bahamas: 1 to 4 inches.
 
Bermuda: 1 to 3 inches.
 
Heavy rains around the center of Fiona will impact the Turks and
Caicos through this evening with continued life-threatening
flooding. Localized additional flash and urban flooding is possible
in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Turks and Caicos through this evening.
 
Localized coastal flooding is possible for the Southeastern Bahamas
in areas of onshore winds through this evening.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the northern coast 
of Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the southeastern 
and central Bahamas.  These swells will continue to spread westward 
across the southwestern Atlantic toward the northwestern Bahamas 
and the east coast of the United States during the next day or two.  
Swells from Fiona are expected to reach Bermuda by early Thursday.  
The swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Hurricane Fiona Forecast Discussion Number 26</title>

Hurricane Fiona Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
500 PM EDT Tue Sep 20 2022

Deep convection around Fiona's eye is intense, but is in a rather 
asymmetrical pattern at this time.  Upper-tropospheric outflow 
remains somewhat restricted over the western semicircle of the 
system.  The last Air Force Hurricane Hunter fix in the 
center of the hurricane around 17Z showed a slight fall of 
central pressure from earlier in the day, but the flight-level and 
SFMR-observed surface winds indicated that the maximum winds were 
still near 100 kt.  This is also in agreement with the latest 
Dvorak satellite estimates from TAFB and SAB.  Another Air Force 
Hurricane Hunter mission into Fiona is scheduled for 00Z to see if 
Fiona is strengthening again.

Vertical wind shear over Fiona, as diagnosed by the SHIPS model, is 
predicted to remain moderate for the next few days.  However, the 
hurricane is likely to remain in a moist unstable air mass and over 
a warm ocean for the next couple of days which is likely to offset 
the influence of shear.  In general, the intensity model guidance 
continues to show strengthening for about the next 48 hours, and so 
does the official forecast.  Fiona is expected to become a category 
4 hurricane in a day or so.  By 96 hours, global model guidance 
indicates that the system will be transformed into a vigorous 
extratropical cyclone near Atlantic Canada.

The hurricane is still headed toward the north-northwest with an 
initial motion estimate of 330/7 kt.  The track forecast scenario 
is generally unchanged from the previous advisory.  Fiona should 
turn northward while moving along the western side of a mid-level 
anticyclone during the next day or so.  In 2-3 days, an intense 
mid-tropospheric trough will be moving off the northeast United 
States coast.  This feature should cause Fiona to accelerate toward 
the north-northeast and northeast during the latter part of the 
forecast period.  The official forecast follows about the same 
trajectory as the previous one, but is just a tad slower.  This is 
in good agreement with both the simple and corrected consensus 
predictions.


Key Messages:
 
1.  Heavy rains around the center of Fiona will continue to impact 
the Turks and Caicos through this evening with continued 
life-threatening flooding.  Localized additional flash and urban 
flooding is possible in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are affecting portions of the Turks and
Caicos islands, while tropical storm conditions should affect
portions of the southeastern Bahamas during the next few hours.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda by late 
Thursday.

4. Fiona is expected to affect portions of Atlantic Canada as a 
powerful hurricane-force cyclone late Friday and Saturday, and could 
produce significant impacts from high winds, storm surge, and heavy 
rainfall. Interests in these areas should closely monitor the 
progress of Fiona and updates to the forecast.

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
900 PM GMT Tue Sep 20 2022

Satellite images indicate that deep convection is persisting near 
and to the north of the center of the cyclone during the past 
several hours. Drifting buoy 44857 recently reported a minimum 
pressure of 1009 mb near the center of the low, which is a 8 mb 
decrease from earlier today. An ASCAT-C pass from several hours ago 
showed maximum winds of about 35 kt in the northeast and northwest 
quadrants.  Based on that data, the initial intensity is increased 
to 35 kt, making the system Tropical Storm Gaston.
 
Gaston has turned north-northeastward and is moving a little faster 
than before.  The initial motion estimate is 020/15 kt.  A turn to 
the east is expected in a couple of days when the tropical storm 
moves along the northern periphery of a subtropical ridge.  By the 
end of the week, however, Gaston is expected to stall to the west of 
the Azores in weak steering currents as high pressure builds near 
and to the north of the cyclone.  After that time, a turn to the 
northwest or north is expected as Gaston moves in the flow between 
Hurricane Fiona and the ridge.  The models have trended a little 
faster this cycle, and the NHC track forecast has been adjusted 
accordingly.

Gaston is currently moving over relatively warm water, in a region 
of upper-level diffluence within a somewhat favorable moist 
environment. These factors should allow the system to strengthen 
slowly during the next day or two.  However, after that time, 
much cooler SSTs, drier air, and an increase in westerly shear 
should end the strengthening trend.  The system is expected to 
become extratropical on Saturday when it moves over SSTs just 
above 20C and merges with a mid- to upper-level trough.  The NHC 
intensity forecast is about the same as the previous one and near 
the middle of the guidance envelope. 

Interests in the Azores should monitor the forecast for Gaston.
