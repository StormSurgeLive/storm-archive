DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Fiona was located
near latitude 18.0 North, longitude 68.1 West. Fiona is moving
toward the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A northwestward
motion is forecast to begin overnight and continue through Monday, 
followed by a turn toward the north-northwest on Tuesday.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Fiona will move over the eastern 
portions of the Dominican Republic tonight and Monday, and near or 
to the east of the Turks and Caicos Islands on Tuesday.

Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that the maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 
hours. 

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km). A wind gust of 58 mph (93 km/h) was recently measured at 
Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. 

The estimated minimum central pressure is 982 mb (29.00 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Fiona can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header
WTNT42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.

WIND:  Tropical storm and hurricane conditions are occurring on 
portions of Puerto Rico and will likely continue until Monday 
morning. Hurricane conditions are expected in portions of the 
eastern Dominican Republic later tonight and Monday, and in the 
Turks and Caicos on Tuesday. Hurricane conditions are possible 
within the hurricane watch area in the Dominican Republic late 
tonight and Monday.

Tropical storm conditions will continue to spread over portions of 
the Dominican Republic within the warning areas through Monday. 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the 
southeastern Bahamas by early Tuesday. Tropical storm conditions are 
possible across the watch area in the Dominican Republic tonight and 
Monday.

RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:

Leeward Islands: Additional 2 inches or less.

British and U.S. Virgin Islands: 4 to 6 inches, maximum of 10 inches
on St. Croix.

Puerto Rico: 12 to 20 inches with local maximum of 30 inches,
particularly across eastern and southern Puerto Rico.

Northern and Eastern Dominican Republic: 4 to 8 inches with local
maximum 12 inches, particularly along the northeast coast.

Rest of Dominican Republic and Haiti: 1 to 3 inches.

Turks and Caicos: 3 to 6 inches.

Southeast Bahamas: 1 to 3 inches.

These rains will continue to produce life-threatening and
catastrophic flash and urban flooding across Puerto Rico and the
eastern Dominican Republic, along with mudslides and landslides in
areas of higher terrain.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will 
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising 
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas
in areas of onshore winds if the peak surge occurs at the time of
high tide...

Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico to Guayama, Puerto Rico...1 to 2 ft

Localized coastal flooding is also possible elsewhere in Puerto
Rico.  For information specific to your area, please see products
issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office.

Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 3 to 5 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Dominican Republic.

Localized coastal flooding will be possible along the coasts of the
Turks and Caicos in areas of onshore winds Monday night into
Tuesday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Leeward Islands,
the northern Windward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the
northern coast of the Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos
Islands, and the southeastern Bahamas. These conditions could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
