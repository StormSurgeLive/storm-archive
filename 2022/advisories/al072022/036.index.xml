Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Fri Sep 23 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Fiona, located less than 200 miles west of Bermuda, and on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gaston, located less than 200 miles northwest of the central <br/>
Azores. <br/>
<br/>
Central Caribbean Sea:<br/>
Satellite imagery indicates that showers and thunderstorms have <br/>
increased and are showing signs of organization tonight with a <br/>
well-defined low pressure system located over the central Caribbean <br/>
Sea about 100 miles north-northeast of Curacao. Even though the <br/>
upper-level wind environment is currently only marginally favorable, <br/>
only a small additional increase in organization would result in the <br/>
formation of a tropical depression later today. The system is <br/>
expected to continue moving west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph <br/>
across the central and western Caribbean Sea.  Locally heavy <br/>
rainfall and gusty winds are likely to affect northwestern <br/>
Venezuela, the ABC island chain, and northeastern Colombia through <br/>
Friday.  Interests in Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, and western Cuba <br/>
should closely monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure, located roughly in between the Cabo <br/>
Verde islands to the east and the west coast of Africa, is producing <br/>
a large area of showers and thunderstorms. While this activity is <br/>
gradually becoming better organized, earlier satellite wind data <br/>
indicated the circulation remained fairly broad. Environmental <br/>
conditions are forecast to be generally conducive for some <br/>
development over the next day or so, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form by this weekend while the system moves northward at <br/>
about 10 mph, parallel to the coast of west Africa. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity remains disorganized association <br/>
with a broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands.  Despite marginal <br/>
environmental conditions, some slow development of this system <br/>
remains possible over the next several days while it drifts <br/>
northwestward or northward over the central tropical Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Fiona was located
near latitude 33.8 North, longitude 66.8 West. Fiona is moving
toward the north-northeast near 25 mph (41 km/h).  A north-northeast
or northeastward motion with an additional increase in forward 
speed is expected today.  Some reduction in forward speed with a 
turn toward the north is forecast tonight through Sunday.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Fiona will pass to the northwest of 
Bermuda during the next few hours.  Fiona's center will then 
approach Nova Scotia later today, move across Nova Scotia and into 
the Gulf of St. Lawrence on Saturday, and then across Labrador over 
the Labrador Sea on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Fiona is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some slight weakening is forecast today, 
however Fiona is forecast to be a large and powerful post-tropical 
cyclone with hurricane-force winds when it approaches and moves 
over Nova Scotia tonight and Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 345
miles (555 km). Elevated automated stations on Bermuda are reporting 
sustained winds between 65-70 mph (105-115 km/h), with a maximum 
wind gust of 93 mph (150 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 936 mb (27.64 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Fiona can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions continue on Bermuda, with
hurricane conditions expected during the next several hours.
Tropical storm conditions should diminish later during the day
today.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in portions of the hurricane
warning area in Canada by late tonight or early Saturday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the tropical
storm warning area in Canada by late today.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the watch area in Labrador on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
Bermuda: An additional 1 to 3 inches (25 to 75 mm).
 
Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and western Newfoundland: 3 to 6
inches (75 to 150 mm), with local maximum up to 10 inches (250 mm).
This rainfall could result in areas of flooding, some of which may
be significant in nature.
 
Newfoundland: 2 to 5 inches (50 to 125 mm).
 
Eastern Quebec: 2 to 5 inches (50 to 125 mm).
 
Eastern New Brunswick: 1 to 3 inches (25 to 75 mm).
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will cause elevated water levels along
the coast of Bermuda in areas of onshore winds beginning today.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
A dangerous storm surge could produce coastal flooding within the
warning areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of onshore winds. Near
the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive
waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Turks and
Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, the southeastern United States
coast, and Bermuda.  These swells will continue to spread
northwestward across the western Atlantic toward the mid-Atlantic
and northeast coasts of the United States and Atlantic Canada
today.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.

Hurricane Fiona Discussion Number  35
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
1100 PM AST Thu Sep 22 2022
 
Fiona's satellite appearance looks a little more asymmetric this
evening, with deep convection and upper-level outflow becoming more 
restricted on the western side.  That said, the hurricane has not 
yet lost any intensity.  An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter 
mission measured a peak 700-mb flight-level wind of 123 kt and SFMR 
winds as high as 110 kt, which support maintaining a 115-kt 
intensity on this advisory.  In addition, dropsonde data indicate 
that the central pressure has fallen further to 932 mb, and the 
SFMR instrument measured hurricane-force winds now extending 100 n 
mi to the southeast of the center.
 
The hurricane is still accelerating toward the north-northeast with
an initial motion estimate of 030/18 kt.  Fiona is getting closer
to a deep-layer trough currently located over the northeastern
United States, and this feature is expected to cause the hurricane
to speed up further during the next day or so, reaching peak speeds
of 30-35 kt by 24 hours as it approaches Nova Scotia.  Fiona should
merge with the trough soon after 24 hours, slow down a bit, but
continue moving northward across Atlantic Canada to the Labrador
Sea.  The previous official forecast appears on track based on the
latest guidance, and no significant changes were made to the new
forecast.
 
Fiona is forecast to remain over warm waters, including within the
Gulf Stream current, during the next 24 hours, although deep-layer
shear is forecast to increase substantially in 12-24 hours.  Given
the hurricane's current appearance, some gradual weakening is
anticipated during the next day or so.  Extratropical transition 
should begin on Friday, and that process is expected to be quick,
with Fiona becoming a warm-seclusion-type extratropical low Friday
night before the center reaches Nova Scotia.  Although continued
weakening is forecast thereafter, Fiona is expected to maintain
hurricane-force winds through 48 hours while it moves across the
Gulf of St. Lawrence.  Winds could drop below gale force by day 5
when the post-tropical low is over the Labrador Sea.  After 24
hours, the NHC intensity forecast is a blend of the GFS and ECMWF
global model solutions.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane conditions are expected on Bermuda overnight.
Conditions should diminish below tropical storm force during the
day on Friday.
 
2. Fiona is expected to affect portions of Atlantic Canada as a
powerful hurricane-force cyclone late Friday and Saturday, and
significant impacts from high winds, storm surge, and heavy rainfall
are likely. Hurricane and Tropical Storm Warnings have now been 
issued for much of Atlantic Canada.
 
3. Large swells generated by Fiona are expected to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along much of the
east coast of the United States, the Bahamas, Bermuda, and Atlantic
Canada during the next few days.

<title>Tropical Storm Gaston Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
300 AM GMT Fri Sep 23 2022
 
Gaston's cloud pattern is showing signs of disruption by westerly 
shear with the center located near the western edge of the main 
area of convection.  This was confirmed by a recent scatterometer 
overpass, which showed that the intensity was, somewhat 
surprisingly, still near 55 kt.  This intensity is also in 
agreement with a Dvorak classification from TAFB, and so the 
advisory's initial wind speed is held at that value.

The storm has continued to slow its forward speed, with the latest 
initial motion estimated to be eastward at around 10 kt.  
During the next day or so, Gaston is expected to move on a 
clockwise loop along the southern side of a blocking mid-level 
ridge.  The official track forecast follows the multi-model 
consensus prediction.  This is fairly close to the previous NHC 
forecast, except shifted a little northward in the latter part of 
the period.

Gaston is expected to remain in an environment of dry air, over 
relatively cool SSTs, and under the influence of strong westerly 
shear for the next couple of days.  These factors should lead to 
gradual weakening and loss of tropical characteristics in 48 hours 
or so.  The official intensity forecast is similar to the previous 
one and is close to the latest Decay-SHIPS prediction.


Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of the 
western Azores, and will likely spread to the central Azores later 
today.
 
2. Gaston is expected to produce heavy rainfall over the western and 
central Azores today into Saturday. This rainfall may result in 
landslides and areas of flooding.
