800 AM EDT Tue Sep 20 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Fiona, located near the Turks and Caicos islands.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic:<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity continues to become better <br/>
organized in association with an area of low pressure located over <br/>
the central subtropical Atlantic, about 950 miles west-southwest of <br/>
the westernmost Azores.   Environmental conditions appear marginally <br/>
favorable for additional development, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form within the next day or so before upper-level winds <br/>
become less conducive later this week.  The system should move <br/>
generally northward or northeastward while remaining over the open <br/>
waters of central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located several hundred miles east of the Windward <br/>
Islands is producing a broad area of disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms while moving westward at 15-20 mph.  Gradual <br/>
development of this system is forecast during the next several days <br/>
as the system approaches the Windward Islands, and a tropical <br/>
depression could form by the latter part of this week as the system <br/>
moves into the eastern and central Caribbean sea. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Fiona was located 
by an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 21.6 North, 
longitude 71.2 West.  Fiona is moving toward the north-northwest 
near 10 mph (17 km/h).  This general motion is expected to continue 
through today, followed by a turn toward the north tonight or 
Wednesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Fiona will continue 
to move near Grand Turk and the other eastern Turks and Caicos 
during the next few hours.  
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Fiona is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Strengthening is forecast during the next
couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150
miles (240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure from Air Force Reserve and 
NOAA Hurricane Hunter data is 960 mb (28.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Fiona can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header
WTNT42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are occurring over the Turks and Caicos 
at this time, and these conditions should persist through this
morning.
 
Tropical storm conditions should be spreading over portions of 
the southeastern Bahamas through this morning.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands: Additional local 1 to 2 inches over
the next 24 hours.
 
Southern Puerto Rico: Additional local 1 to 4 inches over the next
24 hours. Storm Total 12 to 20 inches with local maximum of 35
inches.
 
Northern Puerto Rico: Additional local 1 to 2 inches over the next
24 hours. Storm Total 4 to 12 inches with local maximum of 20
inches.
 
Dominican Republic: Additional 1 to 4 inches with local maximum of 6
inches over the next 24 hours. Storm Total up to 20 inches in the
eastern section.
 
Turks and Caicos: Additional 4 to 8 inches.
 
Southeast Bahamas: 1 to 4 inches.
 
Heavy rainfall and localized life-threatening flash flooding
continues over portions of the Dominican Republic today. Heavy rains
around the center of Fiona impacts the Turks and Caicos through this
afternoon with continued life-threatening flooding. Localized
additional flash and urban flooding is possible in southern portions
of Puerto Rico.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 5 to 8 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Turks and Caicos through today.
 
Localized coastal flooding is possible for the Southeastern Bahamas
in areas of onshore winds through today.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Virgin Islands,
Puerto Rico, the northern coast of Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos
Islands, and the southeastern Bahamas.  These swells will continue
to spread westward across the southwestern Atlantic toward the
central and northwestern Bahamas and the east coast of the United
States through midweek.  The swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Hurricane Fiona Forecast Discussion Number 24</title>

Hurricane Fiona Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
500 AM EDT Tue Sep 20 2022

A few hours ago, an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
reported that the central pressure of Fiona had dropped to 967 mb, 
and that the 700-mb flight-level winds were near 95 kt.  In 
addition, the aircraft also reported surface winds estimates from 
the SFMR of 100-105 kt.  The various satellite intensity estimates 
are in the 100-115 kt range, and based on these data the initial 
intensity was increased to 100 kt.  This makes Fiona the first major 
hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season.  It should be noted 
that since the aircraft left the storm, the eye has become less 
distinct in satellite imagery.  NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft are scheduled to investigate Fiona before 12Z to 
see how much, if any, additional strengthening has occurred.

While Fiona has strengthened, satellite imagery continues to show 
restricted outflow in the western semicircle, likely due to 
continued southwesterly vertical wind shear.  While some shear 
should continue through 72 h, it appears it will not be strong 
enough to prevent additional intensification, and Fiona is likely to 
become a category 4 hurricane during this time.  After 72 h, the 
hurricane will interact with a powerful mid-latitude trough moving 
into the Atlantic from the eastern United States.  This should start 
the process of extratropical transition by 96 h, with the transition 
complete by the end of the forecast period.  Fiona is expected to 
remain intense through much of the transition, with the GFS, ECMWF, 
and UKMET forecasting 85-95 kt winds and unusually low central 
pressures at 96 h.

Fiona has moved northwestward during the past several hours, but a 
longer-term motion is north-northwestward or 330/9 kt.  There is no 
change in the track forecast philosophy, as during the next 
48-60 h the hurricane should gradually turn north while moving 
around the western periphery of a mid-level ridge. After that,
Fiona is forecast to turn north-northeastward and accelerate as it 
interacts with the aforementioned strong mid-latitude trough, with 
a northward motion expected after the cyclone completes 
extratropical transition.  The track guidance, while remaining 
tightly clustered, has shifted a little westward during the first 
72 h, and this part of the new forecast track is nudged a little 
westward as well.  
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Outer bands from Fiona will continue to produce heavy rain over 
mostly coastal and eastern sections of the Dominican Republic and in 
local portions of southern Puerto Rico over the next 24 hours as 
Fiona moves north-northwest over the southwest Atlantic Ocean. Heavy 
rainfall and localized life-threatening flash flooding will continue 
over portions of the Dominican Republic today. Heavy rains around 
the center of Fiona will impact the Turks and Caicos through this 
afternoon with continued life-threatening flooding. Localized 
additional flash and urban flooding is possible in the southern 
portion of Puerto Rico.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are spreading over the Turks and Caicos 
islands, while tropical storm conditions should spread over the 
southeastern Bahamas during the next few hours.
 
3. Interests in Bermuda should continue to monitor the progress of 
Fiona.
