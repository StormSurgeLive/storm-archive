DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fiona was
located near latitude 17.2 North, longitude 66.1 West.  Fiona is
moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A
northwestward motion is expected to begin later today and continue
through Monday, followed by a turn toward the north-northwest on
Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Fiona will approach
Puerto Rico this morning, and move near or over Puerto Rico this
afternoon or evening.  Fiona will then move near the northern coast
of the Dominican Republic tonight and Monday, and near or to the
east of the Turks and Caicos Islands on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast, and 
Fiona is expected to become a hurricane before reaching the southern 
or southwestern coast of Puerto Rico later today.  Additional 
strengthening is expected on Monday and Tuesday while Fiona moves 
near the Dominican Republic and over the southwestern Atlantic.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.  A weather station at Yabucoa-El Negro in Puerto 
Rico recently reported a sustained wind of 45 mph (72 km/h) and a 
gust to 54 mph (87 km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft observations is 991 mb (29.26 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Fiona can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header
WTNT42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected on Puerto Rico today, and
are expected in portions of the eastern Dominican Republic tonight
and Monday.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the U.S. Virgin
Islands this morning.  Hurricane conditions are possible within the
hurricane watch area in the Dominican Republic tonight and Monday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are occurring in the U.S. and British
Virgin Islands and are spreading westward across Puerto Rico. These
conditions are expected to reach portions of the Dominican Republic
later today.  Tropical storm conditions are possible across the 
watch area in the Dominican Republic tonight, and in the Turks and 
Caicos Islands and southeastern Bahamas by early Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
Leeward Islands: Additional 2 inches or less.
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands: 4 to 6 inches, maximum of 10 inches
on St. Croix.
 
Puerto Rico: 12 to 16 inches with local maximum of 25 inches,
particularly across eastern and southern Puerto Rico.
 
Northern and Eastern Dominican Republic: 4 to 8 inches with local
maximum 12 inches, particularly near the far east coast.
 
Rest of Dominican Republic and Haiti: 1 to 3 inches.
 
Turks and Caicos: 3 to 6 inches.
 
These rains will produce life-threatening flash flooding and urban
flooding across Puerto Rico and the eastern Dominican Republic,
along with mudslides and landslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas
in areas of onshore winds if the peak surge occurs at the time of
high tide...
 
Southern coast of Puerto Rico...1 to 3 ft
Vieques and Culebra...1 to 3 ft
U.S. Virgin Islands...1 to 2 ft
 
Localized coastal flooding is also possible elsewhere in Puerto
Rico.  For information specific to your area, please see products
issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Dominican Republic.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Leeward Islands,
the northern Windward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the
northern coast of the Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos
Islands, and the southeastern Bahamas. These conditions could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Fiona Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
500 AM AST Sun Sep 18 2022
 
Fiona has continued to show signs of better organization in Doppler 
radar data from San Juan this morning, and earlier data from an Air 
Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the storm has indeed 
strengthened. The aircraft reported peak flight-level (700 mb) winds 
of 57 kt, along with several instances of SFMR winds greater than 50 
kt and a peak of 57 kt in the northeastern quadrant of the storm. 
Also, a center dropsonde indicated that the minimum pressure had 
fallen a few millibars to 994 mb. Based on these data, the initial 
intensity is raised to 55 kt for this advisory.

After a brief northward jog last night, the center of Fiona appears 
to have resumed a more west-northwestward heading (290/7 kt). The 
storm is expected to turn northwestward later today, which should 
bring the center of Fiona near or over the southwestern portion of 
Puerto Rico this afternoon and near the northern coast of the 
Dominican Republic early Monday. Then, a mid-level trough over the 
southwestern Atlantic is forecast to induce a weakness in the 
steering ridge early next week. This should enable Fiona to turn 
slowly northward by midweek while it passes near or to the east of 
the Turks and Caicos Islands. An acceleration to the north and 
north-northeast is forecast by late in the week as Fiona moves 
within the flow ahead of an amplifying mid- to upper-level trough. 
The models are tightly clustered throughout the forecast period and 
no major changes were made to the NHC track forecast, which still 
lies close to the consensus aids near the center of the guidance 
envelope.  
 
Moderate southwesterly to westerly shear appears likely to continue 
affecting Fiona during the next several days. However, very warm 
sea-surface temperatures and sufficient mid-level moisture are still 
expected to allow for some intensification as Fiona approaches 
Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. The NHC forecast calls for 
Fiona to become a hurricane later today before it moves near or over 
Puerto Rico. Once the cyclone moves away from land and reaches the 
southwestern Atlantic, more significant strengthening is forecast in 
agreement with the consensus of the intensity guidance. The latest 
NHC intensity forecast has been raised from 48 h through the end of 
the forecast period, but still lies slightly below the IVCN and HCCA 
aids. Fiona could reach major hurricane strength by late this week 
over the western Atlantic.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Hurricane conditions are expected across portions of Puerto Rico 
today, and are expected in portions of the Dominican Republic 
tonight and Monday. Tropical storm conditions are occurring across 
the U.S. and British Virgin Islands and are spreading westward 
across Puerto Rico. Tropical storm conditions will reach the 
Dominican Republic later today and tonight.
 
2. Heavy rains from Fiona will continue across Puerto Rico through 
tonight and occur over the Dominican Republic later today into 
Monday. These rainfall amounts will produce life-threatening flash 
floods and urban flooding across Puerto Rico and portions of the 
eastern Dominican Republic, along with mudslides and landslides in 
areas of higher terrain.
 
3. Fiona is forecast to strengthen after moving away from Puerto 
Rico and the Dominican Republic. Tropical storm conditions are 
possible in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern 
Bahamas by late Monday or early Tuesday, and a Tropical Storm Watch 
has been issued for these locations.
