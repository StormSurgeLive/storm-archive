DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fiona was
located by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near 
latitude 15.8 North, longitude 58.8 West. Fiona is moving toward the 
west near 15 mph (24 km/h). A westward motion with a gradual 
decrease in forward speed is expected through Saturday night or 
early Sunday, followed by a turn toward the west-northwest later on 
Sunday. On the forecast track, the center of Fiona is expected to 
move across the Leeward Islands tonight and early Saturday, and move 
near or just south of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico late 
Saturday into Sunday.

Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that maximum 
sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some slight strengthening is forecast during the next few days.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).

possible within the watch area across the Virgin Islands on Saturday 
and in Puerto Rico late Saturday or Saturday night.

RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall

Leeward Islands and Northern Windward Islands: 3 to 6 inches.

particularly across eastern and southern Puerto Rico.

Eastern Dominican Republic: 6 to 10 inches with maximum totals of 16 
inches possible

These rains may produce flash and urban flooding, along with 
mudslides in areas of higher terrain, particularly southern and 
eastern Puerto Rico and the eastern Dominican Republic. 

STORM SURGE:  Localized coastal flooding will be possible along the
coasts of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico in areas of
onshore winds Saturday into Sunday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Leeward Islands,
and are expected to spread westward to the Virgin Islands and Puerto
Rico today and Saturday. These conditions could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
