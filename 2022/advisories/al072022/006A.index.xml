DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fiona was
located near latitude 16.1 North, longitude 56.1 West.  Fiona is
moving toward the west near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A westward motion
with some decrease in forward speed is expected through Saturday
night, with a turn toward the west-northwest possible on Sunday.  On
the forecast track, the center of Fiona is expected to move across
the Leeward Islands Friday night and early Saturday, and move near
the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico late Saturday into Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast during the next few
days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected across portions of
the northern Leeward Islands within the warning area beginning
Friday evening.  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the
watch area across the Virgin Islands on Saturday and in Puerto Rico 
late Saturday or Saturday night.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is expected to produce the following rainfall
totals:
 
Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto 
Rico:  4 to 6 inches with isolated maximum totals of 10
inches across eastern Puerto Rico.
 
Eastern Hispaniola: 4 to 8 inches with isolated maximum totals of
12 inches.
 
These rains may produce flash and urban flooding, along with
isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain. Considerable flood
impacts are possible across eastern portions of Puerto Rico.
 
STORM SURGE:  Localized coastal flooding will be possible along the
coasts of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico in areas of
onshore winds Saturday into Sunday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Leeward Islands, 
and are expected to spread westward to the Virgin Islands 
and Puerto Rico on Friday and Saturday. These conditions could 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Tropical Storm Fiona Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Fiona Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
500 PM AST Thu Sep 15 2022
 
Deep convection has been sheared more than a degree to the east of
the center for much of the day, and as a result, the low-level
center and circulation have become slightly less defined and
elongated, respectively.  That said, an Air Force Reserve Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft measured a peak 925-mb flight-level wind of 65 kt 
and SFMR winds as high as 46 kt.  Assuming some undersampling of 
the surface winds, the initial intensity is set at 50 kt.  This is 
in agreement with ASCAT-C data from earlier today, which showed an 
area of 45-50 kt winds to the northeast of the center.
 
Fiona appears to have lost a little bit of latitude since earlier
this morning, but the motion remains westward, or 270 degrees at 12
kt.  Track models are in good agreement during the next 2 to 3
days, showing a low- to mid-level ridge steering Fiona westward
across the Leeward Islands and over the far northeastern Caribbean
Sea through Sunday.  The HWRF is the only outlier during this
period and appears to have a track too far to the north due to an
unrealistically high intensity.  After day 3, there is more
divergence among the track models, with the stronger solutions
(i.e., the GFS) indicating a sharper northwestward turn toward a
weakness in the subtropical ridge.  The weaker solutions (i.e., the
ECMWF and HMON) keep Fiona on a westward or west-northwestward
track, moving near or over Hispaniola.  As a result, the 4- and
5-day forecasts are of lower-than-normal confidence, and ensembles
from the main global models suggest that the cyclone could end up 
anywhere from eastern Cuba to well to the northeast of the
Bahamas by the end of the forecast period.  For now, the official
track forecast is nudged southward and westward from the previous
forecast, accounting for the adjusted initial position and the
overall trend in the track guidance.
 
Moderate, and even possibly strong, westerly shear is likely to 
continue for much of the 5-day forecast period.  Given these 
conditions, the NHC intensity forecast flatlines Fiona's intensity 
at 50 kt for the next 60 hours, with the caveat that fluctuations 
are possible related to the convective structure of the cyclone at 
any time.  Fiona is forecast to slow down by the 3-5 day time 
frame, and the slower motion could allow for the circulation to 
become more vertically stacked, even in the face of continued 
shear.  As a result, some gradual strengthening is indicated at the 
latter part of the forecast period.  Given uncertainties in how 
much Fiona might interact with the islands of the Greater Antilles, 
the NHC intensity forecast lies about 5-10 kt below the IVCN and 
HCCA consensus aids.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Leeward Islands 
within the warning area by Friday evening.  Tropical storm 
conditions are possible within the watch area across the Virgin 
Islands beginning on Saturday, and then reaching Puerto Rico late 
Saturday and Saturday night.
 
2. Heavy rains from Fiona will reach the northern Leeward Islands 
Friday afternoon, spreading to the British and U.S. Virgin Islands 
and Puerto Rico Saturday into Sunday morning, and reaching eastern 
Hispaniola Sunday.  This rainfall may produce flash and urban 
flooding, along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain. 
Considerable flood impacts are possible across eastern portions of 
Puerto Rico.
 
3. Fiona is expected to move near Hispaniola early next week, and 
watches could be required for parts of the island on Friday.
