DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fiona was
located near latitude 16.7 North, longitude 64.6 West. Fiona is
moving toward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this
motion is expected to continue through tonight.  A northwestward
motion is forecast to begin on Sunday and continue through Tuesday.
On the forecast track, the center of Fiona will move south of the
U.S. Virgin Islands this evening, approach Puerto Rico tonight, and
move across Puerto Rico by Sunday afternoon.  Fiona will then
offshore of the Dominican Republic on Monday and near or to the
east of the Turks and Caicos Islands on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast, and Fiona is expected to become a
hurricane before reaching the southern coast of Puerto Rico on
Sunday.  Additional strengthening is expected on Monday and Tuesday
while Fiona moves over the southwestern Atlantic.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.  NOAA buoy 42060 east-southeast of Fiona's center 
recently reported a sustained wind of 45 mph (72 km/h) and a gust to 
51 mph (83 km/h).  A station at Teagues Bay, St. Croix, recently 
reported a sustained wind of 36 mph (57 km/h) and a gust to 44 mph 
(70 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Fiona can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header
WTNT42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected on Puerto Rico Sunday and
are possible in the U.S. Virgin Islands tonight.  Hurricane
conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area in the
Dominican Republic Sunday night and Monday.
 
Tropical storm conditions will continue across portions of the
Leeward Islands within the warning area through this evening.
Tropical storm conditions are beginning to reach the U.S. and
British Virgin Islands, and will spread westward across Puerto Rico
this evening and tonight and portions of the Dominican
Republic late Sunday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible across
the watch area in the Dominican Republic Sunday night.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
Leeward Islands and Northern Windward Islands: Additional 2 to 4
inches.
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands: 4 to 6 inches with local maximum of
10 inches possible.
 
Puerto Rico: 12 to 16 inches with local maximum of 20 inches
possible, particularly across eastern and southern Puerto Rico.
 
Dominican Republic: 4 to 8 inches with local maximum of 12 inches
possible, particularly on the far eastern coast.
 
Haiti: 1 to 3 inches with isolated maximum totals of 4 inches.
 
Turks and Caicos: 4 to 6 inches.
 
These rains are likely to produce life-threatening flash flooding
and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain,
particularly in portions of Puerto Rico and the eastern Dominican
Republic.
 
Very heavy rains and flooding have occurred over portions of the
Leeward Islands since Friday.  A station at St. Claude Matouba Irfa,
in the mountains in southwestern Guadeloupe, recently measured a
24-hour rainfall total of 19.85 inches (504.2 mm).
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas
in areas of onshore winds if the peak surge occurs at the time of
high tide...
 
Southern coast of Puerto Rico...1 to 3 ft
Vieques and Culebra...1 to 3 ft
U.S. Virgin Islands...1 to 2 ft
 
Localized coastal flooding is also possible elsewhere in Puerto
Rico.  For information specific to your area, please see products
issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Dominican Republic.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Leeward Islands,
the northern Windward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the
northern coast of the Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos
Islands, and the southeastern Bahamas.  These conditions could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Tropical Storm Fiona Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
500 PM AST Sat Sep 17 2022
 
After going through a bit of a re-organization this morning,
Fiona's structure appears to be improving again.  Visible satellite
images show an elongated band of deep convection wrapping around
the center from north to east to southwest, and WSR-88D Doppler
radar from San Juan, Puerto Rico, suggests that a better-defined
center of circulation has developed.  A 1707 UTC AMSR-2 microwave
pass also shows that a mid-level eye feature may be developing.
The last Air Force Reserve reconnaissance mission from a few hours
ago found that the central pressure had fallen back down to 1002 mb,
but maximum winds still appeared to be around 50 kt.  The next
reconnaissance mission is scheduled for this evening.
 
Fiona's motion today has been discontinuous due to the storm's
center re-formation, but the smoothed longer-term motion is now
west-northwestward, or 285/8 kt.  This general motion is expected
to continue through tonight, with Fiona expected to turn
northwestward on Sunday as it begins to move around the western
periphery of the subtropical ridge.  A turn toward the
north-northwest is expected by Monday night, followed by a
northward and north-northeastward acceleration over the western
Atlantic by Thursday.  In general, the new NHC forecast is close to
the TVCN and HCCA consensus aids, in the middle of the guidance
envelope.  This prediction is a little bit north of this morning's
forecast during the first 24 to 36 hours, mainly accounting for
Fiona's adjusted initial position.  After 36 hours, the track
forecast is not too different from earlier.
 
Since the new track forecast has the center of Fiona reaching
Puerto Rico in about 24 hours, the window for strengthening is less
than it was earlier today.  However, the NHC intensity forecast is
near the IVCN and HCCA consensus aids and suggests that Fiona will
be at or near hurricane intensity before moving across Puerto Rico
on Sunday.  If the center does cross Puerto Rico, that could halt
intensification, or cause some slight weakening, but Fiona is
expected to go through a more significant strengthening phase once
it's over the western Atlantic.  The forecast shows Fiona just
below major hurricane intensity by day 5, although it should be
mentioned that this prediction is slightly below the consensus aids.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Hurricane conditions are expected across portions of Puerto
Rico on Sunday, and are possible across the U.S. Virgin Islands
tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are now spreading westward
across the U.S. and British Virgin Islands and will spread
across Puerto Rico this evening and tonight.  Tropical storm
conditions will reach the Dominican Republic by late Sunday.
 
2. Heavy rains from Fiona will spread west to the British and U.S.
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico today, the Dominican Republic Sunday,
and the Turks and Caicos Monday night. These rainfall amounts are
expected to produce life-threatening flash floods and urban
flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain,
especially across portions of Puerto Rico and the Dominican
Republic.
 
3. Fiona is forecast to strengthen after moving away from Puerto
Rico and past the Dominican Republic on Monday, and interests in the
Turks and Caicos Islands and southeastern Bahamas should continue to
monitor forecasts for the storm.
