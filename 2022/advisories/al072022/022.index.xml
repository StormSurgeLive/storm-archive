<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Fiona, located near the northern coast of the Dominican Republic.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic:<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity has changed little since yesterday <br/>
evening in association with an area of low pressure located over the <br/>
central subtropical Atlantic.  Some slow development, however, is <br/>
possible during the next couple of days before environmental <br/>
conditions become less conducive later this week.  The system should <br/>
generally move northward or northeastward while remaining over the <br/>
open central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located several hundred miles east of the Windward <br/>
Islands is producing an area of disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms.  Some gradual development of this system is possible <br/>
during the next several days while the system approaches the <br/>
Windward Islands toward the end of the week and moves over the <br/>
eastern Caribbean sea over the weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Fiona was located
near latitude 20.1 North, longitude 69.8 West. Fiona is moving
toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  This general motion
is expected to continue through tonight, followed by a turn toward
the north-northwest on Tuesday and to the north on Wednesday.  On
the forecast track, the center of Fiona will pass near or to the
east of the Turks and Caicos on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 100 mph (155 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Steady strengthening is expected during the 
next couple of days, and Fiona is forecast to become a major 
hurricane on Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 972 mb (28.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Fiona can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header
WTNT42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the Turks and Caicos
beginning late tonight or early Tuesday.  Hurricane conditions
are possible within the hurricane watch area in the Dominican
Republic tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions will continue over portions of the
Dominican Republic within the warning area tonight.  Tropical
storm conditions are expected in portions of the southeastern
Bahamas by early Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands: Additional 2 to 4 inches.  Storm
Total up to 10 inches on St. Croix.
 
Southern Puerto Rico: Additional 4 to 8 inches with local maximum of
15 inches.  Storm Total 12 to 20 inches with local maximum of over
30 inches.
 
Northern Puerto Rico: Additional 1 to 4 inches with local maximum of
6 inches.  Storm Total 4 to 12 inches with local maximum of 20
inches.
 
Northern and Eastern Dominican Republic: Additional 4 to 8 inches
with local maximum of 10 inches.  Storm Total up to 20 inches in
the eastern section.
 
Rest of Dominican Republic and Eastern Haiti: 3 to 6 inches.
 
Turks and Caicos: 4 to 8 inches.
 
Southeast Bahamas: 1 to 3 inches.
 
These rains will continue to produce life-threatening and
catastrophic flooding along with mudslides and landslides across
Puerto Rico.  Life-threatening flash and urban flooding is likely
for eastern portions of the Dominican Republic.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.
 
Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Dominican Republic.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3 to 5 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Turks and Caicos Monday night into Tuesday.
 
Localized coastal flooding is possible for the Southeastern Bahamas
in areas of onshore winds Monday night into Tuesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Virgin Islands,
Puerto Rico, the northern coast of Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos
Islands, and the southeastern Bahamas.  These swells will continue
to spread westward across the southwestern Atlantic toward the
central and northwestern Bahamas and the east coast of the United
States through midweek.  The swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Fiona Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
1100 AM AST Mon Sep 19 2022
 
The center of the hurricane is moving off the northern coast of the 
Dominican Republic near eastern Samana Bay.  High-resolution 
visible satellite imagery from the GOES-16 mesoscale sector show a 
well-organized system, but the eye is currently cloud-filled.  The 
current intensity and central pressure, 75 kt and 980 mb, are based 
on the assumption of some weakening and filling due to Fiona's 
interaction with the land mass of eastern Hispaniola.  An Air Force 
Reserve Unit reconnaissance aircraft is scheduled to investigate 
the hurricane tonight, assuming that the cyclone will have moved 
far enough offshore over the waters of the southwestern Atlantic. 
 
Fiona is moving northwestward, or at about 310/7 kt.  The system is
moving along the southwestern periphery of a mid-level high
pressure area over the subtropical Atlantic.  During the next 2-3
days, the hurricane should gradually turn toward the
north-northwest and north as it rounds the western side of the
high.  Later in the forecast period, a large and strong trough
moving over the northeastern United States should cause Fiona to
accelerate northeastward and north-northeastward.  The official
track forecast remains in agreement with the previous NHC solutions
and is close to both the simple and corrected dynamical model
consensus predictions.

Moderate vertical shear associated with southwesterly upper-level 
flow over Fiona is likely to prevail during the next few days.  
However, this shear is not expected to be strong enough to offset 
the favorable thermodynamics over the southwestern Atlantic.  The 
official forecast shows steady strengthening with Fiona becoming 
a major hurricane within the next couple of days.  This is in 
line with the latest intensity model guidance and also similar to 
the previous NHC forecasts.
  
As the hurricane accelerates deeper into the mid-latitudes and 
begins interacting with the strong trough to its west, it is 
expected to begin extratropical transition by day 5, although the 
process will likely not be completed until after the end of the 
forecast period.
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Heavy rains from Fiona will continue to produce life- 
threatening and catastrophic flooding along with mudslides and 
landslides across Puerto Rico through tonight. Life-threatening 
flash and urban flooding is likely for eastern portions of the 
Dominican Republic through early Tuesday.

2. Hurricane conditions are occuring across portions of the
Dominican Republic within the warning area. Tropical storm
conditions will continue on Puerto Rico through this afternoon and
over portions of the Dominican Republic within the warning area
through tonight.
 
3. Fiona is forecast to strengthen after moving away from Puerto
Rico and the Dominican Republic. Hurricane conditions are expected
in the Turks and Caicos on Tuesday, and tropical storm conditions
are expected in the southeastern Bahamas by late Monday or early
Tuesday.
