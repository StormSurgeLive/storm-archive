For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Julia, located over the extreme eastern portion of the <br/>
Pacific basin near the southern coast of Central America.<br/>
<br/>
Off the coast of Central America and Southern Mexico:<br/>
Tropical Storm Julia is forecast to dissipate near the southern <br/>
coast of Central America over the next 12 to 24 hours. Afterwards, <br/>
its broader remnants could help generate a new surface low pressure <br/>
area offshore of the coast of southern Mexico in a couple of days. <br/>
Environmental conditions could support some gradual development of <br/>
this new system by the middle to latter part of this week. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Warning for the Pacific coast of Nicaragua.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Pacific coast of Honduras
* Coast of El Salvador
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Pacific coast of Guatemala
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Julia was 
located near latitude 13.4 North, longitude 89.2 West. Julia is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue through today. On the 
forecast track, the center of Julia will move near or over the 
coasts of El Salvador and Guatemala today.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast, and Julia is expected to become a tropical
depression later today and dissipate by tonight.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center. The El Salvador International Airport recently
reported a sustained wind of 28 mph (44 km/h) and a gust of 41 mph 
(67 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches) 
based on surface observations.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Julia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP3 and WMO header WTPZ43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP3.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue over portions of the
warning area along the Pacific coast of Honduras and El Salvador for
the next few hours. Tropical storm conditions are possible along the
Pacific coast of Guatemala this morning.
 
RAINFALL:  Julia is expected to produce the following rainfall
accumulations through Tuesday:
 
El Salvador and southern Guatemala...5 to 10 inches, isolated 15
inches.
Western Honduras and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico...3 to 6
inches, isolated 10 inches.
Belize, remainder of Honduras, and northern Guatemala...additional
1 to 2 inches, isolated storm total of 10 inches
Nicaragua...additional 1 to 2 inches, isolated storm total of 15
inches
Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico...additional 1 to 3 inches, isolated
storm total of 6 inches
 
This rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides
across Central America today. Flash flooding is anticipated across
the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico through Tuesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Julia continue to affect Providencia and
San Andres Islands and the Caribbean coast of Central America, but
should gradually subside today. Swells not caused by Julia are
expected to affect the Pacific coast of Central America during the
next couple of days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 AM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

Tropical Storm Julia Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP182022
400 AM CDT Mon Oct 10 2022
 
GOES-16 proxy-visible satellite data and surface observations from 
the El Salvador International Airport suggest the center of Julia is 
passing very near the coast of El Salvador this morning. A band of 
deep convection has persisted over the southern and eastern portions 
of the circulation, where tropical-storm-force winds are thought to 
still be occurring. Unfortunately, overnight ASCAT data swaths 
missed capturing Julia's wind field, and there have not been any 
recent high-resolution passive microwave overpasses to assess the 
structure of the cyclone. The initial intensity is held at 35 kt for 
this advisory, based on a T2.5/35 kt Dvorak intensity estimate from 
TAFB.
 
The initial motion of Julia is west-northwestward at 290/13 kt, and
this general motion is expected to continue today as the cyclone is
steered by a ridge to the north. Weakening is expected as the center
moves near or over the coast of Central America, and Julia is
forecast to become a tropical depression later today and dissipate
by tonight. However, it is possible that the surface circulation
dissipates even sooner than forecast once it moves over the rugged
terrain of Central America. Regardless, heavy rainfall is likely to
continue over portions of Central America through today.
 
Although Julia is forecast to dissipate by tonight, residual
moisture and vorticity associated with its remnants could become
absorbed within a broader cyclonic envelope to the west, associated
with an ongoing Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind event. For information
on the potential for new development offshore of southern Mexico
later this week, please see the latest eastern North Pacific
Tropical Weather Outlook.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions will continue this morning over 
portions of the coasts of Honduras and El Salvador within the 
warning area. Tropical storm conditions are possible today along the 
Pacific coast of Guatemala.
 
2. Life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides are expected across
portions of Central America today. Flash flooding is anticipated
across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico through Tuesday.
