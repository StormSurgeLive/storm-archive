Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 AM PDT Mon Oct 10 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Julia, located inland over southern Guatemala.<br/>
<br/>
Near the coast of Southern Mexico: <br/>
Tropical Depression Julia is forecast to dissipate inland over <br/>
Guatemala later today or tonight. A portion of its remnants are <br/>
expected to move westward and could contribute to the formation of <br/>
a new area of low pressure just south of the coast of southern <br/>
Mexico in another day or two. Some subsequent gradual development <br/>
of the new system will be possible while it moves generally <br/>
westward to west-northwestward near the coast of Mexico through the <br/>
end of the week. Regardless of development, heavy rainfall <br/>
associated with the remnants of Julia interacting with a broader <br/>
area of low pressure will likely cause flash flooding and mudslides <br/>
across portions of southern Mexico and northern Central America <br/>
during the next few days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

Remnants Of Julia Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP182022
400 PM CDT Mon Oct 10 2022

Surface observations and satellite imagery indicate that the 
low-level circulation of Julia has opened up into a trough of low 
pressure extending from offshore of Guatemala to extreme 
southeastern Mexico.  Thus it is no longer a tropical cyclone, and 
this is the last advisory.  The wind speed is set to 25 kt 
based on earlier scatterometer data on the fringe of the 
system.  The main hazard with the remnants of Julia is heavy 
rainfall, which is likely to continue over portions of Central 
America today and southern Mexico through tomorrow.

The remnants of Julia could also contribute to a new tropical 
cyclone development offshore of southern Mexico later this week, so 
please see the latest eastern North Pacific Tropical Weather Outlook 
for further details.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. The threat of flash flooding continues across the Isthmus of 
Tehuantepec in Mexico through Tuesday.  Across Central America, the 
flash flooding risk is decreasing, but some areas of additional 
flooding remain possible.
