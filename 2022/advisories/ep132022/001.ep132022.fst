DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK

At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression
Thirteen-E was located near latitude 12.7 North, longitude 95.4
West. The depression is moving toward the northwest near 3 mph 
(6 km/h).  A northwestward motion with an increase in forward speed 
is expected over the next couple of days.  On the forecast track, 
the center of the cyclone is expected to approach the southern 
coast of Mexico within the watch area on Saturday. 

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, 
and the depression is forecast to become a tropical storm tonight 
or Friday. 

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  The system is expected to produce rainfall totals of 
3-6 inches with isolated maximum totals of 10 inches across coastal 
portions of the Mexican States of Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Michoac√°n 
through Sunday morning. These rains may produce flash and urban 
flooding, along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain 
near the coast. 

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area beginning early Saturday.

SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are expected to begin
affecting portions of the coast of southern Mexico by late Friday
