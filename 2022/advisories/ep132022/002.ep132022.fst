DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression
Thirteen-E was located near latitude 12.8 North, longitude 95.8
West.  The depression is moving toward the northwest near 3 mph (6
km/h).  A northwestward motion with an increase in forward speed is
expected over the next couple of days.  On the forecast track, the
center of the cyclone is expected to move near or over the coast of 
southwestern Mexico Saturday or Saturday night.

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, 
and the depression is forecast to become a tropical storm tonight 
or Friday.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  The system is expected to produce rainfall totals of 3-6 
inches with local totals of 10 inches across coastal portions of the 
Mexican States of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoac√°n, Colima, and possibly 
Jalisco through Sunday. These rains may produce flash and urban 
flooding, along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain 
near the coast. 

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area beginning early Saturday.

SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are expected to begin
affecting portions of the coast of southern Mexico by late Friday
and continue into the weekend.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
