HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Lester can be found in the Tropical 
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP3 and WMO header

RAINFALL:  The system is expected to produce rainfall totals of 3-6
inches with local totals of 10 inches across coastal portions of the
Mexican States of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoac√°n, Colima, and into
Jalisco through Monday. These rains may produce flash and urban
flooding, along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher coastal

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm
warning areas and possible within the watch area beginning early
Saturday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are expected to begin
affecting portions of the coast of southern Mexico later today and
continue into the weekend.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Lester Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP132022
400 AM CDT Fri Sep 16 2022
 
Tropical Depression Thirteen-E has been upgraded to Tropical Storm 
Lester.  While the storm still has a sheared appearance, recent 
scatterometer data indicate that surface wind speeds have 
increased in the southern half of the circulation and show an area 
of 30-32 kt winds. Satellite Dvorak estimates from SAB and TAFB 
range between 30-35 kt. Given the potential for undersampling in the 
satellite winds, the initial intensity for this advisory is set at 
35 kt.

The cyclone is currently moving north-northwestward at about 4 kt.  
Model guidance agrees that the storm should turn northwestward 
shortly within the eastern portion of the monsoonal flow.  Over the 
next couple of days, Lester is expected to increase in forward speed 
as it moves toward the Mexican coast, and the center is forecast to 
cross the coastline sometime Saturday afternoon or evening.  The 
official track forecast is very similar to the previous one and 
remains close to the model consensus aids.
 
Lester is expected to remain embedded in moderate northeasterly 
vertical wind shear for the next 48 h.  Global model guidance 
suggests other atmospheric and oceanic conditions, such as 
environmental moisture and sea surface temperatures, should be 
conducive for possible strengthening. Therefore, the NHC intensity 
forecast still shows gradual strengthening until landfall along the 
coast of Mexico.  The storm is expected to rapidly weaken once it 
moves inland over the mountainous terrain.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Tropical Storm Lester will reach portions of 
coastal southern Mexico by this evening, increasing in coverage and 
intensity Saturday and Saturday night, spreading farther west on 
Sunday. This rainfall may produce flash and urban flooding, along 
with possible mudslides in areas of higher coastal terrain.  
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected along the coast of 
southern Mexico on Saturday within the Tropical Storm Warning area.
