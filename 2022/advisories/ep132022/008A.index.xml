500 AM PDT Sat Sep 17 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Lester, located just off the coast of southwestern Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Southwest of Southwestern Mexico:<br/>
A low pressure system continues to produce shower and thunderstorm <br/>
activity a few hundred miles southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. This <br/>
disturbance continues to show signs of organization, and a tropical <br/>
depression will likely form later today or tonight. The low is <br/>
forecast to meander off the southwestern coast of Mexico this <br/>
weekend, and then turn north-northwestward early next week. For more <br/>
information on this system, including gale warnings, please see High <br/>
Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Central America and Southeastern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure could form over the far eastern portion of <br/>
the eastern North Pacific basin early next week. Environmental <br/>
conditions are forecast to be conducive for some gradual development <br/>
while the system moves west-northwestward near or offshore the coast <br/>
of southern Mexico through mid-week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

SUMMARY OF 100 PM CDT...1800 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.5N 98.5W
ABOUT 85 MI...140 KM ESE OF ACAPULCO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 360 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1009 MB...29.80 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has discontinued all coastal Tropical 
Storm watches and warnings for the coast of southwestern Mexico.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
For information specific to your area, please monitor products 
issued by your national meteorological service.

 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Lester 
was estimated to be inland near latitude 16.5 North, longitude 98.5 
West. Lester is moving toward the north near 10 mph (17 km/h). The 
depression is forecast to continue moving inland during the next few 
hours.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) with 
higher gusts. The center of Lester will likely dissipate this 
afternoon.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1009 mb (29.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Lester can be found in the 
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP3 and WMO 
header WTPZ43 KNHC and on the web at 
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP3.shtml.
 
RAINFALL: Lester is forecast to produce rainfall totals across the
following Mexican states through Sunday:
 
Coastal Michoacan and coastal Guerrero: 8 to 12 inches with maximum
totals of 16 inches
 
Central to Western coastal  Oaxaca, coastal Colima and coastal
Jalisco: 3 to 6 inches with local maximum totals of 12 inches.
 
These rains may produce flash and urban flooding, along with
possible mudslides in areas of higher coastal terrain.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lester are affecting portions of the 
coast of southern and southwestern Mexico, and this will continue 
today. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and 
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local 
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Lester Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP132022
1000 AM CDT Sat Sep 17 2022
 
Lester's overnight improvement in organization was short lived. 
Several microwave overpasses during the last few hours show a 
distinct lack of organized convective banding, and little evidence 
that a well-defined circulation still exists. It is possible that 
close proximity to land has severely disrupted Lester's structure 
since it has been very difficult to locate the cyclone's center in 
traditional IR or Visible imagery this morning. With the center of 
Lester well-hidden below higher clouds, the uncertainty in the 
initial position and motion are unusually high, which also 
translates to high uncertainty in the intensity estimate since the 
Dvorak technique is very dependent on center location. The initial 
intensity of 35 kt is based on a blend of recent Dvorak fixes, but 
should be considered within that uncertain context.

Significant strengthening is not supported by any guidance and 
appears unlikely with Lester so close to land, so the biggest threat 
will be very heavy rain leading to flash and urban flooding across 
portions of the southwest coast of Mexico. Mudslides will also be 
possible in areas of high terrain. That threat will exist over a 
wide area regardless of Lester's position or intensity, and will 
persist today even after Lester dissipates. Users are therefore 
urged to not put much weight into the specifics of the NHC track and 
intensity forecasts, which shows Lester moving inland and 
dissipating later today. This scenario is supported by all of the 
dynamical models, with some (like the ECMWF, UKMET and CMC models) 
indicating that Lester may have already moved inland.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Lester will continue for portions of coastal
southern Mexico into Sunday. This rainfall may produce flash and
urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher
coastal terrain.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the 
coast of southwestern Mexico today.
