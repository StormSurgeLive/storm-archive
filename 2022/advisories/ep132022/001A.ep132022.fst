tonight or Friday.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).

RAINFALL:  The system is expected to produce rainfall totals of
3-6 inches with isolated maximum totals of 10 inches across coastal
portions of the Mexican States of Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Michoac√°n
through Sunday morning. These rains may produce flash and urban
flooding, along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain
near the coast.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area beginning early Saturday.

SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are expected to begin
affecting portions of the coast of southern Mexico by late Friday
