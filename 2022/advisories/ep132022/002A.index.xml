--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Laguna de Chacahua westward to Zihuatanejo
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning will likely be required for portions of the 
watch area later today.  Interests elsewhere along the southwestern 
coast of Mexico should monitor the progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products 
issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression 
Thirteen-E was located near latitude 13.0 North, longitude 95.6 
West.  The depression is moving toward the north-northwest near 5 
mph (7 km/h).  A northwestward motion with an increase in forward 
speed is expected over the next couple of days.  On the forecast 
track, the center of the cyclone is expected to move near or over 
the coast of southwestern Mexico Saturday or Saturday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual strengthening is forecast during the next couple of
days, and the depression is forecast to become a tropical storm 
later today.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  The system is expected to produce rainfall totals of 3-6
inches with local totals of 10 inches across coastal portions of the
Mexican States of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoac√°n, Colima, and possibly
Jalisco through Sunday. These rains may produce flash and urban
flooding, along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain
near the coast.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area beginning early Saturday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are expected to begin 
affecting portions of the coast of southern Mexico later today and 
continue into the weekend.  These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

<title>Tropical Depression Thirteen-E Forecast Discussion Number 2</title>

Tropical Depression Thirteen-E Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP132022
1000 PM CDT Thu Sep 15 2022

Satellite imagery indicates little change in the organization of 
Tropical Depression Thirteen-E, with the convection continuing in 
loosely organized bands displaced to the west and southwest of the 
low-level center due to northeasterly vertical wind shear.  
Satellite intensity estimates are in the 25-30 kt range, and based 
on that data, the initial intensity remains 30 kt.  

The initial motion is a somewhat uncertain 315/3.  The depression is 
forecast to move generally northwestward during the next 2-3 days 
around the eastern portion of monsoonal flow that is established 
over the eastern Pacific south of Mexico. As this flow strengthens 
during the next day or so, the depression should move at a faster 
forward speed, with the center forecast to move near or over the 
coast of Mexico Saturday or Saturday night.  There has been little 
change in the track guidance since the last advisory, and the new 
forecast track is very similar to the previous track.

Moderate northeasterly shear should continue to affect the cyclone 
during the time it is over water, and thus only gradual 
intensification is expected.  The new intensity forecast calls for 
the depression to become a tropical storm late tonight or on 
Friday, and shows continued gradual strengthening until landfall on 
the coast of Mexico.  Rapid weakening is expected after landfall, 
and the cyclone should dissipate over the mountains of Mexico by 72 
h. The new intensity forecast has only minor adjustments from the 
previous forecast.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Tropical Depression Thirteen-E will reach 
portions of coastal southern Mexico on Friday, increasing in 
coverage and intensity by Saturday and Saturday night. This 
rainfall may produce flash and urban flooding, along with isolated 
mudslides in areas of higher terrain. 
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible along the coast of
southern Mexico between Laguna de Chacahua and Zihautenajo beginning
on Saturday and a Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for that
area.
