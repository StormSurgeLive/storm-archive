----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Lester can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP3 and WMO header

RAINFALL: Lester is forecast to produce the following additional 
rainfall across coastal portions of the following Mexican states 
through Sunday:

Western Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima, into Jalisco: 3 to 6 
inches with local maximum totals of 12 inches.

These rains may produce flash and urban flooding, along with 
possible mudslides in areas of higher coastal terrain.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to reach portions of
the coast within the tropical storm warning area this morning, and
are possible within the tropical storm watch area by this afternoon.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lester are affecting portions of the
coast of southern and southwestern Mexico and this will continue
into the weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.

Tropical Storm Lester Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP132022
400 AM CDT Sat Sep 17 2022
 
Lester has become slightly better organized overnight.  Deep 
convection has continuously pulsed west and southwest (in the 
downshear quadrants) of the estimated low-level circulation through 
the night with cloud top temperatures below -80 degrees C.  
Subjective and objective Dvorak classifications range between 35-45 
kt and the initial intensity has been increased to 40 kt to 
represent a blend of these estimates.

The storm is moving northwestward at about 9 kt in the southeasterly 
flow between a cyclonic gyre to the west and a mid-level ridge 
centered over Texas and northern Mexico.  This general motion is 
expected to continue until landfall.  The official forecast track 
has changed little from the previous advisory. The center of 
Lester is expected to reach the coast of Mexico later this afternoon 
or evening and then dissipate as it moves inland on Sunday.

Atmospheric and oceanic conditions are expected to remain the same 
until the storm moves inland.  Lester is over very warm waters and 
surrounded by high environmental moisture.  However, the storm 
continues to experience moderate northeasterly shear that should 
persist until landfall.  Combined, these factors will likely allow 
for some slight strengthening.  The NHC forecast still shows a peak 
of 45 kt as Lester reaches the coast.  The cyclone should rapidly 
weaken over the high terrain shortly thereafter and dissipate within 
a couple of days.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Lester will continue for portions of coastal 
southern Mexico into Sunday. This rainfall may produce flash and 
urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher 
coastal terrain.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread along the coast 
of southwestern Mexico today within the Tropical Storm Warning area.
