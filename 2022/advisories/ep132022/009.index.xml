Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 AM PDT Sat Sep 17 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Lester, located along the coast of southwestern Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Southwest of Southwestern Mexico:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a well-defined low <br/>
pressure system have shown signs of becoming better organized over <br/>
the past few hours. If current trends continue, advisories will be <br/>
initiated on a new tropical depression or tropical storm this <br/>
afternoon. The low is forecast to meander off the southwestern coast <br/>
of Mexico today and then head northward or north-northwestward on <br/>
Sunday. A slow turn toward the northwest or west-northwest is then <br/>
expected through the middle of next week. For more information on <br/>
this system, including gale warnings, please see High Seas Forecasts <br/>
issued by the National Weather Service. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...near 100 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...near 100 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Central America and Southeastern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure could form over the far eastern portion of <br/>
the eastern North Pacific basin early next week. Environmental <br/>
conditions are forecast to be conducive for some gradual development <br/>
while the system moves west-northwestward near or offshore the coast <br/>
of southern Mexico through mid-week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico:<br/>
Another area of low pressure is forecast to form south of the <br/>
southern coast of Mexico by the middle of next week. Some gradual <br/>
development is possible thereafter while the disturbance moves <br/>
generally west-northwestward off the coast of southwestern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Remnants Of Lester Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP132022
400 PM CDT Sat Sep 17 2022
 
Satellite imagery and surface observations from Mexico indicate that 
the surface circulation of Lester has dissipated. The center of 
Lester has been difficult to locate today, and it is possible that 
the cyclone moved inland faster and farther east than indicated by 
NHC's operational estimates. A more detailed analysis of Lester's 
position near the coast of Mexico will be conducted during the 
post-storm analysis. Heavy rain will continue to be a threat along 
the southwest coast of Mexico for the next few days. For additional 
information on heavy rainfall and flooding, please see products 
issued by your national meteorological service.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Lester will continue for portions of coastal
southern Mexico into Sunday. This rainfall may produce flash and
urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher
coastal terrain.

Tropical Storm Madeline Advisory Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142022
300 PM MDT Sat Sep 17 2022
 
...TROPICAL STORM MADELINE FORMS OVER THE EASTERN PACIFIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM MDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.9N 106.9W
ABOUT 520 MI...840 KM SSE OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 360 DEGREES AT 1 MPH...2 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM MDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Madeline was
located near latitude 15.9 North, longitude 106.9 West. Madeline is
drifting toward the north near 1 mph (2 km/h). A faster northward 
motion is expected by tonight, followed by a slow counter-clockwise 
turn toward the west through Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Slight strengthening is forecast for the next day or so, with 
fluctuations in intensity possible after that.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Madeline will affect portions of the 
southwest coast of Mexico for the next few days. High surf 
associated with Madeline will spread northward and begin to affect 
the coast of Baja California late this weekend or early next week. 
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather 
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM MDT.

Tropical Storm Madeline Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142022
300 PM MDT Sat Sep 17 2022

A low pressure system located several hundred miles southwest of the 
southwest coast of Mexico has very slowly become better organized 
during the past several days. This system has developed and 
maintained a well-defined center today, and while it is still 
strongly sheared, the convective organization now appears to be 
sufficient to classify it as a tropical cyclone. This is supported 
in part by Dvorak classifications of 2.0 and 2.5 from TAFB and SAB, 
respectively. The initial intensity is based primarily on 
scatterometer data from around 18Z that showed peak winds near 40 kt 
to the southeast of the cyclone's center.

Madeline is currently drifting slowly northward, but a faster 
northward motion is forecast to begin this evening. A broad 
mid-level ridge extending from over the Atlantic should be the 
primary steering feature for the next 24 h or so, until another 
ridge centered over Texas begins to build on Sunday. That should 
cause Madeline to turn westward and remain on a westward heading 
through at least the middle of next week. All of the 
normally-reliable track guidance agrees with this general scenario, 
but there is a large amount of uncertainty regarding exactly how 
fast Madeline will make its turn.

While all of the track guidance keeps the tropical storm well 
offshore of Mexico, this uncertainty will have a big impact on the 
intensity forecast since Madeline is forecast to turn westward very 
near the 26 degree isotherm. A relatively southerly track will allow 
Madeline to strengthen, particularly in the 72-120 h portion of the 
forecast period when the wind shear may lessen substantially. On the 
other hand, a northern track could cause Madeline to become a 
remnant low within the next few days. The NHC intensity forecast is 
near the multi-model consensus and shows a middle ground scenario 
where Madeline moves through an environment that would allow it to 
remain a tropical cyclone but not substantially strengthen. Given 
the uncertainty in the track guidance and the sensitivity of the 
intensity to the exact track, the NHC forecast is not very high 
confidence at this time.
