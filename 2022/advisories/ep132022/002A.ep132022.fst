DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression 
Thirteen-E was located near latitude 13.0 North, longitude 95.6 
West.  The depression is moving toward the north-northwest near 5 
mph (7 km/h).  A northwestward motion with an increase in forward 
speed is expected over the next couple of days.  On the forecast 
track, the center of the cyclone is expected to move near or over 
the coast of southwestern Mexico Saturday or Saturday night.

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual strengthening is forecast during the next couple of
days, and the depression is forecast to become a tropical storm 
later today.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  The system is expected to produce rainfall totals of 3-6
inches with local totals of 10 inches across coastal portions of the
Mexican States of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoac√°n, Colima, and possibly
Jalisco through Sunday. These rains may produce flash and urban
flooding, along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain
near the coast.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area beginning early Saturday.

SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are expected to begin 
affecting portions of the coast of southern Mexico later today and 
continue into the weekend.  These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
