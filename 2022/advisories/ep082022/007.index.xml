Tropical Storm Frank Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
900 PM MDT Thu Jul 28 2022
 
Frank continues to become better organized this evening.  The storm 
has developed a well-defined outflow in the southern and eastern 
portions of the circulation.  Subjective satellite intensity 
estimates from TAFB and SAB both suggest Frank is a 55-kt tropical 
storm.  The initial intensity has been adjusted upward to match 
these estimates.
 
The vertical wind shear over Frank appears to be diminishing.  
Significant strengthening is expected since atmospheric and oceanic 
conditions are predicted to be conducive for intensification, and 
the most recent statistical model guidance indicates high 
probabilities for rapid intensification in the next 24 hours.  As a 
result, the official forecast now shows a faster rate of 
strengthening in the next day with a peak intensity of 95 kt by 48 
hours.  After that time, Frank is forecast to cross over cooler sea 
surface temperatures and into a more stable atmospheric environment. 
This should cause the system to weaken into a post-tropical cyclone 
by the end of the period.

Frank is moving westward at 9 kt.  The storm is forecast to turn to 
the west-northwest shortly as it is steered around the periphery of 
a subtropical ridge.  Within a day, Frank should turn northwestward 
as it moves toward a weakness in the subtropical ridge.  The NHC 
track prediction is very similar to the previous advisory forecast 
and closest to the model consensus aid, TVCE.
 
It should be noted that Frank and Tropical Storm Georgette are
expected to come close enough to one another to interact. Frank
will be the larger and dominant system during this interaction, and
Georgette will have only minor impacts on the track and intensity
of Frank.

Tropical Storm Georgette Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
800 PM PDT Thu Jul 28 2022
 
Georgette remains a very compact tropical storm. Satellite images 
show that the system remains sheared, with the low-level center 
estimated to be near on the northeast side of the main of area of 
deep convection.  The system's outflow is also restricted on the 
east side due to the shear.  The Dvorak estimates remains steady at 
3.0/45 kt from TAFB and SAB, and the initial intensity is held at 
that value.
 
The storm continues to move south of due west, or 260 degrees, at 10 
kt. A slightly slower west-southwest to southwest motion is expected 
during the next couple of days. However, as much larger and stronger 
Frank passes to the north, the steering flow should cause Georgette 
to stall and then turn northeastward or northward. The NHC track 
forecast has been adjusted southward during the first 48 hours and 
then eastward from 60-96 hours, trending toward the latest consensus 
models.
 
Georgette is expected to remain relatively steady in strength during 
the next couple of days as moderate northeasterly shear persists. 
However, after Frank passes to the north of Georgette, weakening 
should occur when the system moves along Frank's trough axis and 
gradually becomes more embedded in its circulation. The NHC 
intensity forecast is a little lower than the previous one and near 
the middle of the guidance envelope. Although Georgette is 
predicted to dissipate in 5 days, it is possible that it could open 
into a trough sooner than that.
