<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Frank, located about 900 miles west of the southern tip of <br/>
the Baja California peninsula, and on Tropical Depression Georgette, <br/>
located about 1500 miles west-southwest of the southern tip of the <br/>
Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure is expected to form a few hundred miles <br/>
south of eastern Mexico in a few days.  Some development of this <br/>

* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Well southwest of Southwestern Mexico:<br/>
Another area of low pressure could form several hundred miles <br/>
south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula <br/>
by midweek.  Some development of this system is possible by late <br/>
this week while it moves westward over the open waters of the <br/>
eastern Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Frank Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
800 PM PDT Mon Aug 01 2022
 
Frank continues to produce a small patch of moderate convection near 
its center, but cloud tops of -50 degrees Celsius appear more 
related to remnant cirrus rather than the convection itself.  
Assuming continued weakening of the circulation since the afternoon 
ASCAT passes, Frank's initial intensity is lowered to 40 kt, which 
is also a blend of the latest Dvorak CI numbers from TAFB and SAB.  
Frank's large circulation will continue to spin down over waters of 
20-22 degrees Celsius over the next couple of days, but the NHC 
intensity forecast is near the higher end of the guidance through 
that period, favoring the slower decay shown by the GFS global model 
fields.  Frank should lose its remaining convection soon and become 
post-tropical by 24 hours, and all global models indicate the 
remnant low should open up into a trough in 3 or 4 days about 
300 n mi west of the California coast.

Frank slowed down a little bit today, and is moving toward the 
northwest (310/8 kt).  Although it's decaying, Frank is essentially 
expected to recurve around strong mid-level ridging over the 
southwestern United States and ahead of a deep-layer trough well 
west of California.  There is good model consensus on this 
scenario, and only a slight westward adjustment was required on the 
new forecast after 24 hours based on the lastest track guidance.

SUMMARY OF 800 PM PDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...13.5N 131.2W
ABOUT 1540 MI...2475 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1006 MB...29.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM PDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression 
Georgette was located near latitude 13.5 North, longitude 131.2 
West. The depression has been meandering during the past few 
hours but its average motion is toward the west-northwest near 
5 mph (7 km/h).  A slow north-northeastward motion is expected to 
start overnight, and this motion should continue through Wednesday. 
A turn to the west along with an increase in forward speed is 
forecast to occur on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next few days, and 
Georgette could degenerate into a remnant low at any time.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM PDT.

Tropical Depression Georgette Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
800 PM PDT Mon Aug 01 2022
 
Small bursts of convection continue to develop near the exposed 
low-level center of Georgette this evening.  Subjective and 
objective satellite intensity estimates from TAFB and UW-CIMSS still 
estimate winds of 30-33 kt in this system, and the initial 
intensity estimate is held at 30 kt for this advisory.  Global 
models predict the moderate northeasterly to east-northeasterly 
vertical wind shear should persist over Georgette for the next few 
days.  This and the relatively dry environment around the depression 
should prevent any future restrengthening.  The NHC intensity 
forecast still predicts Georgette to become a post-tropical cyclone 
in a few days, however given the poor organization of the 
convection, this could happen sooner.

Georgette has been meandering west-northwestward at 4 kt.  The 
system is expected to turn north-northeastward overnight into a 
weakness in the subtropical ridge located to the north of the 
cyclone.  In about two days, the ridge is expected to build back in 
and turn Georgette to the west with an increase in forward speed. 
The official track forecast is shifted slightly west of the previous 
advisory prediction, mostly due to the westward shift in the initial 
position.
