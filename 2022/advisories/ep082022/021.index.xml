moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general
motion is forecast to continue through Tuesday night.  A slower
north-northwestward to northward motion is expected by Wednesday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Continued steady weakening is forecast during
the next 48 hours, and Frank should become a post-tropical cyclone
by Tuesday night.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).

<title>Tropical Storm Frank Forecast Discussion Number 26</title>

Tropical Storm Frank Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 01 2022
 
Deep convection associated with Frank has continued to slowly
decrease in depth and coverage while the storm moves over cooler
waters.  As a result, Dvorak T- and CI-numbers are decreasing 
and the initial intensity has been lowered to 55 kt, which is a 
blend of those estimates, and the assumption weakening has occurred 
since the time of the overnight scatterometer overpasses.
 
Frank will be moving over SSTs of 21 to 22 Celsius during the next 
day or so, and this should result in a continued steady decrease in 
intensity.  Simulated satellite imagery from the GFS and ECMWF 
models suggest Frank will cease to produce deep convection by 36 
hours, and the system is forecast to degenerate into a post-tropical 
cyclone by that time.  The remnant low is expected to dissipate 
within 3 to 4 days.
 
Frank continues to move northwestward at about 10 kt around the 
western periphery of a mid-level ridge. By 48 hours, when the system 
weakens and becomes more vertically shallow, it should turn 
generally northward with the low-level flow. The NHC track 
prediction is close to the latest consensus aids, which is slightly 
left of the previous forecast.

Tropical Depression Georgette Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 01 2022
 
Georgette continues to be characterized by pulsating and somewhat 
disorganized deep convection near it's center of circulation.  The 
latest Dvorak intensity estimates range from T-1.0 to T-2.5, and a 
blend of these values suggests that the initial intensity remains 30 
kt. 
 
Satellite imagery indicates that the depression is beginning its 
turn toward a weakness in the subtropical ridge, and the current 
motion is north-northwest at 3 kt.  A turn to the north-northeast is 
expected by tonight, and that motion should continue for a couple of 
days.  The ridge is forecast to strengthen by late this week, which 
should cause Georgette to turn westward along with an increase in 
forward speed.  Overall, the track model guidance has become a 
little more clustered than previous cycles, and there has been a 
slight shift to the right in the guidance through 72 h.  Therefore, 
the latest NHC track forecast was adjusted a little right of the 
previous one through that time period, but remains a little to the 
left of the consensus.
 
Over the next several days, Georgette should remain in an 
environment of moderate east-northeasterly vertical shear and within 
a relatively dry low- to mid-level air mass.  By 60 h, the cyclone 
should move over waters of 25-26 degrees C.  These conditions are 
expected to prevent restrengthening of the cyclone and cause it to 
degenerate into a remnant low toward the latter part of the week.  
The official intensity forecast is unchanged from the previous one 
and is in good agreement with most of the intensity guidance.
