<title>Tropical Storm Frank Forecast Discussion Number 10</title>

Tropical Storm Frank Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
900 AM MDT Thu Jul 28 2022

Conventional satellite imagery this morning suggests that the  
northeasterly shear over Frank is diminishing, with some cirrus 
outflow developing in the northeastern quadrant.  However, SSM/IS 
microwave overpasses at 1144 and 1234 UTC show that the storm has 
not yet become better organized, as the center is still located to 
the northeast of the main convective bands.  Various satellite 
intensity estimates range from 35-55 kt, and given the unchanged 
organization the initial intensity is held at 45 kt.

A further reduction in the shear appears likely later today, which
along with sea surface temperatures of 28-29C, should allow steady 
to possible rapid strengthening through the 60 h point.  The new 
intensity forecast continues to call for a peak intensity of 90 kt, 
and this is at the upper edge of the intensity guidance.  After   
60 h, while the shear is forecast to remain light, the cyclone 
should move over steadily decreasing SSTs, reaching 21C water by  
120 h.  This should cause a steady to rapid weakening.  This part 
of the intensity forecast has been adjusted downward and it lies 
near the intensity consensus aids.

Frank continues to move westward with the initial motion 280/11 kt.
The track forecast reasoning is again unchanged from the previous 
advisory.  A turn toward the west-northwest is expected during the 
next 12-24 h, followed by a northwestward motion as the cyclone 
heads for a break in the subtropical ridge produced by mid- to 
upper-level troughing over the northeastern Pacific.  The track 
guidance remains in good agreement, but it has again shifted just 
a little to the north after about 36 h.  Thus, the new track 
forecast is nudged a little northward during that time.
 
It should be noted that Frank and Tropical Storm Georgette are
likely to come close enough to one another to interact.  The global
models still suggest that Frank will be the larger and dominant
system during this interaction, and that Georgette will have only
minor impacts on the track and intensity of Frank.

Tropical Storm Georgette Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
200 AM PDT Thu Jul 28 2022
 
Georgette remains a compact tropical cyclone with a persistent area
of deep convection located near the center and over the
northwestern portion of the circulation. Moderate easterly shear is
currently limiting the convective activity over the southeastern
portion of the tropical cyclone. A couple of timely scatterometer
overpasses have been very helpful in locating the center overnight.
The ASCAT B instrument revealed peak winds of 36 kt.  Given the
small size of the tropical cyclone and typical undersampling of the
ASCAT instrument, the initial intensity has been set at 45 kt.  That
is in line with the latest TAFB Dvorak T-number of T3.0.
 
There has been a change in the latest global model guidance
regarding the future of Georgette. The ECMWF which had been slowing
Georgette, and then moving the cyclone around the eastern portion
of Tropical Storm Frank's larger circulation now shows the smaller
Georgette opening up into a trough and being absorbed within
Frank's outer circulation within 72 hours.  That is in line with the
GFS and UKMET model guidance, and the majority of ensemble tracks
from the global models. Therefore, the updated NHC forecast now
calls for Georgette to dissipate within 96 hours, but this could
occur somewhat sooner.  In the shorter term, some slight 
strengthening is possible but moderate easterly is likely to 
prevent significant intensification.  The NHC intensity forecast is 
in best agreement with the HCCA and TVCN consensus aids.
 
Georgette is now moving west-southwestward or 255/8 kt. A northeast
to southwest-oriented mid-level ridge should steer Georgette west-
southwestward to southwestward over the next day or two.  After
that time, Georgette's forward speed is expected to slow as some
binary interaction should occur between the two tropical cyclones.
Given the complexity of the forecast, the global model guidance is
in somewhat better agreement and the confidence in the first couple
of days of the forecast is a little higher than before. Beyond that
time however, there is again higher-than-normal uncertainty due to
future interaction of the cyclones.
