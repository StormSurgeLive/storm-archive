Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 PM PDT Tue Aug 2 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center has issued the last advisory on <br/>
Post-Tropical Cyclone Frank, located about 700 miles southwest <br/>
of San Diego, California, and is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Georgette, located about 1400 miles west-southwest of <br/>
the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southern Mexico:<br/>
A tropical wave is producing a large area of disorganized showers <br/>
and thunderstorms over Central America and the adjacent waters.  The <br/>
wave is expected to move over the eastern Pacific waters on <br/>
Wednesday, and an area of low pressure is forecast to form a few <br/>
hundred miles south of southern Mexico in a couple of days. <br/>
Environmental conditions are expected to be favorable for gradual <br/>
development thereafter, and a tropical depression is likely to form <br/>
by this weekend and move west-northwestward, remaining well <br/>
offshore of the coast of southern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Well Southwest of Southwestern Mexico:<br/>
Another area of low pressure could form several hundred miles <br/>
south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula <br/>
later this week. Some gradual development of this system is <br/>
possible by the end of this week while it moves westward over the <br/>
open waters of the eastern Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Post-Tropical Cyclone Frank Discussion Number  31
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
200 PM PDT Tue Aug 02 2022
 
Frank has failed to produce organized deep convection since last 
night, and the system has been reduced to a well-defined low-level 
cloud swirl over the open waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean. Since 
Frank no longer satisfies the criteria of a tropical cyclone, this 
will be the final NHC advisory on now post-tropical Frank.

The cyclone is expected to gradually turn northward during the next 
couple of days as it moves around the western periphery of a distant 
low-level ridge. Although Frank is believed to be still producing 
some 34-kt winds in its northeastern quadrant, weakening is expected 
through midweek as the cyclone continues to spin down over cool 
SSTs. The system is forecast to open into a trough and dissipate by 
early Friday. For additional information on the post-tropical 
cyclone please see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National 
Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 
KWBC, and on the web at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php

Tropical Depression Georgette Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
800 PM PDT Tue Aug 02 2022
 
Georgette continues to hang on to tropical cyclone status.  Small 
bursts of convection persist to the southwest of the partially 
exposed low-level center.  Since the convective organization has not 
changed, the initial intensity remains at 30 kts, slightly below the 
subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates.  Moderate 
northeasterly to northerly shear is expected over the next few days. 
This vertical wind shear combined with the drier surrounding 
environment and gradually cooling sea surface temperatures are 
likely to cause Georgette to become a remnant low in a day or two.  
There were no updates to the intensity forecast this cycle.

The system is moving north-northeastward at about 6 kt into the 
weakness in the subtropical ridge caused by Post-Tropical Cyclone 
Frank.  Within about a day, the low-level ridge should begin 
building back and turn Georgette westward as well as increase its 
forward speed.  The NHC track forecast is very similar to the 
previous track prediction and close to the various consensus model 
aids.
