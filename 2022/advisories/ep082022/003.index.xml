<title>Tropical Storm Frank Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Tropical Storm Frank Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
900 PM MDT Wed Jul 27 2022
 
Deep convection persists to the southwest of the center of Frank 
due to moderate northeasterly vertical wind shear.  Cold cloud 
top temperatures currently range between -80 to -90 degrees C and 
the low-level center remains partially exposed.  The initial 
intensity has been nudged up to 45 kt in agreement with subjective 
Dvorak intensity estimates from SAB and TAFB.

Global model guidance predicts that the vertical wind shear 
currently reducing the rate of strengthening should subside over the 
tropical storm within the next day.  The relaxation of the shear, 
warm ocean surface waters, and a moist atmospheric environment 
should allow Frank to strengthen more quickly, potentially at a 
rapid rate, between 36-72 h.  The peak intensity of the official 
forecast has been increased slightly to 90 kt at 60 h to reflect 
this possibility.  Beyond 72 h, Frank is expected steadily weaken 
when it moves over cooler waters and into a more stable atmospheric 
environment.

Frank is being steered westward at 10 kt by a subtropical ridge to 
the north.  In a day or so, the storm should gradually turn 
west-northwestward to northwestward along the periphery of the 
weakening ridge through the end of the forecast period.  The latest 
NHC track forecast is similar to the previous advisory track and 
closest to the dynamical model consensus aid, TVCE. 
 
It should be noted that Frank and Tropical Storm Georgette are
likely to come close enough to one another to interact.  The global
models still suggest that Frank will be the larger and dominant
system during this interaction, and that Georgette will have only
minor impacts on the track and intensity of Frank.

Tropical Storm Georgette Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
800 PM PDT Wed Jul 27 2022
 
Georgette is a small tropical cyclone with some strong deep
convection concentrated near its center.  Limited banding features
are present around the northern semicircle of the storm, and
upper-level outflow is well defined over the western portion of the
circulation.  Moderate easterly shear, associated with the flow on
the southern side of an upper-level anticyclone. has been impinging
on the system.  The advisory intensity is nudged upward slightly to
40 kt based on the latest objective Dvorak estimates from UW-CIMSS.
 
Although the shear is not expected to diminish much over the next
several days, some modest short-term strengthening could occur
while Georgette remains in a favorable thermodynamic environment.
The longer-term intensity forecast for the system is quite
uncertain, since it is highly dependent on how much influence the
larger circulation of Tropical Storm, or Hurricane, Frank will have
on Georgette.  The forecast track shows Georgette coming within 
about 175 n mi of Frank in 96 hours, and although the official 
forecast shows Georgette weakening by that time, it is quite 
possible that the cyclone will be in the process of becoming 
absorbed by Frank around that time.  For now, the forecast will show 
Georgette as a separate system, as suggested by the ECMWF 
simulation.  However, the GFS model prediction continues to 
show Georgette being absorbed by the larger tropical cyclone in a 
few days.  It will be interesting to see how this plays out.
 
The motion continues westward or about 270/9 kt.  A northeast to 
southwest-oriented mid-level ridge to the northwest of the system 
should cause Georgette to turn west-southwestward and 
southwestward during the next 48 hours.  Thereafter, the cyclone is 
expected to turn northwestward and then northward in the flow on the 
south and east side of Frank.  The official track forecast has been 
shifted a little to the east of the previous one but not as far east 
as the latest simple and corrected consensus forecasts.  As in the 
previous advisory, the NHC track prediction is of lower-than-normal 
confidence due to the uncertainty of the future interaction of 
Georgette and Frank.
