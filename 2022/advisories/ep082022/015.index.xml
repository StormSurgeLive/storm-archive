Hurricane Frank Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
800 PM PDT Sat Jul 30 2022
 
Satellite images indicate that Frank appears to have reached a 
generally steady state. Although the convective banding remains well 
established on the south and east sides, there are pronounced dry 
slots on the system's west side. In addition, the ragged eye feature 
seen occasionally earlier today is no longer evident. There is a 
large spread in the satellite intensity estimates this evening with 
the University of Wisconsin ADT on the low side at 63 kt and 
subjective estimates as high as 90 kt. The initial intensity is held 
at 80 kt based on a blend of that data.
 
Frank is just about out of time to strengthen as it is nearing the 
26 degree C SST isotherm. The hurricane is expected to track over 
increasingly cooler waters during the next few days and move into a 
progressively drier and more stable environment. These factors 
should cause a steady weakening trend, and Frank is now expected to 
become a post-tropical cyclone by 72 hours. This forecast lies a 
little above the latest IVCN and HCCA consensus models. 
 
Frank has been moving steadily to the northwest, with the latest
initial motion estimated to be 315/10 kt. This general motion is
expected to continue as the hurricane moves toward a weakness in the
subtropical ridge caused by a large mid- to upper-level low off the
California coast. When Frank becomes a shallow and weak remnant low
in a few days, it will likely slow down and turn toward the north in
the low-level flow. The new NHC track forecast is a little faster
and slightly to the right of the previous one, trending toward the
latest consensus models.

Tropical Storm Georgette Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
800 PM PDT Sat Jul 30 2022
 
Georgette has looked a little less organized during the past few 
hours. Cloud tops associated with its deep convection have warmed, 
and its banding features appear to be less defined than they were 
earlier today. It's unclear if this is a sign of imminent weakening 
or just a reflection of diurnal fluctuations of the tropical 
storm's convection. Satellite intensity estimates vary from 30 kt 
to 50 kt. The NHC intensity estimate will remain 45 kt for now, 
which is notably the same as the TAFB Dvorak assessment.
 
No changes of note were made to any aspect of the NHC forecast for 
Georgette with this advisory. Unfortunately, the track component of 
the forecast is still of very low confidence.  The small tropical 
storm should continue moving generally west-southwestward to 
westward for the next day or so. By early Monday, a breakdown of 
steering currents should cause the tropical cyclone to take on a 
slow meandering motion. The much larger Hurricane Frank is forecast 
to move north of Georgette on Sunday and Monday, which could 
contribute to a slow eastward drift for Georgette. The GFS is one 
example of this scenario, however the ECMWF shows no such eastward 
movement, while other models fall between those two solutions. As a 
result, even though all models indicate that Georgette will begin 
drifting northward early next week, the model spread is quite high. 
The NHC track forecast is just a touch west of the previous advisory 
at most forecast times beyond 24 h, but is a little east of the 
multi-model consensus at most forecast times.
 
The intensity forecast is more certain. Georgette's current marginal
environment is not likely to change substantially, which
should cause it to slowly weaken through early next week.  The
intensity model spread is very low, increasing confidence in this
part of the forecast. NHC's updated intensity forecast is near the
middle of the small guidance envelope, closest to the multi-model
consensus.
