Tropical Storm Frank Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
200 AM PDT Tue Aug 02 2022
 
Only a tiny region of -45 to -50 degree Celsius cloud top 
temperatures remain with Frank southeast of its center this morning. 
In fact, the tropical cyclone appears well on its way to becoming a 
low-level cloud swirl devoid of any remaining deep convection. 
Subjective and objective Dvorak classifications range from 30-kt to 
45-kt this morning. Absent of any recent scatterometer data, but 
noting that the passes yesterday afternoon had a large region of 
greater than 40 kt winds, the initial intensity was held at 40-kt 
this advisory. Frank should continue to gradually spin down over 
20-22 C ocean waters as it moves further into a more stable 
environment. The meager amount of cold cloud tops near Frank now 
already do not meet the necessary criteria of a tropical cyclone, 
and it is likely the storm will become post-tropical later today. 
Most of the guidance now suggests Frank will open up into a trough 
by 72 hours, and that is reflected in the latest forecast, showing 
the remnant low dissipating about 300 n mi west of the California 
coast.
 
Frank is still moving to the northwest at 310/9 kt. Even as Frank
becomes more shallow, the low-level steering flow will still enable
Frank to recurve between a narrow low-level ridge off of the Baja
California peninsula and a prominent deep-layer trough well west of
California. The track guidance remains tightly clustered, and only
slight changes were needed for the latest track forecast.

West. The depression is moving toward the north-northeast near 5 mph
(7 km/h). A slow north-northeastward motion is expected to continue
through Wednesday followed by a turn to the west along with an
increase in forward speed on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next 48 hours, but
Georgette is expected to become a remnant low after that time.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).

Tropical Depression Georgette Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
800 PM PDT Mon Aug 01 2022
 
Small bursts of convection continue to develop near the exposed 
low-level center of Georgette this evening.  Subjective and 
objective satellite intensity estimates from TAFB and UW-CIMSS still 
estimate winds of 30-33 kt in this system, and the initial 
intensity estimate is held at 30 kt for this advisory.  Global 
models predict the moderate northeasterly to east-northeasterly 
vertical wind shear should persist over Georgette for the next few 
days.  This and the relatively dry environment around the depression 
should prevent any future restrengthening.  The NHC intensity 
forecast still predicts Georgette to become a post-tropical cyclone 
in a few days, however given the poor organization of the 
convection, this could happen sooner.

Georgette has been meandering west-northwestward at 4 kt.  The 
system is expected to turn north-northeastward overnight into a 
weakness in the subtropical ridge located to the north of the 
cyclone.  In about two days, the ridge is expected to build back in 
and turn Georgette to the west with an increase in forward speed. 
The official track forecast is shifted slightly west of the previous 
advisory prediction, mostly due to the westward shift in the initial 
position.
