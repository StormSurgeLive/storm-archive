Tropical Storm Frank Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
300 PM MDT Fri Jul 29 2022

Frank has become better organized during the past several hours, 
with increased convective banding close to the center and signs of 
a ragged eye forming.  However, the convection in the formative 
eyewall is still a bit sporadic, likely due to some continued dry 
air entrainment.  Satellite intensity estimates have increased to 
the 50-77 kt range, and recent ASCAT-B scatterometer data showed 
winds of at least 50 kt northeast of the center. Based on these 
data, the initial intensity is set at 60 kt.  The wind radii have 
been modified using the ASCAT-B data.

Frank will be in an environment of light vertical shear and over
sea surface temperatures of 28-29C for the next 24-36 h, and 
this combined with the increasing organization in the inner core 
favors continued strengthening.  The new intensity forecast calls 
for a peak intensity of 90 kt in 36 h, and this lies at the top of 
the intensity guidance.  However, the rapid intensification indices 
of the SHIPS model call for about a 65 percent chance of 25-30 kt 
of strengthening in just the next 24 h, so it is possible the 
current forecast is conservative.  After 36 h, Frank should move 
over progressively cooler SSTs, with the system reaching 21C water 
by 96 h.  This should cause steady to rapid weakening, and Frank is
forecast to become a remnant low by the end of the forecast period.
 
The initial motion is now 305/10 kt.  Frank is moving along the
southwest side of the subtropical ridge over northwestern Mexico,
and it should move generally northwestward during the forecast
period toward a developing break in the ridge west of California.
The track guidance remains in good agreement with this scenario and 
has again changed little since the previous advisory. Thus, the new 
forecast track is once again an update of the previous forecast.
 
It again should be noted that Frank and Tropical Storm Georgette
are expected to come close enough to one another for some 
interaction.  Frank will be the larger and dominant system during 
this interaction, and the smaller and weaker Georgette will have 
little impact on the track or intensity of Frank.

Tropical Storm Georgette Advisory Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
200 PM PDT Fri Jul 29 2022
 
...GEORGETTE MOVING WEST-SOUTHWESTWARD OVER THE TROPICAL EASTERN
PACIFIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM PDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.7N 124.0W
ABOUT 1080 MI...1740 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WSW OR 255 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM PDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Georgette was
located near latitude 14.7 North, longitude 124.0 West. Georgette is
moving toward the west-southwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A 
west-southwest motion at a gradually slower pace is expected during 
the next few of days, followed by a turn toward the northeast by 
early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Although little change in strength is forecast
during the couple of days, some fluctuations in intensity are
possible in the short term due to Georgette's compact size.  Slow 
weakening is forecast to commence by the end of the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM PDT.

Tropical Storm Georgette Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
200 PM PDT Fri Jul 29 2022
 
Conventional satellite imagery shows that tiny Georgette has become
less organized during the past few hours.  Although a recent SSMIS 
overpass indicated that the inner core and eye-like feature have 
remained intact, the deep convection in the east semi-circle has 
thinned quite a bit, while the previously noted banding feature in 
the north portion of the cyclone has become fragmented.  All of 
this is more than likely due to some increase in the northeasterly 
shear magnitude.  The satellite subjective intensity estimates have 
decreased, and this advisory's initial intensity is set at 45 kt.
 
The moderate deep-layer shear should persist during the next several 
days; some increase in the magnitude of the inhibiting upper wind 
component is forecast beyond 48 hours.  This, along with a dry 
thermodynamic surrounding environment (45 to 50 percent RH in the 
mid-portions of the atmosphere) should induce slow weakening through 
the forecast period.  There's still some uncertainty as to how long 
Georgette will survive.  The GFS, however, is the only global model 
showing Georgette as a post-tropical cyclone or remnant low beyond 
day 4.  Therefore, the intensity forecast is an update of the 
previous one and is similar to the HCCA and IVCN intensity consensus 
forecasts.
 
Georgette's initial motion is estimated to be west-southwestward, or 
255/10 kt.  The forecast philosophy is unchanged.  An east-northeast 
to a west-southwest-oriented mid-tropospheric ridge should cause the 
cyclone to move generally west-southwestward through the 48-hour 
period.  Beyond mid-period, Georgette is expected slow its forward 
motion, turn northwestward, and then northeastward within the 
southeastern peripheral flow of larger and stronger Frank.  The NHC 
forecast has changed little from this morning's advisory and lies 
close to the HFIP Corrected Consensus aid.
