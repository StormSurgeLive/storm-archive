Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 AM PDT Wed Jul 27 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Frank, located several hundred miles south of Manzanillo, <br/>
Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South of Baja California peninsula:<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity associated with a low pressure area <br/>
located several hundred miles southwest of the southern tip of <br/>
the Baja California peninsula has increased and is showing signs of <br/>
organization this morning. Only a small additional increase in <br/>
organization would lead to the formation of a tropical depression, <br/>
possibly as soon as later today. The system is forecast to move <br/>
slowly westward or west-southwestward over the next few days and <br/>
could still interact with Tropical Storm Frank to its east at the <br/>
end of this week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

<title>Tropical Storm Frank Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Frank Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
1000 AM CDT Wed Jul 27 2022

Frank continues to feel the effects of about 20 kt of northeasterly 
vertical wind shear, with the low-level center remaining just 
northeast of the current convective burst.  Various subjective and 
objective satellite intensity estimates are in the 35-40 kt range, 
and these have changed little since the last advisory.  Based on 
this, the initial intensity remains 35 kt.

The global models suggest that the current shear should ease over 
the next 12-24 h and allow Frank to gradually strengthen.  Between 
24-72 h, the shear is forecast to become light while the cyclone is 
over 28-29C sea surface temperatures, and this environment could 
allow for steady, and possible rapid, intensification.  The forecast 
peak intensity of 75 kt is unchanged from the previous forecast due 
to uncertainty as to whether Frank will have a good enough structure 
to rapidly intensify.  However, this is in the middle of the 
intensity guidance and could be conservative.  After 72 h, Frank 
should move over decreasing sea surface temperatures, and this 
should cause weakening.

Frank is wobbling between a westward and west-northwestward motion 
with the current motion of 285/9.  A subtropical ridge to the
north of the cyclone should continue to steer Frank generally 
westward for the next 36 h or so, followed by a west-northwestward 
motion from 36-72 h.  After that time, the cyclone is expected to 
moved more northwestward toward a break in the ridge caused by by a 
mid- to upper-level trough developing over the Pacific west of 
California.  The new official forecast rack is similar to the 
previous track through 60 h, and then is nudged a little to the 
north of the previous forecast in response to a northward shift of 
the guidance.  The new forecast is close to or a little south of 
the various consensus models.

It should be noted that Frank and the newly-formed Tropical 
Depression Eight-E are likely to come close enough to one another to 
interact.  The global models suggest that Frank will be the larger 
and dominant system during this interaction, and that the depression 
will have only minor impacts on the track and intensity of Frank.

Tropical Depression Eight-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
900 AM MDT Wed Jul 27 2022
 
The area of low pressure we have been monitoring more than 500 miles
southwest of the Baja California peninsula has continued to become
better organized this morning. First light visible imagery shows
cold convective cloud tops near the estimated center that also
appear to be rotating cyclonically. While we haven't had any recent
C-band scatterometer passes near the center of this system, a
recent KU-band scatterometer showed plenty of non-rain contaminated
winds to help confirm that a closed circulation exists. Subjective
Dvorak classifications were up to T2.0/30-kt from TAFB and
T1.5/25-kt from SAB. A recently arriving SSMIS pass at 1159 UTC
also showed a well-defined curve band wrapping at least 75 percent
around the northwestern side of the system. All these data indicate
a new tropical depression has formed, and the initial intensity
will be set at 30 kt this advisory.
 
Currently the depression is moving westward at 275/6 kt. A large 
deep-layer ridge is situated north of the cyclone which should steer 
it on a general westward to west-southwestward heading over the next 
day or so. Afterwards, the larger circulation of Tropical Storm 
Frank is expected to get close enough to initiate binary interaction 
with the depression. The net result of this interaction is that the 
depression is likely to bend even more southward than the 
larger-scale steering flow would initially suggest, and there is 
some chance that Frank may capture the smaller depression. For now, 
the track forecast keeps Frank and TD Eight-E separate, showing a 
very slow west-northwestward motion towards the end of the forecast 
period. This track forecast is roughly follows the TVCE aid early 
on, but is slower later in the  forecast period due to uncertainty 
with interaction with Frank to the east. This initial track forecast 
is of low confidence.
 
The intensity forecast is also challenging and strongly related to
how much interaction this depression has with the larger circulation
of Frank. Assuming the depression remains separate, environmental
conditions only appear marginally favorable for intensification in
the short-term, with moderate easterly vertical wind shear, and
plenty of nearby dry air that could get ingested into the small
circulation at any time. For these reasons, the intensity forecast
only shows modest intensification over the next 24-48 hours and
caps the storm at 40 kt thereafter due to uncertainty in its future
evolution near Frank. This is roughly in line with the latest SHIPS
guidance, but is lower than the HCCA and other consensus intensity
aids which are biased by the larger and stronger wind field of
Frank later on in the forecast.
