<title>Tropical Storm Frank Forecast Discussion Number 25</title>

Tropical Storm Frank Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
200 AM PDT Mon Aug 01 2022

Frank has continued to weaken while moving over increasingly colder 
waters, and deep convection is becoming more fragmented and 
diminishing in depth.  Unflagged data from an ASCAT-C 
scatterometer pass at around 0500 UTC indicate that the maximum 
winds have decreased to just below hurricane force, so the advisory 
intensity is reduced to 60 kt.  This is also the mean of the latest 
Dvorak Current Intensity numbers from TAFB and SAB.

Since the system will be moving over even colder ocean waters of 
near 20 deg C by 48 hours, the cyclone is likely to degenerate into 
a post-tropical remnant low by that time, or sooner.  The official 
intensity forecast follows the latest model consensus, IVCN, 
prediction.  Post-tropical cyclone Frank is expected to dissipate by 
the end of the forecast period.

Frank remains on its northwestward course with the initial motion 
continuing near 320/10 kt.  There are no significant changes to the 
track forecast or reasoning.  The cyclone is expected to move along 
the southwestern and western periphery of a mid-level ridge 
associated with a strong high over the southwestern United States 
for the next several days. Late in the forecast period, Frank or 
its remnant should move generally northward in the low-level flow.  
The official track forecast is very close to the simple and 
corrected dynamical model consensus tracks.

Tropical Depression Georgette Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
200 AM PDT Mon Aug 01 2022
 
Deep convection has increased again near and to the west and 
southwest of the center of the tropical cyclone.  This is likely a 
diurnal fluctuation, and the convection is not very well organized. 
The advisory intensity is held at 30 kt, which is the average of 
Dvorak estimates from SAB and TAFB.

The depression has been drifting a little north of west with a 
current motion estimate of just 280/2 kt.  Georgette is expected to 
turn northward or north-northeastward into a weakness in the 
subtropical ridge during the next couple of days.  Later in the 
forecast period, the ridge is likely to build to the north of the 
cyclone which should induce a turn toward the west.  The official 
forecast track is shifted a little eastward from the previous NHC 
prediction, toward the latest multi-model consensus guidance.  
However, there is a lot of spread in the model tracks, so the 
official forecast is of relatively low confidence.

Over the next several days, Georgette should remain in an 
environment of moderate east-northeasterly vertical shear and 
within a relatively dry low- to mid-level air mass.  These 
conditions are expected to prevent restrengthening of the cyclone 
and cause degeneration into a remnant low in the latter part of the 
forecast period.  The official intensity forecast is the same as the 
previous one and lies between the latest LGEM and DSHIPS guidance 
models.
