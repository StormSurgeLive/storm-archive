<br/>
Well southwest of Southwestern Mexico:<br/>
Another area of low pressure could form a several hundred miles <br/>
south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula <br/>
by midweek.  Some development of this system is possible by <br/>
late this week while the system moves westward over the open waters <br/>

Tropical Storm Frank Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 01 2022
 
Deep convection associated with Frank has continued to slowly
decrease in depth and coverage while the storm moves over cooler
waters.  As a result, Dvorak T- and CI-numbers are decreasing 
and the initial intensity has been lowered to 55 kt, which is a 
blend of those estimates, and the assumption weakening has occurred 
since the time of the overnight scatterometer overpasses.
 
Frank will be moving over SSTs of 21 to 22 Celsius during the next 
day or so, and this should result in a continued steady decrease in 
intensity.  Simulated satellite imagery from the GFS and ECMWF 
models suggest Frank will cease to produce deep convection by 36 
hours, and the system is forecast to degenerate into a post-tropical 
cyclone by that time.  The remnant low is expected to dissipate 
within 3 to 4 days.
 
Frank continues to move northwestward at about 10 kt around the 
western periphery of a mid-level ridge. By 48 hours, when the system 
weakens and becomes more vertically shallow, it should turn 
generally northward with the low-level flow. The NHC track 
prediction is close to the latest consensus aids, which is slightly 
left of the previous forecast.

Tropical Depression Georgette Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
200 PM PDT Mon Aug 01 2022
 
Georgette is a poorly organized tropical depression. Visible 
satellite imagery is revealing that the low-level circulation 
is not well-defined, and deep convection continues to sputter. 
Unfortunately, there is no new satellite wind data over the system 
this afternoon to provide a better assessment of the low-level wind 
field of the depression. The initial intensity is being kept at 30 
kt based on the latest Dvorak intensity estimate from TAFB. 
However, this may be generous. 

The depression has been drifting north-northwest at about 4 kt today 
toward a weakness in the subtropical ridge. A slow 
north-northeastward motion is expected to begin tonight and this 
motion should continue through Tuesday night. The ridge is forecast 
to strengthen by Thursday, which should cause Georgette to turn 
westward along with an increase in forward speed. Models are in 
generally good agreement on this scenario, and only minor tweaks 
were made to the NHC track forecast for this advisory. 

Moderate east-northeasterly shear and a dry airmass should prevent 
Georgette from strengthening for the next several days. In a couple 
of days the cyclone is expected to move over cooler waters and 
encounter a more stable airmass. The combination of these factors 
should cause Georgette to degenerate into a remnant low. However, 
there is a possibility that the system could dissipate before that 
time. There was no change to the NHC intensity forecast from the 
previous one.
