<title>Hurricane Frank Forecast Discussion Number 16</title>

Hurricane Frank Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
900 PM MDT Fri Jul 29 2022
 
Frank is on a strengthening trend. Satellite images show that deep
convection has become more symmetric around the center, and there
have been hints of an eye forming. Although banding features have
become well established, microwave data indicate that a well-defined
inner has not yet developed. The latest satellite intensity
estimates range from 60 to 77 kt, and based on that data and the
improvement in the system's structure, the initial intensity is
increased to 70 kt. The minimum pressure has been set at 983 mb.
This makes Frank the sixth hurricane of the 2022 eastern North
Pacific season.
 
Over the past 12 hours, Frank has been moving west-northwestward at 
9 kt. A turn to the northwest is expected on Saturday, and that 
motion is forecast to continue during the next several days as the 
hurricane moves toward a weakness in the subtropical ridge. The NHC 
track forecast is a little to the left of the previous one, 
partially due to an adjustment of the initial position in that 
direction. This forecast lies close to the multi-model consensus 
TVCE from 12 to 72 hours, but is left of that aid beyond that, 
leaning toward the GFS and ECMWF models.

Frank is expected to remain in near ideal conditions of very low 
wind shear, warm waters, and a moist airmass for another 24-36 
hours. In fact, the SHIPS Rapid Intensification Indices show a 
greater than 60 percent chance that Frank could rapidly intensify 
during that period. The NHC intensity forecast during that time has 
been adjusted upward and lies a little above the consensus aids 
given the favorable environment and improving storm structure. 
However, by late Sunday, Frank will be moving over much cooler 
waters and into a progressively drier airmass, which should cause 
steady weakening. Although the system will be moving over quite cool 
waters in a few days, the GFS model suggests that it could still be 
producing some deep convection enhanced by a nearby trough, which 
might delay its transition into a remnant low.   
 
It again should be noted that Frank and Tropical Storm Georgette
are expected to come close enough to one another for some
interaction. Frank will be the larger and dominant system during
this interaction, and the smaller and weaker Georgette will have
little impact on the track or intensity of Frank.

SEVERAL DAYS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM PDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.2N 125.9W
ABOUT 1205 MI...1940 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WSW OR 255 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM PDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Georgette was
located near latitude 14.2 North, longitude 125.9 West.  Georgette 
is moving toward the west-southwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  The 
storm is forecast to move on a similar heading at a slower forward 
speed for the next day or so. After that, Georgette's forward 
movement should slow further, resulting in a meandering motion 
through the remainder of the weekend.  A turn toward the northeast 
is expected by early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Not much change in strength is forecast during the next day 
or so, with gradual weakening anticipated after that.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM PDT.

Tropical Storm Georgette Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
200 AM PDT Sat Jul 30 2022

Georgette continues to be affected by northeasterly vertical shear 
that is displacing much of its deep convection to the southwest of 
the estimated center.  Based on a blend of subjective and objective 
Dvorak estimates from SAB, TAFB, and UW-CIMSS, the advisory 
intensity remains at 45 kt.

The tropical cyclone has continued on its west-southwestward track 
and is moving at about 255/9 kt.  A mid-level ridge just to the 
west of Hurricane Frank should continue to steer Georgette on a 
west-southwestward to westward course for the next day or so.  
Thereafter, the system should become situated in a region of weak 
steering currents between the ridge and broad southwesterly flow to 
the south and southwest of Frank.  This will likely cause Georgette 
to move slowly and erratically during the next 2-3 days.  By 72 
hours, the weakening cyclone is expected to begin moving 
northeastward within the southwesterly low- to mid-level flow.  
Most of the track guidance has shifted westward in comparison to the 
earlier model runs, and the official forecast is somewhat west of 
the previous NHC prediction beyond 36 hours, but not quite as far 
west as the latest model consensus.  

East-northeasterly shear is forecast to prevail over Georgette 
during the next few days, and the low- to mid-level environment is 
expected to remain rather dry.  This, along with an increasing lack 
of low-level inflow due to the influence of Franks's circulation, 
should result in gradual weakening.  The official forecast is 
similar to the previous one and closely follows the latest HFIP 
Corrected Consensus Approach, HCCA, intensity guidance.
