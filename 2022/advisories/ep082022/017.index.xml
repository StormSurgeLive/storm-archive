Hurricane Frank Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
800 AM PDT Sun Jul 31 2022
 
An 0933 UTC AMSR2 microwave overpass revealed the fragments of a 
small inner eye and a much larger 60 to 75 n-mi-wide eye. Since that 
time, the cloud tops have generally warmed with a small CDO feature 
remaining.  Frank's outflow is still well established owing to the 
low vertical wind shear conditions. Objective and subjective Dvorak 
intensity estimates range between 65 and 77 kt, so the initial 
intensity has been lowered to 75 kt for this advisory.
 
Frank has crossed the 26 degree Celsius isotherm and will be moving 
over progressively cooler waters during the next few days.  In 
addition, the storm will be entering a drier and more stable 
environment.  Thus, steady weakening is expected, and Frank is 
forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone within 72 hours, and 
dissipate by the end of the period. The NHC intensity forecast 
follows the HCCA and IVCN consensus aids closely and is essentially 
an update of the previous advisory.
 
Frank is moving northwestward or 315/10 kt.  The cyclone should move 
on a general northwestward track over the next couple of days around 
the southwestern portion of a mid-level ridge.  After that time, a 
weaker and more shallow system is predicted to decelerate and turn 
north-northwest to northward within the low-level flow. The updated 
NHC track forecast is in good agreement with the latest consensus 
models and is very close to the previous official forecast.

  ...GEORGETTE WEAKENS A LITTLE MORE...
 As of 8:00 AM PDT Sun Jul 31
 the center of Georgette was located near 13.1, -129.7
 with movement W at 6 mph.
 The minimum central pressure was 1005 mb

Tropical Storm Georgette Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
800 AM PDT Sun Jul 31 2022
 
Deep convection waned through the overnight hours over the center of 
Georgette. However, over the past couple of hours some regeneration 
of convection has occurred over the cyclone's southern semicircle. 
There has been no new satellite wind data over the storm since early 
this morning, but the degradation of Georgette's appearance suggests 
continued weakening has occurred since the previous advisory. A 
blend of the latest CI values from TAFB, SAB, and the UW-CIMSS ADT 
yields an intensity of 35 kt, which will be the initial advisory 
intensity.
 
Georgette is moving slowly westward, or 260/5 kt, to the south of a 
mid-tropospheric ridge. The portion of the ridge to the north of the 
cyclone should weaken through early this week as Hurricane Frank 
passes well to the north. As a result, Georgette should continue to 
slow its forward motion and then begin drifting northward early this 
week toward the temporary weakness in the ridge carved out by 
Frank.  By mid-week, the ridge is forecast to re-strengthen, 
forcing the cyclone on a more westward track. The latest NHC 
forecast track is very similar to the previous one, as the track 
guidance has changed little since that time. 
 
The outflow from the large circulation of Frank continues to produce 
some strong easterly shear across Georgette that is causing it to 
struggle maintaining persistent deep convection. This shear is 
forecast to continue for the next couple of days. Therefore, 
Georgette is expected to weaken a little more today and be a 
tropical depression through early this week.  There is some 
possiblity that the shear will decrease before Georgette passes 
over cooler waters, and some flucuation in intensity is possible 
before Georgette becomes a remnant low late in the period. The 
latest NHC intensity forecast was adjusted slightly lower than the 
previous one, and is close to the various multi-model intensity 
consensus solutions.
