Tropical Storm Frank Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
900 PM MDT Thu Jul 28 2022
 
Frank continues to become better organized this evening.  The storm 
has developed a well-defined outflow in the southern and eastern 
portions of the circulation.  Subjective satellite intensity 
estimates from TAFB and SAB both suggest Frank is a 55-kt tropical 
storm.  The initial intensity has been adjusted upward to match 
these estimates.
 
The vertical wind shear over Frank appears to be diminishing.  
Significant strengthening is expected since atmospheric and oceanic 
conditions are predicted to be conducive for intensification, and 
the most recent statistical model guidance indicates high 
probabilities for rapid intensification in the next 24 hours.  As a 
result, the official forecast now shows a faster rate of 
strengthening in the next day with a peak intensity of 95 kt by 48 
hours.  After that time, Frank is forecast to cross over cooler sea 
surface temperatures and into a more stable atmospheric environment. 
This should cause the system to weaken into a post-tropical cyclone 
by the end of the period.

Frank is moving westward at 9 kt.  The storm is forecast to turn to 
the west-northwest shortly as it is steered around the periphery of 
a subtropical ridge.  Within a day, Frank should turn northwestward 
as it moves toward a weakness in the subtropical ridge.  The NHC 
track prediction is very similar to the previous advisory forecast 
and closest to the model consensus aid, TVCE.
 
It should be noted that Frank and Tropical Storm Georgette are
expected to come close enough to one another to interact. Frank
will be the larger and dominant system during this interaction, and
Georgette will have only minor impacts on the track and intensity
of Frank.

Tropical Storm Georgette Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
200 AM PDT Fri Jul 29 2022
 
There has been little change in Georgette's structure overnight.
Earlier microwave imagery and more recent geostationary satellite
data continue to suggest that the cyclone's low-level center is
located near the eastern side of the primary convective mass.  This
is due to moderate easterly shear.  Dvorak satellite intensity
estimates remained unchanged, and therefore still support an
initial wind speed of 45 kt.
 
The cyclone is moving south of due west, or 260 degrees at 9 kt.
Georgette is forecast to move west-southwestward to
southwestward with a deceleration in forward speed as the much 
larger and stronger Tropical Storm or Hurricane Frank passes to the 
northeast.  The latest dynamical model guidance shows Georgette 
moving farther westward in the next 36 to 48 hours, before the 
storm stalls when Frank finally passes Georgette's longitude. After 
that time, the guidance takes the smaller tropical cyclone 
(Georgette) northeastward in the flow around the southeastern side 
of Frank.  Most of the models keep Georgette separate for the 
next 3 to 4 days, but there has been a significant increase in the 
spread of guidance tonight, and the uncertainty in the track 
forecast is unusually large.  The official forecast has been 
adjusted westward through 48 hours to be in better agreement with 
the various track aids.  After that time, the forecast is a blend of 
the GFS ensemble mean and the HFIP corrected consensus.
 
Moderate easterly to northeasterly shear is forecast to continue
over Georgette during the next few days.  This is likely to result
in little overall change in strength through 36 hours.  After
that time, the official forecast calls for some weakening as the
vertical shear is forecast to increase. Although the NHC forecast
calls for Georgette to dissipate in 4 to 5 days, some of the
guidance suggests that this could occur sooner.
