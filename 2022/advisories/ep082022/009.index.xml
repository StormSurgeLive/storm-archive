Tropical Storm Frank Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
900 AM MDT Fri Jul 29 2022

In infrared imagery, Frank's appearance has not changed much since 
the last advisory.  While the system shows a large curved 
convective band that wraps a little more than three-quarters of the 
way around the center, the central deep convection is a bit ragged, 
possibly due to dry air entrainment from the northwest.  However, 
recent 37 GHz microwave data shows the cyclone has developed a 
good low-level structure, with a ring of shallow to moderate 
convection surrounding a 40 n mi wide developing eye.  Satellite 
intensity estimates have changed little since the previous 
advisory, so the initial intensity remains 55 kt.

Frank will be in an environment of light vertical shear and over 
sea surface temperatures of 28-29C for the next 36 h, and the 
inner-core structure seen in the microwave imagery favors a faster 
rate of strengthening. The one current negative factor is the dry 
air entrainment that is causing the inner core deep convection to 
sputter.  The intensity forecast assumes strengthening will resume 
as the deep convection will becomes persistent, and it follows the 
trend of the intensity guidance in calling for a peak intensity of 
90 kt in 36 h. After that time, Frank should move over 
progressively cooler SSTs, with the system reaching 21C water by  
120 h.  This should cause steady to rapid weakening, and Frank is 
forecast to become a remnant low by the end of the forecast period.

The initial motion is now 300/10 kt.  Frank is moving along the 
southwest side of the subtropical ridge over northwestern Mexico, 
and it should move generally northwestward during the forecast 
period toward a developing break in the ridge west of California. 
The track guidance is in good agreement with this scenario and has 
changed little since the previous advisory. Thus, the new forecast 
track is an update of the previous forecast.
 
It again should be noted that Frank and Tropical Storm Georgette
are expected to come close enough to one another for some
interaction.  Frank will be the larger and dominant system during
this interaction, and Georgette will have little impact on the track
or intensity of Frank.

LOCATION...15.1N 123.0W
ABOUT 1010 MI...1625 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 260 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM PDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Georgette was
located near latitude 15.1 North, longitude 123.0 West. Georgette is
moving toward the west near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A west-southwest to
southwest motion at a gradually slower pace is expected during the
next few of days followed by a turn toward the northeast by early 
next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Although Little change in strength is forecast 
during the next few days, some fluctuations in intensity are 
possible in the short term due to Georgette's compact size.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM PDT.

Tropical Storm Georgette Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
800 AM PDT Fri Jul 29 2022

GOES-17 Proxy-Vis and enhanced IR imagery show that Georgette's 
cloud pattern has become more symmetric with colder -77C inner core 
cloud tops.  An earlier AMSR2 revealed an eye-like feature in the 
lower frequency band and a well-developed rain band in the north 
part of the cyclone.  The eye feature, however, was not evident in 
the infrared presentation.  Although the Dvorak subjective 
T-numbers from TAFB and SAB haven't changed; the initial intensity 
is increased to 50 kt in deference to the microwave image. 
 
The global models and the statistical intensity guidance indicate 
that the easterly shear will increase within 24 hours, causing 
Georgette to weaken slowly.  However, due to Georgette's compact 
size, intensity fluctuations are possible in the short term.  The 
latest GFS run shows that Georgette could hang on a little longer 
than the NHC forecast indicates, possibly as a post-tropical 
cyclone.  Therefore, adjusting the forecast may be deemed necessary 
to extend the cyclone's life in subsequent advisories.  The official 
forecast is very close to the HCCA and IVCN intensity aids.
 
Georgette's initial motion is estimated to be just a bit south of 
due west or 260/11 kt.  A mid-tropospheric ridge stretching 
east-northeast to west-southwest should steer the small cyclone 
west to west-southwestward during the next 48 hours.  Afterward, a 
reduction in forward speed along with a turn toward the northeast 
is expected in response to larger Frank weakening the ridge and 
disrupting the steering flow while passing to the northeast of 
Georgette.  Although the ECMWF global has been the best performer 
in the eastern Pacific this season with respect to forecast track, 
the model continues to initialize poorly the compact TC indicating 
a significantly weaker system while remaining the left tracker 
outlier.  The GFS, however, now has a more accurate depiction of 
the cyclone's size and vertical depth and shows a more direct 
response to Frank's larger wind field.  There still is quite a bit 
of uncertainty in Georgette's future track as evident by the larger 
than usual guidance spread, particularly after the northeast turn.  
Consequently, this is a low confidence forecast.  The NHC forecast 
is similar to the previous advisory through 48 hours, but has been 
adjusted to the left beyond that point to agree more with the HCCA 
and GEFS/EPS ensemble member solutions.
