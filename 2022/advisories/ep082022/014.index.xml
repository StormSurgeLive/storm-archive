Hurricane Frank Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
200 PM PDT Sat Jul 30 2022

Frank's convective pattern is currently comprised of an inner area 
of eyewall convection that is now almost surrounded by outer 
convective bands. However, an eye has not appeared since the last 
advisory, and the inner core convection is a bit sporadic and 
asymmetric.  The various satellite intensity estimates are again 
unchanged since the last advisory, so the initial intensity remains 
at 80 kt.

The hurricane is now moving over decreasing sea surface 
temperatures and it has just about run out of time to intensify.  
The center should reach the 26C isotherm in 12-18 h and reach 21C 
water by 72 h.  This should cause steady to rapid weakening to occur 
after 12 h, with Frank forecast to decay to a remnant low by 96 h.  
The new intensity forecast is adjusted downward from the previous 
advisory and it follows the trend of the intensity guidance.  It 
should be noted that near the end of the forecast period, the GFS 
model continues to show some rejuvenation of convection as the 
post-tropical cyclone interacts with an upper-level trough to its 
northwest.
 
Frank continues moving northwestward or 310/10 kt, and there is 
again little change to the track forecast scenario.  The cyclone 
should continue on a northwestward track for most of the forecast 
period while it moves along the southwestern periphery of a large
mid-level ridge toward a developing break in the ridge west of
California. The track guidance has made yet another slight shift to 
the north and east at 96 and 120 h, and the latest forecast shows a 
similar slight shift at those times.  Otherwise, it is another
update of the previous forecast that lies close to the consensus
models.

Tropical Storm Georgette Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
200 PM PDT Sat Jul 30 2022
 
Georgette has maintained a consistent structure today, characterized 
by persistent convective activity to the south and southwest of the 
estimated center. A subjective Dvorak estimate from TAFB indicates 
that the storm has maintained its intensity, and recent microwave 
imagery suggests that the low-level circulation remains well 
defined. Thus the initial intensity is held constant at 45 kt, 
consistent with the prior advisory. 

East-northeasterly steering flow continues to influence the 
west-southwestward motion, which has not changed much since the 
prior advisory. The current estimated motion is 255/8 kt. Later 
tonight, the steering currents are expected to weaken, resulting in 
a slower forward speed by tomorrow. In association with the slowing 
forward speed, track guidance diverges after 24-36 hours, and the 
spread among the guidance members suggests high uncertainty in the 
track forecast after 36 hours. Some members of the guidance suite 
indicate a sharp turn toward the northeast, while others suggest a 
continued west-southwestward motion prior to turning northward later 
in the forecast period. The official track forecast is a compromise 
between these solutions, close to the HCCA and slightly to 
the west of the prior NHC forecast. 

The intensity forecast has not changed much since the prior 
advisory. East-northeasterly vertical wind shear, close proximity 
to the much larger Hurricane Frank, and a relatively dry airmass to 
the northeast of Georgette are expected to inhibit significant 
intensification throughout the forecast period. The intensity is 
forecast to remain steady for the next day or so, with gradual 
weakening forecast to occur after the storm turns toward the 
northeast. The official intensity forecast is in line with the 
consensus aids.
