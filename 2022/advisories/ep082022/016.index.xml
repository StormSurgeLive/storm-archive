Hurricane Frank Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072022
200 AM PDT Sun Jul 31 2022
 
Frank appears to be maintaining its intensity for the time being, 
with bands of strong convection more prevalent over the southern 
portion of the circulation and a small CDO feature.  The eye has 
been apparent at times on enhanced infrared imagery, and 
upper-level outflow remains well-defined.  The advisory intensity is 
held at 80 kt, which is just above the subjective Dvorak estimates 
and close to the most recent SATCON value from UW-CIMSS. 
 
The hurricane is currently over SSTs near 26.5 deg C, and will be 
traversing cooler waters while moving into a progressively drier and
more stable air mass over the next few days.  Thus a slow but 
steady weakening trend is likely to commence today and continue for 
the remainder of the forecast period.  By 72 hours, Frank is 
projected to be over SSTs near 20 deg C, and should have degenerated 
into a remnant low.  This is consistent with simulated satellite 
imagery from the GFS and ECMWF global models that depict 
practically no remaining deep convection by that time.  The 
official intensity forecast is a little above the latest IVCN and 
HCCA consensus guidance.

Frank continues its northwestward trek and is still moving at 
about 315/10 kt.  Over the next several days, the cyclone should 
maintain this general motion while moving along the southwestern 
periphery of a large mid-level ridge, and toward a trough in the 
vicinity of 130-135 W.  Later in the forecast period, the weaker 
and more shallow system should move generally northward following 
the low-level flow.  The official track forecast is not much 
different from the previous one and is close to the latest 
corrected consensus model guidance.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM PDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Georgette was 
located near latitude 13.3 North, longitude 129.3 West. Georgette is 
moving toward the west near 7 mph (11 km/h). A westward to 
west-southwestward motion at a slower forward speed is expected 
later today. The tropical storm is then expected to slow down 
further and make a northward turn by early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Some slight additional weakening is expected later 
today, though some slight reintensification could occur early next 
week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Tropical Storm Georgette Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082022
800 PM PDT Sat Jul 30 2022
 
Georgette has looked a little less organized during the past few 
hours. Cloud tops associated with its deep convection have warmed, 
and its banding features appear to be less defined than they were 
earlier today. It's unclear if this is a sign of imminent weakening 
or just a reflection of diurnal fluctuations of the tropical 
storm's convection. Satellite intensity estimates vary from 30 kt 
to 50 kt. The NHC intensity estimate will remain 45 kt for now, 
which is notably the same as the TAFB Dvorak assessment.
 
No changes of note were made to any aspect of the NHC forecast for 
Georgette with this advisory. Unfortunately, the track component of 
the forecast is still of very low confidence.  The small tropical 
storm should continue moving generally west-southwestward to 
westward for the next day or so. By early Monday, a breakdown of 
steering currents should cause the tropical cyclone to take on a 
slow meandering motion. The much larger Hurricane Frank is forecast 
to move north of Georgette on Sunday and Monday, which could 
contribute to a slow eastward drift for Georgette. The GFS is one 
example of this scenario, however the ECMWF shows no such eastward 
movement, while other models fall between those two solutions. As a 
result, even though all models indicate that Georgette will begin 
drifting northward early next week, the model spread is quite high. 
The NHC track forecast is just a touch west of the previous advisory 
at most forecast times beyond 24 h, but is a little east of the 
multi-model consensus at most forecast times.
 
The intensity forecast is more certain. Georgette's current marginal
environment is not likely to change substantially, which
should cause it to slowly weaken through early next week.  The
intensity model spread is very low, increasing confidence in this
part of the forecast. NHC's updated intensity forecast is near the
middle of the small guidance envelope, closest to the multi-model
consensus.
