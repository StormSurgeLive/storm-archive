DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 PM GMT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gaston has 
reformed near latitude 39.3 North, longitude 35.8 West. Gaston is 
now moving toward the west near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A gradual turn to 
the west-southwest is forecast by Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast over the next few days, and
Gaston is expected to become a post-tropical cyclone tonight or on
Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gaston can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Gaston are expected to affect portions of
the Azores today.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.
 
RAINFALL:  Gaston is expected to produce additional rainfall 
accumulations of 1 to 2 inches across the western Azores today. This 
will result in storm total rainfall maxima up to 6 inches which may 
result in landslides and areas of flooding.

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
900 AM GMT Sun Sep 25 2022

Gaston continues to generate an area of deep convection near and to 
the north of the center, as the interaction with the upper-level 
trough mentioned in the previous advisory continues to provide a 
favorable environment.  The initial intensity remains 45 kt based 
on the earlier scatterometer data and a satellite intensity 
estimate of 45 kt from TAFB.

The global models suggest that the favorable trough interaction 
should end in the next 12 h or so, and after that time Gaston 
should experience strong northwesterly shear in a convergent 
upper-level environment.  This, combined with cool sea surface 
temperatures of 24-25C and a dry airmass should cause the 
convection to dissipate and Gaston to become post-tropical.  The 
new intensity forecast has minor adjustments from the previous 
forecast, with the most significant change being keep the system as 
a tropical cyclone at the 12 h point.

Gaston has moved a little to the right of the previous forecast 
with the initial motion 285/9.  A building low- to mid-level ridge 
to the north and northwest of the cyclone should cause it to turn 
westward later today and then west-southwestward, with that motion 
continuing until the system dissipates.  Since the last advisory, 
the track guidance has shifted southward in the 24-72 h period.  
So, the new forecast track is also shifted southward, with the new 
track just to the north of the consensus models.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions over the western Azores should diminish
by midday as Gaston moves away from the islands.
 
2. Gaston is expected to produce heavy rainfall over the western and
central Azores through midday. This rainfall may result in
landslides and areas of flooding.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ian was
located near latitude 14.9 North, longitude 78.8 West. Ian is moving
toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A turn toward the
northwest at a similar forward speed is expected later today, 
followed by a turn toward the north-northwest on Monday and north 
on Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Ian is forecast
to pass well southwest of Jamaica today, and pass near or west of 
the Cayman Islands early Monday.  Ian will then move near or over 
western Cuba Monday night and early Tuesday and emerge over
the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Rapid strengthening is forecast to begin later today.  Ian is 
expected to become a hurricane later today or tonight and reach 
major hurricane strength by late Monday or Monday night before it 
reaches western Cuba.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach Grand Cayman by
early Monday, with tropical storm conditions expected by tonight.
Tropical storm conditions are possible on Little Cayman and Cayman
Brac by tonight or early Monday.  Hurricane conditions are possible
within the hurricane watch area in Cuba by Monday night or early
Tuesday, with tropical storm conditions possible by late Monday.
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the tropical storm
watch area in Cuba Monday night and Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL:  Tropical Storm Ian is expected to produce the following
rainfall:
 
Jamaica and the Cayman Islands: 3 to 6 inches, with local maxima up
to 8 inches.
 
Western Cuba: 4 to 8 inches, with local maxima up to 12 inches.
 
Florida Keys to the southern and western Florida Peninsula: 2 to 4
inches, with local maxima up to 6 inches through Wednesday morning.
 
These rains may produce flash flooding and mudslides in areas of
higher terrain, particularly over Jamaica and Cuba. Flash and urban
flooding is possible with rainfall across the Florida Keys and the
Florida peninsula through mid week. Additional flooding and rises on
area streams and rivers across northern Florida and parts of the
Southeast cannot be ruled out, especially in central Florida given
already saturated antecedent conditions.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 9
to 14 feet above normal tide levels along the coast of western Cuba
in areas of onshore winds in the watch area Monday night and early
Tuesday.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Cayman Islands Sunday night into Monday.
 
Localized coastal flooding is possible along the coast of Jamaica in
areas of onshore winds on Sunday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting Jamaica and will
spread to the Cayman Islands later today.  Swells will then
spread northwestward to the southwestern coast of Cuba and the
coasts of Honduras, Belize, and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico
Monday and Monday night.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Ian Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
500 AM EDT Sun Sep 25 2022
 
Bands of deep convection have developed primarily over the
northern portion of Ian's circulation overnight, however data from
an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft show that the low- and 
mid-level centers of the tropical storm have not yet become in 
better alignment.  The Air Force plane essentially performed a 
low-level invest-like mission at about 2500 ft and found an 
east-southeast to west-northwest elongated area of light
and variable winds that is located to the southeast of the mid-level
center seen in infrared satellite imagery. Given the time spent
searching for the low-level center, the aircraft did not fully
sample the northern portion of the circulation where the strongest
winds are likely located.  Therefore, the initial intensity is held
at 45 kt, which is in line with the latest subjective and objective
satellite estimates.  It should be noted that the advisory position
is a compromise between the low- and mid-level centers as it is
quite likely that a new low-level center will form closer to the
convection and the mid-level center very soon.
 
Due to the current lack of center definition, the initial motion
estimate is a somewhat uncertain 285/10 kt.  The track forecast
philosophy remains unchanged, with Ian forecast to move around the
western periphery of a subtropical ridge located over the western
Atlantic.  Ian is forecast to turn northwestward later today,
passing near or southwest of the Cayman Islands on Monday, and
approach western Cuba on Monday night or early Tuesday.  While the
models agree on the overall scenario, there are still significant
differences regarding the exact track of the storm, especially
after 72 hours.  Even with the addition of the NOAA G-IV synoptic
surveillance dropsonde data and additional upper-air balloon
releases across much of the United States, the spread in the
guidance has not narrowed from before.  The UKMET and ECMWF models
continue to hold firm along the eastern side of the guidance and
show a track into west-central Florida, while the GFS and HWRF
remain one the western side, taking the Ian into the central or
western Florida panhandle.  The updated NHC track continues to
split these differences and remains closest to the TVCA multi-model
consensus, and the latest GFS ensemble mean.  The new track is very
similar to the previous advisory.  With the cross-track spreading
remaining between 200-220 n mi at days 4 and 5, it cannot be
overstated that significant uncertainty remains in Ian's long-range 
prediction. Another NOAA G-IV synoptic surveillance mission is 
already underway collecting data around the storm which will 
hopefully reduce some of the model spread.
 
Ian remains within an environment that appears quite conducive for
strengthening.  Once the circulation become more vertically
coherent, low vertical wind shear conditions and high ocean heat
content are expected to allow for rapid intensification while Ian
moves over the northwestern Caribbean Sea.  The Deterministic to
Probabilistic Statistical Rapid Intensification Index (DTOPS) once
again calls for a 90 percent chance of rapid strengthening during
the following 48- and 72-hour forecast periods. The NHC intensity
forecast calls for rapid intensification to begin later today, and
forecasts Ian to be a major hurricane when it nears western
Cuba in about 48 hours. The latest official intensity forecast
shows a similar peak intensity around 72 h over the southeastern
Gulf of Mexico as the previous advisory.
 
After that time, a significant increase in southwesterly shear is
predicted by the global models, and weakening is forecast to occur
while Ian approaches the Florida coast.  Despite the reduction in
intensity, Ian is likely to have an expanding wind field and will be
slowing down by that time, which will have the potential to produce
significant wind and storm surge impacts.  Users are urged
to not focus on specific forecast intensities in the 4- and 5-day
forecasts and instead focus on the potential hazards Ian may
produce across portions of Florida.
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Ian is expected to produce heavy rainfall and instances of flash
flooding and possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain,
particularly over Jamaica and Cuba.  Flash and urban flooding is
possible with rainfall across the Florida Keys and Florida peninsula
through mid week. Additional flooding on rivers across northern
Florida and parts of the Southeast cannot be ruled out.
 
2.  Hurricane or tropical storm conditions are expected on Grand
Cayman beginning early Monday.
 
3.  Ian is forecast to be a major hurricane when it passes near or
over western Cuba, and there is increasing confidence in a
life-threatening storm surge and hurricane-force winds in portions
of western Cuba beginning late Monday.  Hurricane and tropical
storm watches are now in effect for much of western Cuba.
 
4. Ian is expected to remain a major hurricane when it moves
generally northward across the eastern Gulf of Mexico during the
middle of the week, but uncertainty in the long-term track
and intensity forecast is higher than usual.  Regardless of Ian’s
exact track and intensity, there is a risk of dangerous storm
surge, hurricane-force winds, and heavy rainfall along the west
coast of Florida and the Florida Panhandle by the middle of
the week, and residents in Florida should ensure they have their
hurricane plan in place, follow any advice given by local officials,
and closely monitor updates to the forecast.

...HERMINE BECOMES A POST-TROPICAL REMNANT LOW...
...HEAVY RAINS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE ACROSS THE CANARY ISLANDS
THROUGH MONDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM CVT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...23.6N 20.2W
ABOUT 580 MI...935 KM NNE OF THE CABO VERDE ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...30 MPH...45 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 10 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1008 MB...29.77 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM CVT (0900 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Hermine was located near latitude 23.6 North, longitude 20.2 West.
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the north near 7 mph (11
km/h) and this motion is expected to continue through Sunday 
followed by a slow turn toward the northwest early Monday and a 
turn to the west-northwest Monday evening.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 30 mph (45 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Hermine is expected to dissipate in a couple of 
days.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Hermine is expected to produce 3 to 6 (75 to 150 mm)
inches of rainfall with localized higher amounts up to 10 inches
(250 mm) across the Canary Islands through Monday. This rainfall may
cause some flash flooding in areas of higher terrain.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on Hermine.  Additional information on Hermine can be 
found in High Seas Forecasts issued by Meteo France under WMO 
header FQNT50 LFPW and available on the web at

Post-Tropical Cyclone Hermine Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102022
800 AM CVT Sun Sep 25 2022
 
Hermine's structure overnight has deteriorated further.  While
occasional intermittent bursts of deep convection are still 
occurring to the north of the elongated surface circulation, this 
convection lacks organization.  The system no longer meets the 
definition of a tropical cyclone and, therefore, is being declared 
a remnant low and this will be the last NHC advisory on Hermine.
 
Strong southwesterly shear greater than 40 kt and a high
statically stable surrounding Saharan air mass should prevent the
regeneration of organized convection during the next several days.
The global models and the statistical SHIPS intensity guidance
agree that the remnant low will open up into a trough of low
pressure Tuesday, and the official forecast follows suit.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be northward, or 010/6 kt. This 
general motion is expected to continue today while the cyclone 
moves around the western periphery of a mid-tropospheric ridge. 
Beyond Monday morning, the remnant low is forecast to turn toward 
the northwest and west-northwest in response to the above mention 
ridge building westward over the extreme eastern tropical Atlantic. 
The NHC forecast track is based on the various consensus aids and 
is similar to the previous advisory.
 
Additional information on this system can be found in High Seas
Forecasts issued by Meteo France under WMO header FQNT50 LFPW and
available on the web at
