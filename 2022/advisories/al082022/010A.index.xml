Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Thu Sep 22 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Fiona, located a few hundred miles west-southwest of Bermuda, <br/>
and on Tropical Storm Gaston, located a couple of hundred miles <br/>
northwest of the central Azores. <br/>
<br/>
Southeastern Caribbean Sea:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms remain disorganized in association with a <br/>
low pressure system located over the southeastern Caribbean Sea <br/>
about 150 miles east-northeast of Curacao.  The upper-level wind <br/>
environment over the low is expected to become more conducive for <br/>
development, and a tropical depression is expected to form during <br/>
the next day or two while moving west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph <br/>
across the central Caribbean Sea.  Locally heavy rainfall and gusty <br/>
winds are likely to affect northwestern Venezuela, the ABC island <br/>
chain, and northeastern Colombia through Friday.  Interests in <br/>
Jamaica and the Cayman Islands should closely monitor the progress <br/>
of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure, associated with a tropical wave and <br/>
located about 100 miles west of Dakar, Senegal, is producing a <br/>
disorganized area of showers and thunderstorms off the coasts of <br/>
Senegal and Mauritania.  Although the system is pulling in nearby <br/>
dry air, environmental conditions are forecast to otherwise be <br/>
conducive for some development, and a tropical depression could form <br/>
by this weekend while the system moves northward at about 10 mph, <br/>
parallel to the coast of west Africa. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity has decreased since earlier today <br/>
in association with a broad area of low pressure located several <br/>
hundred miles west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands.  Despite <br/>
marginal environmental conditions, some slow development of this <br/>
system is possible over the next several days while it drifts <br/>
northwestward or northward over the central tropical Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Fiona was located
by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 
30.8 North, longitude 69.1 West. Fiona is moving toward the 
north-northeast near 20 mph (31 km/h).  A north-northeastward or 
northeastward motion with an increase in forward speed is expected 
through Friday, followed by a somewhat slower northward motion 
beginning Friday night, and this motion should continue through late 
Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of Fiona will pass just 
to the west of Bermuda tonight, approach Nova Scotia on Friday, and 
move across Nova Scotia and into the Gulf of St. Lawrence on 
Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Fiona is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Some slight weakening is expected to begin
tonight or Friday, however Fiona is forecast to be a large and
powerful post-tropical cyclone with hurricane-force winds when it
moves over Nova Scotia Friday night and Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275
miles (445 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on data from the Air 
Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft is 932 mb (27.52 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Fiona can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
tonight and continuing through Friday morning.  Tropical storm
conditions are expected to begin on Bermuda during the next few 
hours.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in portions of the hurricane
watch area in Canada by late Friday night.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible in portions of the tropical storm watch
area in Canada by late Friday.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
Bermuda: 2 to 4 inches (50 to 100 mm).
 
Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and western Newfoundland: 3 to 6
inches (75 to 150 mm), with local maximum up to 10 inches (250 mm).
This rainfall could result in areas of flooding, some of which may
be significant in nature.
 
Eastern Newfoundland: 1 to 3 inches (25 to 75 mm).
 
Eastern Quebec: 2 to 5 inches (50 to 125 mm).
 
Eastern New Brunswick: 1 to 3 inches (25 to 75 mm).
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will cause elevated water levels along
the coast of Bermuda in areas of onshore winds beginning tonight.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
A dangerous storm surge could produce coastal flooding within the
watch areas in Atlantic Canada. Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Turks and
Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, the southeastern United States
coast, and Bermuda.  These swells will continue to spread
northwestward across the western Atlantic toward the mid-Atlantic
and northeast coasts of the United States over the next day or so.
The swells will also reach Atlantic Canada on Friday. These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Fiona Discussion Number  34
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
500 PM AST Thu Sep 22 2022
 
The satellite presentation of Fiona has recovered somewhat since
this morning with the eye becoming a little better defined, and
a ring of convection with cloud tops of -65 to-70 degrees
surrounding the center.  There is a fairly large spread in the
subjective and objective satellite estimates, which range from
102 kt to 124 kt.  The initial wind speed remains near the mid
point of estimates at 115 kt, which was supported by the earlier
aircraft reconnaissance data. The next reconnaissance flight is
scheduled into the hurricane this evening.
 
The hurricane continues to accelerate north-northeastward with an
initial motion estimate of 025/17 kt.  The track forecast
reasoning has not changed from the previous advisory.  Fiona is
forecast to continue to accelerate north-northeastward tonight, 
with the hurricane making its closest approach to Bermuda overnight 
or early tomorrow.  On Friday, a vigorous mid-latitude trough that 
is forecast to move off the coast of the northeastern United States
should cause Fiona to turn northward toward Atlantic Canada.  The
dynamic models are in good agreement that the cyclone will pass
over portions of eastern Nova Scotia by Saturday morning, and then
move more slowly northward over the Gulf of St. Lawrence and
portions of Newfoundland and Labrador over the weekend.  The track
guidance remains tightly clustered, and the official forecast lies
near the center of the model envelope.
 
Fiona is expected to remain in a low shear environment and over warm
water for the next 12-24 hours.  Therefore, little change in 
intensity is expected during that time.  After 24 hours, the system 
will interact with the aforementioned trough, and Fiona is forecast 
to transition into a powerful post-tropical cyclone with 
hurricane-force winds Friday night.  Gradual weakening is predicted 
later in the weekend while the system moves northward over 
Newfoundland and Labrador. 
 
The cyclone is forecast to grow in size as it approaches Atlantic
Canada, and earlier ASCAT data showed that the tropical-storm-force
winds have already expanded over the eastern portion of the storm.
The initial and forecast wind radii have been adjusted accordingly.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane conditions are expected on Bermuda tonight through
Friday morning.
 
2. Fiona is expected to affect portions of Atlantic Canada as a
powerful hurricane-force cyclone late Friday and Saturday, and
significant impacts from high winds, storm surge, and heavy rainfall
are becoming increasingly likely. Hurricane and Tropical Storm
Watches are in effect for much of Atlantic Canada.
 
3. Large swells generated by Fiona are expected to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along much of the
east coast of the United States, the Bahamas, Bermuda, and Atlantic
Canada during the next few days.

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
900 PM GMT Thu Sep 22 2022

Gaston is beginning to approach the Azores Islands. An observation 
on Flores in the western Azores recently showed wind gusts to 
tropical storm strength in an outer band of the storm.  Satellite 
images indicate that Gaston has been relatively steady in strength 
through the day with deep convection persisting near the center and 
strong outflow continuing in the northern semicircle.  Since the 
Dvorak estimates are unchanged, the initial intensity remains 55 kt 
for this advisory.
 
The storm has slowed down slightly, with the latest initial motion 
estimated to be east-northeastward at 15 kt.  A turn to the east and 
an additional reduction in forward speed are expected overnight, 
followed by a clockwise loop near or over the central and western 
Azores on Friday and Saturday as the storm moves on the south side 
of a building ridge.  The models have trended northward at days 4 
and 5, and the NHC track forecast has been adjusted in that 
direction for those time periods.
 
Despite moderate to strong shear, relatively dry air, and cool
SSTs, Gaston has been maintaining its strength.  Given that these
conditions are only expected to gradually worsen for the system, a
slow weakening trend seems likely.  The models all show a similar
theme, and the NHC intensity forecast lies near the middle of the
guidance envelope.  Gaston is expected to become post-tropical on 
Saturday when it merges with an approaching shortwave trough.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin later tonight in 
the western Azores and will likely spread to the central Azores on
Friday.
 
2. Gaston is expected to produce heavy rainfall over the western
and central Azores beginning tonight and continuing into Saturday.  
This rainfall may result in landslides and areas of flooding.
