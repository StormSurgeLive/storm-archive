<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Fiona, located near the Turks and Caicos islands, and on Tropical <br/>
Depression Eight, located over the north-central Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located a few hundred miles east of the Windward <br/>
Islands continues to show signs of organization.  Additional <br/>
development is expected, and a tropical depression is likely to form <br/>
within the next few days as the system moves westward to <br/>
west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph across the eastern and central <br/>
Caribbean Sea. Interests in the Windward Islands should closely <br/>
monitor the progress of this system as heavy rainfall and gusty <br/>
winds could affect these islands beginning on Wednesday.  <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is forecast to move off the west coast of Africa in <br/>
a couple of days.  Thereafter, environmental conditions appear <br/>
marginally favorable for some development while the system moves <br/>
northward between west Africa and the Cabo Verde Islands through the <br/>
end of the week. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Fiona was located
near latitude 22.3 North, longitude 71.7 West.  Fiona is moving
toward the north-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h).  This general
motion is expected to continue through today, followed by a turn
toward the north tonight or on Wednesday.  A turn toward the 
north-northeast with an increase in forward speed is expected on 
Thursday.  On the forecast track, the center of Fiona will continue 
to move near the eastern Turks and Caicos during the next few hours, 
away from those islands by tomorrow, and approach Bermuda late on 
Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Fiona is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Strengthening is forecast during the next
couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150
miles (240 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft observations is 959 mb (28.32 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Fiona can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header
WTNT42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are occurring over portions of the Turks
and Caicos, and these conditions should continue for the next few
hours.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
southeastern Bahamas for the next several hours.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands: Additional local 1 to 2 inches over
the next 24 hours.
 
Southern Puerto Rico: Additional local 1 to 4 inches over the next
24 hours. Storm Total 12 to 20 inches with local maximum of 35
inches.
 
Northern Puerto Rico: Additional local 1 to 2 inches over the next
24 hours. Storm Total 4 to 12 inches with local maximum of 20
inches.
 
Dominican Republic: Additional 1 to 4 inches with local maximum of 6
inches over the next 24 hours. Storm Total up to 20 inches in the
eastern section.
 
Turks and Caicos: Additional 4 to 8 inches.
 
Southeast Bahamas: 1 to 4 inches.
 
Bermuda: 1 to 3 inches.
 
Heavy rainfall and localized life-threatening flash flooding
continues over portions of the Dominican Republic today.  Heavy
rains around the center of Fiona impacts the Turks and Caicos
through this afternoon with continued life-threatening flooding.
Localized additional flash and urban flooding is possible in Puerto
Rico.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 5 to 8 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Turks and Caicos through today.
 
Localized coastal flooding is possible for the Southeastern Bahamas
in areas of onshore winds through today.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Virgin Islands,
Puerto Rico, the northern coast of Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos
Islands, and the southeastern Bahamas.  These swells will continue
to spread westward across the southwestern Atlantic toward the
central and northwestern Bahamas and the east coast of the United
States through midweek.  Swells from Fiona are expected to spread
across Bermuda later this week.  The swells could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Fiona Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
1100 AM EDT Tue Sep 20 2022

Fiona has not changed much in organization on satellite images over 
the past several hours, with the eye obscured on visible satellite 
imagery.  Upper-level outflow is still somewhat restricted over the 
western semicircle of the system.  A recent SSMIS microwave image 
suggested that the hurricane may be undergoing an eyewall 
replacement.  Observations from Air Force and NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft indicate that the central pressure has not changed much 
from earlier this morning.  Flight-level and SFMR-observed surface 
winds from the aircraft do not support an intensity higher than 100 
kt, so the intensity is held at that value for this advisory.  This 
is also in agreement with Dvorak satellite estimates from TAFB and 
SAB, and recent NOAA Synthetic Aperture Radar data.

Numerical guidance indicates that Fiona will continue to be 
influenced by moderate west-southwesterly shear during the next 
couple of days.  However the models also indicate that the 
thermodynamic environment will be conducive for intensification 
over the next 48 hours, as Fiona passes through a moist air mass 
and over warm SSTs of 28-29 deg.  The official intensity forecast 
continues to call for Fiona becoming a category 4 hurricane, in 
agreement with the corrected consensus model guidance, HCCA.  
Beyond 72 hours, the hurricane is expected to interact with a 
vigorous mid-latitude trough moving into the Atlantic from the 
northeastern United States.  This should start the process of 
extratropical transition by 96 hours, with the transition complete 
by the end of the forecast period.  Fiona is expected to remain a 
deep and strong cyclone after extratropical transition.
 
Fiona continues to move north-northwestward, at about 330/8 kt.  
The track guidance has changed very little from the previous 
advisory.  Over the next couple of days, the hurricane should 
continue to move around the western periphery of a mid-level high 
pressure system centered to its east.  in 48-96 hours, Fiona is 
expected to move north-northeastward to northeastward with 
increasing forward speed along the southeast side of a strong 
mid-tropospheric trough.  The official track forecast is similar to 
the previous NHC prediction and in close agreement with the HCCA 
guidance. 
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Heavy rainfall and localized life-threatening flash flooding 
should continue over portions of the Dominican Republic today. 
Heavy rains should continue to impact the Turks and Caicos through 
this afternoon with continued life-threatening flooding. Localized 
additional flash and urban flooding is possible in Puerto Rico.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are affecting portions of the Turks and 
Caicos islands, while tropical storm conditions should affect 
portions of the southeastern Bahamas during the next few hours.
 
3. Interests in Bermuda should continue to monitor the progress of
Fiona.

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
900 PM GMT Tue Sep 20 2022

Satellite images indicate that deep convection is persisting near 
and to the north of the center of the cyclone during the past 
several hours. Drifting buoy 44857 recently reported a minimum 
pressure of 1009 mb near the center of the low, which is a 8 mb 
decrease from earlier today. An ASCAT-C pass from several hours ago 
showed maximum winds of about 35 kt in the northeast and northwest 
quadrants.  Based on that data, the initial intensity is increased 
to 35 kt, making the system Tropical Storm Gaston.
 
Gaston has turned north-northeastward and is moving a little faster 
than before.  The initial motion estimate is 020/15 kt.  A turn to 
the east is expected in a couple of days when the tropical storm 
moves along the northern periphery of a subtropical ridge.  By the 
end of the week, however, Gaston is expected to stall to the west of 
the Azores in weak steering currents as high pressure builds near 
and to the north of the cyclone.  After that time, a turn to the 
northwest or north is expected as Gaston moves in the flow between 
Hurricane Fiona and the ridge.  The models have trended a little 
faster this cycle, and the NHC track forecast has been adjusted 
accordingly.

Gaston is currently moving over relatively warm water, in a region 
of upper-level diffluence within a somewhat favorable moist 
environment. These factors should allow the system to strengthen 
slowly during the next day or two.  However, after that time, 
much cooler SSTs, drier air, and an increase in westerly shear 
should end the strengthening trend.  The system is expected to 
become extratropical on Saturday when it moves over SSTs just 
above 20C and merges with a mid- to upper-level trough.  The NHC 
intensity forecast is about the same as the previous one and near 
the middle of the guidance envelope. 

Interests in the Azores should monitor the forecast for Gaston.
