...GASTON WEAKENING AND SOON TO BE POST TROPICAL...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM GMT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...39.1N 37.5W
ABOUT 475 MI...765 KM W OF FAIAL ISLAND IN THE CENTRAL AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 260 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gaston was
located near latitude 39.1 North, longitude 37.5 West. Gaston is
moving toward the west near 10 mph (17 km/h) and a general west to
west-southwestward motion is expected until dissipation.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with
higher gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast over the next few days,
and Gaston is forecast to become a post-tropical tonight and
dissipate entirely later this week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Gaston are expected to affect portions of
the Azores though tonight.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM GMT.

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
900 PM GMT Sun Sep 25 2022
 
Gaston this evening consists of a well-defined, low-level swirl
absent of any deep convection. All of the earlier activity
dissipated shortly after 1200 UTC and if deep, organized convection
does not quickly return near the center, Gaston could soon become
post-tropical. Both subjective and objective Dvorak estimates have
been decreasing, though there were enough derived motion winds
between 925-850 mb (around 50 kt) to lower the intensity down to
just 40 kt for this advisory.
 
Gaston has continued to turn leftward, with the latest estimated
motion now south of due west at 260/9 kt. A deep-layer
southwest-to-northeast oriented ridge is becoming established
northwest of Gaston, which should maintain the system on a
west-southwest heading for the next several days until the
closed-circulation opens up into a trough. The guidance took another
southward shift this cycle, and the NHC track forecast follows the
guidance in bending the track a bit more southward, following the
reliable consensus aids.
 
Gaston has lost its earlier baroclinic support that maintained
instability aiding last night's convective resurgence. The global
and regional hurricane models are in good agreement that Gaston will
fail to produce any additional convective bursts in an environment
of strong northerly vertical wind shear, 24-25 C SSTs, and
significant synoptic forcing for descent on the upwind side of a
upper-level trough. Gaston is now forecast to become a post-tropical
cyclone in 12 hours, but this could occur as quickly as tonight if
convection does not return soon. The post-tropical low should
gradually fill thereafter, opening up into a trough by 60 hours.

At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ian was 
located near latitude 15.7 North, longitude 80.0 West. Ian is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). A turn toward the 
northwest is expected this evening, followed by a 
north-northwestward motion on Monday and a northward motion on 
Tuesday with a slightly slower forward speed. On the forecast track, 
the center of Ian is expected to pass well southwest of Jamaica this 
evening, and pass near or west of the Cayman Islands early Monday. 
Ian will then move near or over western Cuba Monday night and early 
Tuesday and emerge over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Rapid strengthening is forecast to begin tonight. Ian is expected to 
become a hurricane by early Monday and reach major hurricane 
strength Monday night or early Tuesday before it reaches western 
Cuba.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach Grand Cayman by
early Monday, with tropical storm conditions expected later tonight.
Hurricane conditions are expected within the warning area in Cuba by
early Tuesday, with tropical storm conditions expected by late
Monday. Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical
storm warning area in Cuba Monday night and Tuesday. Tropical storm 
conditions are possible on Little Cayman and Cayman Brac by tonight 
or early Monday.
 
RAINFALL:  Ian is expected to produce the following rainfall:
 
Jamaica and the Cayman Islands: 3 to 6 inches, with local maxima up
to 8 inches.
 
Western Cuba: 6 to 10 inches, with local maxima up to 16 inches.
 
Florida Keys into southern and central Florida Peninsula: 2 to 4
inches, with local maxima up to 6 inches beginning Monday through
Wednesday morning.
 
Heavy rainfall may affect north Florida, the Florida panhandle and
the southeast United States Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
 
These rains may produce flash flooding and mudslides in areas of
higher terrain, particularly over Jamaica and Cuba. Flash and urban
flooding are possible across the Florida Keys and the Florida
peninsula through mid week. Additional flooding and rises on
area streams and rivers across northern Florida and parts of the
southeast U.S. later this week cannot be ruled out, especially in
central Florida given already saturated conditions.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 9
to 14 feet above normal tide levels along the coast of western Cuba
in areas of onshore winds in the hurricane warning area Monday night
and early Tuesday.
 
Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore
winds in the Cayman Islands Sunday night into Monday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian are affecting Jamaica and the Cayman 
Islands. Swells will spread northwestward to the southwestern coast 
of Cuba and the coasts of Honduras, Belize, and the Yucatan 
Peninsula of Mexico on Monday and Monday night. These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. 
Please consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Ian Forecast Discussion Number 10</title>

Tropical Storm Ian Discussion Number  10...Corrected
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
1100 AM EDT Sun Sep 25 2022

Corrected timing of Ian becoming a hurricane in the intensity 
discussion below to tonight or early Monday. 
 
The satellite presentation of Ian is gradually improving this 
morning. The overall circulation appears better defined in visible 
satellite imagery, and fragmented bands of convection around the 
center are showing increased signs of curvature. The low-level 
center of Ian also appears better defined in the latest data 
collected by the NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunters. Although the 
vortex is still vertically tilted, tail Doppler radar data suggest 
the low- and mid-level centers are beginning to converge. An earlier 
center dropsonde indicated the minimum pressure dropped slightly to 
1001 mb, but the aircraft winds thus far have not reflected any 
strengthening. Therefore, initial intensity for this advisory is 
held at 45 kt.

The latest fixes suggest Ian is beginning to make its turn around 
the western side of the subtropical ridge, and the initial motion 
is west-northwestward at 290/12 kt. A gradual turn to the northwest 
is expected later today as the cyclone passes well southwest of 
Jamaica, followed by a north-northwestward motion that brings the 
center of Ian west of the Cayman Islands on Monday and near or over 
western Cuba by early Tuesday. There is relatively high confidence 
in this portion of the track forecast. However, once the cyclone 
emerges over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, the spread in the 
track guidance increases at days 3-5. The HWRF and GFS still lie on 
the western side of the guidance envelope and show Ian moving over 
the central or western Florida panhandle, while the ECMWF and UKMET 
models show a track farther east into west-central Florida. Overall, 
the NHC track forecast remains near the center of the guidance 
envelope and still lies very near the TVCA multi-model consensus. 
However, there is still significant uncertainty in the long-range 
track forecast of Ian, and future adjustments to this portion of the 
forecast will likely be required.
 
The atmospheric and oceanic conditions over the northwestern 
Caribbean Sea appear very conducive for significant strengthening. 
So once Ian becomes more organized, the high oceanic heat content 
and low vertical shear conditions appear likely to support rapid 
intensification. The Deterministic to Probabilistic Statistical 
Rapid Intensification Index (DTOPS) still shows a greater than 90 
percent chance of rapid strengthening during the next 2-3 days. The 
intensity guidance remains very aggressive with strengthening Ian, 
and the NHC forecast reflects this potential. Ian is expected to 
become a hurricane by tonight or early Monday, and is forecast to 
reach major hurricane strength before it reaches western Cuba. This 
forecast lies very near the latest SHIPS guidance and the IVCN aid. 
By day 4, a significant increase in southwesterly shear is forecast 
by the global models, and this is forecast to induce some weakening 
as the vertical structure of the hurricane is disrupted. Despite 
this, Ian is likely to have an expanding wind field and will be 
slowing down by that time, which will have the potential to produce 
significant wind and storm surge impacts across portions of the 
Florida west coast and the Florida panhandle. 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Ian is expected to produce heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and 
possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain, particularly over 
Jamaica and Cuba.  Flash and urban flooding is possible across the 
Florida Keys and Florida peninsula through mid week. Additional 
flooding on rivers across northern Florida and parts of the 
southeast U.S. cannot be ruled out later this week. 
 
2.  Life-threatening storm surge and hurricane-force winds are 
expected in portions of western Cuba beginning late Monday, where 
a hurricane warning is now in effect. Efforts to protect life and 
property should be rushed to completion. 
 
3.  Ian is expected to be a major hurricane in the eastern Gulf of 
Mexico during the middle of the week, but uncertainty in the 
long-term track and intensity forecasts is higher than usual.  
Regardless of Ian’s exact track and intensity, there is a risk of 
dangerous storm surge, hurricane-force winds, and heavy rainfall 
along the west coast of Florida and the Florida Panhandle by the 
middle of the week, and residents in Florida should ensure they 
have their hurricane plan in place, follow any advice given by 
local officials, and closely monitor updates to the forecast.
