800 PM EDT Sat Sep 24 2022<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Ian, located over the central Caribbean Sea, on Tropical Storm <br/>
Gaston, located near the western Azores, and on Tropical Depression <br/>
Hermine, located over the far eastern Atlantic. The National <br/>
Hurricane Center has issued its last advisory on Post-Tropical <br/>
Cyclone Fiona, centered near the southwest coast of Newfoundland, <br/>
Canada.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
An area of low pressure located several hundred miles west of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands is producing only limited shower activity. Any <br/>
development of this system should be slow to occur while it moves <br/>
very little through the early portion of next week. Environmental <br/>
conditions could become marginally more conducive for development by <br/>
the middle portion of next week, when the system is forecast to <br/>
begin moving slowly northward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM GMT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gaston was
located near latitude 38.8 North, longitude 33.9 West. Gaston is
moving toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue through today.  A turn to the
west-southwest is forecast by Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast over the next few days, and
Gaston is expected to become a post-tropical cyclone later today or 
tonight.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gaston can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical-storm-force winds are expected in portions of the
western Azores for a few more hours.  See products issued by the
meteorological service in the Azores for more information.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Gaston are expected to affect portions of
the Azores today.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.
 
RAINFALL:  Gaston is expected to produce additional rainfall
accumulations of 1 to 2 inches across the western and central
Azores.  This will result in storm total rainfall maxima up to 6
inches which may result in landslides and areas of flooding.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM GMT.

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
300 AM GMT Sun Sep 25 2022
 
Gaston has been interacting with an upper-level trough just to its 
west for the past several hours, which has helped to regenerate deep 
convection over the northern semicircle. This has bought Gaston some 
more time as a tropical cyclone. A pair of recent scatterometer 
overpasses revealed a swath of 35-42 kt winds over the northern 
semicircle of the tropical storm, which indicates that it is 
stronger than previously estimated. Assuming some undersampling by 
the scatterometer, the initial intensity has been adjusted to 45 kt 
to reflect this new data.
 
The upper trough that is helping to maintain the deep convection is
forecast to lift northward later this morning and be replaced by a
ridge, which should induce strong northwesterly shear over Gaston.
The combination of this shear, relatively cool SSTs of about 24
degrees C, and the presence of dry air should cause Gaston's current
convection to dissipate today, resulting in the system becoming
post-tropical. The NHC intensity forecast was adjusted higher
through 24 h due to the adjusted initial intensity and is unchanged
from the previous forecast after that time.
 
Gaston continues its westward motion at 10 kt to the south of a
mid-level ridge. By Monday, the cyclone is forecast to turn
west-southwestward and possibly southwestward as the ridge builds
its northwest. The latest NHC track forecast is little changed from
the previous one and closely follows the track consensus guidance.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions over the western Azores should diminish
by midday as Gaston moves away from the islands.
 
2. Gaston is expected to produce heavy rainfall over the western and
central Azores through midday. This rainfall may result in
landslides and areas of flooding.

issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ian was
located near latitude 14.7 North, longitude 77.7 West.  Ian is 
moving toward the west near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A turn toward the 
west-northwest and northwest at a similar forward speed is expected 
on Sunday, followed by a turn toward the north-northwest on Monday 
and north on Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Ian is 
forecast to pass well southwest of Jamaica on Sunday, and pass near 
or west of the Cayman Islands early Monday.  Ian will then move near 
or over western Cuba Monday night and early Tuesday and emerge over 
the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Rapid strengthening is forecast to begin on 
Sunday.  Ian is expected to become a hurricane on Sunday and reach 
major hurricane strength by late Monday before it reaches western 
Cuba.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach Grand Cayman by
early Monday, with tropical storm conditions expected by Sunday
night.  Tropical storm conditions are possible on Little Cayman and
Cayman Brac by Sunday night or early Monday.  Hurricane conditions 
are possible within the hurricane watch area in Cuba by Monday 
night or early Tuesday, with tropical storm conditions possible by 
late Monday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the 
tropical storm watch area in Cuba Monday night and Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL:  Tropical Storm Ian is expected to produce the following
rainfall:
 
Jamaica and the Cayman Islands: 3 to 6 inches, with local maxima up
to 8 inches
 
Western Cuba: 4 to 8 inches, with local maxima up to 12 inches
 
Florida Keys and southern Florida: 2 to 4 inches, with local maxima
up to 6 inches through Tuesday evening
 
These rains may produce flash flooding and mudslides in areas of
higher terrain, particularly over Jamaica and Cuba.  Flash and urban
flooding is possible with rainfall across the Florida Keys and the
Florida peninsula through mid next week.  Additional flooding and
rises on area streams and rivers across northern Florida and parts
of the Southeast cannot be ruled out, especially in central Florida
given already saturated antecedent conditions.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 9 
to 14 feet above normal tide levels along the coast of western Cuba 
in areas of onshore winds in the watch area Monday night and early 
Tuesday.

Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above 
normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore 
winds in the Cayman Islands Sunday night into Monday.
 
Localized coastal flooding is possible along the coast of Jamaica in
areas of onshore winds on Sunday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ian will begin affecting Jamaica 
overnight and the Cayman Islands on Sunday.  Swells will then
spread northwestward to the southwestern coast of Cuba and the
coasts of Honduras, Belize, and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico
Monday and Monday night.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Ian Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Tropical Storm Ian Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
1100 PM EDT Sat Sep 24 2022
 
A NOAA G-IV Hurricane Hunter jet flew a surveillance around and 
across Ian at high altitude earlier this evening and dropped 
several dropsondes near the estimated center.  The surface winds 
from the instruments suggested that Ian had an elongated surface 
circulation from northwest to southeast, but one dropsonde in 
particular had a lower pressure than the others, which helped to 
located the center.  Some new convection has been forming near this 
location recently, which provides a little more confidence in the 
estimate.  The minimum pressure has fallen to 1002 mb, a consensus 
of satellite intensity estimates suggests that the maximum winds are 
now near 45 kt.

The track forecast reasoning remains unchanged, with Ian expected 
to curve around the western periphery of the Atlantic subtropical 
ridge through the 5-day forecast period.  There has also been 
little change in the individual model solutions--the ECMWF remains 
on the eastern side of the guidance envelope and the GFS remains on 
the western side.  Since there has been no significant change in 
the guidance, the new NHC track forecast is very similar to the 
previous one through day 3, although it has been nudged slightly 
westward (again) on days 4 and 5 over the eastern Gulf of Mexico in 
the direction of the TVCN and HCCA consensus aids.

Ian is now in an environment of low shear and high atmospheric 
moisture and over waters of high ocean heat content.  Once the 
circulation becomes vertically stacked, which should be soon, these 
conditions favor rapid intensification (RI) while Ian moves over 
the northwestern Caribbean Sea.  Several RI indices support this 
scenario, with the Deterministic to Probabilistic Statistical Rapid 
Intensification Index (DTOPS) in particular showing a greater than 
90 percent chance of RI during the ensuing 48- and 72-hour forecast 
periods.  The NHC official forecast explicitly shows RI beginning 
on Sunday, with Ian predicted to peak at category 4 intensity over 
the eastern Gulf of Mexico in about 3 days.  

By days 4 and 5, global models are leaning toward a scenario where 
Ian enters into an environment of very strong southwesterly shear, 
and weakening is therefore expected while Ian approaches the coast 
of the Florida panhandle.  That said, Ian is likely to have an 
expanding wind field and will be slowing down by that time, which 
will have the potential to produce significant wind and storm surge 
impacts despite any potential weakening.  Users are urged to not 
focus on specific forecast intensities in the 4- and 5-day forecasts 
and instead focus on the potential hazards Ian may produce across 
portions of Florida.

 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Ian is expected to produce heavy rainfall and instances of flash 
flooding and possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain, 
particularly over Jamaica and Cuba.  Flash and urban flooding is 
possible with rainfall across the Florida Keys and Florida peninsula 
through mid next week.  Additional flooding on rivers across 
northern Florida and parts of the Southeast cannot be ruled out. 
 
2.  Hurricane or tropical storm conditions are expected on Grand
Cayman beginning early Monday.
 
3.  Ian is forecast to be a major hurricane when it passes near or
over western Cuba, and there is increasing confidence in a
life-threatening storm surge and hurricane-force winds in portions
of western Cuba beginning late Monday.  Hurricane and tropical 
storm watches are now in effect for much of western Cuba.
 
4. Ian is expected to remain a major hurricane when it moves
generally northward across the eastern Gulf of Mexico during the
middle of next week, but uncertainty in the long-term track 
and intensity forecast is higher than usual.  Regardless of Ian’s 
exact track and intensity, there is a risk of dangerous storm 
surge, hurricane-force winds, and heavy rainfall along the west 
coast of Florida and the Florida Panhandle by the middle of next 
week, and residents in Florida should ensure they have their 
hurricane plan in place, follow any advice given by local officials, 
and closely monitor updates to the forecast.

SUMMARY OF 200 AM CVT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...22.9N 20.3W
ABOUT 535 MI...860 KM NNE OF THE CABO VERDE ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 10 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1006 MB...29.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM CVT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Hermine 
was located near latitude 22.9 North, longitude 20.3 West. The 
depression is moving toward the north near 10 mph (17 km/h) and this 
motion is expected to continue during the next day or so. After that 
time, a turn toward the west-northwest or northwest is expected.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Weakening is forecast, and Hermine is expected to become a remnant 
low later today.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Hermine is expected to produce 3 to 6 (75 to 150 mm)
inches of rainfall with localized higher amounts up to 10 inches
(250 mm) across the Canary Islands through Monday. This rainfall may
cause some flash flooding in areas of higher terrain.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM CVT.

Tropical Depression Hermine Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102022
200 AM CVT Sun Sep 25 2022
 
Hermine is barely holding on a as a tropical cyclone. Southwesterly 
vertical wind shear has increased to nearly 30 kt which has stripped 
away the cyclone's deep convection across the Canary Islands.  The 
advisory intensity is set at 30 kt based on the latest Dvorak CI 
value from TAFB.  The shear is forecast to increase dramatically to 
50 kt by 24 h, and 70 kt by 48 h while Hermine remains over marginal 
SSTs and in a dry thermodynamic environment. Therefore, there is 
fairly high confidence that sustained organized deep convection will 
not regenerate near the center of the cyclone, and the system should 
become a remnant low later this morning. The NHC intensity forecast 
is unchanged from the previous one.
 
The depression is moving northward at 10 kt, and that motion is 
expected to continue during the next day or so while Hermine moves 
in the flow on the west side of a subtropical ridge.  After that 
time, a building surface ridge north of the cyclone should cause it 
to turn west-northwestward or northwestward.  The NHC track forecast 
is little changed from the previous one and remains near the middle 
of the guidance envelope.
