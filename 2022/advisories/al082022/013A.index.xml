DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Fiona was located
near latitude 35.9 North, longitude 64.2 West. Fiona is moving
toward the northeast near 35 mph (56 km/h).  A slower 
north-northeast or north motion is expected later today through 
Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Fiona will approach 
Nova Scotia later today, move across Nova Scotia and into the Gulf 
of St. Lawrence on Saturday, and then across Labrador and over the
Labrador Sea on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Fiona is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Although gradual weakening is forecast, 
Fiona is expected to be a powerful hurricane-force cyclone when it 
moves across Atlantic Canada.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 345
miles (555 km).
 
The minimum central pressure based on data from an Air Force 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 936 mb (27.64 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Fiona can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda during the
next few hours.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in portions of the hurricane
warning area in Canada late tonight or early Saturday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the tropical
storm warning area in Canada later today.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the watch area in Labrador on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
Bermuda: Rainfall is diminishing.  No additional significant
rainfall expected.
 
Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and western Newfoundland: 3 to 6
inches (75 to 150 mm), with local maximum up to 10 inches (250 mm).
This rainfall could result in areas of flooding, some of which may
be significant in nature.
 
Newfoundland and eastern Quebec:  2 to 5 inches (50 to 125 mm).
 
Eastern New Brunswick: 1 to 3 inches (25 to 75 mm).
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge could produce coastal flooding
within the warning areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of onshore
winds. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Turks and
Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, the southeastern United States
coast, and Bermuda.  These swells will continue to spread
northwestward across the western Atlantic toward the mid-Atlantic
and northeast coasts of the United States and Atlantic Canada
today.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.

Hurricane Fiona Discussion Number  37
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
1100 AM AST Fri Sep 23 2022

Fiona is pulling away from Bermuda and racing toward Atlantic 
Canada.  Although the core of Fiona missed Bermuda, the Bermuda 
Weather Service reported that there were wind gusts up to 100 kt on 
the island early this morning.  The Air Force Hurricane Hunters have 
been investigating the major hurricane and have found that it 
remains powerful and very large.  The maximum flight-level wind at 
700 mb was 144 kt in the southeast quadrant and the peak SFMR wind 
was 109 kt.  Based on these data, the initial intensity is nudged up 
to 115 kt, which makes Fiona a very dangerous category 4 hurricane 
on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Satellite images show 
that Fiona still has a relatively well-defined eye and deep 
convection over the eastern portion of the circulation, but dry air 
and westerly vertical wind shear are beginning to affect the system.
 
Satellite and aircraft fixes indicate that Fiona is moving very
quickly to the northeast at about 30 kt.  The hurricane is expected
to turn slightly to the left and slow down as it interacts and
merges with a nearby mid- to upper-level trough.  The center of
Fiona is expected to make landfall in Atlantic Canada late tonight
or early Saturday, but wind, rain, and surge impacts will begin
well before that time given the large size of the hurricane.  The
models suggest that Fiona will slow down significantly, but
continue a generally northward motion through the weekend and into
early next week.  The NHC track forecast lies close to the middle of
the guidance envelope.
 
Although Fiona is expected to begin weakening soon given the
increasing shear and dry air entrainment, there is high confidence
that Fiona will be a powerful cyclone when it moves across Atlantic
Canada.  The system is forecast to complete extratropical
transition when it merges with the trough just before or around the
time it makes landfall.  The NHC intensity forecast lies near the
high end of the guidance in the short term, but falls in line with
the IVCN and HCCA models after that.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Fiona is expected to affect portions of Atlantic Canada as a
powerful hurricane-force cyclone tonight and Saturday, and
significant impacts from high winds, storm surge, and heavy rainfall
are expected. Hurricane and Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect
for much of Atlantic Canada.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions will likely continue for a few
more hours in Bermuda.
 
3. Large swells generated by Fiona are expected to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along much of the
east coast of the United States, the Bahamas, Bermuda, and Atlantic
Canada during the next couple of days.

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
300 PM GMT Fri Sep 23 2022
 
Gaston is improving in satellite presentation this morning. 
Convection is re-forming and wrapping around the northern and 
western sides of the circulation.  A recent scatterometer pass 
showed that Gaston was slightly stronger than the previous advisory 
and the initial intensity has been increased to 55 kt.  The 
tropical-storm-force wind field was also expanded, especially in the 
northwestern quadrant based on these data.

The cyclone has managed to retain its tropical characteristics for 
now.  Global model guidance suggests moderate to strong vertical 
wind shear should gradually strip away convection from the core over 
the next day or so.  In spite of the relatively hostile conditions, 
Gaston has managed to maintain its strength, therefore only gradual 
weakening is forecast until the storm merges with a shortwave trough 
in about 36 hours and becomes a post-tropical cyclone.  The official 
intensity forecast has been shifted slightly higher than the 
previous advisory due to the initial intensity and is slightly 
stronger than the consensus model aids.

The storm is moving east-southeastward at an estimated 120/6 kt.  A 
sharp turn to the south is expected shortly while Gaston traverses 
the periphery of a mid-level ridge building to the north.  
Afterward, the cyclone should generally move toward the 
west-southwest and west, completing an anticyclone turn, through the 
end of the period.  The NHC forecast has been nudged slightly 
northward once again from the previous forecast and lies between the 
HCCA and TVCN multi-model consensus aids.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of the
western Azores, and are spreading to the central Azores.
 
2. Gaston is expected to produce heavy rainfall over the western
and central Azores today through Saturday.  This rainfall may
result in landslides and areas of flooding.

Tropical Depression Nine Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
1100 AM EDT Fri Sep 23 2022
 
The depression remains highly sheared this morning. Visible
satellite imagery and data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft indicate the center of the system is still exposed 
to the east of the associated deep convection. The center also 
appears a bit elongated, with a couple of low-level swirls evident 
in satellite imagery that appear to be rotating around a mean 
center. The aircraft winds and a blend of the latest satellite 
estimates support an initial intensity of 30 kt for this advisory.
 
The long-term motion of the depression is still west-northwestward 
at 12 kt. The cyclone is expected to move more westward over the 
next 24-36 h as a narrow low- to mid-level ridge builds to the north 
of the system. Then, an amplifying deep-layer trough over the 
eastern U.S. is forecast to weaken the ridge beginning on Sunday, 
which should cause the cyclone to turn northwestward and northward 
as it approaches western Cuba early next week. There is increased 
spread in the guidance for this portion of the track forecast, with 
day 5 positions that span from the eastern Gulf to east of the 
Florida peninsula. The latest NHC track forecast lies near the 
center of the guidance envelope and closely follows the IVCN and 
HCCA aids. This prediction is very similar to the previous one, 
with only slight westward adjustments at days 3-5 to reflect the 
latest model consensus trends.
 
The moderate to strong deep-layer northeasterly shear over the 
cyclone is expected to persist through tonight, so only slight 
strengthening is forecast through early Saturday. But once the shear 
decreases to less than 10 kt this weekend, more significant 
intensification is forecast as the cyclone moves over SSTs in excess 
of 30 deg C. The latest NHC intensity forecast has been increased 
from the previous one and explicitly calls for rapid intensification 
as the cyclone crosses the northwestern Caribbean Sea. The system 
is forecast to approach the Cayman Islands and Cuba as a 
strengthening hurricane, with additional intensification likely once 
it emerges over the warm waters of the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. 
In fact, this forecast calls for the system to approach the Florida 
peninsula as a major hurricane by day 5, which is supported by the 
latest IVCN and HCCA aids.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. The depression is expected to produce heavy rainfall and 
instances of flash flooding and possible mudslides in areas of 
higher terrain in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao. Heavy rains are also 
likely to spread into Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, and Cuba in the 
coming days.
 
2. The depression is expected to approach Jamaica as a tropical
storm on Sunday and the Cayman islands as a hurricane on Monday.
Watches for these locations may be required later today or on
Saturday.
 
3. Early next week the system is forecast to move near or over 
western Cuba as a strengthening hurricane and then approach the 
Florida peninsula at or near major hurricane strength, with the 
potential for significant impacts from storm surge, hurricane-force 
winds, and heavy rainfall. While it is too soon to determine the 
exact magnitude and location of these impacts, residents in Cuba, 
the Florida Keys, and the Florida peninsula should ensure they have 
their hurricane plan in place and closely monitor forecast updates 
through the weekend.

Tropical Depression Ten Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102022
200 PM CVT Fri Sep 23 2022

Satellite images indicate that the strong tropical wave that NHC has 
been tracking for several days over western Africa has developed a 
well-defined surface center over the far eastern Atlantic with 
organized bands of convection.  Dropsonde data from a DC-8 aircraft 
with the NASA field program Convective Processes EXperiment-Cabo 
Verde (CPEX-CV) has been quite useful in determining the central 
pressure and surface circulation definition of the low, with the 
central pressure of 1003 mb based on the dropsondes.  The initial 
wind speed is set to 30 kt, perhaps conservatively since the eastern 
side of the circulation has not been sampled by scatterometer or 
aircraft data.

The system is moving north-northwestward at about 10 kt.  A large 
break in the eastern Atlantic subtropical ridge should cause this 
system to move generally northward ahead of a mid-level trough 
before turning westward and accelerating as a shallow system beneath 
the low-level ridge.  The forecast is close to the model consensus, 
with heavier weight being placed on the global models than the 
regional hurricane track models. 

The depression has about a day over warm water in light to moderate 
shear before all the models blast the system with strong upper- 
level southwesterly winds.  Most of the guidance shows this system 
becoming a tropical storm before weakening significantly by late 
this weekend and dissipating early next week.  The official wind 
speed prediction is near the NOAA corrected-consensus guidance HCCA.

Note that 2 to 4 inches of rain is possible over the Canary Islands 
through this weekend due to a combination of the mid-level trough 
and moisture from this system, which is a bit unusual for that area.
