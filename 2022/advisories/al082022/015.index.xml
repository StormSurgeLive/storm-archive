DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Fiona was located
near latitude 42.3 North, longitude 60.7 West.  Fiona is moving
toward the north near 46 mph (74 km/h).  A slower
north-northeast or northward motion is expected through Sunday.  On
the forecast track, the center of Fiona will approach Nova Scotia
tonight, move across Nova Scotia and into the Gulf of St.
Lawrence on Saturday, and then move across Labrador and over the 
Labrador Sea by late Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Fiona is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Although gradual weakening is forecast during
the next couple of days, Fiona is expected to be a powerful
hurricane-force cyclone when it moves across Atlantic Canada.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 345
miles (555 km).  Sable Island, Nova Scotia, reported a wind gust of 
43 mph (69 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 935 mb (27.61 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Fiona can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in portions of the
hurricane warning area in Canada late tonight or early Saturday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in portions of the
tropical storm warning area in Canada tonight.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the watch area in Labrador on Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall:
 
Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and western Newfoundland: 3 to 6
inches (75 to 150 mm), with local maxima of up to 10 inches (250
mm).  This rainfall could result in areas of flooding, some of
which may be significant in nature.
 
Labrador and eastern Quebec:  2 to 5 inches (50 to 125 mm).
 
Eastern New Brunswick: 1 to 3 inches (25 to 75 mm).
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding within the warning areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of
onshore winds. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the northwestern
Bahamas, the eastern United States coast, and Bermuda.  These
swells are now reaching Atlantic Canada this evening.  The swells 
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Fiona Discussion Number  38
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
500 PM AST Fri Sep 23 2022

Fiona is beginning to take on the appearance of an extratropical 
cyclone.  The cloud pattern is becoming more elongated and 
asymmetrical, with cooler-air stratocumulus clouds near the western 
semicircle of the cyclone.  The eye became obscured a few hours ago 
and, assuming gradual weakening since the last Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft mission into the system, the current intensity is set at 
110 kt.

Satellite center fixes indicate that Fiona has been moving very 
rapidly toward the north-northeast, or about 030/35 kt.  The 
numerical guidance is in good agreement that the cyclone will slow 
its forward speed during the next few days while it interacts with 
a mid- to upper-level trough.  The center of Fiona is expected to 
make landfall in Atlantic Canada by Saturday morning, but wind, 
rain, and surge impacts will begin well before that time given the 
large size of the hurricane. The NHC track forecast is mainly a 
blend of the GFS and ECMWF global model solutions, and similar to 
the previous official track prediction.
 
Fiona is expected to slowly weaken during the next few days due to 
increasing shear and dry air entrainment.  In 12 hours, the 
system should become embedded within a baroclinic zone, and 
be transformed into an extratropical cyclone.  This is also 
indicated by simulated infrared satellite imagery from the global 
models.  However, there is high confidence that Fiona will remain a 
powerful cyclone, with hurricane-force winds, when it moves across 
Atlantic Canada.  The system should wind down into a gale center by 
the time it reaches the southeastern Labrador Sea.  The official 
forecast is near the high end of the model guidance.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Fiona is expected to affect portions of Atlantic Canada as a
powerful hurricane-force cyclone tonight and Saturday, and
significant impacts from high winds, storm surge, and heavy rainfall
are expected. Hurricane and Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect
for much of Atlantic Canada.
 
2. Large swells generated by Fiona are expected to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along much of the
east coast of the United States, the northwestern Bahamas, Bermuda, 
and Atlantic Canada during the next couple of days.

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
300 AM GMT Sat Sep 24 2022
 
Gaston continues to decline. Its associated deep convection has been
stripped away by strong northwesterly vertical wind shear, and the
cyclone now consists of a swirl of mainly low-level clouds with
embedded squalls. The initial intensity has been lowered to 45 kt
based on the latest Dvorak CI value from TAFB.
 
The storm has made its anticipated turn to the southwest and is now 
moving at 220/7 kt. A building ridge to the north of Gaston should 
turn the cyclone westward later today, and this motion is expected 
to continue until the system dissipates late in the forecast 
period. The latest NHC forecast track is little changed from the 
previous one. On this track, Gaston will move near or over the 
central and western Azores today.
 
Dry air, relatively cool SSTs of 24-25 degrees C, and persistent
strong vertical wind shear should cause Gaston to struggle to
maintain persistent organized deep convection. Therefore, further
weakening is anticipated, and the cyclone is forecast to become
post-tropical by tonight, if not sooner. The latest NHC intensity
forecast was lowered slightly from the previous one and is close to
the various multi-model consensus intensities.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
western and central Azores today.
 
2. Gaston is expected to produce heavy rainfall over the western and 
central Azores today. This rainfall may result in landslides and 
areas of flooding.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Nine was
located near latitude 14.8 North, longitude 71.5 West.  The
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24
km/h).  A westward motion is expected to begin tonight and continue
through Saturday night, followed by a turn toward the northwest and
north-northwest on Sunday and Monday.  On the forecast track, the
center of the cyclone is forecast to move across the central
Caribbean Sea through Saturday, pass south of Jamaica on Saturday
night and Sunday, and approach the Cayman Islands on Sunday night
and early Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some slow strengthening is forecast during the next day or
so, and the depression is expected to become a tropical storm 
tonight or on Saturday.  More significant intensification is 
forecast on Sunday and Monday, and the system is forecast to become 
a hurricane by early Monday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Nine can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO
header WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible in the Cayman Islands by
early Monday, with tropical storm conditions possible by late
Sunday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible on Jamaica by
Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Nine is expected to produce the
following rainfall:
 
Southern Haiti and Southern Dominican Republic: 2 to 4 inches, with
local maximum up to 6 inches
 
Jamaica and the Cayman Islands: 4 to 8 inches, with local maximum up
to 12 inches
 
Western to central Cuba: 6 to 10 inches, with local maximum up to 14
inches.
 
Heavy rains may begin to affect South Florida on Monday. Limited
flash and urban flood impacts may be possible with this rainfall.
 
These rains may produce flash flooding and mudslides in areas of
higher terrain, particularly over Jamaica and Cuba.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to
3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas
of onshore winds in the Cayman Islands Sunday night into Monday.
 
Localized coastal flooding is possible along the coast of Jamaica in
areas of onshore winds on Sunday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by this system will begin affecting Jamaica,
the Cayman Islands, and Cuba over the next several days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Depression Nine Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
500 PM EDT Fri Sep 23 2022

The organization of the depression has slightly improved since this 
morning. The low-level center has been decoupled from the deep 
convection for much of the day, but in recent satellite imagery 
it appears the center may be drawing closer to a more recent burst 
of convective activity. Unfortunately, earlier scatterometer data 
missed the center of the cyclone, and the satellite intensity 
estimates still range from 25-35 kt. The initial intensity is held 
at 30 kt for this advisory, and an Air Force Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft is on its way to investigate the system this evening.

The system is still moving west-northwestward at 290/13 kt, but it 
is expected to turn westward tonight and continue on that heading 
through Saturday as a ridge develops to its north. Then, a deep- 
layer trough over the eastern U.S. is forecast to erode the ridge 
into early next week. This should result in a turn toward the 
northwest and north-northwest while the cyclone passes near the 
Cayman Islands early Monday and approaches western Cuba Monday 
night. Once again, the global models have shifted westward this 
cycle during this period, and there remains increased track 
uncertainty late in the forecast period once the cyclone emerges 
into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. The latest NHC track forecast 
has been adjusted westward from 48-120 h, and it lies near or 
slightly east of the latest track consensus aids.

Recent satellite trends suggest the cyclone may already be nearing 
a lower shear environment, and once that occurs, the atmospheric 
and oceanic conditions appear very conducive for strengthening 
through early next week. As the cyclone moves within a moist and 
unstable environment over sea-surface temperatures greater than 30 
deg C, it is forecast to rapidly intensify over the northwestern 
Caribbean Sea and continue strengthening while it approaches 
western Cuba on Monday night. The very warm waters of the 
southeastern Gulf of Mexico should allow for more strengthening 
once it crosses Cuba, and the NHC forecast once again shows the 
system approaching the Florida peninsula as a major hurricane by 
the middle of next week.

Based on the latest forecast, a Hurricane Watch has been issued 
for the Cayman Islands, and a Tropical Storm Watch has been 
issued for Jamaica.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. The depression is expected to produce heavy rainfall, flash 
flooding and possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain in 
Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao. Heavy rains are also likely to spread 
into Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, and Cuba in the coming days.
 
2. A Tropical Storm Watch has been issued for Jamaica, with 
tropical storm conditions possible on the island by Sunday. A 
Hurricane Watch has been issued for the Cayman Islands, with 
hurricane conditions possible by early Monday and tropical storm 
conditions possible by late Sunday.
 
3. Early next week the system is forecast to move near or over
western Cuba as a strengthening hurricane and then approach the
Florida peninsula at or near major hurricane strength, with the
potential for significant impacts from storm surge, hurricane-force
winds, and heavy rainfall. While it is too soon to determine the
exact magnitude and location of these impacts, residents in Cuba,
the Florida Keys, and the Florida peninsula should ensure they have
their hurricane plan in place and closely monitor forecast updates
through the weekend.

Tropical Storm Hermine Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102022
200 AM CVT Sat Sep 24 2022
 
Hermine has changed little in organization since earlier this 
evening. Persistent deep convection has been occurring in the 
northeastern quadrant, with the estimated low-level circulation 
center located just to the southwest of the edge of the convection. 
The initial intensity remains 35 kt based on the latest Dvorak 
intensity estimate from TAFB.

The cyclone has turned northward and is moving at a heading of 350/9 
kt toward a break in the eastern Atlantic subtropical ridge. A 
northward to northeastward motion is expected into early next week 
while Hermine remains in tact. A turn to the northwest is expected 
by 72 h as the cyclone becomes shallow and steered by the low-level 
flow. The latest NHC track forecast is near the previous one through 
60 h, but is a little to the right thereafter due to an overall 
shift in the track guidance. 

Hermine now has about 18-24 hours to intensify in the presence of 
marginal SSTs and moderate southwesterly vertical wind shear. After 
24 h, the southwesterly shear is forecast to progressively increase 
while dry air gets pulled into the storm's environment. Therefore 
weakening is expected after that time, and both the ECMWF and GFS 
simulated satellite imagery suggests that Hermine should degenerate 
into a remnant low devoid of deep convection on Monday. The latest 
NHC intensity forecast is unchanged from the previous one, and is on 
the high end of the guidance.
 
Hermine is expected to produce 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated 
totals of 6 inches, over the Canary Islands through this weekend due 
to a combination of a mid-latitude trough and moisture from the 
cyclone. This rainfall could cause some flash flooding in areas of 
higher terrain.
