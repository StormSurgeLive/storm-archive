DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Fiona
was located near latitude 48.4 North, longitude 60.5 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the northeast near 8 mph (13
km/h). A faster north-northeast or north motion is expected
through Monday.  On the forecast track, the center of Fiona will
move across Labrador and over the Labrador Sea late tonight and 
Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is expected during the next couple of
days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 550 miles (890 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface 
observations is 952 mb (28.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Fiona can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml.
 
WIND:  Gale-force and storm-force winds are expected to continue
across portions of Atlantic Canada through early Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  Fiona is forecast to produce 1 to 2 inches (25 to 50 mm) 
of rainfall across portions of Atlantic Canada, with storm total 
maxima as high as 10 inches (250 mm) across Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and western Newfoundland. Flooding 
is expected, some of which could be significant.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Fiona Discussion Number  42
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072022
500 PM AST Sat Sep 24 2022
 
Fiona remains a large and potent extratropical low pressure system.
Even though the maximum winds have decreased just below
hurricane-force, ASCAT data and surface observations show that
Fiona has a very large wind field.  The initial wind speed is
estimated to be 60 kt.
 
Fiona has slowed down significantly, and the system is now moving
northeastward at 7 kt.  A faster north to north-northeast motion is
expected, taking the center of the system across Labrador tonight
and early Sunday.  The NHC track forecast is similar to the
previous one.
 
Since the tropical warnings have been discontinued for Atlantic
Canada, this is the last NHC advisory on Fiona.  For information on
this system, see forecasts issued by Environment Canada at
https://weather.gc.ca/.  Additional information can be found in
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under
AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online
at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Fiona is forecast to continue to affect portions of Atlantic
Canada through early Sunday, and significant impacts from high
winds, storm surge, and heavy rainfall are expected.
 
2. Heavy rains from Fiona are expected to continue to impact
portions of Atlantic Canada into Sunday. This rainfall is expected
to produce flooding, some of which could be significant.
 
3. Large swells generated by Fiona are expected to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the coast of
the northeast United States, Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada during
the next couple of days.

products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gaston was
located near latitude 38.2 North, longitude 31.8 West. Gaston is
moving toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue through Sunday.  A turn to the
southwest is forecast by late Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual weakening is forecast over the next few days, and Gaston is
expected to become a post-tropical cyclone overnight or Sunday
morning.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Gaston can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml.
 
WIND:  Tropical-storm-force winds are expected in portions of the
western Azores for the next several hours.  See products issued by
the meteorological service in the Azores for more information.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Gaston are expected to affect portions of
the Azores through tonight.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
 
RAINFALL:  Gaston is expected to produce additional rainfall
accumulations of 1 to 2 inches across the western and central
Azores.  This will result in storm total rainfall maxima up to 6
inches which may result in landslides and areas of flooding.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1200 AM GMT.
Next complete advisory at 300 AM GMT.

Tropical Storm Gaston Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082022
900 PM GMT Sat Sep 24 2022
 
Gaston still lacks any deep convection near the center of its 
circulation.  There is a burst of convection, mentioned in the 
previous advisory, that is now northwest of Faial island and over a 
hundred miles from the center of the storm. The subjective and 
objective Dvorak classifications have decreased to 30-40 kt. 
Thus, the initial intensity has been lowered to 35 kt to be a blend 
of these estimates.

Strong vertical wind shear and dry environmental conditions 
continue to weaken Gaston.  These adverse atmospheric conditions 
are not expected to improve for the remainder of the forecast 
period, and the storm should gradually weaken.  The official 
forecast is slightly lower than the previous prediction due to the 
decrease in initial intensity.  Gaston is still expected to become 
fully post-tropical within 12 hours.  Global model simulated 
satellite imagery, however, indicate a mid-latitude shortwave 
trough interacting with post-tropical Gaston early Sunday morning 
could develop isolated deep convection, but this should be a 
short-lived event.

Gaston has made its turn to the west and is moving 280/10 kt.  The 
storm should continue to move generally westward for the next day 
or so as it is steered by a building ridge to the north.  The ridge 
is then expected to turn the cyclone to the west-southwest and 
southwest through the end of the forecast period.  The model 
guidance has shifted to the north this forecast cycle.  The 
official track forecast follows the northward guidance trend and 
now lies on the south side of the guidance, though north of the 
previous advisory.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions over the western Azores should 
diminish overnight as Gaston moves away from the islands.
 
2. Gaston is expected to produce heavy rainfall over the western and 
central Azores through early Saturday.  This rainfall may result in 
landslides and areas of flooding.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Jamaica has discontinued the Tropical Storm Watch
for Jamaica.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Grand Cayman
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Little Cayman and Cayman Brac
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests in western and central Cuba, the Florida Keys, and the
Florida peninsula should monitor the progress of Ian.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ian was 
located near latitude 14.3 North, longitude 77.0 West. Ian is moving 
toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h), and this general motion is 
expected to continue through early Sunday. A turn toward the 
northwest and north-northwest is forecast on Sunday and Monday, 
followed by a northward motion on Tuesday. On the forecast track, 
the center of Ian is forecast to pass well southwest of Jamaica on 
Sunday, and pass near or west of the Cayman Islands Sunday night and 
early Monday. Ian will then move near or over western Cuba late 
Monday and emerge over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate
that maximum sustained winds remain near 45 mph (75 km/h) with
higher gusts. Significant strengthening is forecast during the next
few days. Ian is forecast to become a hurricane by late Sunday and a
major hurricane by late Monday or early Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ian can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach Grand Cayman by
early Monday, with tropical storm conditions expected by Sunday
night. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Little Cayman and 
Cayman Brac by Sunday night.
 
RAINFALL: Ian is expected to produce the following rainfall:
 
Southern Haiti and Southern Dominican Republic: 2 to 4 inches, with
local maxima up to 6 inches
 
Jamaica and the Cayman Islands: 3 to 6 inches, with local maxima up
to 10 inches
 
Western Cuba: 4 to 8 inches, with local maxima up to 12 inches
 
Florida Keys and southern Florida: 2 to 4 inches, with local maxima
up to 6 inches through Tuesday evening
 
These rains may produce flash flooding and mudslides in areas of
higher terrain, particularly over Jamaica and Cuba.  Flash and urban
flooding is possible with rainfall across the Florida Keys and the
Florida peninsula through mid next week. Additional flooding and
rises on area streams and rivers across Florida cannot be ruled out
through next week given already saturated antecedent conditions.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 2 to
4 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas
of onshore winds in the Cayman Islands Sunday night into Monday.
 
Localized coastal flooding is possible along the coast of Jamaica in
areas of onshore winds on Sunday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Ian will begin affecting Jamaica and the
Cayman Islands on Sunday and spread westward to Cuba by Monday.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.

<title>Tropical Storm Ian Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Tropical Storm Ian Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092022
500 PM EDT Sat Sep 24 2022
 
The satellite presentation of Ian has improved this afternoon. The
associated deep convection shows increased signs of organization,
and the deep-layer shear appears to have diminished over the cyclone
based on more extensive upper-level outflow noted in visible
satellite imagery. An Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft found
850-mb peak flight level winds of 44 kt and several SFMR retrievals
greater than 40 kt, while dropsonde data suggest the minimum
pressure has not changed much since the previous flight. A blend of
these data support an initial intensity of 40 kt for this advisory.
 
The aircraft data suggest the center could be re-forming slightly
west of previous estimates, so the initial motion is an uncertain
265/14 kt. Ian is expected to move westward through early Sunday
before turning northwestward around the southwestern periphery of a
ridge to the north. A north-northwestward to northward motion is
forecast on Monday and Tuesday as the center of Ian passes near or
over the western tip of Cuba and emerges over the southeastern Gulf
of Mexico. Overall, the westward trend in the track models
continues, with the latest GFS on the far left side of the guidance
envelope and the ECMWF on the right edge. The track forecast is
still highly uncertain at days 4-5, with the GFS and ECMWF positions
about 200 n mi apart by 96 h. There is significant spread noted even
among the GFS ensemble members, with positions that range from the
north-central Gulf of Mexico to the west coast of Florida.
Hopefully, data collected from special radiosonde releases and a
NOAA G-IV flight this evening will help better resolve the steering
flow around Ian and the deep-layer trough that is forecast to be
over the eastern U.S. early next week. The latest NHC track forecast
is once again adjusted westward, and further adjustments may be
needed given the increased uncertainty in the day 3-5 period.
 
Ian is expected to significantly strengthen over the next few
days as it moves within a low shear environment over SSTs greater
than 30 deg C in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. As the structure
of the cyclone continues to improve and Ian develops an inner core,
rapid intensification (RI) appears very likely. The SHIPS-RII
probabilities continue to highlight this potential, with a 66
percent chance of a 65-kt intensity increase in 72 h. The NHC
intensity forecast has been raised substantially through 96 h, and
it now shows Ian reaching major hurricane strength by late Monday
before it nears western Cuba. These changes closely follow the IVCN
and HCCA consensus aids, although there remains guidance even higher
than the current forecast. Ian is forecast to remain a major
hurricane as it moves northward across the eastern Gulf of Mexico
and approaches Florida. Environmental conditions could become less
favorable late in the period due to southerly shear associated with
the aforementioned trough, but Ian is expected to remain a large
and powerful hurricane through the period.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Ian is expected to produce heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and
possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain, particularly over
Jamaica and Cuba. Limited flash and urban flooding is possible with
rainfall across the Florida Keys and Florida peninsula through mid
next week.
 
2.  Hurricane or tropical storm conditions are expected on Grand
Cayman beginning early Monday.
 
3.  Ian is forecast to be a major hurricane when it passes near or
over western Cuba, and there is increasing confidence in a
life-threatening storm surge and hurricane-force winds in portions
of western Cuba beginning late Monday.
 
4. Ian is expected to remain a major hurricane when it moves
generally northward across the eastern Gulf of Mexico during the
middle of next week, but uncertainty in the track forecast is higher
than usual.  Regardless of Ian’s exact track, there is a risk of
dangerous storm surge, hurricane-force winds, and heavy rainfall
along the west coast of Florida and the Florida Panhandle by the
middle of next week, and residents in Florida should ensure they
have their hurricane plan in place, follow any advice given by local
officials, and closely monitor updates to the forecast.

...HERMINE WEAKENS TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION...
...HEAVY RAINS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE ACROSS THE CANARY ISLANDS FOR
ANOTHER DAY OR SO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 PM CVT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.8N 20.6W
ABOUT 460 MI...735 KM NNE OF THE CABO VERDE ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 360 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1003 MB...29.62 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM CVT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Hermine
was located near latitude 21.8 North, longitude 20.6 West. The
depression is moving toward the north near 10 mph (17 km/h) and this 
motion is expected to continue during the next day or so. After 
that time, a turn toward the northwest is expected.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Weakening is forecast, and Hermine is expected 
to become a remnant low in a day or so.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Hermine is expected to produce 3 to 6 (75 to 150 mm)
inches of rainfall with localized higher amounts up to 10 inches
(250 mm) across the Canary Islands through this weekend. This
rainfall may cause some flash flooding in areas of higher terrain.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM CVT.

Tropical Depression Hermine Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102022
800 PM CVT Sat Sep 24 2022
 
Hermine has generally changed little during the past several hours 
and it continues to produce heavy rains across the Canary Islands. 
The cyclone remains strongly sheared with the low-level center 
exposed well to the south-southwest of the main area of deep 
convection due to strong southwesterly shear. The initial intensity 
is lowered to 30 kt, which is near the high end of the satellite 
estimates.  This makes Hermine a tropical depression. 
 
The storm is moving northward at 9 kt, and that motion is expected
to continue during the next day or two while Hermine moves in the
flow on the west side of a subtropical ridge.   After that time, a
turn toward the left is expected as the shallow system is steered by
the low-level flow.  The NHC track forecast remains near the middle
of the guidance envelope.
 
Hermine is expected to move into a region of even stronger shear,
drier air, and cooler SSTs, which should cause the storm to 
slowly weaken. The GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite images show 
that the system should lose all of its deep convection tomorrow, 
and the NHC forecast now shows the system becoming a remnant low in 
24 hours.
