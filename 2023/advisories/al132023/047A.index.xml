Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 290 miles (465 km)
from the center. Beaver Island Nova Scotia recently reported a 
sustained wind of 52 mph (83 km/h) with a gust to 61 mph (98 km/h). 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 983 mb (29.03 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions will continues in portions of the 
warning areas today.  The strong winds are leading to some downed 
trees and power outages.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the
east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Lee is expected to produce an additional 1 inch (25 mm) 
or less, across eastern portions of New Brunswick.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge will produce coastal flooding
within the wind warning areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of
onshore winds. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Post-Tropical Cyclone Lee Discussion Number  47
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
1100 PM AST Sat Sep 16 2023
 
Satellite imagery, surface observations and Canadian radar imagery 
indicates that the center of Lee is over the Bay of Fundy, near the 
coast of New Brunswick. Rain bands continue to spread across 
portions of far eastern Maine and New Brunswick this evening. Drier 
air is wrapping into the system and has eroded most of the 
convection on the southern and eastern side of the circulation. 
Recent observations and a recent partial ASCAT pass support an 
intensity of 50 kt for this advisory.
 
The forward motion of Lee is slower than earlier today, as the 
system has stated to make a northeastward turn . This northeastward 
motion with an increase in forward speed is expected late tonight 
and Sunday, as the system moves across the Canadian Maritimes. The 
NHC forecast track is very similar to the previous forecast.
 
Strong wind shear, dry air, and land interaction should cause
steady weakening over the next day or so as Lee spins down.  The
global models are in agreement that Lee should dissipate on Monday,
and no real changes were made to the NHC intensity forecast.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions and coastal flooding are occurring
across portions of Atlantic Canada, and will continue to spread
northward within the Tropical Storm Warning areas. The strong winds
are leading to downed trees and power outages.
 
2. Any additional rainfall from Lee may produce localized urban and 
small stream flooding in portions of eastern Maine and portions of  
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.
 
3. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents will continue
to affect the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic Canada, Bermuda, the
Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Hispaniola,  and Puerto
Rico through Sunday.

----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...33.9N 40.5W
ABOUT 805 MI...1295 KM WSW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 260 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM GMT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Margot was
located near latitude 33.9 North, longitude 40.5 West. Margot is
moving toward the west near 8 mph (13 km/h)  A westward to
west-northwestward motion is expected during the next 24 hours.
A faster northward to northeastward motion is forecast to begin
Sunday night, and a east-northeastward is expected Monday and
Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h)
with higher gusts. Additional weakening is forecast during the next
day or so, and Margot is now forecast to become a post-tropical
cyclone by Sunday night or Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Margot will continue to affect the
Azores for the next several days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM GMT.

Tropical Storm Margot Discussion Number  39
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
300 AM GMT Sun Sep 17 2023
 
Strong northerly vertical wind shear and dry mid-level air have
taken a toll on Margot during the past 24 hours.  Deep convection
became displaced to the south of the center earlier today, and
within the past 6 hours or so, the deep convection has essentially
dissipated.   The initial intensity has been lowered to 40 kt,
which is a blend of the latest Dvorak T and CI numbers from TAFB.
 
Margot has completed a clockwise loop over the past few days, and 
the storm is now moving westward at 7 kt.  A mid-level ridge to the 
north of Margot should steer the cyclone westward to 
west-northwestward for about another 24 hours.  After that time, the 
ridge is predicted to slide eastward and then southward causing 
Margot to turn northward, and then east-northeastward to eastward 
around the northern side of the ridge.  The track guidance continues 
to be in good agreement with this scenario and only minor 
adjustments to the previous NHC track were needed.
 
The environment ahead of Margot is not expected to improve during 
the next couple of days.  Moderate to strong shear and dry air is 
likely to prevent the return of organized deep convection during the 
next day or two, Margot is now forecast to become a post-tropical 
cyclone during that time. On Monday night into Tuesday, the cyclone 
is forecast to interact with an approaching mid-latitude trough that 
could produce enough instability to allow for a return of deep 
convection and some slight restrengthening.  Shortly after that 
time, northwesterly shear and another surge of dry air should cause 
a gradual spin down of the winds.

Tropical Storm Nigel Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
1100 PM AST Sat Sep 16 2023

The satellite presentation of the cyclone has improved this evening 
as there has been an increase in convective banding over the 
northern portion of the circulation.  The center appears to be 
located near the southern portion of the convective mass.  Dvorak 
Data T-numbers from both SAB and TAFB were T2.5 (35 kt) at 0000 UTC 
and objective satellite estimates from UW/CIMSS are in the 35 to 40 
kt range.  Based on these data, the initial intensity has been 
raised to 35 kt.  Nigel becomes the 10th named storm to form in 
the Atlantic basin since August 20th. 

Nigel is moving northwestward at about 14 kt.  A mid-level ridge 
to the northeast of the cyclone should steer the storm 
northwestward during the next few days.  After that time, Nigel is 
expected to turn northward around the western side of the ridge. By 
the middle of next week, the global model guidance indicates that 
the storm should turn northeast ahead of a broad mid-latitude 
trough over the western Atlantic.  There is fairly good agreement 
in the global model guidance on the overall scenario, but there are 
some timing or forward speed difference later in the period.  The 
NHC forecast track is near the HFIP corrected consensus which is 
close to a blend of the latest GFS and ECMWF models. 

Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive for steady 
intensification during the next few days, with low vertical wind 
shear and warm sea surface temperatures along the forecast track.  
A period of rapid intensification is is certainly possible within 
the next two to three days.  Although the SHIP RI probabilities are 
not very high at the moment, DTOPS gives a 50 percent chance of a 65 
kt increase in intensity during the next 72 hours. The NHC forecast 
is close to that, showing a 60 kt increase in strength during the 
time.  After 72 hours, increasing southwesterly shear is likely to 
cause gradual weakening.  The NHC wind speed forecast is closest to 
the HFIP corrected consensus.
