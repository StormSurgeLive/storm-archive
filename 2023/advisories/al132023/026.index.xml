Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD<br/>
200 PM EDT Mon Sep 11 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Lee, located a few hundred miles north of the northern Leeward <br/>
Islands, and on Tropical Storm Margot, located over the central <br/>
subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL97):<br/>
A weak area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands is producing disorganized <br/>
shower and thunderstorm activity. Development of this system is <br/>
unlikely before it merges with a tropical wave incoming from <br/>
the east during the next couple of days. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent. <br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located over the far eastern tropical Atlantic <br/>
between the Cabo Verde Islands and the west coast of Africa is <br/>
producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Environmental <br/>
conditions appear conducive for gradual development of this system, <br/>
and a tropical depression could form by the weekend while it moves <br/>
westward to west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the central <br/>
tropical Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent. <br/>

...LEE REMAINS A SLOW MOVING MAJOR HURRICANE...
...HAZARDOUS SURF AND RIP CURRENT CONDITIONS EXPECTED AT BEACHES
ACROSS THE WESTERN ATLANTIC ALL WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...23.6N 64.2W
ABOUT 380 MI...610 KM N OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 600 MI...970 KM S OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...115 MPH...185 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...948 MB...28.00 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Lee.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 23.6 North, longitude 64.2 West. Lee is moving toward
the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A slow west-northwest to
northwest motion is expected during the next couple of days,
followed by turn toward the north by midweek. On the forecast track,
Lee is expected to pass near, but to the west, of Bermuda in a few
days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Lee is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in strength is forecast during
the next couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 75 miles (120 km) from 
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 
miles (295 km). Saildrone 1064 located to the west of the Lee's 
center in the last few hours reported a sustained wind of 70 mph 
(113 km/h) and wind gust of 88 mph (142 km/h).   
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 948 mb (28.00 inches). 
Saildrone 1064 located to the west of the Lee's center recently a 
surface pressure of 974 mb (28.79 inches). 
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, and Bermuda.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Dangerous surf and rip currents have begun to
affect portions of the southeastern U.S. coast, and these conditions
are forecast to spread northward along much of the U.S. East Coast
during the next day or two. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
1100 AM AST Mon Sep 11 2023
 
Lee has been holding steady in strength this morning.  The NOAA 
Hurricane Hunters have been investigating Lee and found that the 
minimum pressure was around 948 mb while a combination of the 
measured flight-level and SFMR winds support holding the initial 
intensity at 105 kt.  The aircraft data have also shown a clear 
indication of concentric eyewalls, which will likely cause 
fluctuations, both up and down, in Lee's intensity over the next day 
or two.

The major hurricane is moving slowly toward the northwest at about 
7 kt.  A continued slow motion between west-northwest and northwest 
is expected during the next couple of days as Lee continues to be 
steered by a mid-level high to its north-northeast. Around the 
middle of the week, the ridge is expected to shift eastward as a 
mid- to upper-level trough amplifies over the eastern U.S.  This 
pattern change should cause Lee to turn northward with an increase 
in forward speed.  The models have generally changed little this 
cycle, and only small changes were made to the previous NHC track 
forecast.  Lee is likely to pass near, but to the west of Bermuda, 
late Thursday and Friday and be situated offshore of the 
mid-Atlantic states and New England by the end of the forecast 
period. 

As mentioned above, fluctuations in strength are likely in the 
short term due to eyewall replacement cycles, but there is an 
opportunity for some strengthening during that time since the 
system is expected to remain over very warm waters and in 
relatively low wind shear conditions.  Beyond a couple of days, 
however, progressively cooler waters and a notable increase in 
shear should cause Lee to gradually weaken.  Although the weakening 
is forecast later in the week, Lee is expected to significantly 
increase in size and hazards will extend well away from the center 
of the storm by the end of the forecast period. 


KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents will affect
portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto
Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, 
Bermuda, and most of the U.S East Coast through much of the week.
 
2. Lee could bring strong winds, rainfall, and high surf impacts to
Bermuda later this week. Interests there should monitor the latest
forecasts.
 
3. It remains too soon to know what level of additional impacts Lee 
might have along the Northeast U.S. coast and Atlantic Canada late 
this week and this weekend, however, wind and rainfall hazards will 
likely extend well away from the center as Lee grows in size. Users 
should continue to monitor updates to the forecast of Lee during the 
next several days.

Hurricane Margot Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
900 PM GMT Mon Sep 11 2023
 
Satellite images this afternoon indicate that Margot continues to 
strengthen with a more defined eye present while recent microwave 
data shows improvement in the overall eye pattern. The latest TAFB 
Dvorak intensity estimate of 65 kt, combined with the improved 
satellite structure provides enough support to set the initial wind 
speed at 65 kt this forecast cycle, making Margot the fifth 
hurricane of the Atlantic season. 

Margot is moving northward at about 10 kt. This motion is expected 
to continue for the next couple of days before a slowing trend 
occurs as Margot bends to the north-northwest due to a building 
ridge to the east of the hurricane. Further slowing in the storm's 
motion is expected by this weekend as a large mid-latitude ridge 
blocks its path, effectively stalling the system. Beyond that time, 
there continues to be uncertainty in the track with the various 
model guidance showing a wide spread of possible solutions. The new 
forecast lies near the previous NHC track, shifted a bit to the 
west at long range. 

The environment will continue to become more conducive for further 
strengthening over the next 36 to 48 hours, with a gradual decrease 
in vertical shear expected while Margot remains over relatively warm 
waters of around 28 deg C. Beyond 72 hours, increasing shear and 
drier air working into the system is likely to weaken Margot some. 
The new forecast shows an increase in intensity through 48 hours 
based on the expected favorable environment and higher statistical 
guidance, leaning toward the Florida State Superensemble and NOAA 
corrected-consensus models.
