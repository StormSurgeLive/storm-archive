Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Wed Sep 6 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Lee, located over the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL96):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure, associated with a tropical wave, is <br/>
producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the far <br/>
eastern Atlantic, which are beginning to spread over the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands.  Environmental conditions appear conducive for gradual <br/>
development of this system, and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form later this week while moving toward the west-northwest at about <br/>
15 mph over the eastern and central tropical Atlantic.  The low is <br/>
expected to move across the Cabo Verde Islands overnight and early <br/>
Thursday, and interests there should monitor its progress.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Northeastern Atlantic (ex-Franklin):<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity associated with Post-Tropical <br/>
Cyclone Franklin, located a few hundred miles west-northwest of the <br/>
northwestern coast of Spain, has changed little in organization <br/>
today.  This system could briefly acquire some subtropical or <br/>
tropical characteristics while it moves northward and then meanders <br/>
northwest of Spain and Portugal overnight and on Thursday, but <br/>
environmental conditions appear to become unfavorable for further <br/>
development by Thursday night.  For additional information, <br/>
including gale warnings, see High Seas Forecasts issued by Meteo <br/>
France.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>

Additional information on Post-Tropical Cyclone Franklin can be <br/>

...LEE FORECAST TO BECOME AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS MAJOR HURRICANE BY 
FRIDAY...
...LARGE OCEAN SWELLS LIKELY TO REACH THE LESSER ANTILLES, THE 
VIRGIN ISLANDS, AND PUERTO RICO THROUGH THE WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.4N 47.7W
ABOUT 1035 MI...1665 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...80 MPH...130 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...989 MB...29.21 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands should monitor the
progress of Lee.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 15.4 North, longitude 47.7 West.  Lee is moving toward
the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h), and this motion is 
expected to continue through Friday.  A slower motion toward the 
west-northwest is expected over the weekend.  
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast, and rapid 
intensification is expected to begin on Thursday.  Lee could become 
a major hurricane by early Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 989 mb (29.21 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are expected to reach portions of
the Lesser Antilles on Friday, and reach the British and U.S.
Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Bahamas, and Bermuda
this weekend.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.

<title>Hurricane Lee Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 06 2023
 
Lee has an asymmetric structure this evening, with the bulk of the 
convective activity located to the east of the center.  Dvorak 
estimates from TAFB and SAB were a pair of T4.0s/65 kt, but 
objective Dvorak estimates from UW-CIMSS are a little higher.  
Therefore, Lee's initial intensity is set at 70 kt.

The initial motion remains west-northwestward, or 295/12 kt, with 
Lee situated to the south of the subtropical ridge.  Ridging is 
expected to build westward, and even out ahead of the hurricane 
over the southwestern Atlantic, during the next 5 days.  As a 
result, Lee is likely to maintain a west-northwestward trajectory 
but gradually slow down beyond day 2, with its forward speed 
decreasing to about 7 kt by day 5.  The new NHC track forecast 
is right on top of the previous prediction during the first 
3 days of the forecast.  After that, the official forecast has been 
nudged westward, leaning toward the latest TVCX and HCCA consensus 
aids.  The track model envelope continues to indicate that the 
core of Lee will pass to the north of the northern Leeward 
Islands.  However, interests in those islands should continue to 
monitor Lee's forecasts as the typical three-day NHC track error is 
about 90 n mi, and the northernmost Leeward Islands currently have 
a 1-in-4 chance of experiencing sustained tropical-storm-force 
winds on the southern side of the storm.
 
Global model fields show a well-defined upper-level anticyclone 
developing over Lee during the next 24 hours and persisting over 
the hurricane into the weekend, which should keep the deep-layer 
shear quite low.  In addition, oceanic heat content values will 
double along Lee's track during the next 3 days.  As a result, 
rapid intensification (RI) is forecast to begin on Thursday, and 
following the previous forecast, a 65-kt increase in strength is 
predicted during the next 3 days, bringing Lee to high-end category 
4 intensity.  This forecast lies close to the HAFS dynamical model 
and HCCA consensus aid solutions, and it is also supported by very 
high RI probabilities from the DTOPS scheme for the 36-, 48-, and 
72-hour forecast periods.  Fluctuations in intensity are likely by 
days 4 and 5 due to potential eyewall replacements, but Lee is 
still expected to be a large and dangerous hurricane over the 
southwestern Atlantic early next week.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Lee is forecast to become a major hurricane by early Friday, 
with its core moving north of the northern Leeward Islands, the 
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico this weekend into early next week.  
There is the potential for tropical storm conditions to occur on 
some of these islands over the weekend, and interests there should 
monitor future updates to Lee's forecast.
 
2. Swells generated by Lee are expected to reach portions of the
Lesser Antilles on Friday, and the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, 
Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Bahamas, and Bermuda this weekend.  
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions.
