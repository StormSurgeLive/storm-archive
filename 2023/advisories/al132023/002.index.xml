Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Tue Sep 5 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on newly formed <br/>
Tropical Depression Thirteen, located over the central Tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL96):<br/>
A broad low pressure system associated with a strong tropical wave <br/>
off the coast of West Africa, is producing a large area of showers <br/>
and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions appear conducive for <br/>
gradual development, and a tropical depression could form over the <br/>
far eastern tropical Atlantic during the middle to latter part of <br/>
the week while the system moves west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph. <br/>
This system is expected to move across the Cabo Verde Islands <br/>
Wednesday night and Thursday, and interests there should monitor its <br/>
progress.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Northeastern Atlantic (ex-Franklin):<br/>
Post-Tropical Cyclone Franklin is located a few hundred miles <br/>
northeast of the Azores, and is forecast to move quickly <br/>
east-southeastward towards warmer waters east of the Azores.  This <br/>
system could acquire some subtropical or tropical characteristics <br/>
later this week or this weekend while it moves erratically between <br/>
the Azores and Portugal. For additional information on this system, <br/>
including gale warnings, see High Seas Forecasts issued by Meteo <br/>
France.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Thirteen Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
1100 AM AST Tue Sep 05 2023

Satellite images indicate that the tropical wave (Invest AL95) that 
we have been following for several days has become better organized 
this morning, with many curved low-level banding features.  A 
partial scatterometer pass near 1201 UTC indicated a well-defined 
center had formed, with winds speeds of about 30 kt.  Thus, 
advisories have been initiated on Tropical Depression Thirteen, and 
the current intensity is set to 30 kt.

The depression is moving west-northwestward at about 13 kt.  A 
mid-level ridge over the central Atlantic is expected to persist to 
the north of the tropical cyclone, keeping the system moving with 
this general motion through Saturday.  The spread in the model 
guidance is remarkably low for a first advisory, and the official 
forecast is near or west of the model consensus.  However, it 
should be noted that the NOAA corrected-consensus aids and some 
ensemble members are still to the left of the official forecast, so 
it is too early to determine exactly how close this system will get 
to the Leeward Islands given the average track forecast error at 
those time ranges.

The environment around the depression appears to be conducive for 
strengthening.  The only obvious hindering factor is 
light-to-moderate northeasterly shear, which should keep the 
intensification rate in check in the short term.  However, in two to 
three days, this shear is forecast to relax with an upper-level 
ridge building near the cyclone, and the system should be moving 
over record-warm waters of near 30 deg C east of the Lesser Antilles 
(that would look more in place in the Gulf of Mexico).  These 
factors could support rapid intensification by the end of the week, 
although it too early to determine exactly when this might occur 
until a better-defined inner core forms.  The NHC intensity forecast 
is extremely bullish for a first forecast, but remarkably lies 
below the intensity consensus.  All indications are that the 
depression will become a strong hurricane by the end of the forecast 
period.

KEY MESSAGES:

1. The depression is forecast to become a major hurricane by 
this weekend and could bring impacts to the Leeward Islands by that 
time. While it is too soon to determine the location and magnitude 
of these possible impacts, interests in this area should monitor 
the progress of the depression and updates to the forecast.
