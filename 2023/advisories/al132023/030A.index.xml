NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD<br/>
200 PM EDT Tue Sep 12 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Lee, located several hundred miles south of Bermuda, and on <br/>
Hurricane Margot, located over the central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic (AL97 and AL98):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure over the eastern tropical Atlantic <br/>
continues to produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms. This <br/>
system is expected to consolidate, with a low on the western side <br/>
becoming dominant over the next day or two. Gradual development of <br/>
the low is expected after that, and a tropical depression is likely <br/>
to form by this weekend while the system moves west-northwestward <br/>
or northwestward at about 15 mph across the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent. <br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 25.0 North, longitude 66.5 West.  Lee is moving toward
the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h).  Lee is forecast to turn toward
the north on Thursday and increase in forward speed.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Lee is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some slow weakening is forecast during the 
next 48 hours, though the wind field will remain large.
 
Lee is very large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend outward
up to 125 miles (205 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force
winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km).  Saildrone 1036, 
located about 70 miles (115 km) northwest of Lee's center, recently 
reported a wind gust to 92 mph (148 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 946 mb (27.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm force winds are possible on Bermuda starting
early Thursday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, and Bermuda.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Dangerous surf and rip currents are affecting
portions of the southeastern U.S. coast, and these conditions are
forecast to spread northward along much of the U.S. East Coast and
Atlantic Canada during the next couple of days. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Outer rain bands from Lee may produce rainfall amounts of 
1 to 2 inches, 25 to 50 millimeters, across Bermuda Thursday into 
early Friday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
500 PM AST Tue Sep 12 2023
 
GOES-East satellite and information from an Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter plane indicate a slight recent improvement in the 
inner-eye structure with a 5-mb pressure fall noted in the most 
recent pass.  However, peak 700-mb flight-level winds were lower 
than 6 hr ago with SFMR estimates about the same.   Given the mixed 
signals, we will maintain the initial wind speed at 100 kts for 
this advisory.   The big change in the aircraft data was the sizable
expansion of the whole wind field in the eastern semicircle 
of the hurricane, which was also shown by a late-arriving SAR pass 
this morning.

Lee has turned northwestward (315/6 kt) as the mid-level ridging 
continues to its north and east.  A digging eastern United States 
trough remains on track to weaken the ridge during the next few 
days.  Lee is expected to turn more northward and accelerate by 
Thursday as a result of this pattern change.  Even though the core 
of Lee is expected to be well west of Bermuda, Lee's large wind 
field could arrive early Thursday on the island.  After day 3, 
there is an increase in guidance spread as the hurricane interacts 
with an approaching frontal zone, which could cause a small 
leftward bend in the track.  However, recent guidance has tightened 
somewhat, and the official forecast follows a middle-ground 
solution similar to the GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means, on the fast side 
of the consensus. 

The hurricane is expected to gradually weaken over the next few 
days while it moves over cooler waters into a higher-shear 
environment.  Still, all of the guidance keep this system quite 
large and at hurricane-strength for the next few days.  Once the 
circulation reaches the colder water north of the Gulf Stream, more 
significant weakening is expected at the day 4-5 period as it 
quickly transitions to an extratropical low.  Little change was 
made to the previous forecast, which is also close to the consensus 
aids, and the forward speed north of the Gulf Stream will be 
important in the exact wind speed as Lee approaches the mainland.

Note- The 34- and 50-kt wind speed probabilities beyond 36 hours in 
the text product and graphics are likely underestimating the risk 
of those winds occurring. This is because the forecast wind field 
of Lee is considerably larger than average compared to the wind 
field used to derive the wind speed probability product.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents will affect
portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto
Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas,
Bermuda, and most of the U.S East Coast through much of the week.
 
2. There is an increasing risk of strong winds, rainfall, and high
surf impacts to Bermuda later this week, and a Tropical Storm Watch
remains in effect for the island.
 
3. It remains too soon to know what level of additional impacts Lee
might have along the northeastern U.S. coast and Atlantic Canada
late this week and this weekend.  However, since wind and rainfall
hazards will extend well away from the center as Lee grows in size,
users should continue to monitor updates to Lee's forecast during
the next several days.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Margot was located 
near latitude 31.7 North, longitude 39.6 West. Margot is moving 
toward the north near 14 mph (22 km/h). A turn toward the 
north-northwest at a slower forward speed is expected beginning 
tomorrow. A meandering northward motion is then expected on Thursday 
and Friday. Margot's track beyond Friday is unusually uncertain, but 
a slow meandering motion is generally expected into the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts. Slight fluctuations in intensity, up or down, are possible 
during the next several days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 265
miles (425 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 977 mb (28.85 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Margot will begin to affect the Azores on
Wednesday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM GMT.

<title>Hurricane Margot Forecast Discussion Number 22</title>

Hurricane Margot Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
900 PM GMT Tue Sep 12 2023

As quickly as it re-appeared earlier today, Margot's eye 
disappeared again this evening. Consequently, Dvorak-based 
intensity estimates have decreased a little, with a blend of Data-T 
and Current Intensity values supporting an intensity near 70 kt. 
Based on recent AMSR microwave imagery, Margot still has a double 
eyewall, and a SAR overpass earlier this morning indicated that the 
winds in the outer eyewall were just as high as the inner one.

Margot has continued moving northward today, and should turn 
north-northwestward tomorrow. Beyond about 60 h, there is a 
significant increase in model forecast spread, and therefore, 
forecast uncertainty. The ECMWF and GFS highlight this uncertainty, 
showing very different forecasts for a ridge that is supposed to 
build to the north of Margot over the next 3 days, which results in 
a very different track for the hurricane. However, ensemble 
forecasts from those models indicate that their deterministic model 
solutions are part of a wide spectrum of possible tracks for Margot. 
The ECMWF track ensemble, for instance, has approximately 27 degrees 
of latitude spread between members at 120 h. We don't have a clear 
reason to favor any one solution at this time, so the NHC forecast 
is near the multi-model consensus. It is possible that large track 
adjustments will be needed to future NHC forecasts.

For the next few days, Margot's intensity should stay relatively 
steady, and this is supported by nearly every normally-reliable 
intensity model. Beyond about 72 h, the track of Margot will have an 
influence on its intensity, which increases the uncertainty. 
Depending on the exact evolution and path of Margot, it could hold 
its intensity for a bit longer, or quickly begin a transition to a 
remnant low. The NHC forecast is in the middle of these solutions, 
showing steady weakening, but the uncertainty in the intensity 
forecast is also unusually high.
