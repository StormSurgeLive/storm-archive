...LEE EXPECTED TO REMAIN A POWERFUL HURRICANE THROUGH EARLY NEXT 
WEEK...
...DANGEROUS BEACH CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP AROUND THE
WESTERN ATLANTIC THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.2N 54.5W
ABOUT 565 MI...910 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...155 MPH...250 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...942 MB...27.82 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 18.2 North, longitude 54.5 West. Lee is moving toward
the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h)  and this motion is
expected to continue through early next week with a significant
decrease in forward speed.  On the forecast track, Lee is expected
to pass well to the north of the northern Leeward Islands, the
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico over the weekend and into early
next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 155 mph (250 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Lee is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are likely 
over the next few days, however Lee is expected to remain a 
powerful hurricane through early next week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 942 mb (27.82 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are expected to reach portions of the
Lesser Antilles later today, and reach the British and U.S. Virgin
Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the
Bahamas, and Bermuda this weekend. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Dangerous surf and
rip currents are expected to begin along most of the U.S. East Coast
beginning Sunday.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
1100 AM AST Fri Sep 08 2023
 
The satellite presentation of Lee degraded somewhat this morning. 
The small eye has become cloud filled and the overall cloud pattern 
has become more asymmetric. There has been no indication of 
concentric eyewalls so far, and the recent filling appears to be the 
result of some moderate (15-20 kt) southwesterly shear as diagnosed 
by a shear analysis from UW/CIMSS.  Within the past hour or so, the 
small eye has once again become a little better defined.  Both NOAA 
and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft have been in the 
storm this morning.  The NOAA aircraft has measured a peak 8000 ft 
flight-level wind of 143 kt, and the Air Force plane has found peak 
700-mb flight level winds of 132 kt.  SFMR surface estimates have 
peaked in the 130-143 kt range.  The pressure has risen to around 
942 mb.  Using a blend of these data the initial intensity is set at 
135 kt. Fluctuations in intensity like what has occurred this 
morning are not uncommon in intense hurricanes.  Although Lee's 
current intensity is lower than the overnight peak, the hurricane 
remains very powerful.
 
The latest global model guidance suggests that the moderate shear
over the hurricane is likely to continue during the next day or
so. This along with potential eye wall replacement cycles are likely
to result in additional fluctuations in intensity during that 
time, which are very difficult to time and predict.  By later this 
weekend, the upper-level wind pattern could become a little more 
conducive and some restrengthening is possible. Regardless of exact 
details of the intensity forecast, confidence is high that Lee will 
remain a powerful hurricane during the next several days.
 
Lee has been moving west-northwestward at about 11 kt. The
hurricane should continued to be steered west-northwestward to the
south of a subtropical ridge over the central Atlantic.  The
western extent of the ridge is forecast to weaken by early next
week, and Lee's forward speed is expected to slow considerably
around days 3-5. The track guidance continues to be tightly
clustered during the forecast period, and the NHC track is near 
the middle of the guidance envelope.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Lee's core is expected to move well north of the northern
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico this weekend
and early next week.
 
2. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents are likely in
the northern Leeward Islands beginning today.  These conditions
will spread westward and northward, affecting Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, and Bermuda
through the weekend.
 
3. It is way too soon to know what level of impacts, if any, Lee
might have along the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic Canada, or Bermuda
late next week, particularly since the hurricane is expected to
slow down considerably over the southwestern Atlantic.  Regardless,
dangerous surf and rip currents are expected along most of the U.S.
East Coast beginning Sunday.  Continue to monitor updates to Lee's
forecast during the next several days.

Tropical Storm Margot Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
500 AM AST Fri Sep 08 2023
 
Deep convection has been gradually increasing near and to the north 
of the center of Margot during the past few hours.  The satellite 
intensity estimates range from 30 to 38 kt, and based on that data, 
the initial wind speed is held at 35 kt.

Margot is moving to the west-northwest at about 14 kt on the 
southwest side of a mid-level ridge.  The storm is expected to 
gradually turn to the northwest and then the north as it moves 
toward a weakness in the ridge induced by a mid- to upper-level low 
over the central subtropical Atlantic.  The models are in fairly 
good agreement, but there are some differences on where and when 
Margot makes the northward turn.  The NHC track forecast is similar 
to the previous one and near the middle of the guidance envelope.
 
Global models show Margot strengthening for unconventional reasons. 
While there are sufficiently warm ocean water along the forecast 
track, deep-layer vertical wind shear is expected to be strong to 
moderate as the storm nears an upper-level low pressure.  Typically, 
increased shear would lead to a weakening cyclone, but Margot could 
be positioned beneath an area of diffluence leading to increased 
convection and therefore, strengthening.  The NHC intensity forecast 
is similar to the previous one and near the IVCN and HCCA consensus 
models.
