WIND:  Tropical storm force winds are possible on Bermuda starting
early Thursday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, and Bermuda.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Dangerous surf and rip currents are affecting
portions of the southeastern U.S. coast, and these conditions are
forecast to spread northward along much of the U.S. East Coast and
Atlantic Canada during the next couple of days. Please consult
products from your local weather office.

RAINFALL: Outer rain bands from Lee may produce rainfall amounts of 
1 to 2 inches, 25 to 50 millimeters, across Bermuda Thursday into 
early Friday.
