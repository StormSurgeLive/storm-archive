Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Tue Sep 5 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
upgraded Tropical Storm Lee, located over the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL96):<br/>
A broad low pressure system located several hundred miles southeast <br/>
of the Cabo Verde Islands and a nearby tropical wave are producing a <br/>
large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Environmental <br/>
conditions appear conducive for some gradual development of this <br/>
system, and a tropical depression could form later this week or this <br/>
weekend while the system moves west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph <br/>
over the eastern tropical Atlantic. This system is expected to move <br/>
across the Cabo Verde Islands Wednesday night and Thursday, and <br/>
interests there should monitor its progress.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Northeastern Atlantic (ex-Franklin):<br/>
Post-Tropical Cyclone Franklin, located a few hundred miles <br/>
east-northeast of the Azores, is producing limited shower activity <br/>
to the south and east of its center. This system could briefly <br/>
acquire some subtropical or tropical characteristics during the next <br/>
couple of days while it makes a counterclockwise loop over the <br/>
northeastern Atlantic. By late this week, further development is not <br/>
expected as the system is forecast to become increasingly elongated <br/>
and weaken. For additional information on this system, including <br/>
gale warnings, see High Seas Forecasts issued by Meteo France.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Lee Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
1100 PM AST Tue Sep 05 2023
 
The satellite structure of Lee has continued to improve tonight. A 
prominent curved band of deep convection wraps around the western 
and southern portions of the circulation. Recent SSMIS and GMI 
microwave images reveal deep convection is occurring near the 
center, though it is slightly displaced by some northeasterly shear. 
There are also hints of a formative inner core trying to take shape, 
all of which suggest that Lee is strengthening. The initial 
intensity is raised to 45 kt for this advisory, in best agreement 
with a T3.0 Dvorak classification from TAFB.
 
Lee continues to move west-northwestward at about 15 kt. A mid-level 
ridge over the central subtropical Atlantic is expected to be the 
primary steering mechanism for the next several days, with Lee 
forecast to continue on a west-northwestward heading across the 
central tropical Atlantic through the forecast period. Once again, 
the track guidance is in fairly good agreement on this scenario. 
Overall, the latest NHC track forecast is very similar to the 
previous prediction, with only minor adjustments that keep our 
forecast between the simple and corrected consensus aids. Users are 
reminded that the average NHC forecast track errors are around 125 
and 175 n mi on days 4 and 5, respectively. Thus, it is too soon to 
determine exactly how close this system will be to the Leeward 
Islands by the weekend.
 
The atmospheric and oceanic conditions appear extremely favorable 
for rapid intensification (RI) during the next several days, 
particularly once the northeasterly shear over Lee subsides in a day 
or so. The forecast track of Lee brings the cyclone over anomalously 
warm SSTs during the next several days, with generally low shear and 
favorable upper diffluence to support significant strengthening. The 
updated NHC intensity forecast has been adjusted slightly higher 
than the previous one, toward the latest IVCN and HCCA aids. This 
forecast calls for Lee to become a hurricane in 24 h and a major 
hurricane by 60 h, with continued intensification thereafter. It is 
noted that the regional hurricane models depict even stronger 
solutions, so future adjustments could be necessary. Regardless, 
Lee bears close monitoring as there is high confidence it will 
become a very powerful hurricane by this weekend.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Lee is forecast to become a major hurricane by late this week and 
could bring impacts to the Leeward Islands this weekend. While it is 
too soon to determine the location and magnitude of these possible 
impacts, interests in this area should monitor the progress of Lee 
and further updates to the forecast.
