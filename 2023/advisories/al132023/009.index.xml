Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Thu Sep 7 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Lee, located over the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL96):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to show signs of organization in <br/>
association with an area of low pressure located over the eastern <br/>
tropical Atlantic near the Cabo Verde Islands.  Environmental <br/>
conditions are generally conducive for additional development, and a <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form during the next day or so <br/>
while the disturbance moves toward the west-northwest at about 15 <br/>
mph.  Heavy rain and gusty winds associated with this system are <br/>
now occurring over the Cabo Verde Islands, and these conditions are <br/>
expected to continue during the next several hours. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Northeastern Atlantic (ex-Franklin):<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity associated with Post-Tropical <br/>
Cyclone Franklin, located a few hundred miles west-northwest of the <br/>
northwestern coast of Spain, have not become better organized and <br/>
the system remains frontal.  The chances of subtropical or tropical <br/>
development have decreased as the system meanders northwest of Spain <br/>
and Portugal. Environmental conditions are expected to become even <br/>
more unfavorable for development by tonight.  For additional <br/>
information, including gale warnings, see High Seas Forecasts issued <br/>
by Meteo France.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>

...LEE RAPIDLY STRENGTHENING...
...LARGE SWELLS LIKELY TO REACH THE LESSER ANTILLES, THE VIRGIN
ISLANDS, AND PUERTO RICO THIS WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.4N 50.0W
ABOUT 870 MI...1405 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...105 MPH...165 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...983 MB...29.03 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands should monitor the
progress of Lee.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 16.4 North, longitude 50.0 West. Lee is moving toward
the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this motion is 
expected to continue through Friday. A slower motion toward the
west-northwest is forecast over the weekend. On the forecast track,
the core of Lee will move north of the northern Leeward islands
during the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained have quickly increased to near 105 mph (165 km/h)
with higher gusts. Rapid intensification is expected today and
tonight. Lee will likely become a major hurricane later today. Lee
is forecast to remain a very strong major hurricane through the
weekend
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are expected to reach portions of
the Lesser Antilles on Friday, and reach the British and U.S.
Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Bahamas, and Bermuda
this weekend.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
500 AM AST Thu Sep 07 2023
 
Lee had been steady state overnight, but there are some signs that 
intensification is beginning to resume.  Satellite images show 
evidence of an eye feature appearing within the central dense 
overcast and fragmented bands that are now filling in around the 
center.  In addition, a better defined inner core seems to be 
taking shape.  The initial wind speed of 70 kt is at the high end 
of the satellite estimates, but if these trends continue, the 
intensity of the hurricane could increase quickly.
 
The initial motion remains west-northwestward, or 300/12 kt.  The
hurricane has taken a slight jog to the north during the last few 
hours.  The steering pattern for Lee is straightforward.  A 
subtropical ridge situated to the north of the hurricane should 
steer the system west-northwestward during the next several days, 
but the forward speed will likely slow down late in the weekend and 
early next week.  The models have changed little this cycle, and 
there is increasing confidence that the core of Lee will pass to the 
north of the northern Leeward Islands.  However, interests in those 
islands should continue to monitor Lee's forecasts as the typical 
three-day NHC track error is about 90 n mi, and the northernmost 
Leeward Islands currently have a 1-in-4 chance of experiencing 
sustained tropical-storm-force winds on the southern side of the 
storm.
 
The environment around the cyclone looks ideal for rapid 
intensification.  The models are in fairly good agreement that 
significant strengthening should begin later today and continue into 
the weekend, when Lee will likely reach its peak intensity.  
Fluctuations in strength are likely from days 3 to 5 due to 
potential eyewall replacements, but Lee is still expected to be a 
dangerous hurricane over the southwestern Atlantic early next week.  
The NHC intensity forecast is at the high end of the guidance in the 
short term given recent trends, but falls to near the middle of the 
guidance envelope from 36 to 120 h.
 
As Lee slowly gains latitude and becomes significantly stronger,
its wind field is forecast to expand.  This is expected to result
in a large area of high seas extending well away from the core of
the system.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Lee is forecast to become a major hurricane by early Friday, with 
its core moving north of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin 
Islands, and Puerto Rico this weekend into early next week. There is 
the potential for tropical storm conditions to occur on some of 
these islands over the weekend, and interests there should monitor
future updates to Lee's forecast.
 
2. Swells generated by Lee are expected to reach portions of the
Lesser Antilles on Friday, and the British and U.S. Virgin Islands,
Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Bahamas, and Bermuda this weekend.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.

Tropical Depression Fourteen Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
200 PM CVT Thu Sep 07 2023
 
Visible and infrared satellite imagery depicts that showers and 
thunderstorms have become better organized around a well-defined 
low-level center associated with the low pressure area (AL96) that 
NHC has been tracking the past few days. Subjective satellite 
Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were both T2.0/30 kt. 
Given the better defined low-level center and these satellite 
estimates, advisories are being initiated on Tropical Depression 
Fourteen over the far eastern Atlantic, with an initial intensity
of 30 kt. 

The depression is moving generally west-northwest and this 
motion is forecast to continue over the next few days, with a 
decrease in forward speed and a turn to the north at the end of the 
forecast period, into a weakness in the tropical ridge. The 
guidance envelope is in fairly good agreement and the NHC track 
forecast lies between the HCCA and TVCA consensus aids.

Tropical Depression Fourteen is forecast to be over warm sea surface 
temperatures near 28-29 degrees Celsius during the next several 
days. However, the depression will encounter some northerly vertical 
wind shear, and drier mid-level relative humidities along the 
current forecast track. Given the mixed environmental conditions the 
NHC forecast calls for gradual strengthening during the early part 
of the forecast but brings the system to hurricane strength before 
the end of the period. The NHC intensity forecast lies near the HCCA 
and IVCN intensity consensus aids.
