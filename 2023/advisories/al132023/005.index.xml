Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Wed Sep 6 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Lee, located over the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL96):<br/>
A tropical wave is producing a large area of disorganized showers <br/>
and thunderstorms over the far eastern Atlantic between the Cabo <br/>
Verde Islands and the west coast of Africa.  Environmental <br/>
conditions appear conducive for some gradual development of this <br/>
system, and a tropical depression could form later this week or this <br/>
weekend while the system moves west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph <br/>
over the eastern tropical Atlantic. This system is expected to move <br/>
across the Cabo Verde Islands today and tonight, and interests <br/>
there should monitor its progress.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Northeastern Atlantic (ex-Franklin):<br/>
Post-Tropical Cyclone Franklin, located a few hundred miles <br/>
east-northeast of the Azores, is producing disorganized shower <br/>
activity mostly to the east of its center. This system could briefly <br/>
acquire some subtropical or tropical characteristics during the next <br/>
day or so while it moves northeastward or northward over the <br/>
northeastern Atlantic. By late this week, further development is not <br/>
expected as the system is forecast to move into unfavorable <br/>
environmental conditions, which should cause it to weaken. <br/>
For additional information, including gale warnings, see High Seas <br/>
Forecasts issued by Meteo France.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

...LEE CLOSE TO HURRICANE STRENGTH...
...LIKELY TO RAPIDLY INTENSIFY INTO AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS MAJOR
HURRICANE BY SATURDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.1N 45.5W
ABOUT 1200 MI...1930 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...70 MPH...110 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 285 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...994 MB...29.36 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands should monitor the
progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lee was
located near latitude 14.1 North, longitude 45.5 West. Lee is moving
toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this motion is
expected to continue for the next few days with a slight reduction
in forward speed.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Continued steady to rapid strengthening is
forecast, and Lee is expected to become a hurricane later today
and a major hurricane in a couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are expected to reach portions of
the Lesser Antilles on Friday.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------

<title>Tropical Storm Lee Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>

Tropical Storm Lee Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
500 AM AST Wed Sep 06 2023
 
Lee continues to strengthen at a quick pace.  Satellite images show
that deep convection has been increasing in intensity and coverage
in a central dense overcast feature and in a sprawling curved band
over the western semicircle.  The Dvorak classifications from TAFB
and SAB are now 3.5/55 kt, and accordingly, the initial intensity
has been increased to 55 kt.  Lee is not far from hurricane
strength, and it likely will achieve that status later today.
 
The tropical storm is moving west-northwestward at 14 kt on the
south side of a subtropical ridge over the central Atlantic.  This
ridge is expected to persist to the north of Lee during the next
several days, keeping the storm on a west-northwest track through
the remainder of the week and over the weekend.  Although the NHC
forecast and the model guidance continue to show Lee passing to the
north of the northern Leeward Islands this weekend, users are
reminded that the details of the track forecast are still uncertain
at those time ranges.  For reference, the average NHC forecast track
errors are around 125 and 175 n mi on days 4 and 5, respectively.
The NHC track forecast lies on the southern side of the model
guidance envelope, roughly halfway between the usually most skillful
consensus aids, HCCA and TVCA.
 
Lee has already been strengthening fairly quickly despite some
east-northeasterly vertical wind shear over the system.  Since the
shear is expected to relax while the storm remains over very warm
water and in a moist environment, continued steady to rapid
intensification is expected during the next few days.  Most of the
intensity models are very aggressive, bringing Lee to major
hurricane status by the weekend, but they don't show much change in
strength in the short term.  In addition, even the global models
like the GFS and ECMWF show explosive intensification and forecast
Lee's minimum pressure to drop by more than 60 mb by the end of the
forecast period.  The NHC intensity forecast lies near the high end
of the model guidance during the next 24-48 hours, but falls to near
the middle of the guidance envelope after that.  Regardless of the
details, there is high confidence that Lee will be a powerful
hurricane late this week and over the weekend.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Lee is forecast to become a major hurricane by late this week and
could bring impacts to the Leeward Islands this weekend. While it is
too soon to determine the location and magnitude of these possible
impacts, interests in this area should monitor the progress of Lee
and further updates to the forecast.
