Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Lee, located several hundred miles south of Bermuda, and on <br/>
Hurricane Margot, located over the central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic (AL97 and AL98):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure over the eastern tropical Atlantic <br/>
continues to produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms. This <br/>
system is expected to consolidate, with a low on the western side <br/>
becoming dominant over the next day or two. Gradual development of <br/>
the low is expected after that and a tropical depression is likely <br/>
to form by this weekend while the system moves west-northwestward or <br/>
northwestward at about 15 mph across the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.

Interests in the northeastern United States and Atlantic Canada 
should monitor the progress of Lee.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 24.3 North, longitude 65.9 West. Lee is moving toward
the west-northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h).  A slow west-northwest to
northwest motion is expected during the next day or two, followed by
a turn toward the north by midweek. On the forecast track, Lee is
expected to pass near but to the west of Bermuda in a few days.
 
NOAA Hurricane Hunter data indicate that the maximum sustained
winds remain near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher gusts.  Lee is a
category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.
Some slow weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, but Lee
is expected to remain a large and powerful hurricane.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 951 mb (28.09 inches) 
based on dropsonde data.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm force winds are possible on Bermuda starting
Thursday morning.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, and Bermuda.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Dangerous surf and rip currents are affecting
portions of the southeastern U.S. coast, and these conditions are
forecast to spread northward along much of the U.S. East Coast
during the next couple of days. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
RAIN: Outer rain bands from Lee may produce rainfall amounts of 1 to
2 inches, 25 to 50 millimeters, across Bermuda Thursday into
early Friday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

<title>Hurricane Lee Forecast Discussion Number 29</title>

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
1100 AM AST Tue Sep 12 2023
 
GOES-16 satellite and radar images from the NOAA Hurricane Hunter
indicate that Lee is trying to consolidate into one large eyewall,
but the eye remains obscured with fragments of the old eyewall
structures.  Peak 700-mb flight-level winds were about 110 kt, 0.5
km radar estimates were near 121 kt and surface SFMR estimates were
about 90 kt, which could be under sampled with such a large
radius of maximum winds.  The initial wind speed is held at 100 kt
as a compromise of the aircraft estimates.
 
Lee is still moving slowly west-northwestward (300/5 kt), with
mid-level ridging established to the north and east of the
hurricane. This steering pattern is expected to change during the
next couple of days as a deep-layer trough moves across the eastern
United States and produces a weakness in this ridge. As a result,
Lee is forecast to turn northward and gradually accelerate during
the middle and latter parts of this week. The track guidance
envelope shows little cross-track spread during the first 3 days of
the forecast period, and this portion of the NHC forecast is fairly
similar to the previous one. While the core of the hurricane is
forecast to pass west of Bermuda, the large wind field of the storm
is likely to bring wind impacts to the island on Thursday,
prompting the Bermuda Weather Service to issue a Tropical Storm
Watch.  The latest NHC track was a compromise between the 6z GEFS
and ECMWF ensembles in the days 4/5 time frame, as it is still too
early to know if any leftward bend will occur as Lee approaches
North America.
 
No significant change in strength is expected in the near-term with
Lee due to its current structure and large wind field.  Going
forward, the large hurricane appears likely to begin upwelling
cooler waters along its path, and in a few days it will encounter
the cool wake left behind by recent western Atlantic hurricanes.
Thus, gradual weakening is forecast through midweek. Later, the
aforementioned trough is expected to produce stronger deep-layer
shear over Lee, and the hurricane is forecast to move over
significantly cooler waters as it passes north of the Gulf Stream.
As a result, more significant weakening is shown at days 4-5, along
with completion of its extratropical transition. Despite the
forecast weakening, it is important to note that the expanding wind 
field of Lee will produce impacts well away from the storm center.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents will affect
portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto
Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas,
Bermuda, and most of the U.S East Coast through much of the week.
 
2. There is an increasing risk of strong winds, rainfall, and high
surf impacts to Bermuda later this week, and a Tropical Storm Watch
has been issued for the island.
 
3. It remains too soon to know what level of additional impacts Lee
might have along the northeastern U.S. coast and Atlantic Canada
late this week and this weekend.  However, since wind and rainfall
hazards will extend well away from the center as Lee grows in size,
users should continue to monitor updates to Lee's forecast during
the next several days.

Hurricane Margot Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
900 AM GMT Tue Sep 12 2023
 
Margot's eye became obscured in infrared satellite imagery a couple 
of hours ago, but the hurricane still has a well-defined Central 
Dense Overcast surrounded by convective banding features.  A dry 
slot has become entrained into the eastern part of the circulation, 
between the CDO and the outermost banding.  Based on consensus 
Dvorak estimates of T4.5 from TAFB and SAB, the initial intensity 
is raised to 75 kt.

Margot is moving northward (360/11 kt) along the western periphery 
of a mid-level ridge emanating out of western Africa, and this 
steering mechanism should keep the hurricane on a general 
northward or north-northwestward trajectory for the next few 
days.  A blocking ridge is forecast to form in 2-3 days over the 
north Atlantic, which is likely to cause Margot to slow down during 
the middle to latter part of the forecast period.  However, the 
ridge may be relatively progressive, and by day 5 many of the track 
models show the storm picking up some speed again once the ridge 
gets out of the way.  The most notable change in the NHC track 
forecast is that it's faster than the previous prediction on days 4 
and 5 to better align with the latest guidance.

The hurricane is currently within a strongly diffluent environment 
to the east of an upper-level trough, but the environment is 
forecast to evolve to an anticyclone aloft and low shear within the 
next 12 hours.  Continued strengthening is therefore likely, but 
any intensification trend could be halted soon after 24 hours when 
the hurricane slows down and potentially upwells cooler waters.  
The NHC intensity forecast is above the intensity consensus during 
the first day or two and is closest to the statistical-dynamical 
guidance.  Weakening is likely to occur after 48 hours due to 
cooler waters and an increase in deep-layer shear.
