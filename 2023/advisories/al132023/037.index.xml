...TROPICAL STORM WARNING ISSUED FOR CAPE COD, MARTHA'S VINEYARD, 
AND NANTUCKET...
...DANGEROUS SURF AND RIP CURRENT CONDITIONS AFFECTING MUCH OF THE
EAST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...30.4N 68.3W
ABOUT 245 MI...395 KM WSW OF BERMUDA

before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours. For
a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.
 
Interests elsewhere in the northeastern United States and Atlantic
Canada should monitor the progress of Lee.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area
outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by
your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 30.4 North, longitude 68.3 West. Lee is moving toward
the north near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this general motion with an
increase in forward speed is expected through Saturday.  A turn
toward the north-northeast and then northeast is forecast Saturday
night and Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Lee will
pass west of Bermuda today and tonight, approach the coast of New
England and Atlantic Canada Friday and Saturday, and move across
Atlantic Canada Saturday night and Sunday.
 
Data from Air Force Reserve and NOAA reconnaissance aircraft 
indicate that the maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 
km/h) with higher gusts. Weakening is forecast, but Lee is expected 
to remain a large and dangerous hurricane for the next couple of 
days.
 
Lee is a large hurricane. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up 
to 90 miles (150 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds 
extend outward up to 310 miles (500 km). A wind gust of 48 mph (78
km/h) has recently been reported at the L.F. Wade International
Airport on Bermuda.  NOAA buoy 41048 located about 130 miles (210 
km) northwest of the center of Lee has recently reported a peak 
one-minute sustained wind of 54 mph (86 km/h) and a gust to 67 mph 
(107 km/h).
 
The latest minimum central pressure estimated from reconnaissance 
aircraft data is 956 mb (28.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue on Bermuda through
Friday.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch
areas in Down East Maine and in Atlantic Canada on Saturday. 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in Cape Cod, 
Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket on Friday afternoon. Tropical storm 
conditions are possible in the Tropical Storm Watch area elsewhere 
in coastal New England and Atlantic Canada late Friday into 
Saturday.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Chatham, MA to Sagamore Beach, MA...2-4 ft
Cape Cod Bay...2-4 ft
Nantucket...2-4 ft
Sagamore Beach, MA to Border of US/Canada...1-3 ft
Boston Harbor...1-3 ft
Flushing, NY to Chatham, MA...1-3 ft
Montauk Point, NY to Flushing, NY...1-3 ft
Long Island Sound...1-3 ft
Martha's Vineyard...1-3 ft
Rockaway Inlet, NY to Montauk Point, NY...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
A dangerous storm surge could produce coastal flooding within the
wind watch areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of onshore winds.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the
east coast of the United States, and are beginning to reach Atlantic
Canada.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Outer rain bands from Lee may produce rainfall amounts of 
1 to 2 inches, or 25 to 50 millimeters, across Bermuda today into 
early Friday.

Friday night through Saturday night, Lee is expected to produce 
rainfall amounts of 1 to 4 inches, or 25 to 100 millimeters, across 
portions of eastern New England into portions of New Brunswick and 
Nova Scotia. This may produce localized urban and small stream 
flooding.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  37
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
1100 AM AST Thu Sep 14 2023
 
The satellite presentation of Lee has degraded over the past day or 
so. An eye is no longer apparent but deep convection continues to 
wrap around the eastern and northern portions of the circulation. 
Deep convection has waned over the southwestern portions of the 
cyclone, likely due to an increase in southwesterly vertical wind 
shear and dry air entrainment. An Air Force Reserve reconnaissance 
aircraft that has been investigating Lee this morning has measured 
peak 700-mb flight-level winds of 96 kt, and the NOAA P-3 aircraft 
has found peak 8000 ft flight-level winds of 100 kt.  However, peak 
SFMR winds from both aircraft have been around 70 kt. Using a blend 
of the flight-level and SFMR data, the initial wind speed has been 
lowered to 80 kt, but this could be a little generous.
 
Lee is moving northward at a slightly faster forward speed of 12 kt. 
A faster northward to north-northeastward motion is expected during 
the next day or so around the western side of a mid-level ridge over 
the central Atlantic.  A slight bend to the north-northwest toward 
the Gulf of Maine is likely late Friday or early Saturday as the 
southern extent of mid-latitude trough moves off the Mid-Atlantic 
coast. After that time, Lee is forecast to turn northeastward over 
Atlantic Canada.  The dynamical model guidance is tightly clustered 
and only minor adjustments were made to the previous official 
forecast.  The NHC track is close to a blend of the typically 
reliable GFS and ECMWF models.
 
Southwesterly vertical wind shear is expected to increase over Lee 
during the next 24 to 36 hours, and this is likely to lead to 
gradual weakening during that time.  Sea surface temperatures will 
decrease significantly just after 36 hours when Lee moves north of 
the Gulf Stream.  The global model guidance suggests that Lee will 
begin extratropical transition Friday night and this is likely to be 
completed within 48 hours, if not a little sooner.  The NHC 
intensity forecast is a blend of the HFIP corrected consensus and 
and the IVCN consensus model.  It can't be stressed enough, that 
regardless of Lee's designation, it will remain a large and 
dangerous cyclone while it approaches eastern New England and 
Atlantic Canada.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions, heavy rainfall, and high surf will
continue to impact Bermuda through Friday morning, and a Tropical
Storm Warning is in effect for the island.
 
2. Hurricane conditions and coastal flooding are possible in
portions of eastern Maine, southern New Brunswick, and western Nova
Scotia on Saturday, and a Hurricane Watch is in effect for that
area. Tropical storm conditions are expected on Cape Cod, Martha's
Vineyard, and Nantucket where a Tropical Storm Warning is now in
effect. Tropical storm conditions are possible elsewhere across New
England and Atlantic Canada within the Tropical Storm Watch areas.
 
3. Heavy rainfall from Lee may produce localized urban and small
stream flooding across eastern New England and into portions of New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia from Friday night into Saturday night.
 
4. There is the potential for life-threatening storm surge flooding 
in portions of southeastern Massachusetts, including Cape Cod and 
Nantucket, late Friday and Saturday, where a Storm Surge Watch is in 
effect.

BULLETIN
Hurricane Margot Advisory Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
900 AM GMT Thu Sep 14 2023
 
...MARGOT WEAKENS OVER THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM GMT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...35.9N 40.3W
ABOUT 745 MI...1205 KM W OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 15 DEGREES AT 6 MPH...9 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...979 MB...28.91 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM GMT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Margot was located
near latitude 35.9 North, longitude 40.3 West. Margot is moving
toward the north-northeast near 6 mph (9 km/h), and a slower 
forward motion is expected today. Margot is forecast to meander 
within weak steering currents on Friday and make a small clockwise 
loop over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Continued weakening is forecast over the next few 
days, and Margot is likely to become a tropical storm later today.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles
(335 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Margot will continue to affect the
Azores for the next several days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM GMT.

Hurricane Margot Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
900 AM GMT Thu Sep 14 2023
 
The satellite structure of Margot has continued to deteriorate. The 
low-level center has been partially exposed in GOES-16 proxy-visible 
satellite images, and recent AMSR2 microwave data show the inner 
core convection has eroded. These changes appear to be the result of 
some southwesterly shear over the system and dry air intrusions into 
the circulation. Presently, deep convection is limited to a couple 
of curved bands that wrap around the northern portion of the system. 
The objective and subjective satellite intensity estimates have 
markedly decreased, and the initial intensity is lowered to 65 kt, 
in best agreement with recent UW-CIMSS SATCON and TAFB Dvorak 
current intensity estimates. However, this could be generous given 
the rapidly degrading satellite presentation. 
 
Margot continues to slow down this morning, and it appears the 
center has recently turned north-northeastward (015/5 kt). The 
cyclone is likely to stall and meander over the next couple of days 
in response to a building ridge to its north and west. In general, 
the track models agree that Margot will make a gradual clockwise 
loop while it pivots around the ridge that is forecast to slowly 
slide eastward over the weekend. However, there is still large 
spread in the various model solutions while the steering currents 
remain weak. The updated NHC forecast tries to reflect the latest 
trends of the multi-model consensus aids and shows little movement 
between 12-60 h. By early next week, the ridge should become 
re-positioned to the east of Margot, allowing the system to turn 
northward and become caught up in the mid-latitude westerlies.

In addition to the ongoing shear, several factors suggest Margot is 
likely to continue weakening during the next several days. The 
cyclone is over marginal SSTs, and the coupled atmosphere-ocean 
models indicate the slow-moving storm is likely to upwell even 
cooler waters while it meanders over the central Atlantic. Also, 
more bouts of dry air entrainment within a drier and more subsident 
environment will make it difficult for Margot to sustain convection 
near its center, as suggested by the GFS and ECMWF simulated 
satellite imagery. The NHC forecast shows continued weakening 
through early next week with Margot becoming extratropical in 120 h 
while accelerating into the mid-latitudes. Although not explicitly 
forecast, it is noted that the hostile conditions could render 
Margot devoid of deep convection even sooner.
