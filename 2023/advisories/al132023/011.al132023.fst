DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 17.3 North, longitude 52.4 West. Lee is moving toward
the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h), and this motion is
expected to continue through early next week with a significant
decrease in forward speed.  On the forecast track, Lee is expected
to pass well to the north of the northern Leeward Islands, the
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico over the weekend and into early
next week.

Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate
that maximum sustained winds have increased to near 160 mph (260
km/h) with higher gusts.  Lee is a category 5 hurricane on the
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional strengthening is
forecast overnight.  Fluctuations in intensity are likely over the
next few days, but Lee is expected to remain a major hurricane
through early next week.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).

The minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data is 928 mb
(27.41 inches).

SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are expected to reach portions of the
Lesser Antilles on Friday, and reach the British and U.S. Virgin
Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the
Bahamas, and Bermuda this weekend. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Dangerous surf and
rip currents are expected to begin along most of the U.S. East Coast
beginning Sunday.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
