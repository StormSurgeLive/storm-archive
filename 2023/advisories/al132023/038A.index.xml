DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 32.1 North, longitude 68.0 West.  Lee is moving toward
the north near 15 mph (24 km/h) and this general motion with an
increase in forward speed is expected through Saturday.  A turn
toward the north-northeast and then northeast is forecast Saturday
night and Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Lee will 
continue to pass west of Bermuda through this evening, approach the 
coast of New England and Atlantic Canada Friday and Saturday, and 
move across Atlantic Canada Saturday night and Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected through Friday
afternoon.  Some gradual weakening is forecast Friday night and
Saturday, but Lee is expected to remain large and dangerous for the
next couple of days.
 
Lee is a very large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend 
outward up to 105 miles (165 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 345 miles (555 km). 
 A sustained wind of 43 mph (69 km/h) was recently reported at the 
L.F. Wade International Airport on Bermuda. 
 
The minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft is 956 mb (28.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue on Bermuda through
Friday morning.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the Hurricane
Watch areas in Down East Maine and in Atlantic Canada on Saturday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the southern New
England on Friday afternoon and spread northward within the
Tropical Storm Warning area through Saturday.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the Tropical Storm Watch area in
Atlantic Canada by late Friday into Saturday.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Flushing, NY to U.S./Canada border...1-3 ft
Long Island Sound...1-3 ft
Cape Cod...1-3 ft
Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket...1-3 ft
Boston Harbor...1-3 ft
Rockaway Inlet, NY to Montauk Point, NY...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
A dangerous storm surge could produce coastal flooding within the
wind watch areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of onshore winds.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the
east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Outer rain bands from Lee may produce rainfall amounts of
1 to 2 inches, or 25 to 50 millimeters, across Bermuda tonight into
early Friday.
 
Friday night through Saturday night, Lee is expected to produce
rainfall amounts of 1 to 4 inches, or 25 to 100 millimeters, across
portions of eastern New England into portions of New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia. This may produce localized urban and small stream
flooding.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  38
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
500 PM AST Thu Sep 14 2023
 
There has been little overall change to the satellite presentation
of Lee since the previous advisory.  Deep convection continues to
develop near the center, but it is primarily confined to the
northern portion of the circulation.  Southwesterly shear and dry
air entrainment is disrupting the convective banding over the
southern portion of the storm.  The initial intensity was lowered
to 75 kt on the 1800 UTC intermediate advisory, and was based
on data from the Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft that was
in the storm through midday.  The initial wind speed remains at
that value for this advisory.  The next reconnaissance mission is
scheduled to investigate Lee this evening. The early aircraft data
along with a couple of fortuitous ASCAT overpasses showed that the
wind field of Lee has continued to expand.  The 50-kt wind radii
extend outward up to 170 n mi over the eastern semicircle of the
storm.  NOAA buoy 41048 located about 75 miles (120 km) west of the 
center of Lee has recently reported a peak one-minute sustained wind 
of 58 kt and a gust to 76 kt and wave heights of around 30 ft.  
Bermuda, located more than 220 miles east-northeast of the center 
has also reported sustained tropical-storm force winds today.   

Lee is moving northward at about 13 kt, which is slightly faster
than before.  Lee should continue to pick up some forward speed as
it moves northward around the western side of a mid-level ridge
over the central Atlantic during the next 12-24 hours.  After that
time a slight bend to the north-northwest is likely late Friday or
early Saturday, and this motion should bring the center of Lee near
or over southwestern Nova Scotia late Saturday.  After that time,
Lee is forecast to turn northeastward over Atlantic Canada.  The
track guidance is still in good agreement, and no significant
changes to the previous official forecast were required.
 
Increasing southwesterly vertical wind shear and dry air entrainment 
could cause some additional weakening, but baroclinic forcing 
during the early stages of Lee's extratropical transition may help 
to maintain the cyclone's intensity through Friday.  By Friday 
night Lee will be moving over significantly cooler sea surface 
temperatures, and gradual weakening is expected after that time.  
Lee is forecast to complete its transition into an extratropical 
cyclone when it nears Atlantic Canada.  Regardless of Lee's 
designation when it approaches New England and Atlantic Canada, it 
will remain a very large and dangerous cyclone through landfall.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions, heavy rainfall, and high surf will
continue to impact Bermuda through Friday morning, and a Tropical
Storm Warning is in effect for the island.
 
2. Hurricane conditions and coastal flooding are possible in
portions of eastern Maine, southern New Brunswick, and western Nova
Scotia on Saturday, and a Hurricane Watch is in effect for that
area.  Tropical storm conditions and coastal flooding are expected 
to begin in southern New England on Friday afternoon, and spread 
northward along the coast of New England through Saturday where 
Tropical Storm warnings are in effect. 
 
3. Heavy rainfall from Lee may produce localized urban and small
stream flooding across eastern New England and into portions of New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia from Friday night into Saturday night.

...MARGOT EXPECTED TO SLOWLY LOOP OVER THE NORTH-CENTRAL ATLANTIC
WELL WEST OF THE AZORES...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM GMT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...36.9N 39.3W
ABOUT 680 MI...1090 KM W OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...80 MPH...130 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 50 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...978 MB...28.88 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Margot was located
near latitude 36.9 North, longitude 39.3 West. Margot is moving
toward the northeast near 5 mph (7 km/h), and this motion is 
expected to slow while Margot undergoes a clockwise loop well to the 
west of the Azores.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and 
Margot should weaken to a tropical storm by Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230
miles (370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 978 mb (28.88 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Margot will continue to affect the
Azores for the next several days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM GMT.

Hurricane Margot Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
900 PM GMT Thu Sep 14 2023

An inner eyewall redeveloped today, with the outer eyewall 
persisting.  Outflow is well-established to Margot's north and 
northeast, near the base of a shortwave trough in the northeast 
Atlantic.  Vertical wind shear over the hurricane appears modest and 
not enough to cause additional weakening.  The initial wind speed 
remains set to 70 kt, a compromise between the earlier higher SAR 
estimates and Dvorak values closer to 65 kt, as Margot does not 
appear to have degraded today.
 
Margot has turned further to the right, or 050/4.  A blocking ridge 
over the north-central Atlantic should force Margot to slow down and 
execute a clockwise loop during the next few days.  After the ridge 
shifts eastward, the hurricane should gain some latitude and begin 
to move more to the northeast at the end of the forecast period.  
Model guidance is in good agreement on this general idea, although 
there is considerable spread at long range with the GFS faster and 
more to the northeast than the ECMWF-based guidance.  The new 
forecast remains close to continuity, near or just behind the model 
consensus.
 
The hurricane should gradually weaken as the large system slows down 
and upwells cooler water, along with it crossing over its own cold 
wake.  Simulated satellite imagery indicates that over the weekend, 
Margot could be struggling to maintain convection near its center.  
There is plenty of mid-level dry air in the surrounding environment, 
as it navigates around the center of a warm-core high, which could 
be mixed in the core.  Margot could become a post-tropical cyclone 
without deep convection early next week, but that really depends on 
how it handles the more hostile conditions and if it can regain 
convection as it tries to escape into the westerlies.  Given how 
resilient this season's tropical cyclones have been, it could be 
optimistic that Margot is post-tropical on day 5.
