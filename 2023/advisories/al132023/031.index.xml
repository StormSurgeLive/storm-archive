<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Lee, located several hundred miles south-southwest of Bermuda, and <br/>
on Hurricane Margot, located over the central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic (AL97 and AL98):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure over the eastern tropical Atlantic <br/>
continues to produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms. This <br/>
system is expected to consolidate, with a low on the western side <br/>
becoming dominant over the next day or two. Gradual development of <br/>
the low is expected after that, and a tropical depression is likely <br/>
to form by this weekend while the system moves west-northwestward or <br/>
northwestward at about 15 mph across the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent. <br/>

CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Bermuda Weather Service has issued a Tropical Storm Warning for
Bermuda.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, generally within 36
hours.
 
Interests in the northeastern United States and Atlantic Canada
should monitor the progress of Lee.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 25.3 North, longitude 66.7 West.  Lee is moving toward
the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h).  Lee is forecast to turn toward
the north on Thursday and increase in forward speed.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Lee is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some slow weakening is forecast during the
next 48 hours, however Lee is likely to remain a large and 
dangerous hurricane for the next couple of days.
 
Lee is a very large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend 
outward up to 125 miles (205 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km).
Saildrone 1036, located about 75 miles (120 km) northwest of Lee's 
center, recently reported a wind gust to 88 mph (141 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 946 mb (27.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in Bermuda starting
late Wednesday or early Thursday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, and Bermuda.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Dangerous surf and rip currents are affecting
portions of the southeastern U.S. coast, and these conditions are
forecast to spread northward along much of the U.S. East Coast and
Atlantic Canada during the next couple of days. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Outer rain bands from Lee may produce rainfall amounts of
1 to 2 inches, 25 to 50 millimeters, across Bermuda Thursday into
early Friday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
500 PM AST Tue Sep 12 2023
 
GOES-East satellite and information from an Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter plane indicate a slight recent improvement in the 
inner-eye structure with a 5-mb pressure fall noted in the most 
recent pass.  However, peak 700-mb flight-level winds were lower 
than 6 hr ago with SFMR estimates about the same.   Given the mixed 
signals, we will maintain the initial wind speed at 100 kts for 
this advisory.   The big change in the aircraft data was the sizable
expansion of the whole wind field in the eastern semicircle 
of the hurricane, which was also shown by a late-arriving SAR pass 
this morning.

Lee has turned northwestward (315/6 kt) as the mid-level ridging 
continues to its north and east.  A digging eastern United States 
trough remains on track to weaken the ridge during the next few 
days.  Lee is expected to turn more northward and accelerate by 
Thursday as a result of this pattern change.  Even though the core 
of Lee is expected to be well west of Bermuda, Lee's large wind 
field could arrive early Thursday on the island.  After day 3, 
there is an increase in guidance spread as the hurricane interacts 
with an approaching frontal zone, which could cause a small 
leftward bend in the track.  However, recent guidance has tightened 
somewhat, and the official forecast follows a middle-ground 
solution similar to the GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means, on the fast side 
of the consensus. 

The hurricane is expected to gradually weaken over the next few 
days while it moves over cooler waters into a higher-shear 
environment.  Still, all of the guidance keep this system quite 
large and at hurricane-strength for the next few days.  Once the 
circulation reaches the colder water north of the Gulf Stream, more 
significant weakening is expected at the day 4-5 period as it 
quickly transitions to an extratropical low.  Little change was 
made to the previous forecast, which is also close to the consensus 
aids, and the forward speed north of the Gulf Stream will be 
important in the exact wind speed as Lee approaches the mainland.

Note- The 34- and 50-kt wind speed probabilities beyond 36 hours in 
the text product and graphics are likely underestimating the risk 
of those winds occurring. This is because the forecast wind field 
of Lee is considerably larger than average compared to the wind 
field used to derive the wind speed probability product.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents will affect
portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto
Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas,
Bermuda, and most of the U.S East Coast through much of the week.
 
2. There is an increasing risk of strong winds, rainfall, and high
surf impacts to Bermuda later this week, and a Tropical Storm Watch
remains in effect for the island.
 
3. It remains too soon to know what level of additional impacts Lee
might have along the northeastern U.S. coast and Atlantic Canada
late this week and this weekend.  However, since wind and rainfall
hazards will extend well away from the center as Lee grows in size,
users should continue to monitor updates to Lee's forecast during
the next several days.

Hurricane Margot Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
300 AM GMT Wed Sep 13 2023
 
Margot's satellite appearance has improved since the previous
advisory. Infrared imagery indicates deep convection wraps
around the center, with cold cloud tops. Infrared and proxy-vis
satellite depict that an eye may also be trying to reappear. A
recent scatterometer pass shows that the system continues to have a
very large wind field. Subjective Dvorak estimates for this cycle
were T4.0/T4.5 from TAFB and SAB, respectively. Using a blend of
these estimates and the improved satellite appearance, the initial
intensity for this advisory is raised to 75 kt.
 
Margot has started to move north-northwestward, and should continue 
this motion with a slightly slower forward speed on Wednesday. In 
about 2 to 3 days, there continues to be significant divergence in 
the guidance envelope, and therefore there is higher than normal 
forecast uncertainty. A ridge is forecast to build north of Margot 
over the next couple of days. The GFS and ECMWF have two very 
different solutions with how Margot interacts with this ridge, and 
are on opposite sides of the guidance suite. The current NHC 
forecast has not been adjusted much from the previous one, which 
remains near the multi-model consensus aids, as there is no reason 
to favor either global model solution at this time. It is possible 
that larger track adjustments will be needed to future NHC 
forecasts.
 
Margot's intensity should stay relatively steady, with slight 
fluctuations, up or down, during the next several days. The 
intensity guidance is in fairly good agreement in the short-term. 
However, in about 2 to 3 days, similar to the track forecast there 
is uncertainty in the intensity forecast as they are dependent on 
one another. The NHC intensity forecast is similar to the previous 
one, and lies near the multi-model consensus showing steady 
weakening towards the end of the forecast period.
