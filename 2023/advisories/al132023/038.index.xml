DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 31.7 North, longitude 68.3 West.  Lee is moving toward
the north near 15 mph (24 km/h) and this general motion with an
increase in forward speed is expected through Saturday.  A turn
toward the north-northeast and then northeast is forecast Saturday
night and Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Lee will
pass west of Bermuda through this evening, approach the coast
of New England and Atlantic Canada Friday and Saturday, and move
across Atlantic Canada Saturday night and Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected through Friday 
afternoon.  Some gradual weakening is forecast Friday night and 
Saturday, but Lee is expected to remain large and dangerous for the 
next couple of days.
 
Lee is a large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend outward up 
to 105 miles (165 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force 
winds extend outward up to 345 miles (555 km).  A sustained wind of 
40 mph (65 km/h) with a gust to 52 mph (83 km/h) was recently 
reported at the L.F. Wade International Airport on Bermuda.  NOAA 
buoy 41048 located about 75 miles (120 km) west of the center of 
Lee has recently reported a peak one-minute sustained wind of 
67 mph (108 km/h) and a gust to 87 mph (141 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 957 mb (28.26 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue on Bermuda through
Friday morning.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the Hurricane 
Watch areas in Down East Maine and in Atlantic Canada on Saturday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the southern New
England on Friday afternoon and spread northward within the 
Tropical Storm Warning area through Saturday.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the Tropical Storm Watch area in
Atlantic Canada by late Friday into Saturday.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Flushing, NY to U.S./Canada border...1-3 ft
Long Island Sound...1-3 ft
Cape Cod...1-3 ft
Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket...1-3 ft
Boston Harbor...1-3 ft
Rockaway Inlet, NY to Montauk Point, NY...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
A dangerous storm surge could produce coastal flooding within the
wind watch areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of onshore winds.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the
east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Outer rain bands from Lee may produce rainfall amounts of
1 to 2 inches, or 25 to 50 millimeters, across Bermuda tonight into
early Friday.
 
Friday night through Saturday night, Lee is expected to produce
rainfall amounts of 1 to 4 inches, or 25 to 100 millimeters, across
portions of eastern New England into portions of New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia. This may produce localized urban and small stream
flooding.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  37
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
1100 AM AST Thu Sep 14 2023
 
The satellite presentation of Lee has degraded over the past day or 
so. An eye is no longer apparent but deep convection continues to 
wrap around the eastern and northern portions of the circulation. 
Deep convection has waned over the southwestern portions of the 
cyclone, likely due to an increase in southwesterly vertical wind 
shear and dry air entrainment. An Air Force Reserve reconnaissance 
aircraft that has been investigating Lee this morning has measured 
peak 700-mb flight-level winds of 96 kt, and the NOAA P-3 aircraft 
has found peak 8000 ft flight-level winds of 100 kt.  However, peak 
SFMR winds from both aircraft have been around 70 kt. Using a blend 
of the flight-level and SFMR data, the initial wind speed has been 
lowered to 80 kt, but this could be a little generous.
 
Lee is moving northward at a slightly faster forward speed of 12 kt. 
A faster northward to north-northeastward motion is expected during 
the next day or so around the western side of a mid-level ridge over 
the central Atlantic.  A slight bend to the north-northwest toward 
the Gulf of Maine is likely late Friday or early Saturday as the 
southern extent of mid-latitude trough moves off the Mid-Atlantic 
coast. After that time, Lee is forecast to turn northeastward over 
Atlantic Canada.  The dynamical model guidance is tightly clustered 
and only minor adjustments were made to the previous official 
forecast.  The NHC track is close to a blend of the typically 
reliable GFS and ECMWF models.
 
Southwesterly vertical wind shear is expected to increase over Lee 
during the next 24 to 36 hours, and this is likely to lead to 
gradual weakening during that time.  Sea surface temperatures will 
decrease significantly just after 36 hours when Lee moves north of 
the Gulf Stream.  The global model guidance suggests that Lee will 
begin extratropical transition Friday night and this is likely to be 
completed within 48 hours, if not a little sooner.  The NHC 
intensity forecast is a blend of the HFIP corrected consensus and 
and the IVCN consensus model.  It can't be stressed enough, that 
regardless of Lee's designation, it will remain a large and 
dangerous cyclone while it approaches eastern New England and 
Atlantic Canada.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions, heavy rainfall, and high surf will
continue to impact Bermuda through Friday morning, and a Tropical
Storm Warning is in effect for the island.
 
2. Hurricane conditions and coastal flooding are possible in
portions of eastern Maine, southern New Brunswick, and western Nova
Scotia on Saturday, and a Hurricane Watch is in effect for that
area. Tropical storm conditions are expected on Cape Cod, Martha's
Vineyard, and Nantucket where a Tropical Storm Warning is now in
effect. Tropical storm conditions are possible elsewhere across New
England and Atlantic Canada within the Tropical Storm Watch areas.
 
3. Heavy rainfall from Lee may produce localized urban and small
stream flooding across eastern New England and into portions of New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia from Friday night into Saturday night.
 
4. There is the potential for life-threatening storm surge flooding 
in portions of southeastern Massachusetts, including Cape Cod and 
Nantucket, late Friday and Saturday, where a Storm Surge Watch is in 
effect.

Hurricane Margot Advisory Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
900 PM GMT Thu Sep 14 2023
 
...MARGOT EXPECTED TO SLOWLY LOOP OVER THE NORTH-CENTRAL ATLANTIC
WELL WEST OF THE AZORES...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM GMT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...36.9N 39.3W
ABOUT 680 MI...1090 KM W OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...80 MPH...130 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 50 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...978 MB...28.88 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Margot was located
near latitude 36.9 North, longitude 39.3 West. Margot is moving
toward the northeast near 5 mph (7 km/h), and this motion is 
expected to slow while Margot undergoes a clockwise loop well to the 
west of the Azores.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and 
Margot should weaken to a tropical storm by Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230
miles (370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 978 mb (28.88 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Margot will continue to affect the
Azores for the next several days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM GMT.

Hurricane Margot Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
900 PM GMT Thu Sep 14 2023

An inner eyewall redeveloped today, with the outer eyewall 
persisting.  Outflow is well-established to Margot's north and 
northeast, near the base of a shortwave trough in the northeast 
Atlantic.  Vertical wind shear over the hurricane appears modest and 
not enough to cause additional weakening.  The initial wind speed 
remains set to 70 kt, a compromise between the earlier higher SAR 
estimates and Dvorak values closer to 65 kt, as Margot does not 
appear to have degraded today.
 
Margot has turned further to the right, or 050/4.  A blocking ridge 
over the north-central Atlantic should force Margot to slow down and 
execute a clockwise loop during the next few days.  After the ridge 
shifts eastward, the hurricane should gain some latitude and begin 
to move more to the northeast at the end of the forecast period.  
Model guidance is in good agreement on this general idea, although 
there is considerable spread at long range with the GFS faster and 
more to the northeast than the ECMWF-based guidance.  The new 
forecast remains close to continuity, near or just behind the model 
consensus.
 
The hurricane should gradually weaken as the large system slows down 
and upwells cooler water, along with it crossing over its own cold 
wake.  Simulated satellite imagery indicates that over the weekend, 
Margot could be struggling to maintain convection near its center.  
There is plenty of mid-level dry air in the surrounding environment, 
as it navigates around the center of a warm-core high, which could 
be mixed in the core.  Margot could become a post-tropical cyclone 
without deep convection early next week, but that really depends on 
how it handles the more hostile conditions and if it can regain 
convection as it tries to escape into the westerlies.  Given how 
resilient this season's tropical cyclones have been, it could be 
optimistic that Margot is post-tropical on day 5.
