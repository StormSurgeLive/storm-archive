DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located 
near latitude 21.4 North, longitude 60.5 West. Lee is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A slower 
west-northwestward motion is expected during the next few days. On 
the forecast track, Lee is expected to pass well north of the 
northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico into 
early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast during the next couple of 
days, followed by gradual weakening.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles
(260 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on measurements from 
the Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter is 958 mb (28.29 
inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, and are spreading westward to the British and U.S. Virgin
Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the
Bahamas, and Bermuda over the remainder of this weekend. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Dangerous surf and rip currents are expected to begin
along most of the U.S. East Coast tomorrow and worsen through next
week. Please consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Hurricane Lee Forecast Discussion Number 19</title>

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
1100 PM AST Sat Sep 09 2023

While the geostationary satellite appearance of Lee has not changed 
appreciably since the prior advisory, data from a NOAA P-3 
reconnaissance mission in the storm, in addition to earlier GPM and 
SSMIS microwave imagery, indicate that Lee is in the middle of an 
eyewall replacement cycle (ERC). The aircraft has been reporting 
both an inner and outer eyewall, with the outer eyewall gradually 
contracting in size. However, this outer eyewall continues to 
exhibit some asymmetry, consistent with modest vertical wind shear 
still affecting the storm. In addition, the aircraft has reported 
that the inner-core wind field is becoming weaker, but broader, with 
a more muted wind profile outside of the radius of maximum wind. 
This observation is also evident comparing TDR data between the 
morning and evening NOAA-P3 missions. The peak 700 mb flight level 
winds were down to 94 kt, with SFMR only in the 75-85 kt range. The 
initial intensity has been adjusted to a somewhat generous 90 kt for 
this advisory.  

Lee continues to move west-northwestward this evening at 300/9 kt. 
As discussed previously, the mid-level ridge axis currently north of 
Lee is soon expected to shift to its west-southwest, resulting in 
Lee slowing its forward motion, and perhaps making a slight westward 
bend over the next 24-36 hours. Afterwards, an eastward-moving 
mid-latitude trough is expected to erode this ridge and allow Lee to 
turn northward by the end of the forecast period. There remains a 
significant amount of spread in both the deterministic and ensemble 
guidance on when this turn occurs, and then how quickly Lee 
accelerates northward. For now the NHC track forecast remains 
closest to the consensus aids, which have slowed a bit from the 
prior cycle, and the latest track forecast is a bit slower but near 
the same trajectory as the prior advisory. 

While vertical wind shear over Lee appears to be gradual decreasing 
over the system, the ongoing ERC seems to be resulting in the wind 
field broadening versus allowing Lee to re-intensify so far. 
However, once this cycle is complete, reintensification is still 
anticipated, and the NHC intensity forecast still takes Lee back to 
a category 4 hurricane in 36-48 hours, in good agreement with the 
latest HAFS-A/B forecasts, which both explicitly show the ongoing 
ERC. However, Lee's growing wind field, in combination with its 
slowing forward motion, could make the hurricane susceptible to 
feeling the effects of its own cold wake, which the 
atmospheric-ocean coupled HAFS and HWRF models suggest could begin 
to occur beyond 36 hours. Thus, the latest NHC intensity forecast 
shows gradual weakening beginning by that time, with more pronounced 
weakening by the end of the forecast period as the hurricane 
traverses already cooled sea-surface temperatures from Franklin and 
Idalia last week along its forecast track. This intensity forecast 
is in good agreement with the simple consensus aids, but is a little 
lower than the HFIP corrected consensus early on.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Lee's core is expected to move well north of the northern
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico this weekend
and early next week.
 
2. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents are affecting
portions of the northern Leeward Islands.  These conditions are
spreading westward and northward and will affect Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, and Bermuda during
the next several days.
 
3. It remains too soon to know what level of impacts, if any, Lee 
might have along the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic Canada, or Bermuda 
late next week, especially since the hurricane is expected to slow 
down considerably over the southwestern Atlantic.  Regardless, 
dangerous surf and rip currents are expected along most of the U.S. 
East Coast beginning tomorrow and continuing into next week as Lee 
grows in size. Users should continue to monitor updates to the 
forecast of Lee during the next several days.

Tropical Storm Margot Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
500 AM AST Sun Sep 10 2023
 
Westerly shear and a slug of dry air, which was noted in the
MET-10 water vapor imagery, impedes Margot's ability to sustain
deep convection near the surface center while most convection 
remains displaced to the northeast.  A recent AMSR2 microwave pass 
confirmed that the surface center has again become exposed to the 
southwest of the convective canopy.  The initial intensity is held 
at 45 kt and is based on the TAFB and SAB Dvorak satellite 
intensity estimates. 
 
The aforementioned moderate shear should continue to undercut the 
diffluent southerly flow aloft during the next couple of days.  
Afterward, the statistical-dynamic SHIPS guidance indicates that 
Margot will slip under a narrow upper-level ridge, favoring 
intensification.  The only inhibiting factor during the latter part 
of the forecast appears to be a less conducive surrounding 
thermodynamic environment, which should affect the intensity rate 
some.  Therefore, only gradual strengthening is forecast and agrees 
with intensity consensus models but below the HAFS-B hurricane 
model, which predicts Margot as a hurricane on day 4.  For now, the 
official forecast shows Margot becoming a hurricane in 48 hours in 
agreement with the reliable intensity consensus aids, but this 
predicted rate of intensification could be generous.
 
Through the early part of this week, Margot is expected to turn
north-northwestward to northward while entering a growing weakness
in the central Atlantic subtropical ridge.  Beyond day 3, Margot 
will likely slow its forward motion in response to a building or
blocking high to the northwest.  There remains quite a bit of model 
spread/uncertainty late in the period, with the two global model 
clusters showing Margot either turning eastward or moving toward 
the northwest to west.  The NHC track forecast conservatively lies 
between the HFIP HCCA and simple consensus TVCA, which splits the 
two model cluster solutions.
