DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Lee 
was located near latitude 43.8 North, longitude 66.4 West. The 
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the north near 22 mph (35 
km/h). A northward motion is expected to continue, and the center of 
Lee is forecast to make landfall in Atlantic Canada later this 
afternoon.  Lee is then expected to turn toward the northeast and 
move across Atlantic Canada tonight and Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Lee is expected to be near hurricane strength when it makes 
landfall later this afternoon.  Weakening is forecast tonight
and Sunday while Lee moves across Atlantic Canada.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 390
miles (630 km). An observation in Bangor, Maine, recently 
reported a wind gust of 52 mph (84 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 968 mb (28.58 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch
areas in Atlantic Canada later today.  Tropical storm conditions
are occurring along the coasts of Maine and Nova Scotia and
will spread northward within the Tropical Storm Warning areas today
and tonight.  The strong winds are leading to downed trees
and power outages.  Tropical-storm-force gusts are likely to
continue on Cape Cod for a couple of more hours.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting the U.S. Virgin
Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the
Bahamas, Bermuda, the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic
Canada.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Through tonight, Lee is expected to produce rainfall
amounts of 1 to 4 inches, or 25 to 100 millimeters over far eastern
Massachusetts,  eastern Maine, western Nova Scotia, and New
Brunswick. This could produce localized urban and small stream
flooding.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge will produce coastal flooding 
within the wind warning areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of 
onshore winds. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by 
large and destructive waves.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Post-Tropical Cyclone Lee Discussion Number  45
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
1100 AM AST Sat Sep 16 2023
 
The core of Lee is very near the west coast of Nova Scotia.  Data 
from the NOAA Hurricane Hunters indicate that the minimum pressure 
has been steady at 965 mb, but the surface winds are down a little 
to 65 kt.  Dropsonde data indicate that winds are notably stronger 
just off the surface, so significant wind gusts are likely in areas 
of heavy rain and over elevated terrain near the coast.  In fact, an 
observation on Grand Manan Island in New Brunswick, Canada, recently 
recorded a wind gust of 81 kt (150 km/h).  Radar data from New 
England and Nova Scotia show bands of heavy rain onshore of portions 
of coastal New England and Atlantic Canada.  

Lee continues to accelerate northward and has jogged to the 
left this morning.  The core of the cyclone will likely brush the 
western portion of Nova Scotia during the next couple of hours and 
then move inland near or just east of the U.S./Canada border this 
afternoon.  After landfall, a faster northeastward motion is 
expected as a trough approaches the system, which should take Lee 
across portions of Atlantic Canada tonight and Sunday.

Little change in strength is expected before landfall, and the core 
winds are likely to come ashore in far down east Maine and western 
portions of New Brunswick.  Steady weakening is expected after Lee 
moves inland, and the system is expected to dissipate by late 
Monday.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Hurricane conditions are possible across portions of southern New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia later today within the Hurricane Watch
areas.  Tropical storm conditions and coastal flooding are
occurring across portions of coastal Maine and Atlantic
Canada, and will continue to spread northward within the Tropical
Storm Warning areas.  The strong winds are already leading to downed
trees and power outages.
 
2. Heavy rainfall from Lee may produce localized urban and small 
stream flooding in portions of far eastern Massachusetts, eastern 
Maine, New Brunswick and western Nova Scotia today.
 
3. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents will continue
to affect the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic Canada, Bermuda, the
Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, the
Virgin Islands, and the northern Leeward Islands through the
weekend.

Tropical Storm Margot Discussion Number  37
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
300 PM GMT Sat Sep 16 2023
 
Margot's structure has continued to degrade, with the low level 
center now exposed on visible satellite imagery. Deep convection is 
mainly limited to the southern semicircle of the tropical storm. Dry 
air is also wrapping around the western and southern side of Margot. 
The subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB both 
support an initial intensity of 45 kt.

Margot has maintained its southwestward heading and is moving 
slightly faster, with an initial estimate of 215/7 kt. Since the 
tropical storm has yet to turn due west, the official forecast shows 
a slightly larger clockwise loop around a mid-level ridge through 48 
hours. This is on the eastern edge of the model consensus aids. As 
the mid-level ridge builds south-eastward, Margot is expected to 
turn back towards the east and potentially interact with a shortwave 
trough arriving from the northwest. Beyond 48 hours, the NHC 
forecast is slightly south of and slower than the previous forecast, 
closest to the HCCA consensus aid.

Environmental conditions are not expected to improve, with 
moderate-to-strong northerly vertical wind shear, dry mid-level 
relative humidities, and sea surface temperatures of 26 Celsius or 
less through the forecast period. As a result, weakening is forecast 
in the near-term, and simulated satellite IR imagery from the GFS 
and ECMWF shows a notable lack of deep convection during this time. 
By Monday night, Margot is expected to begin interacting with a 
mid-latitude shortwave trough. This could allow for some slight 
re-intensification, as is shown in the official forecast. Margot is 
not expected to be absorbed by the trough and is forecast to 
degenerate into a post-tropical cyclone west of the Azores.

Tropical Depression Fifteen Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
1100 AM AST Sat Sep 16 2023
 
The tropical depression has not changed much this morning. The 
center remains poorly defined, and visible satellite imagery 
indicates a broad region of low- and mid-level rotation persisting 
over a large area. Most of the deep convection is occurring in the 
northern semicircle of the broad circulation. Subjective Dvorak 
estimates from SAB and TAFB were 25 kt and 35 kt, respectively, and 
are similar to the objective Dvorak estimates. Based on the 
disorganized structure and the current intensity estimates, the 
intensity is held at 30 kt for this advisory. A late arriving ASCAT 
pass suggests that this estimate may be a bit generous.  

Since the center of circulation is broad, the initial motion is 
somewhat uncertain and estimated at 330/16 kt. This general motion 
is expected to continue for the next couple days as the depression 
moves along the southern periphery of a mid-level ridge located to 
the northeast of the system. Track guidance, including global and 
regional hurricane models, is in general agreement that the system 
will continue on a northwestward trajectory for the next several 
days. After 72 hours, the track forecast uncertainty increases 
somewhat as the system will begin to interact with a deep-layer 
trough. This trough interaction is expected to induce a more 
poleward shift in the track and eventually recurve the system toward 
the northeast by 120 hours. The NHC track forecast is similar to the 
prior forecast and in agreement with the consensus aids, TVCN and 
HCCA. 

The system is currently in a favorable environment for 
intensification, with low vertical wind shear and warm sea surface 
temperatures expected to persist during the next several days. 
However, the timing of intensification will depend on how quickly 
the system is able to consolidate into a more compact structure. The 
current intensity forecast assumes that it will take 24-36 hours for 
this to happen, with the system expected to become a hurricane in 48 
hours. The current forecast reaches 95 kt by 72 h, although some of 
the regional hurricane models, including HWRF and HMON, indicate a 
more rapid intensification. ECMWF-SHIPS guidance continues to 
indicate a greater than a 40 percent chance of rapid intensification 
in the next 72 hours. By mid-week, as the system recurves to the 
northeast, it is expected to gradually weaken as southwesterly shear 
increases. The NHC forecast is lower than the regional model 
guidance and is similar to both the prior forecast and HCCA.
