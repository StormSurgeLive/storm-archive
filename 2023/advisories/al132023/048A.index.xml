CANADA...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM AST...1200 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...47.3N 63.0W
ABOUT 70 MI...115 KM WNW OF CHARLOTTETOWN PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND
ABOUT 180 MI...290 KM W OF PORT AUX BASQUES NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...70 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 45 DEGREES AT 22 MPH...35 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...989 MB...29.20 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Nova Scotia from Lismore eastward to Point Aconi and
southwestward to east of Porters Lake
* Prince Edward Island from Savage Harbor eastward to east of Wood
Islands
* Magdalen Islands
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning, in this case today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Lee
was located near latitude 47.3 North, longitude 63.0 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the northeast near 22 mph (35
km/h), and a faster northeastward motion is expected over the next
couple of days, taking Lee over Newfoundland this afternoon and over
the Atlantic waters by early Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (70 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Continued gradual weakening is forecast during the 
next couple of days, and Lee could dissipate on Tuesday. A number of 
tropical-storm-force wind gusts have been reported across Nova 
Scotia during the past few hours. Beaver Island Nova Scotia 
recently reported a sustained wind of 44 mph (70 km/h) with a gust 
to 54 mph (87 km/h).
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 290 miles (465 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface observations 
in Canada is 989 mb (29.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions continue in portions of the
warning areas today. The strong winds could lead to some downed
trees and power outages.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Lee continue to affect Puerto Rico, 
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the 
east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada. These swells 
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Lee is expected to produce an additional 1 inch (25 mm)
or less across eastern portions of New Brunswick.
 
STORM SURGE: Areas of coastal flooding should gradually subside 
today.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Lee Discussion Number  48
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
500 AM AST Sun Sep 17 2023
 
Satellite imagery, surface observations and Canadian radar imagery
indicates that the center of Lee is near Prince Edward Island, 
with most of the rain west of the center near New Brunswick.  
Observations from the southern coast of Nova Scotia support lowering
the intensity to 45 kt on this advisory.

Lee has turned northeastward at about 19 kt.  The system should 
accelerate in this general direction as it interacts with the 
stronger mid-latitude flow, but gradually weaken since it has lost 
any baroclinic forcing. No significant changes were made to the 
previous forecast, except to keep Lee a bit stronger in 36 hours 
based on the global model wind forecasts.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions and coastal flooding are occurring
across portions of Atlantic Canada. These winds could lead to 
downed trees and power outages.
 
2. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents will continue
to affect the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic Canada, Bermuda, the
Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Hispaniola, and Puerto
Rico through Monday.

...MARGOT MAY NOT LAST MUCH LONGER...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM GMT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...34.0N 41.4W
ABOUT 850 MI...1365 KM WSW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 280 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM GMT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Margot was
located near latitude 34.0 North, longitude 41.4 West. Margot is
moving toward the west near 9 mph (15 km/h).  Margot is expected to 
turn northward on Monday and eastward on Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Little change in strength is forecast during the 
next 72 hours, and Margot could degenerate into a post-tropical 
cyclone later today.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Margot should continue to affect the
Azores for the next several days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM GMT.

Tropical Storm Margot Discussion Number  40
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
900 AM GMT Sun Sep 17 2023

There haven't been a lot of changes with Margot overnight, with no 
associated deep convection and an exposed low-level center.  The 
initial wind speed is lowered to 35 kt in accordance with the latest 
Dvorak estimates.  Very dry mid-level air and upper-level 
convergence will likely prevent any re-development of convection, 
so the storm is now forecast to become post-tropical later today.  
No significant changes were made to the intensity forecast, with a 
slight increase in winds possible as Margot interacts with an 
upper-level trough in a couple of days, but not as a tropical 
cyclone.

Margot is moving westward at about 8 kt.  It should turn northward 
within 24 hours and then eastward or east-southeastward as it moves 
around the subtropical ridge, finally dissipating in the hostile 
environment.  The new NHC track forecast is essentially an update of 
the previous one, near or just south of the model consensus.

Tropical Storm Nigel Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
500 AM AST Sun Sep 17 2023

Nigel's satellite structure has improved overnight as deep 
convection has taken on a distinct curved band appearance to the 
north of the estimated center. With that said, we have not 
received any recent microwave imagery to confirm if the low-level 
circulation has tightened up or has become more embedded in the deep 
convection, though derived motion winds from the 1-minute meso 
sector over the system do suggest the center has likely tucked 
underneath the convective cirrus canopy. Subjective Dvorak intensity 
estimates from TAFB and SAB were a consensus T3.0/45 kt, and the 
recent objective estimates from UW-CIMSS are in the 44-50 kt range. 
The initial intensity will be set at 45 kt, on the lower end given 
the uncertainty on the center position. 

Based on the estimated position, Nigel has been moving somewhat 
right of the prior track forecast, off to the north-northwest at 
330/12 kt. This continued rightward motion relative to the track 
forecast over the past 24 hours could be related to Margot eroding 
the mid-level ridging located northeast of Nigel, in addition to a 
mid- to upper-level trough favoring more convection on Nigel's 
eastern flank overall. However, as Margot continues to weaken, this 
mid-level ridging should rebuild, allowing Nigel to bend a bit more 
northwestward in the 24-48 hour time frame. By the middle of next 
week, the global model guidance is in good agreement that Nigel 
should recurve to the northeast as it gets picked up by a 
mid-latitude trough ejecting off the eastern U.S. coastline. The NHC 
track forecast continues to lie near the TVCA and HCCA consensus 
aids, which is a little east of the prior forecast, but not far off 
of a blend of the latest GFS and ECMWF models.

While it is unclear to know without recent microwave imagery if 
Nigel is in the early stages of developing an inner core, the 
improvement of the larger-scale structure on satellite suggests 
further intensification is likely. Both GFS- and ECMWF-based SHIPS 
guidance show vertical wind shear should remain low (under 10 kt) 
for the next 48-72 hours, while sea-surface temperatures remain 
between 28-30C. While mid-level relative humidity is a bit on the 
low side, this may only help to tighten up the core from its initial 
large origin assuming the shear remains low. SHIPS-RII and DTOPS 
continue to suggest a significant chance of rapid intensification 
over the next 2-3 days, and the latest NHC intensity forecast now 
shows Nigel peaking as a category 3 hurricane again. This is a bit 
higher than the IVCN and HCCA consensus aids, but close to the raw 
model output of the HAFS, HWRF, and COAMPS-TC models. By the end of 
the forecast, Nigel will likely be undergoing extratropical 
transition, though this process might not be complete until just 
beyond the 120 h point.
