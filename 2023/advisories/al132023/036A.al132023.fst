before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.

A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life- 
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the 
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours. For 
a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather 
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov.

Interests elsewhere in the northeastern United States and Atlantic
Canada should monitor the progress of Lee.

For storm information specific to your area in the United States, 
including possible inland watches and warnings, please monitor 
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast 
office. For storm information specific to your area outside of the 
United States, please monitor products issued by your national 
meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 29.8 North, longitude 68.2 West.  Lee is moving toward
the north near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general motion with an
increase in forward speed is expected through Saturday.  A turn
toward the north-northeast and then northeast is forecast Saturday
night and Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Lee will
pass west of Bermuda today and tonight, approach the coast of New
England and Atlantic Canada Friday and Saturday, and move across
Atlantic Canada Saturday night and Sunday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Weakening is forecast, but Lee is expected to remain a large 
and dangerous hurricane for the next couple of days.

Lee is a large hurricane. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 
105 miles (165 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds 
extend outward up to 290 miles (465 km).  A wind gust of 44 mph (70 
km/h) has recently been reported at the L.F. Wade International 
Airport on Bermuda.  An elevated observing site at the National 
Museum of Bermuda has recently measured sustained winds of 53 mph 
(85 km/h) with a gust to 64 mph (104 km/h).  NOAA buoy 41048 located 
about 160 miles (260 km) northwest of the center of Lee has recently 
reported a peak one-minute sustained wind of 51 mph (83 km/h) and a 
gust to 60 mph (96 km/h).

The latest minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force Reserve 
reconnaissance aircraft is 955 mb (28.20 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue on Bermuda through 
Friday.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch 
areas in Down East Maine and in Atlantic Canada on Saturday.  
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the Tropical Storm Watch 
area in coastal New England and Atlantic Canada late Friday into 
Saturday.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Chatham, MA to Sagamore Beach, MA...2-4 ft
Cape Cod Bay...2-4 ft
Nantucket...2-4 ft
Sagamore Beach, MA to Border of US/Canada...1-3 ft
Boston Harbor...1-3 ft
Flushing, NY to Chatham, MA...1-3 ft
Montauk Point, NY to Flushing, NY...1-3 ft
Long Island Sound...1-3 ft
Martha's Vineyard...1-3 ft
Rockaway Inlet, NY to Montauk Point, NY...1-2 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.

A dangerous storm surge could produce coastal flooding within the
wind watch areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of onshore winds.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser 
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, 
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the 
east coast of the United States, and are beginning to reach Atlantic 
Canada.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and 
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local 
weather office.

RAINFALL: Outer rain bands from Lee could produce rainfall amounts
of 1 to 2 inches, or 25 to 50 millimeters, across Bermuda today into
early Friday.

From Friday night through Saturday night, Lee is expected to produce
rainfall amounts of 1 to 4 inches, or 25 to 100 millimeters, across
portions of eastern New England into portions of New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia. This could produce localized urban and small stream
flooding.
