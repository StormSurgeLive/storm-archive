DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Lee
was located near latitude 44.7 North, longitude 66.3 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the north near 14 mph (22

Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts. Steady weakening is forecast during the next couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 320 miles (520 km)
from the center. An observing site on Beaver Island, Canada, 
reported a sustained wind of 48 mph (78 km/h) and a gust to 63 mph 
(102 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occurring along the coasts of 
Maine and Nova Scotia and will spread northward within the Tropical 
Storm Warning areas through tonight.  The strong winds are leading 
to downed trees and power outages.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the
east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Lee may produce an additional 1 to 2 inches of rain, or
25 to 50 millimeters, over portions of eastern Maine and New
Brunswick. This may produce localized urban and small stream
flooding.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge will produce coastal flooding
within the wind warning areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of
onshore winds. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Lee Discussion Number  46
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
500 PM AST Sat Sep 16 2023
 
The core of Lee briefly moved across Long Island in Western Nova 
Scotia within the past hour or so. Satellite images and surface 
observations indicate that the center is now over the Bay of Fundy. 
Rain bands continue to spread across portions of Maine, New 
Brunswick, and Nova Scotia as seen in radar images. A pair of ASCAT 
passes from several ago showed that Lee remains very large, but the 
core winds have decreased below hurricane-force.  Considering some 
undersampling of that data, the initial intensity was lowered to 60 
kt on the 1800 UTC intermediate advisory.
 
The forward motion of Lee is slower than earlier today as it 
moves near the west coast of Nova Scotia.  However, the storm is 
expected to turn northeastward and accelerate late tonight and 
Sunday, bringing the system across the Canadian Maritimes.  Little 
change was made to the previous NHC track forecast.
 
Strong wind shear, dry air, and land interaction should cause
steady weakening during the next day or so.  The global models are
in agreement that Lee should dissipate on Monday, and that is
reflected in the NHC forecast.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions and coastal flooding are occurring
across portions of coastal Maine and Atlantic Canada, and will
continue to spread northward within the Tropical Storm Warning
areas.  The strong winds are leading to downed trees and power 
outages.
 
2. Heavy rainfall from Lee could produce localized urban and small
stream flooding in portions of eastern Maine and New Brunswick.
 
3. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents will continue
to affect the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic Canada, Bermuda, the
Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Hispaniola,  and Puerto
Rico through Sunday.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Margot was 
located near latitude 34.3 North, longitude 39.6 West. Margot is 
moving toward the west near 8 mph (13 km/h), and it is expected to 
continue making a slow clockwise loop during the next day or two. A 
faster northeastward to eastward motion is forecast by early next 
week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of days, though 
slight fluctuations in intensity are possible.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 255 miles (405 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Margot will continue to affect the
Azores for the next several days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Margot Discussion Number  38
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
900 PM GMT Sat Sep 16 2023
 
Tropical Storm Margot's low-level center remains exposed, as strong 
northerly upper-level winds displace the deep convection to the 
south and west. The CIRA Layered Precipitable Water satellite 
product shows that Margot has been nearly encircled by dry mid-level 
air. The subjective Dvorak classification from TAFB and the 
objective intensity estimates support an initial intensity of 45 kt 
for this advisory.
 
Since the last advisory, Margot has turned westward at 270/7 kt. The 
tropical storm is forecast to continue a clockwise loop around a 
mid-level ridge. As the ridge builds southeastward, Margot will 
turn north, then back towards the east around the northern side of 
the ridge. An eastward motion is forecast through the remainder of 
the forecast period. No significant changes were made to the track 
forecast.

Atmospheric and oceanic conditions are not expected to improve 
through the forecast period. Model guidance continues to show that 
Margot could lose its deep convection and degenerate into a remnant 
low sooner than forecast. However, on Monday Margot is forecast to 
interact with the southern periphery of a shortwave trough arriving 
from the northwest. This could introduce enough instability to allow 
convection to reform and for the system to slightly re-intensify. By 
Wednesday, Margot will be left behind by the shortwave and should 
degenerate into a post-tropical cyclone west of the Azores.

Tropical Depression Fifteen Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
500 PM AST Sat Sep 16 2023
 
The tropical depression remains poorly organized this afternoon. 
However, visible satellite imagery continues to indicate a broad 
region of low- and mid-level rotation, and deep convection has 
increased somewhat in the northern semicircle of the disturbance. 
Subjective Dvorak estimates from SAB and TAFB remain steady at 25 kt 
and 35 kt, respectively. Based on the current structure and the 
various intensity estimates, the intensity is held at 30 kt for this 
advisory. 
 
The initial motion is estimated at 330/14 kt. This general motion
is expected to continue for the next couple days as the depression
moves along the southern periphery of a mid-level ridge. Consensus 
track guidance, as well as the global and regional hurricane models, 
are in general agreement during the early portion of the forecast 
period. Early next week, the track forecast uncertainty increases 
somewhat as the system will begin to interact with a deep-layer 
trough. This trough interaction is expected to induce a more 
poleward shift in the track and eventually recurve the system toward 
the northeast after 96 hours. The NHC track forecast is in agreement 
with the consensus aids, TVCN and HCCA, and slightly faster than 
the prior forecast.
 
Environmental conditions remain favorable for intensification during 
the next several days, with low vertical wind shear and warm sea 
surface temperatures expected to persist along the forecast track. 
The timing of intensification will depend on how quickly the system 
is able to consolidate into a more compact structure. The current 
intensity forecast assumes that it will take 24-36 hours for this to 
happen, with the system expected to become a hurricane in 48 hours. 
The current forecast reaches 95 kt by 72 h, although the regional 
hurricane models HWRF and HAFS indicate that a major hurricane is 
not out of the question. ECMWF-SHIPS guidance continues to indicate 
the possibility of rapid intensification in the next 72 hours. By 
mid-week, as the system recurves to the northeast, it is expected to 
gradually weaken as southwesterly shear increases. The NHC forecast 
is in the middle of the guidance envelope and is similar to both the 
prior forecast and HCCA.
