200 PM EDT Sun Sep 10 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Lee, located a few hundred miles north-northeast of the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands, and on Tropical Storm Margot, located over the <br/>
central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL97):<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity associated with a weak area of <br/>
low pressure, located a few hundred miles to the southwest of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands remains disorganized.  Environmental conditions <br/>
are forecast to become less conducive for development during the <br/>
next day or so as the disturbance moves slowly westward over the <br/>
eastern tropical Atlantic.  The system is forecast to merge with a <br/>
larger tropical wave to its east in a couple of days and no further <br/>
development is expected after that time. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent. <br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located over the far eastern tropical Atlantic just <br/>
west of the coast of Africa is producing disorganized cloudiness <br/>
and showers.  Environmental conditions appear conducive for some <br/>
gradual development of this system during the latter part of this <br/>
week as it moves westward to west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph <br/>
over the central tropical Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent. <br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located 
near latitude 22.1 North, longitude 61.7 West. Lee is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A slower west-northwestward 
motion is expected during the next few days.  On the forecast track, 
Lee is expected to pass well north of the northern Leeward Islands, 
the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico during the next day or two.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that the maximum sustained winds have increased to near 120 mph (195 
km/h) with higher gusts.  Lee is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional strengthening 
is forecast during the next day or so.  Some fluctuations in 
intensity are possible on Monday and Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure reported by Air Force Reserve 
reconnaissance is 954 mb (28.17 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, and Bermuda.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Dangerous surf and rip currents have begun 
to reach portions of the southeast U.S. East Coast and are forecast 
to worsen and spread northward along much of the U.S. East Coast 
during the next couple of days. Please consult products from your 
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
500 PM AST Sun Sep 10 2023
 
Lee has continued to become better organized today. The eye has 
become more apparent in both infrared and visible satellite
imagery this afternoon, and reconnaissance aircraft reports 
indicate that the eye has contracted today.  An Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft that is currently investigating Lee has 
measured peak 700-mb flight-level winds of 112 kt and SFMR winds of 
106 kt. Near the conclusion of the earlier NOAA P-3 aircraft 
mission an eyewall dropsonde measured mean boundary layer winds in 
the lowest 150 m of the sonde of 117 kt, which supported surface 
winds of around 100 kt.  Based on the improved satellite 
presentation and the recent SFMR wind report, Lee's initial 
intensity has been raised to 105 kt.
 
As mentioned this morning, the vertical wind shear over Lee appears
to have decreased as the upper-level outflow has become better
established over the southern and southwestern portions of the
storm.  Some further reduction in shear is anticipated during the
next day or so, and Lee is expected to restrengthen during that
time.  The NHC intensity prediction calls for steady intensification
during the next 24 hours or so, and Lee is forecast regain category
4 status tonight or early Monday.  After that time, the slow 
motion of the hurricane could cause the water beneath the hurricane 
to cool due to upwelling, which is likely to cause Lee's intensity 
to plateau or weaken slight during the middle portion of the 
forecast period.  By days 4 and 5, increasing southwesterly shear 
is likely to cause weakening, however Lee's wind field is expected 
to expand by that time, and Lee is forecast to remain a strong 
hurricane through most of this week.
 
Lee is moving west-northwestward or 300 at 7 kt. Lee's is expected 
to move slowly northwestward during the next couple of days as its 
forward progress is impeded by a high pressure ridge located to the 
northwest of the storm.  By Wednesday, a mid-latitude trough moving 
across the Great Lakes region and into the northeastern United 
States should weaken the ridge and allow Lee to turn northward.  The 
ECMWF model has trended faster with the northward progression of Lee 
late in the period and there is a little less spread in the guidance 
at day 5.  The updated NHC track forecast is very similar the 
previous track, but has trended a bit faster later in the period.  
Users should be reminded to not focus on the exact forecast track, 
especially at the longer range, as the average day 4 and 5 track 
errors are about 145 and 200 miles, respectively. 

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents will affect
portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto 
Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, and 
Bermuda through much of this week.
 
2. Lee could bring wind, rainfall, and high surf impacts to
Bermuda later this week.  Although it is too soon to determine the
specific timing and level of those impacts, interests on Bermuda
should monitor the latest forecasts for Lee.
 
3. It remains too soon to know what level of impacts, if any,
Lee might have along the U.S. East Coast and Atlantic Canada late
this week, especially since the hurricane is expected to slow
down considerably over the southwestern Atlantic.  Regardless,
dangerous surf and rip currents are expected along most of the U.S.
East Coast this week as Lee grows in size. Users should continue to
monitor updates to the forecast of Lee during the next several days.

Tropical Storm Margot Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
500 PM AST Sun Sep 10 2023
 
Margot has become better organized this afternoon. Visible and 
infrared satellite imagery indicate that the low-level center has 
tucked up under the deep convection. A recent SSMI/S microwave pass 
depicts that there is well-defined curved banding around the center. 
Deep convection continues to burst near the center. Subjective and 
objective Dvorak satellite estimates from TAFB and SAB are T/3.5 and 
T/3.0, respectively. Given the improved structure, this advisory 
will lean towards the higher end of these estimates and the initial 
intensity is raised to 55 kt. 
 
Margot is still within an environment of moderate southwesterly wind 
shear. The vertical wind shear is forecast to persist, but 
strengthening is forecast over the coming days as the system is 
entering a more favorable upper-level divergent wind pattern. Margot 
will continue to traverse warm sea surface temperatures throughout 
the forecast period, around 28 degrees Celsius.  The NHC forecast is 
slightly higher in the short term, with Margot forecast to become a 
hurricane on Monday. The NHC intensity forecast lies near the HCCA 
and IVCN consensus intensity aids.
 
Margot is moving northward at around 8 kt. A northward motion is 
expected to continue into a weakness in the central Atlantic 
subtropical ridge. In about 2 to 3 days, Margot's forward motion is 
forecast to slow down as the steering flow weakens. Towards the end 
of the forecast period, there remains considerably large 
cross-track model spread. The NHC track forecast lies between the 
consensus aids, with the system meandering over the central 
Atlantic.
