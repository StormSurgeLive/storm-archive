...LEE TO PASS WELL NORTH OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS DURING THE NEXT
DAY OR SO...
...HAZARDOUS BEACH CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP AROUND THE WESTERN
ATLANTIC THROUGH NEXT WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.7N 59.1W
ABOUT 310 MI...505 KM NE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...115 MPH...185 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...958 MB...28.29 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 20.7 North, longitude 59.1 West. Lee is moving toward
the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A slower west- 
northwestward motion is expected during the next few days.  On the
forecast track, Lee is expected to pass well to the north of the
northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico into
early next week.

Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Lee is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Gradual restrengthening is possible during 
the next couple of days. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km). NOAA buoy 40144 located about 85 miles north-northeast of 
the center of Lee has reported a peak sustained wind of 54 mph (86 
km/h) with a gust to 67 mph (107 km/h) within the past couple of 
hours. 

The estimated minimum central pressure is 958 mb (28.29 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser 
Antilles, and are spreading westward to the British and U.S. Virgin 
Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the 
Bahamas, and Bermuda through this weekend. These swells are likely 
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Dangerous 
surf and rip currents are expected to begin along most of the U.S. 
East Coast on Sunday and Monday and worsen through the week. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
1100 AM AST Sat Sep 09 2023
 
Satellite imagery shows that deep convection continues to pulse
near the center of Lee.  Recent reports from reconnaissance
aircraft and an earlier SSMIS microwave image indicates that Lee 
has a small (5 to 10 n-mi-wide) eye that is obscured by the
higher convective cloud tops.  The NOAA P-3 Hurricane Hunter
aircraft penetrated the eye around 1013 UTC this morning and found
that the pressure was down a few millibars.  The NOAA aircraft
measured peak SFMR surface winds of 100 kt, and 700-mb flight-level
winds of 103 kt.   An Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft
remains in the storm environment, but due to safety concerns was
not able to penetrate the northeastern eyewall on its first pass
through the storm due to very strong convection and mesovortices
orbiting the small eye.  A recent center drop from the Air Force
plane suggest that the minimum pressure is around 957 mb.  Drops
from both aircraft and Doppler radar data from the earlier NOAA
aircraft indicate that there is some southwest to northeast tilt 
to the vortex.  Based on the aircraft data, the initial intensity
remains 100 kt for this advisory.
 
There is still some question as to how conducive the upper-level
environment will be during the next few days.  The GFS and regional
hurricane models indicate that the shear that has been affecting
Lee will decrease today, and that the upper-level wind pattern will
become much more favorable for restrengthening.  Meanwhile, the
ECMWF and UKMET models depict a less favorable environment, with a
continuation of at least some moderate shear.  The NHC forecast
follows the scenario that there will be at least some relaxation of 
the shear and it calls for gradual restrengthening during the next 
two to three days.  The official wind speed forecast is not as high 
as some of the dynamical model guidance, but is a blend of the HFIP 
corrected consensus model and the IVCN multi-model consensus.
 
Lee is still moving west-northwestward or 300/10 kt. A mid-level
ridge located over the central Atlantic is forecast to build
west-southwestward during the next few days.  This should keep Lee
on a general west-northwestward heading, but the building ridge is
expected to impede Lee's progress, and a much slower forward speed
is anticipated over the next several days. By Wednesday, Lee should
begin to turn northwestward, and then north-northwestward as a 
mid-latitude trough moves into the Great Lakes region and eastern 
United States.  While the cross track spread in the guidance 
remains fairly low, there is significant long track (forward speed) 
spread in the models.  The GFS and ECMWF depict similar overall 
tracks, but the cross-track spread between those two typically 
reliable models is more than 150 n mi by day 3. The NHC forecast 
splits these speed differences and lies near the various consensus 
aids.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Lee's core is expected to move well north of the northern
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico this weekend
and early next week.
 
2. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents are affecting
portions of the northern Leeward Islands.  These conditions are
spreading westward and northward and will begin affecting Puerto
Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, and Bermuda
later today and Sunday.
 
3. It is way too soon to know what level of impacts, if any, Lee
might have along the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic Canada, or Bermuda
late next week, particularly since the hurricane is expected to
slow down considerably over the southwestern Atlantic.  Regardless,
dangerous surf and rip currents are expected along most of the U.S.
East Coast beginning Sunday and Monday.  Continue to monitor
updates to Lee's forecast during the next several days.

Tropical Storm Margot Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
1100 AM AST Sat Sep 09 2023
 
Margot is looking a little better organized on satellite imagery 
this morning compared to yesterday. A SSMIS microwave pass from 
earlier this morning depicted that some banding features are trying 
to develop on the northeastern side of the low-level center. The 
deep convection also continues to burst near the center of the 
system as well, with cold cloud tops. Subjective and objective 
satellite intensity estimates from SAB/TAFB remain the same as the 
previous cycle. Therefore, the initial intensity remains 40 kt for 
this advisory.
 
Margot is currently within an environment of moderate vertical wind 
shear and dry mid-level relative humidities. However, despite the 
less than favorable environment the intensity guidance indicates 
that Margot will gradually strengthen over the next few days as it 
enters a more favorable upper-level wind pattern, and continues 
over warm sea surface temperatures.  The NHC forecast therefore 
shows slow strengthening throughout the forecast period, similar to 
the previous advisory, and lies near the HCCA and IVCN consensus 
aids.
 
Margot is moving west-northwestward at 10 kt around the edge of a 
subtropical ridge over the eastern Atlantic. This west-northwest 
motion will continue during the next day or so, followed by a turn 
to the northwest and northward by late in the weekend and early next 
week, with a slower forward motion.  Models are in fairly good 
agreement in the short-term. However, the track model spread 
increases in both cross- and along-track spread beyond day 3 to 4, 
as there is some uncertainty in the steering flow.  The NHC track 
forecast lies near the model consensus aids, and only slight 
adjustments to the previous forecast were made.
