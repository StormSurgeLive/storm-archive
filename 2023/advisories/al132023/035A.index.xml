* Nova Scotia southeast coast from north of Medway Harbour to
Porterâ€™s Lake
 
A Storm Surge Watch is in effect for...
* Cape Cod Bay
* Nantucket
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within the
next 6 to 12 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.
 
Interests elsewhere in the northeastern United States and Atlantic
Canada should monitor the progress of Lee.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products 
issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located 
near latitude 28.5 North, longitude 68.0 West.  Lee is moving 
toward the north near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A generally northward motion 
and an increase in forward speed are expected through Friday.  On 
the forecast track, the center of Lee will pass west of Bermuda 
today and tonight and then approach the coast of New England and 
Atlantic Canada Friday and Saturday.
 
Data from Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds are now near 100 mph (155 
km/h) with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast, but Lee
is expected to remain a large and dangerous hurricane for the next
couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 265
miles (425 km).  Saildrone 1065 recently measured a sustained wind 
of 73 mph (117 km/h), a gust to 94 mph (152 km/h), and a 
significant wave height of 44 feet (13.3 meters) while located 
about 65 miles (100 km) northeast of Lee's center.
 
The minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data is 953 mb 
(28.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in Bermuda starting
in a few hours.  Hurricane conditions are possible in portions of
Down East Maine and in the Hurricane Watch area in Atlantic Canada
on Saturday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible in portions of
coastal New England and Atlantic Canada in the Tropical Storm Watch
area beginning Friday night.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Chatham, MA to Sagamore Beach, MA...2-4 ft
Cape Cod Bay...2-4 ft
Nantucket...2-4 ft
Sagamore Beach, MA to Border of US/Canada...1-3 ft
Boston Harbor...1-3 ft
Flushing, NY to Chatham, MA...1-3 ft
Montauk Point, NY to Flushing, NY...1-3 ft
Long Island Sound...1-3 ft
Martha's Vineyard...1-3 ft
Rockaway Inlet, NY to Montauk Point, NY...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
A dangerous storm surge could produce coastal flooding within the
wind watch areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of onshore winds.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the
east coast of the United States, and are beginning to reach Atlantic
Canada. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Outer rain bands from Lee could produce rainfall amounts
of 1 to 2 inches, or 25 to 50 millimeters, across Bermuda today into 
early Friday.
 
From Friday night through Saturday night, Lee is expected to produce
rainfall amounts of 1 to 4 inches, or 25 to 100 millimeters, across
portions of eastern New England into portions of New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia. This could produce localized urban and small stream
flooding.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  35
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 13 2023
 
Both NOAA and Air Force Reserve Unit Hurricane Hunter aircraft have
been investigating Lee this evening.  They found that the central
pressure has not changed much since earlier today, and that the
hurricane still had concentric eyewalls, but these were partially
open over portions of the western quadrant.  The Air Force
plane measured  700 mb flight-level winds as high as 105 kt and
the NOAA plane found winds as high as 107 kt at a flight level of
8000 ft.  Tail Doppler radar velocities from the NOAA plane were
near 100 kt at elevations of 0.5 km.  These observations support
maintaining the intensity at 90 kt for this advisory.  Satellite
imagery also suggests that the eyewall is not fully closed but
there is fairly intense inner-core convection.
 
There has been a (likely temporary) decrease in forward speed and
the initial motion is just west of due north or 350/8 kt.  The
steering scenario for the hurricane is essentially unchanged from
the previous few advisories.  A 500-mb trough moving into the
northeastern U.S. and a mid-level ridge near eastern Atlantic
Canada should cause Lee to move generally northward at a faster
forward speed during the next couple of days.  A slight bend to the
left is likely around 48 hours while the tropical cyclone interacts
with the trough.  This will likely bring the center of Lee close to
southeastern New England late Friday before it moves near or over
Maine and Atlantic Canada later in the weekend.  The official track
forecast is similar to the previous one and closely follows both the
simple and corrected dynamical consensus guidance.

Over the next couple of days, Lee will encounter significantly 
increasing vertical wind shear and somewhat drier mid- to low-level 
air.  Sea surface temperatures along the projected track decrease 
sharply north of around 40N latitude. These conditions should cause 
weakening, but since the hurricane has such a large circulation, the 
weakening will likely be slow.  The NHC intensity forecast is near 
or above the highest available model guidance.  Notwithstanding, 
there is still high confidence that Lee will be a large and 
dangerous cyclone when it moves near or over land on Saturday.
  
It should again be noted that the 34- and 50-kt wind speed
probabilities beyond 36 hours in the text and graphical products are
likely underestimating the risk of those winds occurring.  This is
because the forecast wind field of Lee is considerably larger than
average compared to the wind field used to derive the wind speed
probability product.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions, heavy rainfall, and high surf are
expected to impact Bermuda beginning early Thursday, and a Tropical
Storm Warning is in effect for the island.
 
2. Hurricane conditions and coastal flooding are possible in 
portions of eastern Maine, southern New Brunswick, and western Nova 
Scotia on Saturday, and a Hurricane Watch has been issued for that 
area.  Heavy rainfall in these areas may produce localized urban 
and small stream flooding from Friday night into Saturday night. 
 
3. There is the potential for life-threatening storm surge flooding
in portions of southeastern Massachusetts, including Cape Cod and
Nantucket, late Friday and Saturday, where a Storm Surge Watch has
been issued.
 
4. Tropical storm conditions are possible over a large portion of
coastal New England, including Cape Cod, Nantucket, Martha's
Vineyard, Block Island, and portions of Atlantic Canada, where a
Tropical Storm Watch has been issued.

BULLETIN
Hurricane Margot Advisory Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
300 AM GMT Thu Sep 14 2023
 
...MARGOT TO MEANDER OVER THE NORTH ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM GMT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...35.2N 40.5W
ABOUT 770 MI...1245 KM W OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...85 MPH...140 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 10 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...972 MB...28.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM GMT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Margot was located 
near latitude 35.2 North, longitude 40.5 West. Margot is moving 
toward the north near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this motion is expected 
to continue with a gradual decrease in forward speed through 
Thursday. Margot is then likely to meander within weak steering 
currents through this weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Steady weakening is forecast over the next few 
days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230
miles (370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 972 mb (28.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Margot will continue to affect the
Azores for the next several days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM GMT.

Hurricane Margot Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
300 AM GMT Thu Sep 14 2023

Margot's satellite depiction has become more ragged during the last 
few hours. An earlier microwave pass showed that the center was 
partially opened on the northern and western sides of the system. 
Dry air is beginning to wrap into the center of the system, which 
has caused some of the banding features to become broken. The center 
has been cloud filled since the previous advisory, with overall 
warming cloud tops. Satellite Dvorak current intensity estimates 
were both 4.5 from TAFB and SAB. Given these estimates and the 
degraded satellite depiction, the initial intensity for this 
advisory is lowered to 75 kt.
 
Margot continues to gradually slow down as it moves within the flow 
between a deep-layer ridge over the eastern Atlantic and an upper 
trough to its west. A general northward motion should continue over 
the next day or so. The steering pattern becomes fairly weak with a 
blocking ridge to the north of the system, causing Margot to meander 
over the north Atlantic and make a gradual clockwise loop over the 
next 2 to 3 days. There are still some large differences in the 
guidance envelope in the long term, but slightly better agreement 
than 24 h ago. By the end of the period, the storm will likely 
begin accelerating off to the east-northeast as it gets picked up by 
the westerlies, but the overall track forecast confidence remains 
low given the model spread.
 
Margot's convective structure has degraded this evening. The system 
is entering a less favorable environment, with dry air entrainment 
beginning to erode some of the structure. Deep-layer shear is also 
forecast to increase, and upwelling of cooler waters due to the lack 
of forward motion should result in weakening of the system through 
the weekend. The NHC intensity forecast is similar to the previous 
advisory and lies near the corrected consensus aids, the HCCA and 
IVCN. Although the forecast keeps Margot a tropical cyclone through 
day 5, simulated satellite imagery from the global models suggests 
these increasingly hostile environmental factors could cause the 
system to lose organized convection and become post-tropical sooner.
