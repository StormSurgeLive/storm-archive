DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Lee
was located near latitude 42.7 North, longitude 66.2 West.  Lee is
moving toward the north near 25 mph (41 km/h).  A northward motion
but at a slower forward speed is expected later today, and the
center of Lee is forecast to reach western Nova Scotia around
midday.  Lee is then expected to turn toward the north-northeast and
northeast and move across Atlantic Canada tonight and Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Lee is expected to be at or just below hurricane strength 
when it reaches Nova Scotia later today.  Weakening is forecast 
tonight and Sunday while Lee moves across Atlantic Canada.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 390
miles (630 km).  A sustained wind of 47 mph (76 km/h) and a gust to
55 mph (89 km/h) in Nantucket, Massachusetts.  A wind gust of 77 
mph (124 km/h) was recently reported in Grand Manan Island in New 
Brunswick, Canada. 
 
The minimum central pressure is estimated to be 965 mb (28.50 
inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch
areas in Atlantic Canada later today.  Tropical storm conditions
are occurring along the coasts of New England and Nova Scotia and
will spread northward within the Tropical Storm Warning areas today
and tonight.  The strong winds are likely to lead to downed trees
and potential power outages.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting the U.S. Virgin
Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the
Bahamas, Bermuda, the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic
Canada.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Through tonight, Lee is expected to produce rainfall
amounts of 1 to 4 inches (25 to 100 millimeters) over far eastern
Massachusetts, eastern Maine, western Nova Scotia, and New
Brunswick.  This may produce localized urban and small stream
flooding.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Watch Hill, RI to the U.S./Canada border...1-3 ft
Cape Cod...1-3 ft
Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket...1-3 ft
Boston Harbor...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
A dangerous storm surge will produce coastal flooding within the
wind warning areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of onshore winds.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Lee Discussion Number  44
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
500 AM AST Sat Sep 16 2023
 
Lee appears to have completed its transition to a post-tropical 
cyclone.  The cloud pattern is comma shaped, and there has been no 
significant central deep convection for the past 12 hours or so.  
The cyclone is now frontal but likely still has a warm core, 
indicating that it is a warm seclusion-type of extratropical 
cyclone.  Despite this transition, it remains a potent cyclone, and 
the initial intensity remains 70 kt since the Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunters measured SFMR winds as high as 66 kt about 110 n 
mi southwest of the center.

Lee accelerated more than expected during the past 6-12 hours, and 
the current motion is estimated to be northward (355 degrees) at 22 
kt.  The aircraft fixes and recent satellite imagery indicate that 
the center has bent back to the west by just a bit, which was 
expected, likely due to interaction with a mid-level trough which 
moved off the U.S. Mid-Atlantic coast.  A general northward motion, 
but at a slower forward speed, is expected today, and Lee's center 
is now forecast to reach western Nova Scotia around midday.  The 
cyclone is then expected to turn toward the north-northeast and 
then northeast, moving across Atlantic Canada and the Gulf of St. 
Lawrence tonight through Sunday.  Due to the recent acceleration, 
the new NHC track forecast is faster than, but still otherwise on 
top of, the previous prediction. 
 
Lee's center has moved north of the Gulf Stream, and water 
temperatures along the cyclone's path are down to 20 degrees 
Celsius and decreasing.  Intensity models indicate that Lee should 
begin gradually weakening very soon, although the maximum winds are 
likely to still be at or just below hurricane strength (mainly 
over water) when Lee's center reaches Nova Scotia later today.  The 
NHC intensity forecast closely follows the GFS and ECMWF solutions, 
and Lee is expected to continue producing gale-force winds while it 
moves across Atlantic Canada tonight through Sunday.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Hurricane conditions are possible across portions southern New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia later today within the Hurricane Watch 
areas.  Tropical storm conditions and coastal flooding are
occurring across portions of coastal New England and Atlantic 
Canada, and will continue to spread northward within the Tropical 
Storm Warning areas.  The strong winds are likely to lead to downed 
trees and potential power outages.
 
2. Heavy rainfall from Lee may produce localized urban and small 
stream flooding in portions of far eastern Massachusetts, eastern 
Maine, New Brunswick, and western Nova Scotia today.

3. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents will continue 
to affect the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic Canada, Bermuda, the 
Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, the 
Virgin Islands, and the northern Leeward Islands through the 
weekend.

Tropical Storm Margot Discussion Number  36
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
900 AM GMT Sat Sep 16 2023
 
This morning, Margo's structure on satellite imagery has degraded 
some. Cloud top temperatures surrounding the tropical cyclone have 
been gradually warming, and there is evidence of northerly vertical 
wind shear beginning to impinge on the storm due to flow from a 
poleward amplifying upper-level anticyclone. The subjective 
intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB have been slowly decreasing, 
though the AiDT, D-PRINT, & D-MINT estimates remain a bit higher. A 
compromise of these various data support a slightly weaker intensity 
of 50 kt on this advisory. 
 
Margot continues to execute a slow clockwise turn, with the 
estimated motion now southwestward at 220/6 kt. A gradual turn to 
the west and then northwest is anticipated over the next 24-36 hours 
as the cyclone rounds the southern periphery of a mid-level ridge 
shifting gradually northeast of Margot. It is interesting to note 
that Margot's track evolution over the last several days appears to 
have been remotely influenced by Lee, where mid-level height rises 
north of the tropical storm are in part related to diabatic ridge 
building downstream of Lee. Ultimately the same trough that is 
phasing with post-tropical cyclone Lee will pick up Margot as well, 
with the cyclone turning northeast and even eastward by the end of 
the forecast. The latest track forecast is not far off the previous 
forecast, but a little farther to the south and west over the first 
day or so, adjusting a bit towards the reliable consensus aids. 

The vertical wind shear diagnosed by SHIPS guidance is not expected 
to abate much over the next 24 hours, and Margot will be moving over 
its own cold wake it previously generated along its forecast track. 
Thus, weakening is anticipated, and simulated satellite imagery from 
both the GFS and ECMWF suggest that the cyclone may cease to produce 
enough convection to qualify as a tropical cyclone sometime in the 
36-48 hour period, though this is not explicitly shown. However, 
most of the guidance agrees a favorable trough interaction may 
result in a convective resurgence in the 60-72 h time period, and 
the latest intensity forecast shows some re-intensification during 
that time period. The trough is expected to ultimately leave behind 
Margot, with increasing shear and cooler sea-surface temperatures 
likely to result in the system becoming a post-tropical cyclone for 
good in the day 4-5 day time period.

Tropical Depression Fifteen Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
500 AM AST Sat Sep 16 2023

Finding the exact center of the tropical depression this morning has 
been a challenge. While there is a large region of mid-level 
cyclonic rotation in the shortwave IR imagery, there isn't much 
evidence that the low-level circulation has tightened up any from 
the earlier ASCAT passes. This was confirmed by a 0501 UTC AMSR2 
microwave pass which only had a subtle hint of banding with the 
ongoing convection in the depression's northern semicircle. 
Subjective Dvorak estimates were 25 kt and 35 kt from SAB and TAFB, 
respectively. Objective intensity estimates were also in the 30-35 
kt range. Given the continued broad structure, the intensity is held 
at 30 kt for this advisory.

Given the current structure of the depression, its initial motion 
has higher-than-normal uncertainty but is currently estimated at 
330/12 kt. A general northwest to north-northwest motion is expected 
to continue for the next day or two, as the system is steered 
between a mid-level ridge centered to its northeast, and a 
deep-layer trough, centered to its west. The track guidance in the 
short-term has actually shifted a bit more poleward early on, and 
the NHC track was nudged in that direction over the first 48 hours 
or so. One interesting caveat to this track forecast is Margot, 
which has weakened the overall magnitude of the ridge steering 
TD15, and may explain the more poleward shift in the guidance 
the last few cycles. Thereafter, as Margot moves out of the 
picture, the mid-level ridge should briefly build back in, and 
the guidance this cycle shows a subtle bend more northwestward 
between 48-72 hours. However, another mid-latitude trough is 
expected to move off the eastern U.S. coastline in about 4-5 days, 
eroding this ridge enough to begin recurvature by the end of the 
forecast period. The NHC track forecast is in best agreement with 
the TVCN and HCCA consensus aids. 

The intensity forecast early on is largely dependent on how TD15's 
broad structure evolves, since environmentally vertical wind shear 
is low, sea-surface temperatures are anomalously warm, and the 
system is in a pocket of enhanced mid-level moisture. The 
uncertainty of structural evolution is highlighted by the regional 
hurricane models, which over the past few cycles have oscillated 
between the system developing a small inner core versus a broader 
structure that intensifies more slowly despite the favorable 
environment. The latest intensity forecast assumes it will take a 
day or so for the core to consolidate, only showing a slow rate of 
intensification for the next 24 hours, which is on the low side of 
the intensity guidance. However, assuming an inner core does form in 
the 36-48 hour time frame, a period of rapid intensification is 
possible, which is best highlighted by the ECMWF-SHIPS guidance 
which shows a 45 percent chance of a 65-kt increase in intensity in 
72 hours, more than eight times the climatological mean. This 
possibility is shown in the NHC intensity forecast, which shows a 
peak intensity of 95 kt in 72 hours. While not explicitly shown, it 
still remains possible TD15 could become a major hurricane sometime 
between the 72-96 hour forecast period, though some increase in 
southwesterly shear and inner core fluctuations will likely result 
in gradual weakening by the end of the forecast. The NHC intensity 
forecast is somewhat higher than the consensus aids at peak 
intensity.
