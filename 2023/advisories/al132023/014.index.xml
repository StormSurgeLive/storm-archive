...CORE OF POWERFUL HURRICANE LEE EXPECTED TO PASS WELL NORTH OF
THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS THIS WEEKEND...
...DANGEROUS SURF AND RIP CURRENT CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP
AROUND THE WESTERN ATLANTIC THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.9N 55.5W
ABOUT 500 MI...805 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...150 MPH...240 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...942 MB...27.82 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 18.9 North, longitude 55.5 West. Lee is moving toward
the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this motion is
expected to continue through early next week with a significant
decrease in forward speed. On the forecast track, Lee is expected
to pass well to the north of the northern Leeward Islands, the
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico over the weekend and into early
next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 150 mph (240 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Lee is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are likely
over the next few days, however Lee is expected to remain a
powerful major hurricane through early next week. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 942 mb (27.82 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the
Lesser Antilles, and will reach the British and U.S. Virgin
Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the
Bahamas, and Bermuda this weekend. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Dangerous surf and
rip currents are expected to begin along most of the U.S. East Coast
beginning Sunday and Monday.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
500 PM AST Fri Sep 08 2023
 
The small eye of Lee has become cloud filled this afternoon. 
A 1643 UTC AMSR2 microwave overpass and the earlier reconnaissance 
aircraft reports indicate that Lee's eye was a little less than 
10 n mi in diameter.  The microwave imagery revealed a well-defined
inner core but there was a lack of banding noted just outside the 
core. This is likely due to some drier mid-level air that has 
wrapped into the circulation.  The Air Force Reserve Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft did not find any stronger flight-level or SFMR winds 
after the release of the previous advisory, and the initial 
intensity for this advisory has been set at 130 kt.  This is a blend 
of the earlier reconnaissance data and subjective Dvorak intensity 
estimates of T6.5 or 127 kt from TAFB and SAB.  NOAA and Air Force 
reconnaissance aircraft are scheduled to investigate Lee again this 
evening. 
 
The moderate shear and dry mid-level air that has affected Lee
today is not expected to abate during the next 12-24 hours.  After
that time, the upper-level wind pattern could become a little more
conducive for re-strengthening.  However, the timing of eyewall
replacement cycles makes it difficult to predict when Lee might
re-intensify.  Although there is lower-than-normal confidence in
the exact details of the intensity forecast, there is high
confidence that Lee will remain a powerful hurricane into early next
week. The latest NHC wind speed forecast is a blend of the HFIP
corrected consensus model and the multi-model intensity consensus
aids.

Lee continues to move west-northwestward or 300 degrees at 11 kt. 
A well-established mid- to upper-level ridge over the central 
Atlantic should continue to steer the hurricane west-northward into 
early next week.  The ridge is forecast to build southwestward near 
Bermuda late this weekend and early next week which is expected 
cause Lee's forward speed to slow around 5-7 kt between days 2-4. 
Late in the period, a mid-latitude trough that will be moving into 
the Great Lakes Region is forecast to weaken the western portion of 
the ridge, and Lee should begin to turn more poleward around that 
time.  The track guidance is still in good agreement through about 
72 hours, but there is slightly more spread at days 4 and 5. 
The spread is primarily related to speed differences in the guidance 
during the latter portion of the forecast period.   The latest NHC 
track prediction is again close to the HCCA and TCVA consensus 
aids, and it is very similar to the previous official forecast. 


KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Lee's core is expected to move well north of the northern
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico this weekend
and early next week.
 
2. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents are affecting 
portions of the northern Leeward Islands.  These conditions
will spread westward and northward, affecting Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, and Bermuda
through the weekend.
 
3. It is way too soon to know what level of impacts, if any, Lee
might have along the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic Canada, or Bermuda
late next week, particularly since the hurricane is expected to
slow down considerably over the southwestern Atlantic.  Regardless,
dangerous surf and rip currents are expected along most of the U.S.
East Coast beginning Sunday and Monday.  Continue to monitor 
updates to Lee's forecast during the next several days.

Tropical Storm Margot Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
500 PM AST Fri Sep 08 2023
 
Margot continues to be a disorganized tropical storm. Over the past 
few hours, visible satellite depicts the low-level center has become 
exposed with deep convection displaced to the northeast. This deep 
convection has continued to persist, however the system has not 
become better organized today. An earlier AMSR2 microwave pass 
showed that the structure of the system is fairly poor with very 
little banding features. Subjective and objective satellite 
intensity estimates from SAB/TAFB for this advisory were unchanged 
for this cycle. Given the disorganized structure and the satellite 
estimates, the initial intensity remains 35 kt for this advisory.
 
The tropical storm is moving west-northwestward at about 15 kt along 
the southern edge of a mid-level ridge.  Margot is expected to 
continue this general motion for the next day or so.  Afterwards a 
weakness in the ridge will allow for a turn more northwestward, then 
northward by early next week.  Overall, models are in fairly good 
cross-track agreement in the short term. However beyond day 
3, there begins to be some divergence in the model suite, due to 
uncertainty in the steering flow. The ECMWF lies on the left side of 
the envelope, while the GFS is on the right side.  The official 
track forecast is similar to the previous advisory, and lies in the 
center of the guidance closest to the HCCA and TVCA consensus aids.
 
The intensity forecast is fairly difficult given the mixed 
environmental conditions. Sea surface temperatures are sufficiently 
warm along the forecast track, but vertical wind shear is already 
impacting the system and is forecast to remain throughout much of 
the forecast period. Given the competing factors and current lack of 
organization, the intensity guidance shows only gradual 
strengthening throughout the forecast period. The official forecast 
is similar to the previous, near the intensity consensus aids the 
IVCN and HCCA.
