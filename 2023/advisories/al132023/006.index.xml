Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD<br/>
200 PM EDT Wed Sep 6 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical<br/>
Storm Lee, located over the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL96):<br/>
A tropical wave is producing a large area of disorganized showers<br/>
and thunderstorms over the far eastern Atlantic between the Cabo<br/>
Verde Islands and the west coast of Africa.  Environmental<br/>
conditions appear conducive for some gradual development of this<br/>
system, and a tropical depression could form later this week or this<br/>
weekend while the system moves west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph<br/>
over the eastern tropical Atlantic. This system is expected to move<br/>
across the Cabo Verde Islands today and tonight, and interests there<br/>
should monitor its progress.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Northeastern Atlantic (ex-Franklin):<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity associated with Post-Tropical<br/>
Cyclone Franklin, located a few hundred miles east-northeast of the<br/>
Azores, has become a little better organized today. Although<br/>
environmental conditions are only marginally favorable for<br/>
additional development this system could briefly acquire some<br/>
subtropical or tropical characteristics during the next day or so,<br/>
while it moves northeastward or northward over the northeastern<br/>
Atlantic. By Friday, further development is not expected as the<br/>
system is forecast to move into unfavorable environmental<br/>
conditions, which should cause it to weaken. For additional<br/>
information, including gale warnings, see High Seas Forecasts issued<br/>
by Meteo France.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>

...LEE STRENGTHENS INTO A HURRICANE...
...LIKELY TO INTENSIFY INTO AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS MAJOR HURRICANE 
BY EARLY SATURDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.9N 46.4W
ABOUT 1130 MI...1815 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...991 MB...29.27 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands should monitor the
progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 14.9 North, longitude 46.4 West. Lee is moving toward
the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h), and this motion is
expected to continue for the next few days with a slight reduction
in forward speed over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Continued steady to rapid strengthening is
forecast, and Lee is expected to become a major hurricane in a day 
or two. 

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.27 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are expected to reach portions of
the Lesser Antilles on Friday, and reach the British and U.S. 
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico this weekend. These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
500 PM AST Wed Sep 06 2023
 
Lee has continued to quickly organize today. Convective banding,
especially over the eastern semicircle of the storm, has increased
since this morning.  The center is embedded within a small central
dense overcast, and earlier this afternoon there was a hint of a 
ragged eye in visible imagery.  Although subjective Dvorak 
intensity estimates from SAB and TAFB were still T3.5 (55 kt) and 
most of the objective estimate are slightly below hurricane 
strength, the initial intensity has been increased to 65 kt based 
on the continued improvement in organization this afternoon, and 
the presence of a mid-level eye in a recent SSMIS microwave 
overpass. Lee becomes the fourth hurricane of the 2023 Atlantic 
hurricane season. 

Recent satellite fixes suggest that Lee took a northwestward jog 
this afternoon, however the longer-term motion is still 
west-northwestward at about 12 kt.  A mid-level ridge located 
to the north of Lee should continue to steer the cyclone on a
west-northwestward heading through the weekend.  Near the end of
the forecast period, Lee will be approaching the western periphery
of the ridge and the forward motion of the cyclone is likely to 
slow at that time.  The dynamical model guidance continues to
indicate that the core of Lee will pass to the north of the
northern Leeward Islands, however interests in those islands
should continue to monitor the latest forecasts as the typical
three-day NHC track error is about 90 n mi.  The NHC track 
forecast is again along the southern side of the guidance 
envelope, between the faster and farther south HFIP corrected 
consensus model, and the TVCA multi-model consensus aid.  The 
updated track foreast is slightly north of the previous advisory 
primarily due to the more northward initial position, and it is a 
little slower than the previous forecast to be closer to the 
latest consensus aids. 
 
The light to moderate east-northeasterly shear over Lee is forecast 
to decrease overnight, and that along with warm SSTs and a moist 
atmosphere along the forecast track should allow for additional 
intensification. With the small inner core seen in microwave 
imagery and favorable environmental conditions, a period of rapid 
strengthening is a distinct possibility within the next day or two.  
Although the exact timing of any rapid strengthening is tricky to 
anticipate, the official forecast calls for a substantial 65-kt 
increase in strength during the next 72 hours.  This is similar to 
the previous forecast, and is near the upper end of the intensity 
guidance.  By later in the weekend, hard-to-predict eyewall 
replacement cycles could cause some fluctuations in intensity.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Lee is forecast to become a major hurricane by early Saturday and
could bring impacts to the northern Leeward Islands this weekend.
While it is too soon to determine the location and magnitude of
these possible impacts, interests in this area should monitor the
progress of Lee and further updates to the forecast.
 
2. Swells generated by Lee are expected to reach portions of the
Lesser Antilles on Friday, and the British and U.S. Virgin Islands 
and Puerto Rico this weekend.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
