A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within the
next 6 to 12 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.
 
Interests elsewhere in the northeastern United States and Atlantic
Canada should monitor the progress of Lee.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United States, 
including possible inland watches and warnings, please monitor 
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast 
office. For storm information specific to your area outside of the 
United States, please monitor products issued by your national 
meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 29.1 North, longitude 68.1 West.  Lee is moving toward
the north near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion with an 
increase in forward speed is expected through Saturday.  A turn 
toward the north-northeast and then northeast is forecast Saturday 
night and Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Lee will 
pass west of Bermuda today and tonight, approach the coast of New 
England and Atlantic Canada Friday and Saturday, and move across 
Atlantic Canada Saturday night and Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Weakening is forecast, but Lee is expected to remain a 
large and dangerous hurricane for the next couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 290
miles (465 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 953 mb (28.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are beginning in Bermuda and will
continue through Friday.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the
Hurricane Watch areas in Down East Maine and in Atlantic Canada
on Saturday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible in the
Tropical Storm Watch area in coastal New England and Atlantic
Canada late Friday into Saturday.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Chatham, MA to Sagamore Beach, MA...2-4 ft
Cape Cod Bay...2-4 ft
Nantucket...2-4 ft
Sagamore Beach, MA to Border of US/Canada...1-3 ft
Boston Harbor...1-3 ft
Flushing, NY to Chatham, MA...1-3 ft
Montauk Point, NY to Flushing, NY...1-3 ft
Long Island Sound...1-3 ft
Martha's Vineyard...1-3 ft
Rockaway Inlet, NY to Montauk Point, NY...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
A dangerous storm surge could produce coastal flooding within the
wind watch areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of onshore winds.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the
east coast of the United States, and are beginning to reach Atlantic
Canada.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Outer rain bands from Lee could produce rainfall amounts
of 1 to 2 inches, or 25 to 50 millimeters, across Bermuda today into
early Friday.
 
From Friday night through Saturday night, Lee is expected to produce
rainfall amounts of 1 to 4 inches, or 25 to 100 millimeters, across
portions of eastern New England into portions of New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia. This could produce localized urban and small stream
flooding.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  36
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
500 AM AST Thu Sep 14 2023
 
Lee's satellite presentation has been a little deceiving early this 
morning, as earlier reconnaissance flight-level and dropsonde 
surface wind data indicated that the hurricane's center was located 
about 15-20 n mi to the west of the satellite eye feature.  On the 
last couple of passes of the Air Force Reserve C-130 through the 
center, the highest 700-mb wind measured was 95 kt, and peak SFMR 
readings from both the Air Force and NOAA were 70-75 kt.  Accounting 
for some undersampling, Lee's initial intensity is reduced slightly 
to 85 kt.
 
The initial motion remains 350/8 kt.  A faster northward motion, 
with some wobbles, is expected during the next 2-3 days as Lee 
moves between a mid-tropospheric high over the west-central Atlantic 
and a deep-layer trough over the eastern United States.  As noted 
in earlier forecasts, a slight bend to the west toward the Gulf 
of Maine is likely in 48-60 hours when Lee interacts with the tail 
end of the trough over the Mid-Atlantic states.  A turn toward the 
north-northeast and then northeast is forecast on days 3 and 4, 
bringing Lee's center across Atlantic Canada.  The NHC track 
forecast is nearly on top of the previous forecast, largely due to 
consistent and tightly clustered model guidance.

The latest shear analyses suggest that moderate southwesterly shear 
has begun to affect Lee, and this is confirmed by the offset of 
the aircraft fixes relative to the satellite eye feature.  The 
shear is forecast to increase further in 24-36 hours, which will 
cause Lee to ingest drier and more stable air into its circulation. 
In addition, sea surface temperatures along Lee's future path drop 
off significantly after 36 hours.  Therefore, continued gradual 
weakening is forecast, and the NHC intensity forecast is at or 
slightly above the intensity consensus aids for much of the 
forecast period.  Extratropical transition is likely to begin on 
Friday as Lee interacts with a frontal boundary moving off the east 
coast of the United States, and a good chunk of the guidance 
suggests the transition could be complete by 60 hours.  In order to 
maintain continuity with the previous forecast, Lee is now shown to 
be a fully post-tropical cyclone by 72 hours.  Regardless of its 
designation, Lee will remain a large and dangerous cyclone while it 
approaches eastern New England and Atlantic Canada into the weekend.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions, heavy rainfall, and high surf are
beginning to impact Bermuda, and a Tropical Storm Warning is in 
effect for the island.
 
2. Hurricane conditions and coastal flooding are possible in
portions of eastern Maine, southern New Brunswick, and western Nova
Scotia on Saturday, and a Hurricane Watch is in effect for that
area.  Heavy rainfall in these areas may produce localized urban
and small stream flooding from Friday night into Saturday night.  
Tropical storm conditions are possible elsewhere across New England 
and Atlantic Canada within the Tropical Storm Watch areas.
 
3. There is the potential for life-threatening storm surge flooding
in portions of southeastern Massachusetts, including Cape Cod and
Nantucket, late Friday and Saturday, where a Storm Surge Watch is 
in effect.

Hurricane Margot Advisory Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
900 AM GMT Thu Sep 14 2023
 
...MARGOT WEAKENS OVER THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM GMT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...35.9N 40.3W
ABOUT 745 MI...1205 KM W OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 15 DEGREES AT 6 MPH...9 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...979 MB...28.91 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM GMT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Margot was located
near latitude 35.9 North, longitude 40.3 West. Margot is moving
toward the north-northeast near 6 mph (9 km/h), and a slower 
forward motion is expected today. Margot is forecast to meander 
within weak steering currents on Friday and make a small clockwise 
loop over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Continued weakening is forecast over the next few 
days, and Margot is likely to become a tropical storm later today.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles
(335 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Margot will continue to affect the
Azores for the next several days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM GMT.

Hurricane Margot Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
900 AM GMT Thu Sep 14 2023
 
The satellite structure of Margot has continued to deteriorate. The 
low-level center has been partially exposed in GOES-16 proxy-visible 
satellite images, and recent AMSR2 microwave data show the inner 
core convection has eroded. These changes appear to be the result of 
some southwesterly shear over the system and dry air intrusions into 
the circulation. Presently, deep convection is limited to a couple 
of curved bands that wrap around the northern portion of the system. 
The objective and subjective satellite intensity estimates have 
markedly decreased, and the initial intensity is lowered to 65 kt, 
in best agreement with recent UW-CIMSS SATCON and TAFB Dvorak 
current intensity estimates. However, this could be generous given 
the rapidly degrading satellite presentation. 
 
Margot continues to slow down this morning, and it appears the 
center has recently turned north-northeastward (015/5 kt). The 
cyclone is likely to stall and meander over the next couple of days 
in response to a building ridge to its north and west. In general, 
the track models agree that Margot will make a gradual clockwise 
loop while it pivots around the ridge that is forecast to slowly 
slide eastward over the weekend. However, there is still large 
spread in the various model solutions while the steering currents 
remain weak. The updated NHC forecast tries to reflect the latest 
trends of the multi-model consensus aids and shows little movement 
between 12-60 h. By early next week, the ridge should become 
re-positioned to the east of Margot, allowing the system to turn 
northward and become caught up in the mid-latitude westerlies.

In addition to the ongoing shear, several factors suggest Margot is 
likely to continue weakening during the next several days. The 
cyclone is over marginal SSTs, and the coupled atmosphere-ocean 
models indicate the slow-moving storm is likely to upwell even 
cooler waters while it meanders over the central Atlantic. Also, 
more bouts of dry air entrainment within a drier and more subsident 
environment will make it difficult for Margot to sustain convection 
near its center, as suggested by the GFS and ECMWF simulated 
satellite imagery. The NHC forecast shows continued weakening 
through early next week with Margot becoming extratropical in 120 h 
while accelerating into the mid-latitudes. Although not explicitly 
forecast, it is noted that the hostile conditions could render 
Margot devoid of deep convection even sooner.
