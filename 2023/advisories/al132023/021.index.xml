Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Sun Sep 10 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Lee, located a few hundred miles northeast of the northern Leeward <br/>
Islands, and on Tropical Storm Margot, located over the central <br/>
subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL97):<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity associated with a small area of <br/>
low pressure, located a few hundred miles to the southwest of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands remains disorganized.  Environmental conditions <br/>
appear to be only marginally favorable for development as the <br/>
disturbance moves slowly westward over the eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic.  The system is forecast to merge with a larger tropical <br/>
wave to its east by midweek and no further development after that <br/>
time is expected. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent. <br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located near the west coast of Africa is producing <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions <br/>
appear conducive for some gradual development of this system during <br/>
the latter part of this week as it moves westward to west- <br/>
northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the central tropical Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent. <br/>

...LEE PASSING WELL NORTH OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS...
...HAZARDOUS BEACH CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO SPREAD THROUGH THE WESTERN
ATLANTIC DURING THE WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.6N 61.0W
ABOUT 270 MI...435 KM NNE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...110 MPH...175 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...958 MB...28.29 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 21.6 North, longitude 61.0 West. Lee is moving toward
the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A slower west- 
northwestward motion is expected during the next few days.  On
the forecast track, Lee is expected to pass well north of the
northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico 
during the next couple of days.
 
Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the 
maximum sustained winds have increased to near 110 mph (175 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast during the next 
couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles
(260 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure reported by NOAA reconnaissance 
aircraft is 958 mb (28.29 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, 
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, and Bermuda. 
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions. Dangerous surf and rip currents are expected to 
begin along much of the U.S. East Coast later today and worsen 
through this week. Please consult products from your local weather 
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
1100 AM AST Sun Sep 10 2023
 
Earlier SSMIS and GMI microwave overpasses along with reports from 
a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that Lee has a larger 
banded-type eye as compared to yesterday.  The ragged eye has 
become apparent in visible and infrared satellite images within 
the past hour or so.  The NOAA aircraft has measured a peak 700-mb 
flight-level wind of 106 kt and SFMR winds of 95 kt, and the minimum 
pressure has been oscillating in the 956-958 mb range during the 
flight.  Based on these data, and the recent improvement in 
structure, the initial intensity has been raised to 95 kt. 

The vertical wind shear over Lee appears to have relaxed some since 
yesterday as there has been an expansion of the upper-level outflow 
over the southern and southwestern portions of the storm.  Most of 
the guidance suggests that the shear will decrease more over the 
next couple of days, allowing Lee to re-strengthen.  The expected 
slow motion of the hurricane could cause some upwelling, especially 
in the 2-3 day time period when Lee is forecast to be moving at only 
around 5 kt.  The NHC wind speed forecast calls for steady 
restrengthening during the next 24-48 hours, then shows some gradual 
weakening after that time due to the potential for upwelling. Later 
in the forecast period, increasing southwesterly shear is likely to 
cause additional weakening, however Lee is forecast to remain a 
strong hurricane through most of this week. 

Recent aircraft center fixes show that the hurricane is beginning 
to slow down.  The initial motion is now west-northwest or 300 
degrees at 7 kt. A high pressure ridge to the northwest of Lee is 
forecast to build southwestward during the next couple of days, 
further slowing Lee's progress.  By midweek, a mid-latitude trough 
moving into the northeastern United States is expected to weaken 
the western extent of the ridge, allowing Lee to turn northward. 
There is still significant uncertainty in the global model guidance 
regarding the forward speed of Lee later in the forecast period.  
The NHC track forecast continues to lie between the faster GFS and 
slower ECMWF, close to the various consensus models. 

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Lee's core is expected to pass well north of the northern
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico during the 
next couple of days.
 
2. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents are affecting
portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. 
Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos 
Islands, the Bahamas, and Bermuda. 
 
3. It remains too soon to know what level of impacts, if any, Lee
might have along the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic Canada, or Bermuda
late next week, especially since the hurricane is expected to slow
down considerably over the southwestern Atlantic.  Regardless,
dangerous surf and rip currents are expected along most of the U.S.
East Coast beginning later today and continuing through the week as 
Lee grows in size. Users should continue to monitor updates to the
forecast of Lee during the next several days.

Tropical Storm Margot Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
1100 AM AST Sun Sep 10 2023
 
Shear continues to impact Margot's ability to become better 
organized. Visible satellite imagery this morning shows that the 
low-level center of the system remains on the southwestern edge of 
the deep convection. All the deep convection remains sheared to the 
northeast. A 1154 UTC scatterometer pass this morning, depicted a 
few wind barbs,that were not rain flagged, near 40 kt. Given the 
undersampling of this instrument, the intensity is held at 45 kt 
for this advisory. This is in agreement with the latest subjective 
Dvorak satellite intensity estimate of T3.0 from TAFB.
  
Margot is currently within an environment of moderate vertical wind 
shear, which is inhibiting the organization of the system. Despite 
the less than favorable environment, the intensity guidance has 
been persistent in Margot gradually strengthening over the next few 
days as it enters a more favorable upper-level wind pattern, and 
continues over warm sea surface temperatures.  The NHC forecast is 
for gradual strengthening and has Margot becoming a hurricane in 
about two days. This is in agreement with the corrected consensus 
HCCA, and IVCN intensity aids.

Margot is expected continue to move north-northwestward to northward 
into a weakness in the central Atlantic subtropical ridge. Beyond 
day 3, Margot will begin to slow its forward motion as the steering 
pattern weakens. Towards the end of the forecast period, there 
remains quite a bit of cross-track model spread, and some models 
have the system meandering in the central Atlantic. There is higher 
than normal uncertainty in this time range. The NHC track forecast 
lies between the HFIP HCCA and simple consensus TVCA.
