expected somewhere within the warning area, generally within 36
hours.
 
Interests in the northeastern United States and Atlantic Canada
should monitor the progress of Lee.  Watches may be required for a
portion of these areas later today or tonight.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 26.0 North, longitude 67.2 West.  Lee is moving toward
the northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h).  A turn toward the
north-northwest is expected later today, followed by a northward
turn and an increase in speed on Thursday and Friday.  On the
forecast track, the center of Lee will pass west of Bermuda Thursday
and Thursday night and then approach the coast of New England or
Atlantic Canada late this week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Lee is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Slow weakening is forecast during the next
few days, however, Lee is likely to remain a large and dangerous
hurricane into the weekend.
 
Lee is a very large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend
outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from the center and
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 948 mb (28.00 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in Bermuda 
starting early Thursday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, and Bermuda.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Dangerous surf and rip currents are affecting
portions of the southeastern U.S. coast, and these conditions are
forecast to spread northward along much of the U.S. East Coast and
Atlantic Canada during the next couple of days. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Outer rain bands from Lee may produce rainfall amounts of
1 to 2 inches, 25 to 50 millimeters, across Bermuda Thursday into
early Friday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
500 AM AST Wed Sep 13 2023
 
Lee's structure is very gradually declining in organization.  The 
hurricane has a ragged but somewhat elliptical 25-30 n mi wide eye, 
but deep convection has become eroded a bit within the western 
semicircle, possibly due to some moderate westerly shear.  In 
addition, a 0607 UTC AMSR-2 microwave pass showed that the eyewall 
was open on the southwest side at that time.  Subjective and 
objective satellite estimates range from 90-105 kt, so Lee's 
initial intensity remains 100 kt for now.

The hurricane is very slowly making its turn around a west-central 
Atlantic mid-level high, with its motion now northwestward at 
325/5 kt.  The track guidance is tightly clustered during the next 
2 days or so, showing Lee turning and accelerating toward the 
north-northwest and north between the high and a shortwave trough 
swinging across the Great Lakes region.  Lee's core is forecast to 
pass west of Bermuda in 36-48 hours, but tropical storm conditions 
are likely to begin there late tonight or early Thursday due to the 
hurricane's large wind field.  On days 3 and 4, Lee is expected to 
maintain a general northward track offshore the northeastern U.S. 
However, the global models are suggesting that the hurricane 
will interact with a remnant mid-level trough over the mid-Atlantic 
states, causing Lee to possibly bend just west of due north while 
it moves across the Gulf of Maine.  Under the assumption that the 
global models will have a better handle on this mid-latitude 
pattern as compared to the regional hurricane models, the NHC track 
forecast is close to a consensus of the GFS and ECMWF models (GFEX) 
on days 3, 4, and 5, and therefore ends up being a bit west and 
then north of the previous prediction on those days.
 
A number of factors--including Lee's broad structure, increasing 
shear, and potential upwelling of cooler waters--are likely to lead 
to a very gradual decrease in the hurricane's maximum winds during 
the next 3 days or so.  In addition, Lee is likely to begin 
extratropical transition in 2-3 days, with that process expected to 
be complete just before the cyclone's center reaches the coast of 
Maine, New Brunswick, or Nova Scotia in about 4 days.  That said, 
Lee's expected post-tropical transition will not diminish potential 
wind, rain, and coastal flooding impacts in New England and Atlantic 
Canada due to the system's broad wind field. 
 
It should again be noted that the 34- and 50-kt wind speed
probabilities beyond 36 hours in the text and graphical products are
likely underestimating the risk of those winds occurring.  This is
because the forecast wind field of Lee is considerably larger than
average compared to the wind field used to derive the wind speed
probability product.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents will affect
portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto
Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas,
Bermuda, and most of the U.S East Coast through much of the week.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions, heavy rainfall, and high surf are
expected to impact Bermuda beginning late tonight or early Thursday, 
and a Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for the island.
 
3. There is an increasing risk of wind, coastal flooding, and rain 
impacts from Lee in portions of New England and Atlantic Canada 
beginning on Friday and continuing through the weekend.  Watches may 
be required for portions of these areas later today or tonight.  
Due to Lee's large size, hazards will extend well away from the 
center, and there will be little to no significance on exactly where 
the center reaches the coast.

...MARGOT MOVING NORTHWARD OVER THE OPEN WATERS OF THE CENTRAL
ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM GMT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...33.6N 40.0W
ABOUT 790 MI...1270 KM WSW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...85 MPH...140 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 350 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...975 MB...28.80 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM GMT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Margot was located 
near latitude 33.6 North, longitude 40.0 West. Margot is moving 
toward the north near 12 mph (19 km/h). A north-northwestward or 
northward motion with a gradual decrease in forward speed is 
expected through early Thursday. Then, Margot is likely to stall or 
meander within weak steering currents into the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast during the next few days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles
(370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 975 mb (28.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Margot will begin to affect the Azores
later today. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM GMT.

<title>Hurricane Margot Forecast Discussion Number 24</title>

Hurricane Margot Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
900 AM GMT Wed Sep 13 2023
 
The eye of Margot has been obscured by clouds to varying degrees
overnight, but has begun to warm in the latest infrared satellite
images this morning. Recent AMSR2 microwave images reveal the
hurricane has a compact inner core, with a concentric outer ring of
convection that is broken to the northwest. Earlier scatterometer
data indicated a secondary wind maximum exists within this outer
band. The vortex is slightly tilted with height, as the mid-level
89-GHz eye lies to the southwest of the 37-GHz center. The
intensity for this advisory remains 75 kt based on consensus T4.5
Dvorak classifications from TAFB and SAB.
 
Margot has begun to slow down while moving northward (350/10 kt)
within the flow between a deep-layer ridge over the eastern Atlantic
and a narrow upper trough to its west. A general northward motion
should continue over the next day or so before the track forecast
becomes very challenging. Margot is forecast to become caught in
weak steering currents, with the global models showing a blocking
ridge developing to the north of the cyclone by late week into the
weekend. There are significant differences between the GFS and ECMWF
with regards to the strength and position of this ridge, which has
large implications in the longer-range track of Margot. Based on the
overall shift in the guidance suite this cycle, the latest NHC
forecast shows little net motion between 36-72 h as Margot meanders
over the central Atlantic. This is a fairly large departure from the
previous advisory, but better represents the latest consensus track
solutions. At days 4-5, most models (except for the ECMWF) show the
ridge sliding eastward, but overall track forecast confidence is
very low and larger future adjustments could be necessary.
 
It is possible that Margot is at or near its peak intensity. The
deep-layer shear is forecast to increase during the next 24 h, and
thereafter the coupled atmosphere-ocean models indicate the slow
motion of the storm is likely to result in upwelling of cooler
waters. In addition, the surrounding environment is expected to
become drier and more subsident by this weekend. The NHC intensity
forecast has been lowered from the previous one and shows steady
weakening beyond 36 h, in good agreement with the latest HCCA and
IVCN aids. Although this forecast keeps Margot a tropical cyclone
through day 5, simulated satellite imagery from the global models
suggests these environmental factors could cause the system to lose
organized convection and become post-tropical early next week.
