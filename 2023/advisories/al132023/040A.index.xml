DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located 
near latitude 35.1 North, longitude 67.0 West.  Lee is moving toward 
the north near 16 mph (26 km/h), and a northward motion at a faster 
forward speed is expected through Saturday.  On the forecast track, 
the center of Lee will continue to move farther away from Bermuda 
this morning and approach the coast of New England and Atlantic 
Canada today and Saturday.  Lee is then expected to turn toward the 
north-northeast and northeast and move across Atlantic Canada 
Saturday night and Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected through tonight. Lee 
is forecast to become post-tropical and begin weakening by Saturday, 
but it is still expected to be a large and dangerous storm when it 
reaches eastern New England and Atlantic Canada.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 320
miles (520 km).
 
The minimum central pressure based on data from the NOAA Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft is 962 mb (28.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue on Bermuda through
the morning.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch areas in
Down East Maine and in Atlantic Canada on Saturday.  Tropical storm
conditions are expected to begin in southern New England late this
afternoon and spread northward within the Tropical Storm Warning
area through Saturday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected to
spread across the Tropical Storm Warning area in Atlantic Canada
tonight and Saturday.  These conditions are likely to lead to
downed trees and potential power outages.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the
east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  From tonight through Saturday night, Lee is expected to
produce rainfall amounts of 1 to 4 inches, or 25 to 100 millimeters,
across portions of eastern New England into portions of New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia.  This may produce localized urban and
small stream flooding.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Flushing, NY to U.S./Canada border...1-3 ft
Long Island Sound...1-3 ft
Cape Cod...1-3 ft
Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket...1-3 ft
Boston Harbor...1-3 ft
Rockaway Inlet, NY to Montauk Point, NY...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
A dangerous storm surge will produce coastal flooding within the
wind warning areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of onshore winds.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  40
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
500 AM AST Fri Sep 15 2023
 
Lee appears to be in the very initial stages of extratropical 
transition.  The cloud pattern is becoming increasingly asymmetric, 
and scatterometer data from last evening showed a band of strong 
winds developing along a boundary to the northwest of the center.  
Lee's initial intensity remains 75 kt based on continuity from last 
evening's reconnaissance and scatterometer data, but NOAA and Air 
Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft should be in the storm in a 
couple of hours to again sample the wind field.

Lee has been wobbling a bit since yesterday afternoon, but the 
smoothed motion is northward (010 degrees) at a faster speed of 14 
kt.  Additional northward acceleration is expected during the next 
24-36 hours as Lee moves along the western periphery of a mid-level 
ridge, and approaches a trough currently over New England.  The 
track model guidance continues to be in very good agreement on 
bringing Lee's center very near the western end of Nova Scotia by 
Saturday afternoon, although the new NHC forecast is a little 
faster than the previous prediction.  In 2-3 days, Lee is forecast 
to turn north-northeastward and northeastward across Atlantic 
Canada as it moves between the aforementioned ridge and a mid-level 
trough moving across Quebec. 
 
Although southerly shear is forecast to increase markedly through 
the day, baroclinic influences during Lee's extratropical transition 
are likely to keep the intensity relatively steady for the next 24 
hours or so.  During that time, the NHC intensity forecast is near 
the top end of the guidance suite, closest to the GFS and ECMWF 
solutions, and there is some possibility that a band of strong winds 
could develop near the front on the western side of the circulation 
over the Gulf of Maine.  Extratropical transition is forecast to be 
complete by 36 hours (although it could be sooner), and Lee is 
likely to be weakening--but still near or just below hurricane 
force--as it is approaching Nova Scotia due to the continued shear 
and much colder ocean temperatures.  Lee is expected to continue 
weakening while it moves across Atlantic Canada, and global model 
fields indicate that it is likely to be absorbed by another 
developing area of low pressure near Newfoundland and Labrador just 
after 72 hours. 

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Hurricane conditions are possible across portions of Down East 
Maine, southern New Brunswick, and western Nova Scotia on Saturday 
within the Hurricane Watch area.  Tropical storm conditions and 
coastal flooding are expected to begin in southern New England 
within the Tropical Storm Warning area this afternoon, and spread 
northward along the coast of New England and over portions of 
Atlantic Canada through Saturday.  These conditions are likely to 
lead to downed trees and potential power outages.
 
2. Heavy rainfall from Lee may produce localized urban and small
stream flooding across eastern New England and into portions of New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia from tonight into Saturday night.

3. Tropical storm conditions and high surf will continue to impact 
Bermuda through this morning.

Tropical Storm Margot Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
900 AM GMT Fri Sep 15 2023
 
Margot is producing small, intermittent bursts of convection near 
its partially exposed low-level center this morning. An ASCAT pass 
over the western portion of the circulation from last night showed 
that the winds within the max wind band have decreased by about 
10-15 kt from 24 h ago, with peak vectors slightly above 50 kt. 
These data and the current satellite presentation indicate Margot is 
likely no longer a hurricane. The initial intensity is lowered to 60 
kt for this advisory, which remains above the highest available 
satellite intensity estimates. 
 
The tropical storm is drifting east-southeastward (115/3 kt) within 
weak steering currents, as a mid-level ridge continues to build over 
the north Atlantic. Margot is forecast to make a clockwise loop 
while it pivots around this ridge during the next couple of days. 
The latest NHC forecast shows a slightly broader loop that is 
consistent with the latest multi-model consensus aids. By early next 
week, the ridge is forecast to become oriented to the east and south 
of Margot, and the cyclone should turn northward and then eastward 
within the flow between this feature and mid-latitude westerlies. 
There is greater uncertainty in the long-range track forecast given 
mixed signals in the global guidance as to whether Margot gets fully 
caught in the westerlies (GFS) or stays farther south and continues 
to meander over the central Atlantic (ECMWF). For now, the NHC 
forecast is held near the simple consensus aids. 

Margot is likely to continue weakening during the next couple of 
days while it meanders over its own cool wake of sub-26C SSTs in an 
increasingly dry and stable airmass. By Sunday, it could briefly 
encounter slightly warmer waters while moving westward, but the 
upper-level winds do not appear very conducive for much 
strengthening. In fact, the GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite 
imagery suggest Margot could struggle at times to sustain enough 
organized convection to remain a tropical cyclone. While the 
guidance suite suggests some minor intensity fluctuations are 
possible during this period, the NHC intensity forecast remains 
steady between 48-96 h in agreement with the IVCN consensus aid.
