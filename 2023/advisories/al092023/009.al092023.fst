DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the remnants of Harold were located near
latitude 30.4 North, longitude 104.4 West. The remnants are moving
toward the northwest near 24 mph (39 km/h) and this motion is
expected to continue today. The surface low is forecast to become 
increasingly ill-defined, eventually being absorbed into a thermal 
trough situated from northern Mexico into New Mexico. This process 
make the surface reflection of Harold difficult to track beyond 
this evening. Therefore, this will be the final advisory.

Maximum sustained winds are near 25 mph (35 km/h) with higher gusts.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1010 mb (29.83 inches).

In far northern Mexico, rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches with local
amounts of 4 inches are expected through today across northern
portions of Chihuahua. Isolated instances of flash flooding are
