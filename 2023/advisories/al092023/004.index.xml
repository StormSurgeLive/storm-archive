<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
The remnants of former Tropical Storm Emily are located over the <br/>
central tropical Atlantic several hundred miles east-northeast of <br/>
the Leeward Islands with limited associated shower activity.  <br/>
Environmental conditions could become more conducive for <br/>
re-development of this system late this week or this weekend when <br/>
the system moves northward over the subtropical central Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Gert Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
500 AM AST Tue Aug 22 2023
 
Gert is a very disorganized system and may no longer have a closed 
circulation.  Consequently, we'll await further justification 
from the conventional visible imagery and this morning's 
scatterometer passes.  The current intensity estimate remains at 25 
kt in agreement with a Dvorak estimate from SAB.

The statistical-dynamical SHIPS intensity guidance suggests 
that strong shear should weaken the system further while it moves 
west-northwestward, and Gert is forecast to open up into a trough of 
low-pressure, and this is explicitly shown in the NHC forecast.  
Once again, no significant changes were made to the NHC track or 
intensity forecasts, which is also in agreement with the latest 
multi-model consensus and global model forecasts.

At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Franklin was
located near latitude 14.7 North, longitude 70.4 West.  Franklin is
moving toward the north-northwest near 4 mph (6 km/h).  The system 
should turn northward today, and a generally northward motion is 
expected on Wednesday.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Franklin is forecast to reach the southern coast of Hispaniola on 
Wednesday, traverse the island and move off of the northern coast on 
Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast before Franklin reaches
Hispaniola.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).

<title>Tropical Storm Franklin Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Franklin Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
1100 PM EDT Mon Aug 21 2023
 
Franklin is not a well-organized tropical cyclone at this time. A 
NOAA reconnaissance aircraft was in the system earlier this evening 
and found an elongated low-level circulation, with possible 
multiple surface centers.  Franklin is also fairly asymmetric on 
satellite imagery, with convection only on the east side of the 
storm, near the mid-level center.  The initial intensity will 
remain at 45 kt for this advisory, which is in between the higher 
TAFB and lower SAB intensity estimates.  A NOAA G-IV mission should 
hopefully provide more in-situ data overnight.
 
The tropical storm has been meandering in the eastern Caribbean for 
much of the day.  There is the potential that the center may try to 
reform to the northeast, near a new burst of convection and the 
mid-level center, but this is an uncertain evolution.  Eventually,  
mid-level ridging will build to the east of Franklin, which should 
allow the system to move more northward in the next 36 hours, and 
then northeastward between 48-96 h. The NHC track forecast is 
shifted slightly to the right in the short term, and it lies a 
little east of the consensus aids given the potential reformation of 
the center to the northeast.
 
Franklin is currently in an environment of moderate vertical wind 
shear, which is disrupting the cyclone's organization. SHIPS 
guidance shows that the shear will slightly decrease over the next 
12-24 hours, which will allow for some intensification before it 
reaches Hispaniola. After land interaction over Hispaniola, there 
will be some weakening due to the mountainous terrain. After 
Franklin emerges north of the island in the western Atlantic, the 
forecast calls for some slight strengthening as it moves northeast, 
then northward. The intensity forecast is fairly low confidence 
given all the different environmental factors and land interaction, 
but lies near the corrected consensus aids.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Franklin is expected across portions of 
Puerto Rico and Hispaniola through the middle of the week. The heavy 
rainfall may produce areas of flash and urban flooding as well as 
river rises and mudslides. Across Hispaniola, significant and 
potentially life-threatening flash flooding is possible Tuesday into 
Wednesday.
 
2. Franklin is expected to bring tropical storm conditions to
portions of the Dominican Republic and Haiti beginning on Tuesday
where Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect.

local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Harold was
located near latitude 25.8 North, longitude 95.1 West.  Harold is
moving toward the west-northwest near 18 mph (30 km/h).  This 
general motion is expected to continue through tonight, and the 
system is forecast to move inland over south Texas by midday today.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is possible before Harold reaches the Texas
coast.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Harold can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
RAINFALL: Harold is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 3 to 5
inches, with isolated higher amounts of 7 inches, across South Texas
through early Wednesday.  Scattered instances of flash flooding will
be possible.
 
Across Mexico, rainfall amounts of 4 to 6 inches, with local amounts
of 10 inches, are expected across portions of northern Coahuila and
northern Nuevo Leon Tuesday through Wednesday.  Scattered instances
of flash flooding are expected.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area
and are possible in the watch area beginning early today.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Mouth of Rio Grande to Sargent, including Baffin Bay, Corpus
Christi Bay and Matagorda Bay...1 to 3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
TORNADOES: A couple of tornadoes are possible across south Texas
through the afternoon.
 
SURF: Large swells will affect portions of southern Texas through
Tuesday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.

Tropical Storm Harold Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092023
400 AM CDT Tue Aug 22 2023
 
Air Force Hurricane Hunter wind observations indicate that the 
cyclone strengthened to a tropical storm earlier this morning.  
However, the circulation is not very well defined and the low-level 
center is somewhat elongated from south to north.  Imagery from the 
Brownsville WSR-88D radar shows broad cyclonic turning, with curved 
rain bands moving onshore of the south Texas coast.
 
Harold is embedded in strong deep-layer easterlies on the southern 
periphery of a large anticyclone over the east-central United 
States.  As a result, the cyclone is moving fairly briskly toward 
the west-northwest at around 285/16 kt.  This general motion should 
continue through tonight, and the official forecast is quite 
similar to the previous one.  This is also very close to the latest 
corrected consensus, HCCA prediction.

The system still has a short time to strengthen over the warm Gulf 
waters, and the latest SHIPS guidance shows slight strengthening  
within the next 12 hours.  This is reflected in the official 
forecast.  Since the cyclone does not have a well-defined inner 
core, however, rapid intensification is not likely before landfall.


KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Tropical Storm Harold is expected across
South Texas through early Wednesday, and may produce areas of flash
and urban flooding. Across portions of northern Coahuila and
northern Nuevo Leon in Mexico, flash flooding with possible
landslides in mountainous terrain is expected Tuesday through
Wednesday.
 
2. Coastal flooding is possible along the south Texas coast
today through Tuesday evening.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area,and
are possible in the watch area, within a few hours.
