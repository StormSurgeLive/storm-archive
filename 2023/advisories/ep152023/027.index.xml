WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has discontinued the tropical storm warning 
from Punta San Telmo to Lazaro Cardenas.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Acapulco to Lazaro Cardenas
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case over the
next 12 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Max was 
located near latitude 17.6 North, longitude 101.0 West. Max is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h) and this 
motion is expected to continue until dissipation as the cyclone 
moves further inland over southern Mexico.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Rapid weakening is expected as Max moves inland, with the storm
expected to dissipate over Mexico on Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) 
from the center. In the past few hours, a surface observing station 
at Puerto Vicente Guerrero reported a sustained wind of 41 mph (66 
km/h) with a wind gust up to 72 mph (116 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches). 
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Max can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP1.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Max is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches with local maxima of 12 inches through Tuesday across the
states of Guerrero and Michoacan. These rains will likely produce
flash and urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of
higher terrain near the coast.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring in the warning area
and expected to continue through this evening.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Max will affect the southern coast of
Mexico for the next day or two.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Max Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162023
400 PM CDT Mon Oct 09 2023
 
Max is estimated to have made landfall around 1800 UTC just to the 
west of Puerto Vicente Guerrero in the Mexican Provence of Guerrero. 
Data received from the a Mexican surface observing site at that 
location just after the intermediate advisory suggested the 
tropical storm might have been a little stronger than initially 
assessed, reporting sustained tropical-storm-force winds with a 
minimum pressure of 994 mb. Thus, the 18 UTC working best track 
intensity was adjusted to 55 kt with a 991 mb pressure. Since that 
time, the satellite structure has begun to degrade, likely as the 
surface circulation begins to be disrupted by the high rugged 
terrain of south-central Mexico. Thus, some weakening is assumed 
since that time with the current intensity assessed at 50 kt. 
Further rapid weakening is anticipated as the small tropical cyclone 
moves further inland, and by this time tomorrow Max is likely to be 
little more than a remnant mid-level circulation moving poleward 
with enhanced moisture over central Mexico.
 
The initial motion still appears to be north-northeast at 030/5 kt. 
This motion should continue until Max dissipates over the higher 
terrain of Mexico. The track guidance following the low-level center 
quickly lose the system beyond 12 h, and the updated track forecast 
is little changed from the prior one. Even as Max dissipates, its 
mid-level remains and larger moisture plume will likely result in 
significant upslope rainfall, leading to flash flooding and 
mudslides pushing into inland Mexico.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Max is forecast to continue bringing tropical storm conditions 
through this evening to portions of the southern coast of Mexico 
where a Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect.
 
2. Heavy rains from Max will likely produce flash and urban 
flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain 
across the states of Guerrero and Michoacan.

tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within 24 
hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in west-central Mexico should monitor the 
progress of Lidia.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM MDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was
located near latitude 18.1 North, longitude 110.9 West. Lidia is
moving toward the east-northeast near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A faster
east-northeastward motion is expected this evening and Tuesday. On
the forecast track, the center of Lidia should approach Las Islas
Marias on Tuesday, and move inland over west-central Mexico late 
Tuesday or Tuesday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast later today and Tuesday, and 
Lidia is expected to be a hurricane when it approaches Las Islas 
Marias and the coast of west-central Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure of 985 mb (29.09 inches) is based on 
data collected by the Air Force Hurricane Hunters.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lidia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP5.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches with local maxima of 12 inches through Wednesday across the
state Nayarit, southern portions of the state of Sinaloa, and
coastal portions of the state of Jalisco in western Mexico. These
rains will likely produce flash and urban flooding, along with
possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain near the coast.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the south of where
the center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the warning area
on Tuesday, with winds expected to first reach tropical
storm strength by Tuesday morning, making outside preparations
difficult or dangerous. Preparations to protect life and property
should be rushed to completion. Tropical storm conditions are
expected in the Tropical Storm Warning areas beginning Tuesday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Lidia will affect the west coast of Mexico
and the Baja California peninsula for the next couple of days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Lidia Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
300 PM MDT Mon Oct 09 2023
 
Satellite images indicate that Lidia is becoming better organized.
Deep convection is consolidating near the center and it appears that
an inner core is forming.  In addition, a large curved band has
developed on the south and east sides of the circulation.  The Air
Force Hurricane Hunters investigated Lidia earlier this afternoon
and found that the minimum pressure was quite low, around 985 mb.  A
combination of the aircraft flight-level wind and SFMR data support
increasing the wind speed to 60 kt, and is possible that this is
conservative.  The aircraft data and recent satellite images
suggest that the center has reformed to the south of the previous
positions.
 
Since the center of Lidia appears to have reformed, the initial 
motion of 065/7 kt is uncertain.  Water vapor images show a mid- to 
upper-level trough approaching Lidia, and that feature should steer 
the storm relatively quickly to the east-northeast toward 
west-central Mexico.  The main change for this forecast cycle is 
associated with Lidia's reformation, which is roughly 1 degree south 
of the previous estimates.  Based on the initial position 
adjustment, the new track forecast lies to the south of the previous 
prediction.  This forecast is close to the consensus aids and 
roughly halfway between the fast GFS solution and the much slower 
ECMWF run.  Based on the new forecast, Lidia is expected to reach 
the coast of Mexico Tuesday afternoon/evening.
 
Since Lidia appears to be developing an inner core while moving into 
conducive environmental conditions, significant strengthening is 
forecast.  The storm is expected to move over SSTs near 30 C and 
into a favorable upper-level wind pattern. The NHC intensity 
forecast is similar to the previous one, and is in good agreement 
with the hurricane regional models. Rapid weakening is forecast once 
Lidia moves inland due to the rugged terrain in west-central Mexico.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Lidia is forecast to strengthen before it reaches west-central
Mexico, and hurricane conditions are expected within the Hurricane
Warning area beginning Tuesday.
 
2. Heavy rains from Lidia will likely produce flash and urban 
flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain 
across the the state of Nayarit, southern portions of the state of 
Sinaloa, and coastal portions of the state of Jalisco in western 
Mexico.
 
3. A dangerous storm surge is expected near and to the south of
where the center of Lidia moves over the Islas Marias and the coast
of west-central Mexico.
 
4. Swells from Lidia will cause dangerous surf and rip current
conditions along the west coast of Mexico and the Baja California
peninsula during the next couple of days.
