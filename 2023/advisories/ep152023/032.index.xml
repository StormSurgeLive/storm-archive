DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lidia was located 
near latitude 20.6 North, longitude 104.7 West. Lidia is moving 
toward the east-northeast near 17 mph (28 km/h), and a slightly

Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Rapid weakening is expected as Lidia moves inland tonight 
and Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 965 mb (28.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lidia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP5.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches with local maxima of 12 inches through Wednesday across the
state of Nayarit, southern portions of the state of Sinaloa, and
coastal portions of the state of Jalisco in western Mexico. These
rains will likely produce flash and urban flooding, along with
possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain near the coast.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the south of where Lidia
made landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are occurring in portions of 
west-central Mexico within the hurricane warning area. Tropical 
storm conditions are occuring in portions of the tropical storm 
warning areas.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lidia will affect the west coast of
Mexico and the Baja California peninsula for the next day or so.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 AM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

Hurricane Lidia Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
1000 PM CDT Tue Oct 10 2023
 
Lidia is estimated to have made landfall around 2350 UTC near Las 
Penitas in the Mexican state of Jalisco.  Satellite imagery showed 
an eye briefly clearing and warming before reaching the coastline, 
and the maximum sustained wind speed was estimated to be 120 kt.  
Since that time, the structure of Lidia has degraded.  The eye is 
no longer apparent and convection around the center is no longer 
symmetric.  The initial intensity for this advisory is lowered to 
90 kt.  Continued rapid weakening is expected for the next day 
while Lidia moves over the elevated terrain in west-central Mexico. 
Model guidance shows the storm will dissipate within 24 hours, and 
this is reflected in the official intensity forecast.

The hurricane's motion is estimated to be 60/15 kt.  Lidia is 
expected to accelerate northeastward in the flow of a mid- to 
upper-level trough located over northern Mexico. Minor adjustments 
have been made to the NHC track forecast.  Even as Lidia dissipates, 
remnant moisture could result in flooding rainfall and possible 
mudslides as it moves inland.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Lidia is moving inland over west-central Mexico as a hurricane. 
Life-threatening hurricane-force winds are expected along the path 
of the storm overnight.
 
2. Heavy rains from Lidia will likely produce flash and urban
flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain
across the state of Nayarit, southern portions of the state of
Sinaloa, and coastal portions of the state of Jalisco in western
Mexico.
 
3. Dangerous water levels along the coast of west-central Mexico 
will gradually subside overnight.
 
4. Swells from Lidia will cause dangerous surf and rip current
conditions along the west coast of Mexico and the Baja California
peninsula through Wednesday.
