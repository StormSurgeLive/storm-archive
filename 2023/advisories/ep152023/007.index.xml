Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 AM PDT Wed Oct 4 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Lidia, located several hundred miles south-southwest of the <br/>
southwestern coast of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South of Central America:<br/>
A large, elongated area of showers and thunderstorms located well <br/>
south of the coast of Guatemala is associated with a trough of low <br/>
pressure.  Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive for <br/>
gradual development during the next several days, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form this weekend or early next week while <br/>
the disturbance moves slowly west-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western East Pacific:<br/>
An area of low pressure located about 1200 miles southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula is producing <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Development of this system, <br/>
if any, should be slow to occur while it moves little during the <br/>
next couple of days.  By this weekend, environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to become less conducive for further development. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Lidia Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
300 PM MDT Wed Oct 04 2023

Lidia is experiencing a robust burst of convection very near the 
center of low-level circulation in the past couple of hours, but 
displays little overall change in appearance and organization since 
this morning. Shortly after the previous advisory the low-level 
center became exposed to the east of the deep convection on visible 
GOES-18 satellite. Within the past few hours, the low-level center 
is now under a deep burst of convection, allowing subjective Dvorak 
intensity estimates this cycle from TAFB and SAB to remain at 
T3.0/45 kt. Thus, initial intensity remains at 45 kt for this 
advisory.

The initial motion is north-northwestward or 335 degrees at 6 kt. A 
mid-level ridge over Mexico will continue to steer the system 
north-northwestward during the next day or so. Afterwards, a ridge 
will build to the north of Lidia which will result in a slower 
forward motion and a turn towards the west through the remainder of 
the forecast period. There continues to be a large spread in the 
along-track guidance as the system turns westward. Most of the 
global models are faster, while the hurricane regional models and 
HCCA corrected consensus aid are slower. Therefore, there is 
increased uncertainty in the long range track forecast. The NHC 
track exhibits little change from the previous advisory, and lies 
between the faster global models and the slower regional models.
 
Models are in fairly good agreement that the moderate-to-strong 
easterly vertical wind shear will persist over Lidia the next 
several days. However, warm sea surface temperatures, a moist 
environment and upper-level diffluence will allow slow strengthening 
of the system. The NHC intensity forecast is similar to the previous 
forecast, and the intensity forecast lies near the IVCN consensus 
aid.
