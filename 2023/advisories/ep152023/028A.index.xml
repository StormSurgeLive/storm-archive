MEXICO...
...HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLOODING LIKELY ALONG THE COAST OF SOUTHERN
MEXICO TONIGHT AND TUESDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1000 PM CDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.1N 100.9W
ABOUT 55 MI...85 KM ENE OF ZIHUATANEJO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 30 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1002 MB...29.59 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warning for the coast of southern Mexico.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Max was
located near latitude 18.1 North, longitude 100.9 West. The
depression is moving toward the north-northeast near 7 mph (11 
km/h), and this motion is expected to continue as Max moves farther 
inland over southern Mexico.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Max is expected to continue weakening as it moves 
farther inland, with the depression expected to dissipate over 
Mexico late tonight or early Tuesday morning.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Max can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP1.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Max is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches with local maxima of 12 inches through Tuesday across the
states of Guerrero and Michoacan. These rains will likely produce
flash and urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of
higher terrain near the coast.
 
WIND:  Periods of gusty winds are possible tonight and early
Tuesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Max will affect the southern coast of
Mexico for the next day or so.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

Tropical Depression Max Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162023
1000 PM CDT Mon Oct 09 2023
 
After making landfall earlier today in southern Mexico, the 
satellite presentation of Max has degraded somewhat this evening, 
and the center of circulation has become more ill-defined. However, 
deep convection remains along and near the coast, which is likely 
producing flooding rainfall as the system moves over the higher
terrain of southern Mexico. Based on recent observations from 
coastal Mexico and satellite trends, Max is downgraded to a 
depression for this advisory, with the intensity set at 30 kt.

Max is moving north-northeastward at 030/6 kt and should continue 
on this trajectory until it dissipates late tonight or tomorrow. 
Once the system dissipates, the remnants of Max will continue 
to move north-northeastward and still have the potential to produce 
life-threatening flooding across the higher terrain of Mexico over 
the next day or so.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Max is forecast to continue producing gusty winds through 
tonight to portions of the southern coast of Mexico.
 
2. Heavy rains from Max will likely produce flash and urban
flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain
across the states of Guerrero and Michoacan.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 AM MDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lidia was located
near latitude 18.3 North, longitude 109.7 West. Lidia is moving
toward the east-northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h). A faster
east-northeastward motion is expected later today. On the
forecast track, the center of Lidia should approach the west-central
coast of Mexico within the hurricane warning area on later today and
move inland over west-central Mexico late today or tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast today as Lidia 
approaches the coast of west-central Mexico. Rapid weakening is 
expected after Lidia moves inland.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80
miles (130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 983 mb (29.03 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lidia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP5.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches with local maxima of 12 inches through Wednesday across the
state of Nayarit, southern portions of the state of Sinaloa, and
coastal portions of the state of Jalisco in western Mexico. These
rains will likely produce flash and urban flooding, along with
possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain near the coast.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the south of where
the center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the warning area
later today, with winds expected to first reach tropical
storm strength by this morning, making outside preparations
difficult or dangerous. Preparations to protect life and property
should be rushed to completion. Tropical storm conditions are
expected in the Tropical Storm Warning areas beginning later today.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Lidia will affect the west coast of Mexico
and the Baja California peninsula for the next day or two. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Hurricane Lidia Forecast Discussion Number 28</title>

Hurricane Lidia Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
900 PM MDT Mon Oct 09 2023
 
Lidia has become better organized this evening, with an increase in
deep convection and banding near the center.  An 0122 UTC SSMIS
microwave overpass revealed a well-defined mid-level center that
could be slight tilted from the low-level center.  The upper-level
outflow has also become a little better established over the western
portion of the system.  Subjective Dvorak data T-numbers from TAFB
and SAB are both T4.0 (65 kt), and the objective estimates are
close to that value as well.  Based on the increase in organization
and recent subjective and objective estimates, the initial
intensity is raised to 65 kt, making Lidia a hurricane.
 
The initial motion estimate is east-northeast or 065 kt degrees at
9 kt. Lidia should accelerate east-northeastward ahead of mid- to
upper-level trough approaching from the northwest.  On this
motion, the center of Lidia will approach the west-central coast of
Mexico on Tuesday.  This storm is forecast to move inland along
the west-central coast of Mexico within the hurricane warning area
by Tuesday evening.  The track guidance is in good agreement, but
it has again trended slightly south.  The updated NHC forecast has
been nudged in that direction, and it lies close to the TVCE
multi-model consensus aid.
 
Low vertical wind shear and warm SSTs along the track of Lidia
is likely to allow for significant strengthening while the storm
heads toward west-central Mexico.  The global and regional
dynamical models nearly unanimously call for significant deepening
during the next 12-24 hours, and the latest NHC intensity forecast
is a little higher than before.  This is near the upper-end of the
interpolated intensity guidance, but a little lower than the raw 
regional hurricane model output. Increasing shear near the time of 
landfall, and interaction with land after Lidia moves onshore is 
expected to result in rapid weakening and dissipation of the 
cyclone by 48 hours.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Lidia is now a hurricane and it is expected to continue to
strengthen as it approaches west-central Mexico on Tuesday.
Dangerous hurricane-force winds are expected within the Hurricane
Warning area beginning Tuesday afternoon.
 
2. Heavy rains from Lidia will likely produce flash and urban
flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain
across the the state of Nayarit, southern portions of the state of
Sinaloa, and coastal portions of the state of Jalisco in western
Mexico.
 
3. A dangerous storm surge is expected near and to the south of
where the center of Lidia moves onshore along the coast of
west-central Mexico.
 
4. Swells from Lidia will cause dangerous surf and rip current
conditions along the west coast of Mexico and the Baja California
peninsula during the next couple of days.
