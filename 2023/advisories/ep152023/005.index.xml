Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 PM PDT Tue Oct 3 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Lidia, located several hundred miles south-southwest of the <br/>
southwestern coast of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South of Central America:<br/>
A large but elongated area of showers and thunderstorms located well <br/>
south of the coast of Guatemala is associated with a trough of low <br/>
pressure.  Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive for <br/>
gradual development during the next several days, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form this weekend or early next week while <br/>
the disturbance moves slowly west-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western East Pacific:<br/>
An area of low pressure located about 1200 miles southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula is producing <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Development of this system, <br/>
if any, should be slow to occur while it moves little during the <br/>
next couple of days.  By this weekend, environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to become less conducive for further development. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Lidia Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
300 AM MDT Wed Oct 04 2023
 
Earlier microwave imagery and recent geostationary satellite data
indicate that the low-level center of Lidia is located just beneath
the eastern edge of a large convective mass with cloud top
temperatures below -80 degrees C.  The most recent subjective Dvorak
intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were T3.0 (45 kt) and T2.5 (35
kt), respectively.  Since the center appears to be slightly more
embedded within the deep convection, the initial intensity is raised
to 40 kt, using a blend of the subjective Dvorak estimates. A very
recently arriving GMI microwave overpass shows that there has been
some increase in organization, but the mid-level center is
displaced about 30-40 n mi west of the low-level center.
 
The initial motion estimate is north-northwestward or 330 degrees at
7 kt.  The track forecast reasoning is unchanged from before.  A
mid-level ridge over the northwestern Gulf of Mexico is expected to
steer the cyclone northwestward to north-northwestward during the
next 24 to 36 hours.  After that time, a narrow ridge is forecast to
build to the north of Lidia which should result in a slower westward
motion through much of the remainder of the forecast period.  There
is still a large amount of along-track spread in the guidance after
the westward turn, with the UKMET and ECMWF on the faster side of
the guidance envelope.  The GFS and HAFS-A/B models are much
slower.  It should also be noted that there is unusually large
spread between the HFIP corrected consensus model and the various
multi-model consensus aids.  This results in lower-than-normal
confidence in Lidia's long range track forecast.  The NHC track
forecast is close to a blend of the GFS, ECMWF, and regional
hurricane models.
 
The SHIPS guidance indicates that moderate-to-strong easterly
vertical wind shear will persist over Lidia during the next several
days.  However, other environmental conditions consisting of warm
sea surface temperatures and a moist environment favor some
strengthening.  As a result, the NHC intensity forecast calls from
slow intensification during the next several days, but it is a
little lower than the previous forecast at the long range. The
updated NHC wind speed forecast is a little above the latest HCCA
and IVCN consensus models.
