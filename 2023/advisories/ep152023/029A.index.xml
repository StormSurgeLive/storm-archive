Remnants Of Max Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162023
400 AM CDT Tue Oct 10 2023

Satellite images show that any convection associated with Max has 
weakened, and there are no signs of a well-defined surface center.  
Thus this system has dissipated over the high terrain of Mexico, 
and the initial wind speed is set to 20 kt in accordance with a 
rapid weakening rate.  Any future rainfall from this system is not 
anticipated to be significant.

This is the last advisory from the National Hurricane Center on 
this system.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM MDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lidia was located 
near latitude 18.8 North, longitude 108.3 West. Lidia is moving 
toward the east-northeast near 13 mph (20 km/h). A faster 
east-northeast motion is expected through tonight. On the forecast 
track, the center of Lidia should make landfall within the hurricane 
warning area in west-central Mexico late this evening or overnight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast today while Lidia 
approaches the west-central coast of Mexico. Rapid weakening
is expected after Lidia moves inland.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115
miles (185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 977 mb (28.85 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lidia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP5.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches with local maxima of 12 inches through Wednesday across the
state Nayarit, southern portions of the state of Sinaloa, and
coastal portions of the state of Jalisco in western Mexico. These
rains will likely produce flash and urban flooding, along with
possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain near the coast.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the south of where
the center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the warning area
later this afternoon. Preparations to protect life and property
should be rushed to completion. Tropical storm conditions are
expected in the Tropical Storm Warning areas beginning this
afternoon. Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area
this evening.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Lidia will affect the west coast of Mexico
and the Baja California peninsula for the next day or two. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Lidia Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
300 AM MDT Tue Oct 10 2023
 
Lidia continues to have robust burst of convection this morning,
with cold cloud tops near -90 degrees Celsius. The recent 
convective burst is near the well-defined mid-level core that was
depicted from an earlier SSMIS microwave pass. Subjective Dvorak
final T-numbers from TAFB and SAB are T4.0 (65 kt) and T4.5 (77 kt),
respectively. UW-CIMSS objective estimates range between 70-77 kt as
well.  Based on the improved satellite imagery and recent
subjective and objective estimates, the initial intensity is raised
to 75 kt.
 
Lidia's estimated motion is east-northeast or 70 degrees at 10 kt. 
The hurricane should move faster to the east-northeast later today 
ahead of a mid- to upper-level trough advancing from the northwest.  
The center of Lidia will approach the west-central coast of Mexico 
later this afternoon and evening, with the system forecast to move 
inland along the west-central coast of Mexico within the hurricane 
warning area by tonight. The track guidance has once again trended 
southward this cycle. The NHC forecast has been nudged further south 
by about 20 n mi, and it lies close to the multi-model consensus 
aids.  
 
Low vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures along the
track of Lidia should allow for further strengthening up until 
landfall, consistent with the regional hurricane models and the 
global model suite.  While the 12 h intensity forecast of
90 kt is unchanged from the peak of the previous forecast (near the
upper-end of the intensity guidance), Lidia could intensify further 
up to landfall. Increasing shear and the high terrain of Mexico 
will result in rapid weakening after landfall and Lidia is expected 
to dissipate by 36 hours.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Lidia is expected to continue to strengthen as it approaches
west-central Mexico today. Dangerous hurricane-force winds are
expected within the Hurricane Warning area beginning this afternoon.
 
2. Heavy rains from Lidia will likely produce flash and urban
flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain
across the the state of Nayarit, southern portions of the state of
Sinaloa, and coastal portions of the state of Jalisco in western
Mexico.
 
3. A dangerous storm surge is expected near and to the south of
where the center of Lidia moves onshore along the coast of
west-central Mexico.
 
4. Swells from Lidia will cause dangerous surf and rip current
conditions along the west coast of Mexico and the Baja California
peninsula during the next couple of days.
