Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 PM PDT Wed Oct 4 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Lidia, located several hundred miles southwest of the <br/>
southwestern coast of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico:<br/>
A large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms located well <br/>
south-southeast of the Gulf of Tehuantepec is associated with a <br/>
trough of low pressure.  Environmental conditions are expected to <br/>
be conducive for gradual development during the next several days, <br/>
and a tropical depression is likely to form this weekend or early <br/>
next week while the disturbance moves slowly west-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western East Pacific:<br/>
An area of low pressure located about 1200 miles southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula is producing <br/>
a small area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  <br/>
Development of this system, however unlikely, should be slow to <br/>
occur while it moves little during the next couple of days.  By this <br/>
weekend, environmental conditions are forecast to become less <br/>
conducive for further development. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Lidia Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
300 AM MDT Thu Oct 05 2023
 
This morning's satellite presentation consists of a sheared cloud 
pattern with the surface center located near the eastern edge of the 
convective canopy.  Although the upper wind pattern is quite 
diffluent over Lidia, easterly shear continues to restrict the 
intensification rate.  The Dvorak satellite intensity estimates 
yield 45 kt from TAFB and SAB, and the initial intensity remains 
unchanged for this advisory. However, based on the 0411 UTC METOP-B 
scatterometer overpass, this could be generous.
 
The statistical GFS/ECMWF SHIPS guidance indicates that the moderate
deep-layer shear should persist over Lidia through the majority of
the forecast period.  Warm oceanic surface temperatures and a very
moist surrounding low- to mid-tropospheric thermodynamic environment
support modest strengthening over the next few days, and the NHC
forecast follows suit.  The official intensity forecast shows a 
peak intensity in 3 days and now indicates some weakening 
afterward due to an increase in shear magnitude (a combination of 
the cyclone's eastward trajectory and persistent easterly shear) and 
is based on a blend of the SHIPS and IVCN intensity guidance.
 
Lidia's is still moving northwestward, or 315/4 kt, and is being 
steered by a subtropical high located to the northeast over the 
west coast of central Mexico.  Around the 36-hour period, the ridge 
is forecast to build temporarily and turn Lidia westward with some 
further reduction in forward speed.  In 72 hours, the cyclone should 
gradually turn toward the northwest to north followed by a turn 
toward the northeast near the end of the period in response to an 
approaching sharp shortwave trough from the northwest, causing a 
break in the aforementioned subtropical ridge.  The NHC track 
forecast is based on a blend of the TVCE and HFIP HCCA consensus 
models and is shifted a little to the right of the previous 
advisory beyond day 3.  
 
Based on the METOP-B scatterometer swath, Lidia's wind radii were
increased slightly northeast through southwest.
