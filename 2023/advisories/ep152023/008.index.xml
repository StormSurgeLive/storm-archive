Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 PM PDT Wed Oct 4 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Lidia, located several hundred miles south-southwest of the <br/>
southwestern coast of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South of Central America:<br/>
A large, elongated area of showers and thunderstorms located well <br/>
south of the coast of Guatemala is associated with a trough of low <br/>
pressure.  Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive for <br/>
gradual development during the next several days, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form this weekend or early next week while <br/>
the disturbance moves slowly west-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western East Pacific:<br/>
An area of low pressure located about 1200 miles southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula is producing <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Development of this system, <br/>
if any, should be slow to occur while it moves little during the <br/>
next couple of days.  By this weekend, environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to become less conducive for further development. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Lidia Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
900 PM MDT Wed Oct 04 2023
 
Lidia has maintained its small, sheared structure for the past 
several hours. Convection has been waning, but infrared 
geostationary imagery shows a growing burst of convection 
developing west of the estimated low-level center.  Microwave 
imagery also revealed a large curved band around the western and 
northern portion of the circulation.  Subjective and objective 
satellite intensity guidance nearly all agree on a 45-kt estimate, 
and therefore, the initial intensity is held constant for this 
advisory.
 
The storm has a somewhat uncertain motion since the center position 
is obscured by the cirrus canopy, but the direction is estimated to 
be northwestward, or 325/6 kt.  A mid-level ridge over Mexico is 
steering Lidia, and the storm is expected to maintain its current 
motion for the next 12 hours or so.  Then the ridge is forecast to 
build and turn the cyclone westward in the next day or so, with a 
slight decrease in forward motion.  By day 5, global models predict 
the ridge will erode and turn Lidia northwestward.  There is still 
above average spread in the model guidance, largely due to the 
along-track differences in the westward progression of the storm.  
The latest official track forecast has shifted slightly north of the 
previous advisory and favors the simple consensus aid, TVCE.
 
There are competing factors contributing to the intensity forecast.
While the storm is forecast to be over warm ocean waters and in an
area of decent mid-level moisture, a limiting factor is still the
moderate-to-strong deep-layer vertical wind shear.  Most models
show gradual strengthening, and minor adjustments have been made to
the latest NHC intensity forecast, which is closest to the IVCN
consensus aid.
