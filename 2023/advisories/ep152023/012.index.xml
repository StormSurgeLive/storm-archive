Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 PM PDT Thu Oct 5 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Lidia, located several hundred miles southwest of the <br/>
southwestern coast of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico (EP99):<br/>
A large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms located  <br/>
south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec is associated with a trough of low <br/>
pressure.  Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive for <br/>
gradual development during the next several days, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form this weekend or early next week while <br/>
the disturbance moves slowly west-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western East Pacific:<br/>
An elongated area of low pressure located about 1200 miles southwest <br/>
of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula continues to <br/>
produce disorganized thunderstorms. Any development of this system <br/>
would be slow to occur while it moves little during the next couple <br/>
of days. By this weekend, environmental conditions are forecast to <br/>
become less conducive for further development. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Lidia Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
900 PM MDT Thu Oct 05 2023
 
Lidia seems to gradually be getting better organized.  The estimated 
low-level center appears to be more closely aligned with the deepest 
convection, with cloud top temperatures of -90 degrees C.  Still, 
the majority of the convection is on the western portion of the 
circulation.  The latest subjective satellite intensity estimates 
from TAFB and SAB are T3.5/55kt and the initial wind speed is raised 
to 55 kt for this advisory.

The storm is moving very slowly westward, at an estimated 270/2 kt. 
Lidia is being steered by the weak currents of a mid-level ridge 
located over Mexico.  As the ridge strengthens, the cyclone will 
continue to move westward at a slightly quicker pace for about the 
next day.  In a day or two, Lidia should begin to slowly turn 
northward as the ridge begins to retreat eastward.  By days 4 and 
5, the system should accelerate northeastward in the flow ahead of 
an upper-level trough.  The initial position needed to be adjusted 
slightly southward based on the last-light visible imagery showing 
the low-level spiral bands becoming more co-located with the deep 
convection.  This relocation shifted the official track forecast 
southward from the previous advisory, which still lies between the 
various consensus aids.  

In terms of the intensity forecast, the atmospheric and oceanic 
conditions are still mixed.  The upper-level winds are expected to 
induce moderate-to-strong vertical wind shear through the majority 
of the forecast period.  However, the warm sea surface temperature 
and relatively decent mid-level humdities create conducive 
conditions for strengthening.  The model guidance indicates this 
should lead to gradual strengthening for the next couple of days or 
so.  As the surrounding mid-level moisture decreases, the storm 
should slowly weaken between days 3 through 5.  The latest NHC 
forecast shifted the peak intensity to 48 h and lies a little above 
the various consensus aids.
