RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches with local maxima of 12 inches through Wednesday across the
state of Nayarit, southern portions of the state of Sinaloa, and
coastal portions of the state of Jalisco in western Mexico. These
rains will likely produce flash and urban flooding, along with
possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain near the coast.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the south of where Lidia
made landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are occurring in portions of 
west-central Mexico within the hurricane warning area. Tropical 
storm conditions are occuring in portions of the tropical storm 
warning areas.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lidia will affect the west coast of
Mexico and the Baja California peninsula for the next day or so.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
