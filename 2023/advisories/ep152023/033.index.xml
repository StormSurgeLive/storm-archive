PORTIONS OF WESTERN MEXICO...
...THIS IS THE LAST NHC ADVISORY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 400 AM CDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...22.5N 102.5W
ABOUT 145 MI...235 KM NNE OF GUADALAJARA MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 50 DEGREES AT 23 MPH...37 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1003 MB...29.62 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has discontinued all warnings for the
Pacific coast of Mexico.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the remnants of Lidia were located near
latitude 22.5 North, longitude 102.5 West. The remnants are moving
toward the northeast near 23 mph (37 km/h).
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for the remnants of Lidia can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header
WTPZ45 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP5.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  The remnants of Lidia are expected to produce an 
additional 2 to 4 inches across portions of western Mexico through 
today, bringing storm total amounts to 12 inches locally. This 
rainfall may produce flash and urban flooding, along with possible 
mudslides in areas of higher terrain near the coast. 
 
SURF:  Swells will continue to affect the west coast of Mexico and
the Baja California peninsula through today. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system.

Remnants Of Lidia Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
400 AM CDT Wed Oct 11 2023
 
The satellite structure of Lidia has rapidly deteriorated overnight 
over the mountainous terrain of western Mexico. Surface observations 
and satellite data indicate the system no longer has a well-defined 
center, and therefore this will be the final NHC advisory on Lidia. 
Even though the system has dissipated, moisture associated with 
Lidia's remnants could result in additional heavy rainfall and 
flooding over portions of western Mexico today.
  
Key Messages:
 
1. Additional rainfall associated with the remnants of Lidia may 
produce flash and urban flooding across portions of western Mexico 
today, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain near 
the coast.
