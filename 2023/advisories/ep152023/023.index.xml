DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression 
Sixteen-E was located near latitude 15.9 North, longitude 101.7 
West. The depression is moving toward the north-northwest near 5 mph 
(7 km/h) and this motion is forecast to continue with a gradual turn 
northward and north-northeastward through late Monday. On the 
forecast track, the center of the depression is forecast to reach 
the coast of southern Mexico within the warning area by late Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Strengthening is forecast during the next 24 hours, and this system 
is forecast to become a tropical storm tonight. Rapid weakening is 
expected after the system moves inland on Tuesday. 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for the disturbance can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header
WTPZ41 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP1.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Tropical Depression Sixteen-E is expected to produce
rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches with local maxima of 12 inches
through Tuesday across the states of Guerrero, Michoacan and the
coastal sections of western Oaxaca in southwest Mexico. These rains
will likely produce flash and urban flooding, along with possible
mudslides in areas of higher terrain near the coast.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area on Monday, making outside preparations
difficult or dangerous.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.

Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen-E Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162023
1000 AM CDT Sun Oct 08 2023
 
The system appears to be getting slowly better organized this 
morning, though it remains unclear if a well-defined center has 
formed. An SSMIS pass at 1110 UTC revealed a decent curved 
convective band to the northwest of the best low-level turning, but 
there is a lack of clear evidence of a tighter low-level circulation 
on the low-level 37 GHz channel. First-light visible images on the 
1-minute GOES-18 meso-sector also remain unclear on the circulation 
definition. Thus, the system remains a potential tropical cyclone, 
but given the improvement in banding the initial intensity was 
raised to 30 kt, a bit higher than the TAFB and SAB Dvorak 
estimates.
 
First-light visible imagery suggests the best position of the system 
right now is just a little north and west of overnight estimate, 
resulting in a slow northwest motion at 320/4 kt. The overall track 
reasoning remains unchanged, as the system is expected to move 
north-northwestward or northward over the next 24-36 h, in between a 
mid-level ridge centered to its east over the northwest Caribbean, 
and Tropical Storm Lidia located to its west. This motion should 
bring the system inland over Mexico just beyond 36 h from now. 
However, notable differences in the timing of landfall between the 
guidance remain. The GFS model, in addition to the 
hurricane-regional models based on the GFS initial conditions  
(HWRF, HMON, HAFS-A/B) continue to be much faster than other global 
model guidance such as the ECMWF and CMC. This disagreement is 
likely at least partially related to the fact the disturbance does 
not yet have a well-defined center, and may potentially form further 
north closer to land. For now, the NHC track forecast leans towards 
the slower solutions, but has shifted a bit east compared to the 
previous track, and is a little slower than the consensus aid TVCE.
 
Given the gradually improving structure, the system is expected to 
become a tropical cyclone soon, and most of the intensity guidance 
suggest continued intensification up till landfall. The NHC 
intensity forecast continues to show a peak intensity of 45 kt near 
landfall, which is on the high end of the intensity guidance that 
appears biased by the GFS and its hurricane-regional models that 
bring the system inland faster than shown here. It is notable that 
the ECMWF and CMC show a stronger tropical cyclone than the NHC 
forecast, mainly because they spend a longer period of time 
offshore.
 
Based on the latest forecast showing the system near landfall in   
36 h, the government of Mexico has upgraded the area previously 
under a Tropical Storm Watch to a Warning.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. The disturbance is expected to become a tropical storm before it
approaches the coast of southern Mexico on Monday.  A tropical storm
warning is now in effect for a portion of the coast of southern
Mexico.
 
2. Heavy rains from this system will likely produce flash and urban
flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain
across the states of Guerrero, Michoacan and coastal sections of
western Oaxaca.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has issued a Hurricane Watch for Las Islas
Marias and for the coast of west-central Mexico from Playa Perula
to Mazatlan.  The government of Mexico has also issued a Tropical
Storm Watch from Mazatlan to Bahia Tempehuaya and from Manzanillo
to Playa Perula
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Las Islas Marias
* Playa Perula to Mazatlan
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Mazatlan to Bahia Tempehuaya
* Manzanillo to Playa Perula
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in west-central Mexico and the southern portion
of the Baja California peninsula should monitor the progress of
Lidia.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM MDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was 
located near latitude 17.6 North, longitude 112.8 West.  Lidia is 
moving toward the north near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A faster 
northeastward or east-northeastward motion is expected on Monday and 
Tuesday. On the forecast track, the center of Lidia should approach 
the Islas Marias and the coast of west-central Mexico on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual strengthening is forecast, and Lidia is expected to 
be a hurricane before it approaches the coast of west-central 
Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.24 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lidia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP5.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area by
late Tuesday, with tropical storm conditions possible on
Tuesday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible in the Tropical
Storm Watch areas beginning Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches with local maxima of 12 inches through Wednesday across the
southern portions of the state of Sinaloa, western portions of the
state of Nayarit and coastal  portions of the state of Jalisco in
southwest Mexico. These rains will likely produce flash and urban
flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain
near the coast.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Lidia will affect the west coast of Mexico
and the Baja California peninsula for the next few days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 600 PM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 900 PM MDT.

Tropical Storm Lidia Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
300 PM MDT Sun Oct 08 2023
 
Lidia has become a little better organized this afternoon.  
Satellite images indicate that deep convection has been increasing 
and gradually becoming more symmetric.  However, microwave data 
show that the low- and mid-level centers are still not well aligned, 
and there is a notable southwest tilt with height.  The initial 
intensity is again held at 60 kt, near the low end of the satellite 
estimates, but if the trends continue, Lidia could become a 
hurricane tonight.
 
The storm has now turned northward at 6 kt.  A faster motion to the
northeast and east-northeast is expected on Monday and Tuesday as a
mid- to upper-level trough approaches the system.  There has not
been any significant change with the new models runs, with the GFS
remaining the fastest solution and the ECMWF the slowest.  The NHC
track forecast has again been nudged northward this cycle toward
the latest consensus aids.  Based on the latest guidance, Lidia will
likely make landfall in west-central Mexico late Tuesday.
 
Lidia could strengthen a little tonight or early Monday, but more
notable intensification seems likely late Monday and Tuesday in
part due to a favorable trough interaction while Lidia moves over
SSTs near 30 C.  The models have trended higher this cycle and the
NHC intensity forecast has followed suit, and is in line with the
HCCA and IVCN models.  Rapid weakening is expected after landfall
and Lidia will likely dissipate over central Mexico in a few days.

Based on the forecast and the track uncertainty, the government of 
Mexico has issued Hurricane and Tropical Storm Watches for portions 
of west-central Mexico.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Lidia is expected to strengthen before it reaches west-central
Mexico, and hurricane and tropical storm conditions are possible in 
the watch areas beginning Tuesday.
 
2. Heavy rains from Lidia will likely produce flash and urban
flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain
across the southern portions of the state of Sinaloa, western
portions of the state of Nayarit and coastal portions of Jalisco
in southwest Mexico.
 
3. Swells from Lidia will cause dangerous surf and rip current
conditions along the west coast of Mexico and the Baja California
peninsula during the next few days.
