Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 AM PDT Wed Oct 4 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Lidia, located several hundred miles south-southwest of the <br/>
southwestern coast of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South of Central America:<br/>
A large area of showers and thunderstorms located well south of the <br/>
coast of Guatemala is associated with a trough of low pressure.  <br/>
Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive for gradual <br/>
development during the next several days, and a tropical depression <br/>
is likely to form this weekend or early next week while the <br/>
disturbance moves slowly west-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western East Pacific:<br/>
An area of low pressure located about 1200 miles southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula is producing <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Development of this system, <br/>
if any, should be slow to occur while it moves little during the <br/>
next couple of days.  By this weekend, environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to become less conducive for further development. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

<title>Tropical Storm Lidia Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Lidia Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
900 AM MDT Wed Oct 04 2023
 
Lidia continues to produce a large convective rain shield, with 
a deep convective burst and cloud top temperatures around -80 
degrees Celsius. An earlier microwave pass depicts that the system 
continues to gradually organize with a mid-level core developing, 
but the low-level center is still displaced to the east of the 
mid-level core, due to easterly vertical wind shear. Subjective 
Dvorak intensity estimates this cycle from TAFB and SAB were T3.0/45 
kt. Given the improved satellite depiction and intensity estimates 
the initial intensity is raised to 45 kt for this advisory.
 
The initial motion is north-northwestward or 335 degrees at 7 kt. A
mid-level ridge over Mexico will continue to steer the system
north-northwestward during the next day or so. Afterwards, a ridge
will build to the north of Lidia which will result in a slower
forward motion and a turn towards the west through the remainder of
the forecast period. There continues to be a large spread in the
along-track guidance as the system turns westward. Most of the
global models are faster, while the hurricane regional models and
HCCA corrected consensus are slower. Therefore, there is increased
uncertainty in the long range track forecast. The NHC track is
slightly faster than the previous, and lies between the faster
global models and the slower regional models.
 
Models are in fairly good agreement that the moderate-to-strong
easterly vertical wind shear will continue to persist over Lidia the
next several days. However, warm sea surface temperatures, a moist
environment and upper-level diffluence will allow slow strengthening
of the system. The NHC intensity forecast is similar to the previous
forecast, and the intensity forecast lies near the IVCN consensus
aid.
