DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 PM MDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lidia was located 
near latitude 19.2 North, longitude 107.2 West. Lidia is moving 
toward the east-northeast near 15 mph (24 km/h). A faster 
east-northeastward motion is expected through tonight. On the

hurricane warning area in west-central Mexico this evening or 
overnight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 115 mph (185 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast and
Lidia will likely be at or near major hurricane strength when it 
reaches the coast.  Rapid weakening is expected after Lidia moves 
inland.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125
miles (205 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 959 mb (28.32 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lidia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP5.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches with local maxima of 12 inches through Wednesday across the
state Nayarit, southern portions of the state of Sinaloa, and
coastal portions of the state of Jalisco in western Mexico. These
rains will likely produce flash and urban flooding, along with
possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain near the coast.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the south of where
the center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the warning area
later this afternoon. Preparations to protect life and property
should be rushed to completion. Tropical storm conditions are
expected in the Tropical Storm Warning areas beginning this
afternoon.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lidia will affect the west coast of 
Mexico and the Baja California peninsula for the next day or two. 
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather 
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 300 PM MDT.

Hurricane Lidia Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
900 AM MDT Tue Oct 10 2023
 
Lidia is strengthening as it approaches west-central Mexico. 
Microwave images from a few hours ago indicated that the hurricane 
has developed a well-defined inner core with an eyewall that is 
nearly closed.  Although an eye is not present in geostationary 
satellite images, the central dense overcast has become more 
circular during the last few hours.  The Dvorak estimates have 
increased and now range from 77 to 90 kt, and based on that data and 
the improvement in the system's organization, the initial intensity 
is increased to 85 kt.  This increase in wind speed makes Lidia a 
category 2 hurricane.  The Air Force Hurricane Hunters are in route 
to investigate Lidia this afternoon, and will provide a better 
estimate of the hurricane's intensity.  The outer rain bands of 
Lidia are nearing Isla Las Marias and west-central Mexico, and 
conditions are expected to worsen in that region through the day.
 
Lidia is accelerating to the east-northeast, and the latest initial
motion is 070/13 kt.  The mid- to upper-level trough just to the
west of the hurricane will steer it quickly toward west-central
Mexico and the center should make landfall this evening.  However,
as noted above, weather conditions will deteriorate well before
then since most of the strong winds are east of the center.  The
NHC track forecast is a touch to the south of the previous one and
near the various consensus aids.
 
Additional strengthening is expected due to a combination of very
warm SSTs near 30 C and a favorable upper-level wind pattern.
Lidia will likely be near major hurricane strength when it reaches
the coast, and the NHC intensity forecast closely follows the
hurricane regional models, HAFS-A, HAFS-B, HWRF, and HMON.  Rapid
weakening is expected once Lidia moves inland, and the hurricane is
expected to dissipate by late Wednesday over the rugged terrain of
central Mexico.
 
Based on the forecast, the government of Mexico has extended the
Hurricane and Tropical Storm Warnings southward.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Lidia is expected to continue to strengthen as it approaches
west-central Mexico today. Dangerous hurricane-force winds are
expected within the Hurricane Warning area beginning this afternoon.
 
2. Heavy rains from Lidia will likely produce flash and urban
flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain
across the the state of Nayarit, southern portions of the state of
Sinaloa, and coastal portions of the state of Jalisco in western
Mexico.
 
3. A dangerous storm surge is expected near and to the south of
where the center of Lidia moves onshore along the coast of
west-central Mexico.
 
4. Swells from Lidia will cause dangerous surf and rip current
conditions along the west coast of Mexico and the Baja California
peninsula during the next couple of days.
