NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 PM PDT Fri Oct 6 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Lidia, located several hundred miles south of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico (EP99):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms are gradually becoming better organized in <br/>
association with an area of low pressure centered a couple of <br/>
hundred miles southwest of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to support further development of this <br/>
system during the next couple of days, and a tropical depression is <br/>
very likely to form this weekend. The disturbance is forecast to <br/>
move slowly west-northwestward for the next day or so, and then <br/>
turn northward and move toward the southern coast of Mexico late <br/>
Sunday and Monday. This system could produce heavy rainfall along <br/>
portions of the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico through <br/>
early next week. Interests in this area should monitor the progress <br/>
of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

...LIDIA FORECAST TO MOVE SLOWLY WELL OFFSHORE OF SOUTHWESTERN
MEXICO THIS WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM MDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.0N 111.9W
ABOUT 540 MI...870 KM WSW OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
ABOUT 495 MI...795 KM SSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 270 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...995 MB...29.39 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was
located near latitude 16.0 North, longitude 111.9 West. Lidia is
moving toward the west near 5 mph (7 km/h).  A gradual turn toward
the northwest and north is expected this weekend, followed by a
slightly faster northeastward motion on Monday.
 
Satellite data show that maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph 
(100 km/h) with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is 
anticipated this weekend, but Lidia could become a hurricane early 
next week. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Lidia will begin to affect the west coast
of Mexico and the Baja California peninsula today. These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. 
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Lidia Forecast Discussion Number 16</title>

Tropical Storm Lidia Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
900 PM MDT Fri Oct 06 2023
 
Moderate easterly deep-layer shear continues over Lidia this
evening. Earlier visible satellite images along with AMSR2 and SSMIS
passive microwave data indicate the low-level center lies near the
northeastern edge of a large convective mass. The cyclone continues
to produce very deep convection, with infrared cloud tops as cold as
-85 deg C. But, the tilted vertical structure signifies that Lidia
has likely not strengthened, and the initial intensity is held at 60
kt. This is once again in best agreement with the UW-CIMSS SATCON,
D-PRINT, and D-MINT estimates. The ASCAT-B and -C overpasses
expected over Lidia later tonight should help to better assess the
low-level structure and refine the wind radii values.
 
Lidia is moving slowly westward at 275/5 kt. In the near term,
models are in good agreement that the storm will gradually turn
northwestward and northward during the next couple of days. By early
next week, a developing shortwave trough over the eastern Pacific is
forecast to cause Lidia to accelerate northeastward and move toward
the southwestern or west-central coast of Mexico. There is increased
spread in the guidance beyond 72 h, particularly in the along-track
direction. The NHC track forecast has been shifted slightly to the
right of the previous prediction, bringing it closer to the latest
consensus aids. The day 5 forecast position is just inland over
western Mexico, but note uncertainty is high as the GFS and ECMWF
are over 24 h apart in terms of when Lidia might reach the coast.
 
Although Lidia is currently moving over very warm SSTs, the easterly
shear is forecast to persist over the next couple of days. Thus,
only small intensity fluctuations are forecast through the weekend,
and Lidia could hover near or just below hurricane intensity during
this period. The global and regional models suggest there is a brief
window where Lidia could move under an upper-level ridge in about 3
days, providing a brief respite from the shear and allowing the
cyclone to become better organized. There is also some potential for
positive trough interaction thereafter, despite the increased
southwesterly shear forecast at 96-120 h. The spread in the
intensity guidance grows substantially beyond day 3. The HAFS-A and
-B models show Lidia peaking as a major hurricane, while the GFS
shows a hurricane and other global and regional models keep the
system a tropical storm. Overall, there is enough model evidence to
warrant showing slight strengthening later in the period, but the
longer-range intensity forecast is highly uncertain and future
adjustments may be required.
