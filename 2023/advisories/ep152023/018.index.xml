Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 AM PDT Sat Oct 7 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Lidia, located several hundred miles south-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico (EP99):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms are gradually becoming better organized in <br/>
association with an area of low pressure centered a couple of <br/>
hundred miles southwest of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to support further development of this <br/>
system during the next couple of days, and a tropical depression is <br/>
expected to form over the next day or two. The disturbance is <br/>
forecast to move slowly west-northwestward for the next day or so, <br/>
and then turn northward and move toward the southern coast of Mexico <br/>
late Sunday and Monday. This system could produce heavy rainfall <br/>
along portions of the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico <br/>
through early next week. Interests in this area should monitor the <br/>
progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was
located near latitude 16.2 North, longitude 112.2 West. Lidia is
moving toward the west-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h), and a gradual 
turn toward the north is expected this weekend, followed by a 
faster northeastward motion on Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast this weekend, but 
Lidia could become a hurricane early next week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Lidia will begin to affect the west coast
of Mexico and the Baja California peninsula today. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.

Tropical Storm Lidia Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
900 AM MDT Sat Oct 07 2023
 
Infrared satellite imagery this morning indicates that easterly 
shear continues to impact Lidia. A recent AMSR-2 microwave pass 
showed the low-level center embedded along the eastern edge of the 
most intense deep convection. Based on a blend of subjective and 
objective intensity estimates from TAFB/SAB and UW-CIMSS, 
respectively, the intensity is held at 55 kt for this advisory.

Lidia has begun its turn toward the northwest, and the storm is 
currently moving west-northwestward at approximately 4 kt. A slow 
turn to the north is expected during the next day or so, after which 
time it is expected to begin interacting with an approaching trough 
from the north. This interaction will result in an acceleration 
early next week toward the northeast and in the general direction 
of west-central Mexico. While some uncertainty exists in the 
forward speed forecast, the current forecast is very similar to the 
prior forecast and lies between the TVCN and HCCA consensus aids. 
 
Easterly shear is forecast to remain strong and inhibit significant 
intensification through the weekend. During this time the NHC
intensity forecast shows little change. However, early next week 
the shear is expected to briefly relax as the storm begins to 
accelerate northeastward over warm sea-surface temperatures. During 
this time, Lidia is forecast to intensify to hurricane strength. Of 
note, southwesterly shear is expected to increase as the storm 
approaches Mexico, and the spread is quite large among the intensity 
guidance aids. The ECMWF and GFS global models both depict central 
pressures that suggest Lidia could maintain hurricane intensity, 
while other reliable statistical models and consensus aids are not 
as aggressive. The NHC forecast is similar to the prior forecast and 
near the center of the guidance envelope. Confidence in the 
intensity forecast is low considering the wide range of solutions, 
but interests in west-central Mexico should remain attentive to 
forecast updates in the coming days.
