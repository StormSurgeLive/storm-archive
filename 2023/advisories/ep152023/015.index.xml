Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 AM PDT Fri Oct 6 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Lidia, located several hundred miles south of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico (EP99):<br/>
An area of low pressure is centered about 250 miles southwest of <br/>
the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Shower and thunderstorm activity <br/>
is showing signs of becoming better organized. Environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to be conducive for gradual development <br/>
during the next several days, and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form late this weekend or early next week. The disturbance is <br/>
forecast to move slowly west-northwestward for the next two days, <br/>
and then turn northward and move closer to the southern coast of <br/>
Mexico on Sunday and Monday. Regardless of development, this system <br/>
could produce heavy rainfall along portions of the coast of <br/>
southwestern Mexico through early next week and interests in this <br/>
area should monitor the disturbance's progress.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>

...SHEARED LIDIA REMAINS NEAR HURRICANE INTENSITY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM MDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.4N 111.2W
ABOUT 490 MI...785 KM WSW OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
ABOUT 455 MI...735 KM S OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...70 MPH...110 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 275 DEGREES AT 6 MPH...9 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM MDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was
located near latitude 16.4 North, longitude 111.2 West. Lidia is
moving toward the west near 6 mph (9 km/h). This general motion 
is expected to continue over the next day, followed by a gradual
turn toward the northwest, and then north, through the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts. Slight strengthening is possible during the next day or 
two, and Lidia could become a hurricane tonight or over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.27 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Lidia will begin to affect the west coast
of Mexico and the Baja California peninsula on Saturday.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------

<title>Tropical Storm Lidia Forecast Discussion Number 15</title>

Tropical Storm Lidia Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
300 PM MDT Fri Oct 06 2023

Lidia remains sheared, with its low-level center nearly exposed in 
recent visible satellite imagery. Confidence in the center position 
of Lidia is therefore much higher than it was six hours ago. Recent 
Dvorak intensity fixes still appear to be inflated relative to 
Lidia's observed structure. Thus, the intensity estimate is again 
based heavily on objective techniques that incorporate microwave 
data, such as the UW-CIMSS DMINT, which still support an intensity 
near 60 kt.

For the next 2-3 days, confidence in the NHC track and intensity 
forecasts is fairly high. Lidia is forecast to continue moving 
generally westward to west-northwestward today, and then gradually 
turn northward through the weekend. The tropical storm will likely
remain sheared during this time, which should result in only small 
fluctuations in intensity. Lidia could still become a hurricane 
tonight or over the weekend. 

Beyond about 72 h, the forecast uncertainty increases substantially. 
The tropical storm is forecast to interact with a mid-latitude 
short-wave trough, which should cause it to accelerate 
northeastward. The trough interaction will also cause a change in 
the environmental mid- to upper-level wind pattern, resulting in a 
southwesterly shear vector and an increase in upper-level difluence. 
Some models, including both HAFS-A and HAFS-B, indicate that Lidia 
could begin to strengthen at this time, while others keep it 
steady-state and strongly sheared. There is also uncertainty with 
the forward speed of Lidia. For instance, the GFS shows a much 
faster forward speed than most other models. Run-to-run consistency 
of the models in the 4-5 day time frame has been poor today, so only 
very small adjustments were made to the NHC forecast at this time. 
Larger changes may be required over the weekend as the forecast 
becomes clearer.
