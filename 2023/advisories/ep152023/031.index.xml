DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM MDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lidia was located
near latitude 19.6 North, longitude 106.6 West. Lidia is moving
toward the east-northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h). A slightly faster

hurricane warning area in west-central Mexico this evening.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Lidia is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional strengthening is possible and
Lidia could become an extremely dangerous category 4 hurricane  
before it reaches the coast.  Rapid weakening is expected after 
Lidia moves inland.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on data from an Air 
Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 950 mb (28.06 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lidia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP5.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches with local maxima of 12 inches through Wednesday across the
state Nayarit, southern portions of the state of Sinaloa, and
coastal portions of the state of Jalisco in western Mexico. These
rains will likely produce flash and urban flooding, along with
possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain near the coast.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the south of where
the center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the warning area
this evening. Preparations to protect life and property be nearing 
completion. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Tropical 
Storm Warning areas this evening.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lidia will affect the west coast of
Mexico and the Baja California peninsula for the next day or two.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 600 PM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 900 PM MDT.

Hurricane Lidia Discussion Number  31
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
300 PM MDT Tue Oct 10 2023
 
Lidia became a major hurricane around 1800 UTC and has continued to
intensify since that time.  The Air Force Hurricane Hunters recently
found that the minimum pressure has fallen significantly to 950 mb.
In addition, the maximum 700-mb flight-level wind measured by the
aircraft was 116 kt, which adjusts to about 105 kt at the surface.
The maximum SFMR surface wind reported was 108 kt.  Based on these
data, the initial intensity is increased to 110 kt.  Lidia has
strengthened by a very impressive 50 kt over the past 24 hours.
Although the eye has just become evident in geostationary satellite
images, it has been clearly seen in microwave data for much 
of the day.  Deep convection has been increasing in coverage and
magnitude, and has become more symmetric during the past few hours.
 
The outer rain bands of Lidia are beginning to spread across
portions of west-central Mexico, and weather conditions are
expected to steadily worsen into the evening.  The center of Lidia
is forecast to make landfall in west-central Mexico later this 
evening.
 
As mentioned above, Lidia has rapidly strengthened over very warm
SSTs and in a favorable upper-level wind pattern during the past day
or so.  Since the environmental conditions are not expected to
change, Lidia could reach category 4 strength before it makes
landfall.  Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland,
and Lidia is forecast to dissipate on Wednesday over the rugged
terrain of central Mexico.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Lidia is expected to make landfall in west-central Mexico as a
major hurricane this evening. Life-threatening hurricane-force 
winds are expected within the Hurricane Warning area.
 
2. Heavy rains from Lidia will likely produce flash and urban
flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain
across the the state of Nayarit, southern portions of the state of
Sinaloa, and coastal portions of the state of Jalisco in western
Mexico.
 
3. A dangerous storm surge is expected near and to the south of
where the center of Lidia moves onshore along the coast of
west-central Mexico. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied 
by large and destructive waves. 
 
4. Swells from Lidia will cause dangerous surf and rip current
conditions along the west coast of Mexico and the Baja California
peninsula during the next day or so.
