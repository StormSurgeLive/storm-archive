Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 AM PDT Fri Oct 6 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Lidia, located several hundred miles south of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico (EP99):<br/>
An area of low pressure is centered about 200 miles south of the <br/>
Gulf of Tehuantepec. Shower and thunderstorm activity associated <br/>
with the low is currently limited and disorganized. However, <br/>
environmental conditions are expected to be conducive for gradual <br/>
development during the next several days, and a tropical depression <br/>
is likely to form late this weekend or early next week. The <br/>
disturbance is forecast to move slowly west-northwestward for the <br/>
next two days, and then turn northward and move closer to the <br/>
southern coast of Mexico on Sunday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Lidia Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
300 AM MDT Fri Oct 06 2023
 
Lidia's satellite presentation has improved during the past several 
hours.  Cloud tops remain very cold (-88 Celsius) and the cloud mass 
has increased with a primary curved banding wrapping around from the 
northwest to southeast side of the cyclone.  Based on a recent 
GPM/GMI overpass, however, the center is still located near the 
northeastern edge of the convective canopy.  Using a blend of the 
subjective intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB, the UW-CIMSS Deep 
Multi-spectral Intensity TC estimator (D-MINT) objective analysis, 
and the latest ATMS microwave intensity estimate, the initial 
intensity is raised to 60 kt for this advisory.

Although the 20-25 kt of easterly shear has continued to impinge on 
the eastern portion of the cyclone, the upper-wind pattern has 
become appreciably diffluent.  This favorable contribution along 
with warm oceanic surface temperatures and a relatively moist 
surrounding atmosphere should support further strengthening during 
the next 48 hours.  Afterward, a gradual weakening trend should 
commence due to increasing southwesterly shear and Lidia moving into 
a highly stable marine air mass.  The official forecast shows Lidia 
becoming a hurricane a little sooner than the previous intensity 
forecast, and is based on a compromise of the statistical SHIPS and 
LGEM intensity guidance.
 
The center of Lidia has been difficult to pinpoint this morning, and 
Lidia is estimated to be moving in a somewhat uncertain direction 
and forward speed of 295/4 kt.  The cyclone is being steered by weak 
mid-tropospheric flow produced by a subtropical ridge extending over 
the eastern Pacific from the west coast of central Mexico.  Near the 
60 hour period, Lidia is forecast to turn northwestward to 
north-northwestward while rounding the southwestern periphery of the 
ridge.  By the 72 hour period, the system should turn northward to 
north-northeastward in response to a mid-latitude shortwave trough 
approaching Lidia from the northwest.  The NHC track forecast 
adjusted a little to the north of the previous one due to the 
initial position adjustment, and closely follows the TVCE 
multi-model consensus aid.
