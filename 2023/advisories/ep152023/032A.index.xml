SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Punta San Telmo to San Blas
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products 
issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was 
located inland near latitude 21.7 North, longitude 103.5 West. 
Lidia is moving toward the northeast near 21 mph (33 km/h). This 
general motion at a slightly faster forward speed is expected 
today. On the forecast track, the center of Lidia will continue 
moving inland over west-central Mexico this morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Rapid weakening is expected today as Lidia 
continues moving inland.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km) 
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lidia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP5.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches with local maxima of 12 inches through today across the
state of Nayarit, southern portions of the state of Sinaloa, and
coastal portions of the state of Jalisco in western Mexico. These
rains will likely produce flash and urban flooding, along with
possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain near the coast.
 
STORM SURGE:  Water levels along the coast of west-central Mexico 
will gradually subside overnight.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occuring in portions of the 
tropical storm warning area.
 
SURF:  Swells from Lidia will affect the west coast of Mexico and 
the Baja California peninsula through today. These swells are likely 
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

Hurricane Lidia Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
1000 PM CDT Tue Oct 10 2023
 
Lidia is estimated to have made landfall around 2350 UTC near Las 
Penitas in the Mexican state of Jalisco.  Satellite imagery showed 
an eye briefly clearing and warming before reaching the coastline, 
and the maximum sustained wind speed was estimated to be 120 kt.  
Since that time, the structure of Lidia has degraded.  The eye is 
no longer apparent and convection around the center is no longer 
symmetric.  The initial intensity for this advisory is lowered to 
90 kt.  Continued rapid weakening is expected for the next day 
while Lidia moves over the elevated terrain in west-central Mexico. 
Model guidance shows the storm will dissipate within 24 hours, and 
this is reflected in the official intensity forecast.

The hurricane's motion is estimated to be 60/15 kt.  Lidia is 
expected to accelerate northeastward in the flow of a mid- to 
upper-level trough located over northern Mexico. Minor adjustments 
have been made to the NHC track forecast.  Even as Lidia dissipates, 
remnant moisture could result in flooding rainfall and possible 
mudslides as it moves inland.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Lidia is moving inland over west-central Mexico as a hurricane. 
Life-threatening hurricane-force winds are expected along the path 
of the storm overnight.
 
2. Heavy rains from Lidia will likely produce flash and urban
flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain
across the state of Nayarit, southern portions of the state of
Sinaloa, and coastal portions of the state of Jalisco in western
Mexico.
 
3. Dangerous water levels along the coast of west-central Mexico 
will gradually subside overnight.
 
4. Swells from Lidia will cause dangerous surf and rip current
conditions along the west coast of Mexico and the Baja California
peninsula through Wednesday.
