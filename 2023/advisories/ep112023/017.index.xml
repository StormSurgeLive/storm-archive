...DANGEROUS BEACH CONDITIONS EXPECTED ALONG THE COAST OF
CALIFORNIA THIS WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM PDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.4N 122.4W
ABOUT 820 MI...1320 KM W OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...85 MPH...140 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...980 MB...28.94 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM PDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jova was located
near latitude 20.4 North, longitude 122.4 West. Jova is moving
toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this general
motion with a gradual decrease in forward speed is expected over the
next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts. Continued weakening is forecast during the next several
days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Jova are expected to reach portions of
the coast of California later today. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions through the
weekend.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM PDT.

Hurricane Jova Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112023
200 PM PDT Fri Sep 08 2023
  
Jova continues to weaken as it encounters cooler sea surface 
temperatures. The overall satellite depiction of Jova is that of a 
weakening tropical system, encountering a more stable environment. 
A SSMIS microwave pass that came in just after the previous 
advisory, shows that banding around Jova is thinning, and the inner 
core is collapsing as dry air wraps into the system. Cloud tops 
within the convection have been warming throughout the day as well. 
Subjective and objective satellite estimates have continued to 
decrease throughout the day. The initial intensity has been set to 
75 kt, which represents a blend of the data-T and current intensity 
Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB.
 
Environmental conditions along the forecast track are becoming less 
favorable, as the hurricane is moving over cool sea surface 
temperatures and into a more stable airmass. The latest NHC forecast 
continues to show steady weakening and is similar to the previous 
advisory. The GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite show the system 
becoming devoid of convection in about 3 days, and Jova is forecast 
to become a post-tropical remnant low at that time.
 
Jova is moving to the west-northwest at 13 kt. This general motion 
with a decrease in forward speed is expected to continue for the 
next couple of days while the cyclone rounds the end of a ridge 
centered over the southwestern United States. As Jova weakens, the 
system is forecast to turn westward to west-southwestward into the 
low-level flow towards the end of the forecast period. The NHC track 
forecast is close to the previous advisory, just slightly slower 
and lies near the consensus aids.
