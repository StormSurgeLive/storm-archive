Tropical Storm Jova Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112023
300 AM MDT Tue Sep 05 2023
 
Deep convection has increased near the center of the tropical 
cyclone, with limited banding features surrounding the central 
overcast.  Upper-level outflow is increasing over the system, 
although it is a bit restricted over the northern part of the 
circulation.  A subjective Dvorak satellite classification from 
TAFB and objective ADT intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS support a 
current intensity estimate of 35 kt for this advisory.  Therefore, 
the tropical cyclone is being named at this time.

The initial motion estimate, 280/10 kt, remains somewhat uncertain 
because the center is still not easy to locate.  However, the 
steering scenario for Jova appears to be relatively 
straightforward.  The flow on the south side of a ridge extending 
westward from a mid-tropospheric high over the southwestern U.S. 
should push Jova on a mostly west-northwestward track for the next 
several days.  The track guidance models are in reasonably good 
agreement, although there are some differences in the predicted 
forward speeds.  The NHC forecast is close to the previous one and 
lies between the simple and corrected dynamical consensus solutions.

Over the next couple of days, Jova will be moving through an 
environment that should be quite conducive for strengthening, 
possibly at a rapid pace, with low shear, high humidities, and warm 
SSTs.  The various model Rapid Intensification (RI) indices show 
greater than normal RI probabilities.  Accordingly, the official 
forecast shows intensity increases on the order of 20-25 kt per day 
over the next 48 hours.  Later in the forecast period, cooler ocean 
waters will likely cause a weakening trend.
