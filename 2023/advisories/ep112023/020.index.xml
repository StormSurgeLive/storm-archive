800 AM PDT Sat Sep 09 2023
 
...TROPICAL STORM JOVA SLIGHTLY WEAKER...
...DANGEROUS BEACH CONDITIONS ALONG THE COASTS OF CALIFORNIA AND 
MEXICO ARE OCCURING...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM PDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...22.3N 125.5W
ABOUT 995 MI...1600 KM W OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...992 MB...29.30 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM PDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jova was 
located near latitude 22.3 North, longitude 125.5 West. Jova is 
moving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A 
west-northwestward to northwestward motion at a slightly slower 
forward speed is expected for the next couple of days. Jova is 
forecast to slow down further and turn toward the west-southwest by 
late Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional weakening is likely, and Jova is 
expected to become a remnant low late this weekend or early next 
week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Jova are affecting the western coast of
Mexico and are occuring along portions of the coast of California.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions through the weekend.  Please consult products
from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM PDT.

Tropical Storm Jova Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112023
800 AM PDT Sat Sep 09 2023
 
Jova continues to deteriorate in latest satellite imagery. Dry air 
continues to work into this system, with deep convection starting 
to dissipate. Broken convective banding around the system is 
deteriorating with warming cloud tops in infrared satellite imagery 
A blend of subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates 
suggest an intensity of 55 kt, which is the initial intensity for 
this advisory.
 
Jova is forecast to continue weakening during the next several days 
as the system moves over cool sea surface temperatures, and into a 
more stable airmass. Simulated satellite from the GFS and ECMWF 
suggest Jova will be devoid of deep convection and become a remnant 
low in about 48 hours, this is reflected in the NHC intensity 
forecast. However, the transition to a remnant low could occur 
sooner than forecast.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be northwestward at 9 kt. Jova 
should continue to move generally toward the northwest around the 
edge of a subtropical ridge located over the southwestern United 
States. As Jova weakens, the system is forecast to turn westward to 
west-southwestward into the low-level flow through the end of the 
forecast period. The NHC track forecast is similar to the previous 
forecast track.
