SUMMARY OF 800 PM PDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...23.7N 126.5W
ABOUT 1055 MI...1695 KM W OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 315 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM PDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jova was
located near latitude 23.7 North, longitude 126.5 West.  Jova is
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h.  A gradual turn 
toward the west and west-southwest is expected over the next 
couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast, and Jova is expected to become a remnant low 
by Monday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Jova are affecting the western coast of
Mexico and are occuring along portions of the coast of California.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions through the weekend.  Please consult products
from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM PDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Jova Forecast Discussion Number 22</title>

Tropical Storm Jova Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112023
800 PM PDT Sat Sep 09 2023
 
Jova is maintaining some deep convection near the center, and some 
shallow convective banding features are still evident over the 
southeastern quadrant of the circulation.  Since the central 
convection has still not decreased much, the current intensity is 
held at 45 kt for this advisory.  This is above the subjective 
Dvorak estimates, but in general agreement with objective ADT values 
from UW-CIMSS.

The cyclone continues on a northwestward heading with a motion of 
about 315/8 kt, on the western periphery of a mid-level high 
pressure area.  As the system weakens further, it should be steered 
more by the low-level trade wind flow, and turn toward the east and 
east-southeast.  The official track forecast lies roughly in the 
middle of the track guidance suite.

It is a bit surprising the the system has been able to maintain 
deep convection this evening.  Since the storm will remain over 
cooler waters of 23 deg C or lower, however, weakening is likely 
and the system should degenerate into a remnant low by Monday.  
This is similar to the previous NHC intensity forecast.
