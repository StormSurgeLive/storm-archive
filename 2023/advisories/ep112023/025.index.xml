Post-Tropical Cyclone Jova Advisory Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112023
200 PM PDT Sun Sep 10 2023
 
...DANGEROUS SURF AND RIP CURRENT CONDITIONS CONTINUE ALONG THE 
COASTS OF CALIFORNIA AND MEXICO...
...THIS IS THE LAST ADVISORY AS JOVA BECOMES A REMNANT LOW...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM PDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.8N 127.8W
ABOUT 1135 MI...1830 KM W OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 6 MPH...9 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1005 MB...29.68 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM PDT (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Jova 
was located near latitude 24.8 North, longitude 127.8 West. The 
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the northwest near 6 mph (9 
km/h). A gradual turn toward the west and west-southwest is expected 
over the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Jova has become a remnant low and will continue to 
gradually spin down.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Jova are affecting the western coast of
Mexico and are occuring along portions of the coast of California.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions through Monday.  Please consult products
from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system.  For additional information on the remnant 
low please see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather 
Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and 
on the web at

Post-Tropical Cyclone Jova Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112023
200 PM PDT Sun Sep 10 2023
 
Jova has been devoid of deep convection for roughly 12 hours or so. 
The overall cloud pattern  continues to become disheveled, as the 
system gradually spins down. Given that the system has not been 
producing convection for some time now, it no longer meets the 
definition of a tropical cyclone. Therefore, Jova has degenerated 
into a post-tropical remnant low. The initial intensity is lowered 
to 30 kt for this advisory, based on a recent scatterometer pass 
which is in agreement with the latest subjective and objective 
satellite intensity estimates.
 
Jova will continue to spin down for the next couple of days as
it remains a remnant low, before opening up into a trough in about
72 h. No significant changes were made to the official forecast,
which lies near the consensus intensity aids.
 
Jova's initial motion is estimated to be northwestward at 5 kt, A 
gradual turn toward the west and west-southwest, with an increase in 
forward motion is forecast. The NHC forecast lies near the middle 
of the guidance envelope, near the model consensus.

This is the last advisory on this system from the National Hurricane 
Center. For additional information on the remnant low please see 
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service...under 
AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI and WMO header FZPN02 KWBC.
