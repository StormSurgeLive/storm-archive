BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Jova Advisory Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112023
200 AM PDT Sat Sep 09 2023
 
...TROPICAL STORM JOVA SLOWLY SPINNING DOWN...
...DANGEROUS COASTAL CONDITIONS ALONG THE COASTS OF
CALIFORNIA AND MEXICO ARE OCCURING...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM PDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.5N 124.6W
ABOUT 945 MI...1520 KM W OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...70 MPH...110 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...986 MB...29.12 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM PDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jova was
located near latitude 21.5 North, longitude 124.6 West. Jova is
moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h). A
west-northwestward to northwestward motion at a slightly slower
speed is expected for the next couple of days. Jova is forecast to
slow down further and turn toward the west by late Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional weakening is likely, and Jova is 
expected to become a remnant low early next week.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 986 mb (29.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Jova are affecting the western coast of
Mexico and are occuring along portions of the coast of California. 
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions through the weekend.  Please consult products
from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM PDT.

Tropical Storm Jova Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112023
200 AM PDT Sat Sep 09 2023
 
This morning's satellite presentation consists of a deteriorating
cloud pattern with what remains of the deep convection confined to
the western half of the cyclone.  A blend of the subjective and
objective intensity estimates yield an initial intensity of 60 kt
for this advisory.
 
Jova is forecast to spin down slowly during the next few days,
while traversing decreasing oceanic surface temperatures and moving
into a high, statically stable surrounding environment.  Most models
indicate that Jova will lose its deep convection and become a
remnant low in 60 hours, which is shown in the NHC intensity 
forecast.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be west-northwestward, 300/11 kt. 
The NHC forecast track philosophy remains unchanged.  Jova should 
continue to move generally toward that northwest within the 
southeasterly mid-tropospheric flow produced by subtropical high 
pressure that stretches from the southwestern U.S. across most of 
the eastern Pacific.  As Jova sheds its associated deep convection 
and degenerates to a vertically shallow cyclone, Jova is expected to 
decrease in forward speed and turn toward the west, and 
west-southwest within the easterly tradewind flow through 
dissipation.
