200 AM PDT Sun Sep 10 2023
 
...WEAKENING JOVA STILL GENERATING DANGEROUS SURF AND RIP CURRENT
CONDITIONS ALONG THE COASTS OF CALIFORNIA AND MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM PDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.0N 126.9W
ABOUT 1080 MI...1735 KM W OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 315 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM PDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jova was
located near latitude 24.0 North, longitude 126.9 West. Jova is
moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A gradual turn
toward the west and west-southwest is expected over the next
couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Further weakening is forecast, and Jova is 
expected to become a remnant low by tonight.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Jova are affecting the western coast of
Mexico and are occuring along portions of the coast of California.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions through the weekend.  Please consult products
from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM PDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Jova Forecast Discussion Number 23</title>

Tropical Storm Jova Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112023
200 AM PDT Sun Sep 10 2023
 
A shrinking area of fragmented convection is all that remains of 
Jova's cloud pattern this morning.  A 0525 UTC METOP-C scatterometer 
pass revealed a couple of 35 kt winds in the northeast quadrant.  In 
the deference of undersampling, the initial intensity is lowered to 
40 kt for this advisory.
 
A gradual spin down of Jova should continue through the period while 
it remains over sub 23 degree Celsius SSTs.  Consequently, Jova is 
likely to degenerate into a remnant low by early Monday, or or as 
soon as this evening, as suggested in the global model simulated 
infrared guidance.  No significant changes were made to the official 
forecast and it's similar to the IVCN multi-model intensity 
guidance.
 
Jova's initial motion is estimated to be northwestward or about 
315/7 kt, on the southwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge 
centered over the Baja California peninsula.  As Jova degenerates to 
a vertically shallow cyclone around the 24 hour period, it should 
turn toward the west and west-southwest.  The NHC forecast track is 
basically an update of the previous advisory and is based on the 
various consensus aids.
