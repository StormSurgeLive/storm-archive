Tropical Storm Jova Advisory Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112023
200 PM PDT Sat Sep 09 2023
 
...JOVA CONTINUES TO WEAKEN...
...DANGEROUS BEACH CONDITIONS ALONG THE COASTS OF CALIFORNIA AND
MEXICO ARE OCCURING...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM PDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...22.9N 126.1W
ABOUT 1030 MI...1655 KM W OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 315 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM PDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jova was 
located near latitude 22.9 North, longitude 126.1 West. Jova is 
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A northwestward 
motion at a slightly slower forward speed is expected for the next 
day or so. Jova is forecast to slow down further and turn toward the 
west-southwest by late Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Additional weakening is likely, and Jova is expected 
to become a remnant low by late Sunday or early Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Jova are affecting the western coast of
Mexico and are occuring along portions of the coast of California.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions through the weekend.  Please consult products
from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM PDT.

Tropical Storm Jova Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112023
200 PM PDT Sat Sep 09 2023
 
Jova's convection continues to dissipate this afternoon, with only a 
few bursts in the inner core. Microwave imagery from SSMI/S depicts 
decreased convective banding and the overall structure of the 
system continues to deteriorate as well. A blend of subjective and 
objective satellite intensity estimates suggest an intensity of 45 
kt, which is the initial intensity for this advisory.
 
Jova is forecast to continue weakening for the next few days as the
system moves over cool sea surface temperatures, and into a stable
air mass. Simulated satellite imagery from the GFS and ECMWF models 
suggest Jova will be devoid of deep convection and become a remnant 
low in about 36 hours, and this is reflected in the NHC intensity 
forecast.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be northwestward at 8 kt. Jova 
should continue to move generally toward the northwest around the 
edge of a subtropical ridge during the next day or so. As Jova 
weakens, the system is forecast to turn westward to 
west-southwestward within the low-level flow through the end of the 
forecast period. The NHC track forecast is similar to the previous 
forecast track.
