SUMMARY OF 1100 PM HST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.6N 119.6W
ABOUT 765 MI...1230 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM HST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Ten-E
was located near latitude 16.6 North, longitude 119.6 West. The
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 
km/h). The system is expected to move toward the west-northwest at a 
slightly faster forward speed over the next couple of days, before 
subsequently turning toward the west and slowing down by mid-week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast and the depression is expected to
become a tropical storm by tomorrow.  However, the system is
unlikely to reach hurricane intensity and should begin weakening by
mid-week.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM HST.

Tropical Depression Ten-E Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102023
1100 PM HST Sat Aug 26 2023
 
While abundant deep convection continues in association with 
Tropical Depression Ten-E, there is little curvature to the 
convection and the low-level center continues to be positioned on 
the northeastern side of the deep convection. Subjective Dvorak 
intensity fixes from SAB and TAFB are unchanged (and the ASCAT 
scatterometers missed sampling the system), so Ten-E's maximum 
winds remain at 30 kt. 
 
While the system is currently located over quite warm waters with 
abundant moisture and low vertical wind shear, these conducive 
conditions will not last long. Along the projected forecast track, 
the sea-surface temperatures should lower below 26C as moisture 
decreases and convective instability diminishes in about 36 h. On 
days 4 to 5, the system should encounter even colder waters and 
drier conditions. Based on the above conditions, Ten-E is 
anticipated to only gradually intensify through 24-36 h, followed by 
gradual weakening until it is forecast to become a remnant low at 
around day 4. The official intensity forecast is based upon the IVCN 
simple consensus and shows a slightly weaker peak intensity than the 
previous advisory.
 
Currently, the tropical depression is moving toward the 
west-northwest at around 10 kt.  A longitudinally-extended mid-level 
ridge should continue the system's movement toward the 
west-northwest at a slightly faster forward speed for the next 
couple days.  As Ten-E begins to weaken, it should turn toward the 
west at a slower rate of speed while it gets steered by the 
low-level trades. There continues to be significant along-track 
spread among the guidance. The GFS global model and HAFS-COAMPS 
hurricane models are substantially slower along the track, while the 
UKMET and ECMWF global models are substantially faster.  The 
official track forecast is most similar to the HFIP corrected 
consensus technique - which leans a bit toward the latter track 
solutions - and is nearly unchanged from the previous advisory.
