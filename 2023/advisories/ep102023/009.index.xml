...IRWIN EXPECTED TO FINALLY TURN WESTWARD TONIGHT..
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM HST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.3N 125.7W
ABOUT 1045 MI...1685 KM W OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM HST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Irwin was
located near latitude 19.3 North, longitude 125.7 West. Irwin is
moving toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h). A turn 
toward the west is expected tonight. Irwin is then expected to 
continue heading generally westward for the next several days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Only small changes in intensity are expected for the next day or 
so. Slow weakening is likely after that and Irwin could become 
post-tropical by mid-week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).

Tropical Storm Irwin Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102023
500 PM HST Mon Aug 28 2023
 
Irwin has surprisingly recovered some of its convective organization
over the past few hours. Convection is primarily north of Irwin's
center of circulation, which may have contributed to the tropical
storm moving well to the right of NHC's forecasts for the last 18
hours or so. Earlier ASCAT data and the latest Dvorak analysis from
TAFB support the 35-kt intensity analysis.
 
Despite its recent poleward jog, Irwin is forecast to finally turn
westward tonight. The track models are in very good agreement now
on the forecast for Irwin, so only a small northward adjustment was
made to the NHC track forecast to account for Irwin's recent
right-of-track motion. A low- to mid-level ridge to the north of
Irwin should keep the cyclone moving westward for the majority of
the forecast period, whether it retains its tropical cyclone status
or not. The NHC track forecast is based on the variable track
consensus aid TVCN.
 
Despite cool waters beneath Irwin and dry air surrounding the
tropical cyclone, simulated satellite imagery from most dynamical
models continues to indicate that Irwin will sustain some deep
convection for at least a couple more days. Small fluctuations in
intensity are possible during that period. Sooner or later, the
environment should cause Irwin to weaken and become post-tropical.
No changes of note were made to the NHC intensity forecast.
