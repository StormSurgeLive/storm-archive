<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Central East Pacific (EP92):<br/>
Satellite-derived wind data indicate that the circulation of a low <br/>
pressure system located several hundred miles southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula has become better <br/>
defined. Additionally, the associated shower and thunderstorm <br/>
activity continues to show increased signs of organization while the <br/>
system moves west-northwestward to northwestward at 10 to 15 mph <br/>
over the central portion of the tropical eastern Pacific. If these <br/>
trends continue, advisories will be initiated on a tropical <br/>
depression or tropical storm tonight. For additional information on <br/>
this system, including gale warnings, see High Seas Forecasts issued <br/>
by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...near 100 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...near 100 percent.<br/>

SUMMARY OF 500 PM HST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.1N 118.6W
ABOUT 735 MI...1185 KM SW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM HST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Ten-E
was located near latitude 16.1 North, longitude 118.6 West. The
depression is moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). The 
system is expected to move toward the northwest or west-northwest 
at a slightly faster forward speed over the next couple of days, 
before subsequently turning toward the west and slowing down by 
mid-week.  
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some strengthening is forecast and the depression is expected to 
become a tropical storm by tomorrow.  However, the system is 
unlikely to reach hurricane intensity and should begin weakening by 
mid-week.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Tropical Depression Ten-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102023
500 PM HST Sat Aug 26 2023
 
Invest 92-E has become better organized this evening as a curved 
band of deep convection has become established along the low's 
southwestern semicircle. Additionally, a well-defined center has 
been observed in the GOES visible satellite imagery along the edge 
of the curved band. Thus advisories are being initiated on Tropical 
Depression Ten-E.

The initial intensity of 30 kt is based upon a blend of the TAFB and 
SAB subjective Dvorak fixes and is consistent with the scatterometer 
winds observed this afternoon.  While the system is currently 
located over quite warm waters with abundant moisture and low 
vertical wind shear, these conducive conditions will not last long.  
Along the projected forecast track, the sea-surface temperatures 
should lower below 26C as moisture decreases and convective 
instability diminishes in about 36 h. On days 4 to 5, the system 
should encounter even colder waters and drier conditions. Based on 
the above conditions, Ten-E is anticipated to only gradually 
intensify through 36 h, followed by gradual weakening until it is 
forecast to become a remnant low around day 4. The intensity 
forecast is based upon the a blend of the IVCN simple consensus and 
HFIP corrected consensus approaches, though none of the 
normally-reliable guidance suggests intensification to a hurricane 
for the system.

Currently, the tropical depression is moving toward the northwest at 
around 8 kt, though the initial motion is uncertain due to Ten-E's 
recent formation.  A longitudinally-extended mid-level ridge should 
continue the system's movement toward the northwest or 
west-northwest at a slightly faster forward speed for the next 
couple days.  As Ten-E begins to weaken, it should turn toward the 
west at a slower rate of speed while it gets steered by the 
low-level trades. There is significant along-track spread among 
the guidance. The GFS global model and HAFS-COAMPS hurricane models 
are substantially slower along the track, while the UKMET and ECMWF 
global models are substantially faster.  This forecast is most 
similar to the HFIP corrected consensus technique, which leans a bit 
toward the latter track solutions.
