Tropical Depression Four-E Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042023
200 AM PDT Sat Jul 22 2023
 
The depression lost all of its deep convection several hours ago as 
strong west-southwesterly shear has continued to disrupt the system. 
Recently, a few small cells have formed about 100 miles from the 
center.  The initial intensity is held at 30 kt for this advisory 
based on a blend of subjective satellite estimates and an offset 
ASCAT-C pass containing several 20-25 kt observations.  However, it 
seems likely the depression will degenerate into a remnant low later 
today.

The cyclone is moving west-northwestward at 13 kt. This general 
motion should continue due to the steering flow from a mid-level 
ridge to the north and northwest of the depression.  The NHC 
forecast has been updated with minor adjustments to the north of 
the previous advisory and lies close to, though a little faster 
than, the various consensus aids.
