Post-Tropical Cyclone Four-E Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042023
800 AM PDT Sat Jul 22 2023
 
The depression has been devoid of deep convection near its center 
since yesterday as it continues to deal with strong 
west-southwesterly shear, and drier mid-level air. What little 
convection remains is well displaced from the center.  The Dvorak 
satellite estimate from TAFB was that the system is too weak to 
classify. Given the satellite trends, the depression has degenerated 
into a remnant low with an intensity set at 25 kt.
 
The remnant low is moving west-northwestward at 11 kt. This general
motion should continue due to the steering flow from a low- 
to mid-level ridge to the north and northwest of the system.  
Gradual weakening will continue over the next 24 hours, before the 
system opens up into a trough tomorrow. 

This is the final NHC advisory for this system. For additional 
information on the remnant low, please see the High Seas Forecasts 
issued by the National Weather Service can be found under AWIPS 
header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php
