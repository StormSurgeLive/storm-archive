Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 PM PDT Thu Jul 20 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Southwest of the Southern Baja California Peninsula (EP95):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure <br/>
located several hundred miles southwest of the southern tip of the <br/>
Baja California peninsula have increased in coverage and become <br/>
better organized.  If current trends continue, a short-lived <br/>
tropical depression or tropical storm is likely to form while it <br/>
moves west-northwestward at about 15 mph.  By Saturday, further <br/>
development is not expected as the system moves over cooler waters <br/>
and encounters stronger upper-level winds.  <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Four-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042023
200 AM PDT Fri Jul 21 2023
 
Convection associated with an area of low pressure located nearly
1000 miles southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California 
peninsula has noticeably increased since last night.  Earlier 
last-light visible satellite imagery showed a well-defined 
low-level circulation before deep convection formed and persisted 
directly over it.  The system therefore meets the criteria for a 
tropical cyclone, and advisories have been initiated on Tropical 
Depression Four-E. The initial intensity is a conservative 30 kt, 
based on the satellite trends and a subjective satellite intensity 
estimate from TAFB of T2.5.
 
The depression is being sheared by strong upper-level westerly winds 
which are forecast to increase during the next few days.  The system 
is also crossing over a gradient of sea surface temperatures towards 
cooler waters. Given these marginal conditions and global model 
guidance it is likely the depression will be short-lived.  The 
official intensity forecast shows the cyclone gradually weakening, 
becoming a remnant low by 48 h, and dissipating by 60 h.  However, 
some models suggest it could weaken and dissipate sooner.
 
The system is moving west-northwestward at 9 kt.  A ridge centered 
over the southwestern United States should continue to steer the 
depression with this general motion for the next day or so. 
Afterward, the shallow vortex is expected to turn westward in the 
low-level flow.  The NHC track forecast lies near the center of the 
model guidance, which is generally in good agreement, and closest to 
the simple consensus aid, TVCE.
