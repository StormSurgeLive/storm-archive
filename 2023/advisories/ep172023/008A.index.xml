WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has issued a Tropical Storm Watch for Las 
Islas Marias.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Baja California peninsula from Todos Santos to Los Barriles

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Las Islas Marias
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area. A watch is typically issued 48 hours before
the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds,
conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous.

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Baja California Sur and along the west coast
of mainland Mexico should monitor the progress of Norma. Additional
watches or warnings could be required later today or tonight.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 PM MDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Norma was located
near latitude 17.3 North, longitude 108.0 West. Norma is moving
toward the north near 7 mph (11 km/h). A northward to
north-northwestward motion at a similar forward speed is expected
for the next couple of days. A slower northward to northeastward
motion is forecast over the weekend. On the forecast track, Norma is
forecast to approach the southern portion of Baja California on
Friday night and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts. Norma is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Small intensity fluctuations are possible
today, followed by gradual weakening beginning Friday and continuing
into the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150
miles (240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter dropsonde data is 941 mb (27.79 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Norma can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are possible within
the watch area in Baja California Sur by early Saturday. Tropical 
storm conditions are possible in Las Islas Marias Friday and Friday 
night.
 
RAINFALL: Norma is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10
inches with local maxima of 15 inches through Sunday across the far
southern portion of the Mexican state of Baja California Sur. These
rains will likely produce flash and urban flooding, along with
possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Norma are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur, and will spread 
northward along the coast of western Mexico during the next couple
of days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM MDT.

<title>Hurricane Norma Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Hurricane Norma Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172023
900 AM MDT Thu Oct 19 2023
 
Norma has continued to show signs of strengthening this morning. The
15 to 20 n-mi-wide eye of the hurricane is surrounded by a thick
ring of convective cloud tops colder than -70 to -75C. The initial
intensity is raised to 115 kt based on consensus T6.0/115 kt
subjective Dvorak classifications from TAFB and SAB. The Air Force
Hurricane Hunters are scheduled to investigate Norma later today.
 
The eye of Norma has deviated right of track during the past 6-12 h,
and the longer-term motion is nearly due north (360/6 kt). The
track forecast remains challenging. Even in the near term, there is
significant spread among the various models, likely related to
differences in the steering flow based on the vertical depth of the
cyclone. Given recent trends, the NHC forecast has been adjusted to
the right of the previous one through 60 h, bringing it just east of
the multi-model consensus aids and favoring the stronger GFS and
regional hurricane models. Thereafter, it remains unclear whether
Norma will turn northeastward and approach the west coast of
mainland Mexico, or stall and meander to the south of the Baja
California peninsula. The official forecast continues to show Norma
moving toward mainland Mexico beyond 60 h, albeit slower than some
of the stronger model guidance (GFS, HAFS) with a deeper vortex.
Once again, confidence is low and future track and/or speed
adjustments could be required.
 
Recent satellite images and model shear analyses suggest that 
southerly shear is increasing over Norma and will continue to do 
so over the next couple of days. Therefore, the hurricane is likely 
near its peak intensity, although some small fluctuations cannot be 
ruled out today. By Friday, weakening is expected as Norma likely 
becomes more tilted by the shear and moves into a drier and more 
stable environment. Still, Norma could be at or near hurricane 
strength when it makes its closest approach to the southern tip of 
Baja California, where a Hurricane Watch is in effect. Beyond 72 h, 
the intensity forecast is more uncertain and highly dependent on 
Norma's track, structure, and the extent (if any) of land 
interaction with the Baja peninsula. If Norma moves faster than 
forecast, it could reach the west coast of mainland Mexico as a 
stronger storm. Given the track uncertainty described above, 
interests there are encouraged to closely monitor forecast updates.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Norma is expected to be at or near hurricane strength as it
approaches the southern tip of Baja California, and a hurricane
watch has been issued for that area.
 
2. Heavy rains from Norma will begin to impact the far southern
portions of California Baja Sur on late Friday, continuing through
Sunday. This rainfall may produce flash and urban flooding, along
with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
