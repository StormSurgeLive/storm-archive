None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Santa Fe to San Evaristo
* Huatabampito to Mazatlan
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests elsewhere in Baja California Sur and along the west coast
of mainland Mexico should monitor the progress of Norma.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Norma was
located near latitude 24.7 North, longitude 109.6 West. Norma is
moving toward the north-northeast near 5 mph (7 km/h).  A
northeastward motion is expected to begin later this morning,
followed by a turn toward the east-northeast later today and
tonight. On the forecast track, the center of Norma is forecast to
approach the west coast of mainland Mexico today and move inland
within the tropical storm warning area tonight or early Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast today, and Norma is
expected to approach the west coast of mainland Mexico as a tropical
storm. Rapid weakening is anticipated once Norma moves inland over
mainland Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.24 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Norma can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are ongoing within portions of the
tropical storm warning area in Baja California Sur. Tropical storm
conditions are expected to spread onshore along portions of the
warning area along the west coast of mainland Mexico through
tonight.
 
RAINFALL:  Norma will produce rainfall totals of 6 to 12 inches with
maxima of 18 inches across the southern portion of Baja California
Sur through today and through Sinaloa into Monday.  These rains
will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas
of higher terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  Coastal flooding along the coast of Baja California
Sur should gradually subside today. Coastal flooding is possible
along the west coast of mainland Mexico within the tropical storm
warning area. Near the coast, the coastal flooding will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Norma will continue to affect the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur for
the next day or two. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1200 PM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 300 PM MDT.

Tropical Storm Norma Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172023
900 AM MDT Sun Oct 22 2023
 
Bursts of deep convection have been wrapping around the northern
portion of Norma's center overnight and into the morning.  Microwave
satellite imagery from an AMSR2 0931 UTC pass also showed a decent
curved band around the northern side of the circulation.  The
initial intensity is held at 50 kt based on the previous cycle's
satellite wind data and is similar to the subjective Dvorak current
intensity estimates of T3.0/45 kt from TAFB and SAB.  Norma is
expected to maintain its intensity for the next 12 h or so.  After
the storm moves inland over mainland Mexico, rapid weakening and
dissipation over the high terrain is predicted to occur within a day
or so.
 
Norma is still moving north-northeastward at about 4 kt.  The most 
recent model guidance suggests Norma will make a turn to the 
northeast shortly as the storm crosses the Gulf of California. There 
remains a fairly large spread in the track guidance, with the GFS on 
the southern side and ECMWF on the northern side of the envelope.  
The latest NHC track forecast has shifted northward by about 15 n mi 
from the previous advisory, likely due to the recent 
north-northeastward motion.  Regardless of the exact landfall 
location of the center, heavy rainfall and gusty winds are expected 
to spread along the coast of the Mexican state of Sinaola and inland 
through tonight and into tomorrow morning.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Norma will continue to impact Sinaloa into
Monday. Rainfall will continue to diminish across the southern
portions of Baja California Sur early this morning.  This rainfall
will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas
of higher terrain.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions will continue through this afternoon
within portions of the Tropical Storm Warning area over the southern
Baja California peninsula.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread onshore along
portions of the west coast of mainland Mexico within the Tropical
Storm Warning area through tonight.
