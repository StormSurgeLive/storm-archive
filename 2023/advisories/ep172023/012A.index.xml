<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Norma, located a couple of hundred miles south of Cabo San Lucas, <br/>
Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico (EP91):<br/>
Visible satellite imagery shows the circulation associated with a <br/>
broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles south of <br/>
the Gulf of Tehuantepec has become better defined. The system is <br/>
currently producing limited shower and thunderstorm activity well to <br/>
the west of its center due to strong upper-level winds, but <br/>
environmental conditions are expected to become more conducive for <br/>
development over the next couple of days. A tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form later this weekend or early next week. The system is <br/>
forecast to meander during the next couple of days and then drift <br/>
generally northward late this weekend and into early next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 PM MDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Norma was located
near latitude 19.7 North, longitude 109.5 West. Norma is moving
toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A
north-northwestward to northward motion is forecast through
Saturday, followed by a turn toward the northeast on Sunday. On the
forecast track, Norma is expected to approach the southern portion
of Baja California Sur tonight and move near or over the area on
Saturday. Norma is forecast to move toward the west coast of
mainland Mexico on Sunday and Sunday night.
 
Data from the Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters indicate that 
maximum sustained winds are near 110 mph (175 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Gradual weakening is expected during the next few days, but 
Norma is forecast to be a hurricane when it moves near or over the 
southern portion of Baja California Sur.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175
miles (280 km). An automated weather station on Socorro Island 
recently reported a sustained wind of 31 mph (50 km/h) and a gust 
to 47 mph (76 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on aircraft data is 
963 mb (28.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Norma can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area in Baja California Sur on Saturday, with tropical
storm conditions beginning late tonight. Tropical storm conditions
are expected in the tropical storm warning areas in Baja California
Sur on Saturday. Tropical storm conditions are possible in Las
Islas Marias today and tonight, and in the watch area along the
west coast of Mexico by Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  Norma is likely to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10
inches with local maxima of 15 inches across the far southern
portion of Baja California Sur through Sunday and across portions of
Sinaloa through Monday. These rains will likely produce flash and
urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher
terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge could produce coastal flooding in areas
of onshore winds within the hurricane warning area. Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Norma are affecting portions of the coast 
of southwestern and west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur. 
These swells will spread northward along the coast of western Mexico 
and the Baja California peninsula this weekend. These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. 
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 300 PM MDT.

Hurricane Norma Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172023
900 AM MDT Fri Oct 20 2023
 
The center of Norma is embedded underneath a cold central dense 
overcast this morning. The GOES-West derived motion winds and 
satellite images show healthy upper-level outflow to the north, but 
moderate shear continues to impinge on the south side of the 
hurricane. Recent SSMIS passive microwave images show a ragged 
mid-level eyewall structure, with a thinner ring of convection noted 
on the south and west sides of the inner core. The objective and 
subjective satellite intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS, TAFB, and 
SAB have decreased this morning, and the initial intensity is 
lowered to 95 kt based on a blend of these data. An Air Force 
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate Norma 
later today.
 
Norma is moving north-northwestward (335 degrees) at 7 kt. A gradual 
turn toward the north is expected through Saturday while Norma moves 
within the flow between a mid-level ridge to its east and a mid- to 
upper-level trough to its northwest. This will bring the center of 
Norma near or over the southern tip of Baja California Sur between 
24-36 h. From there, a turn toward the northeast with a slower 
forward speed is forecast as Norma approaches the west-central coast 
of Mexico. The overall track guidance envelope has shifted slightly 
westward this cycle. The updated NHC forecast from 24-72 h has been 
nudged in that direction, generally between the simple (TVCE) and 
corrected (HCCA) consensus aids. This track shows Norma reaching the 
west coast of Mexico on Sunday night and dissipating early next 
week. There are still pronounced speed differences between the 
global and regional models regarding when Norma reaches the coast of 
mainland Mexico, so further adjustments could be required. 
 
Although Norma remains over very warm SSTs, it is moving into a more 
hostile environment. Drier mid-level air and increasing 
southwesterly shear will likely cause continued weakening during the 
next few days. Still, Norma is expected to be a hurricane when it 
moves near or over the southern portion of Baja California Sur on 
Saturday within the Hurricane Warning area. The continued shear and 
potential land interaction with the Baja peninsula will likely cause 
Norma to weaken to a tropical storm on Sunday while it approaches 
the west coast of Mexico. Based on the threat of tropical storm 
conditions there, the government of Mexico has issued a Tropical 
Storm Watch for a portion of the west coast.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Norma is expected to bring hurricane conditions to the far
southern portion of the Baja California peninsula within the
hurricane warning area on Saturday.
 
2. Heavy rains from Norma will begin to impact the far southern
portions of Baja California Sur later today and continue through
Sunday, with heavy rains reaching Sinaloa on Saturday. This rainfall
may produce flash and urban flooding, along with possible mudslides
in areas of higher terrain.
 
3. Norma is forecast to approach the west coast of Mexico as a
tropical storm on Sunday and Sunday night, and a Tropical Storm
Watch has been issued for a portion of that area.
