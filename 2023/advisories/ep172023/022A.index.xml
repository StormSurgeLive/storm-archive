WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Huatabampito to Mazatlan
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 AM MDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Norma was 
located near latitude 24.6 North, longitude 108.8 West. Norma has 
moved southeastward during the past several hours, but an eastward 
motion near 5 mph (7 km/h) is expected to resume later this morning. 
On the forecast track, the center of Norma is forecast to approach 
the west coast of mainland Mexico overnight and move inland within 
the tropical storm warning area later this morning.
 
Recently received satellite wind data indicate that the maximum 
sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Norma is expected to move over the west coast of mainland 
Mexico as a tropical storm later this morning. Rapid weakening is 
anticipated once Norma moves inland over mainland Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Norma can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are ongoing within portions of the
tropical storm warning area.
 
RAINFALL:  Norma will produce additional rainfall totals of 4 to 6 
inches with storm total maxima of 18 inches in and near Sinaloa 
through today.  These rains will produce flash and urban flooding, 
along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  Coastal flooding is possible along the west coast of 
mainland Mexico within the tropical storm warning area. Near the 
coast, the coastal flooding will be accompanied by large and 
dangerous waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Norma will continue to affect the coast 
of southwestern and west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur for 
the next day or two. These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM MDT.

Tropical Storm Norma Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172023
900 PM MDT Sun Oct 22 2023

The center of Norma is exposed tonight with all of the deep 
convection displaced well northeast of the center.  The initial wind 
speed is lowered to 50 kt, in accordance with Dvorak estimates 
assuming some weakening from earlier scatterometer data.  While the 
global models re-develop some deep convection overnight near the 
center over the warm Gulf of California waters, strong shear is 
expected to cause Norma to weaken as it approaches mainland Mexico.  
Norma is forecast to continue to move slowly east-northeastward 
through landfall early Monday, then rapidly weaken and dissipate as 
a tropical cyclone over the elevated terrain in less than 24 hours. 
Only a slight southward adjustment was made to the track forecast. 
Heavy rains causing flash floods and mudslides are expected to be 
the main hazards with Norma.

Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Norma will continue to impact locations 
in and near Sinaloa into Monday.  This rainfall will produce flash 
and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions will continue along portions of the
west coast of mainland Mexico within the Tropical Storm Warning area
through tonight.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Otis was

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some slow strengthening is forecast during the next 72 hours. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Heavy rainfall may impact coastal areas of southern

Tropical Storm Otis Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP182023
1000 PM CDT Sun Oct 22 2023

Convection has been pulsing in the northwestern quadrant of Otis 
during the past several hours, with less overall convective 
activity than this afternoon.  Microwave data and ship reports 
suggests the center is southeast of the main area of deep 
convection.  The initial wind speed is kept at 35 kt, in line with 
recent Dvorak T-number estimates.  
 
Otis appears to be moving north-northwest at about 4 kt.  The 
biggest change to report on this advisory is that there's been a 
notable northwest shift in the NHC track forecast.  The synoptic 
pattern of a trough over northwestern Mexico and a ridge over the 
northwestern Caribbean would seem to favor a slow north-northwest 
track for the next few days.  Much of the GFS-based guidance, 
however, appears to be too intertwined with the Intertropical 
Convergence Zone, resulting in many of the aids not showing enough 
motion during the next few days or even a track southward.  
This doesn't seem realistic, and I've adjusted the forecast a large 
distance to the northwest, with further northwest track changes 
possible on later forecasts.  

The storm will likely be in an environment of light-to-moderate 
shear, with fairly high mid-level humidity over very warm water.  
These conditions should promote gradual strengthening, which is 
shown to begin after 12 hours to give the system some time to 
re-align vertically.  An increase in shear and possible land 
interaction is forecast to cause Otis to level off in intensity 
around midweek. This NHC intensity prediction is near the higher 
end of the guidance, closer to the statistical guidance than the 
dynamical models, the latter of which seem to be too low given the 
large-scale environment.
