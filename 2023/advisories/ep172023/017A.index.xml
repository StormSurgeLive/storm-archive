<br/>
South of Southern Mexico (EP91):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles south of <br/>

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Baja California Sur and along the west coast
of mainland Mexico should monitor the progress of Norma.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM MDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Norma was 
located near latitude 23.3 North, longitude 109.8 West. Norma is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 6 mph (9 km/h). This general 
motion should continue through tonight, followed by a turn toward 
the northeast and east-northeast on Sunday and Sunday night. On the 
forecast track, the center of Norma is expected to continue moving 
across the southern portion of Baja California Sur tonight. Norma is 
forecast to move toward the west coast of mainland Mexico on Sunday 
and move inland within the tropical storm warning area on Sunday 
night or early Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h)
with higher gusts. Continued weakening is expected during the next
couple of days, and Norma is expected to approach the west coast of
mainland Mexico as a tropical storm.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 986 mb (29.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Norma can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring within the tropical 
storm warning areas in Baja California Sur. Tropical storm 
conditions are expected in the warning area along the west coast of 
Mexico by early Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  Norma will produce rainfall totals of 6 to 12 inches with
maxima of 18 inches across the southern portion of Baja California
Sur through Sunday and across much of Sinaloa through Monday. These
rains will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in
areas of higher terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal 
flooding in areas of onshore winds within the tropical storm warning 
area in Baja California Sur. Near the coast, the surge will be 
accompanied by large and destructive waves. Coastal flooding is 
possible along the west coast of mainland Mexico within the tropical 
storm warning area.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Norma will continue to affect the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur for
the next couple of days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 900 PM MDT.

Hurricane Norma Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172023
300 PM MDT Sat Oct 21 2023
 
Norma made landfall along the southern tip of the Baja California 
peninsula just west-northwest of Cabo San Lucas around 2015 UTC with 
estimated maximum winds of 70 kt. The center of the tropical cyclone 
has become exposed this afternoon, as increasing southerly shear 
stripped away the associated deep convection. An Air Force Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft sampled Norma shortly before landfall and found 
hurricane-force SFMR winds in the northwest quadrant, with a peak of 
73 kt. A center dropsonde supported a minimum pressure of around 974 
mb. Assuming some continued weakening since the plane departed, the 
landfall and advisory intensity is set at 70 kt.
 
With Norma becoming a more shallow vortex, it has slowed down and 
turned north-northeastward (15 degrees/5 kt). The cyclone will move 
across the southern portion of Baja California Sur through tonight, 
with continued weakening expected due to the negative influences of 
increasing shear, drier air, and land interaction. Norma should 
emerge over the southern Gulf of California as a tropical storm 
early Sunday, then move northeastward and make landfall along the 
coast of Sinaloa in western Mexico within the tropical storm warning 
area. The updated NHC track forecast has been nudged slightly north 
of the previous prediction, in agreement with the latest multi-model 
consensus aids. Once Norma moves inland, it will quickly dissipate 
over the rugged terrain of western Mexico.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Norma will continue to impact southern portions
of Baja California Sur through Sunday, and through Sinaloa into
Monday. This rainfall will produce flash and urban flooding, along
with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
2. Hurricane conditions will continue for the next few hours within
the Hurricane Warning area over the far southern Baja California
peninsula.
 
3. Norma is forecast to bring tropical storm conditions to portions
of the west coast of Mexico within the Tropical Storm Warning area
beginning early Sunday.
