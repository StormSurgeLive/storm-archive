BAJA CALIFORNIA SUR THROUGH SUNDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 600 PM MDT...0000 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.9N 108.0W
ABOUT 255 MI...410 KM WSW OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
ABOUT 365 MI...590 KM SSE OF CABO SAN LUCAS MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...120 MPH...195 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 360 DEGREES AT 6 MPH...9 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Baja California Sur from Todos Santos to Los Barriles
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* North of Los Barriles to La Paz
* North of Todos Santos to Santa Fe
* Las Islas Marias
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected 
somewhere within the warning area. A warning is typically issued 36 
hours before the anticipated first occurrence of 
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside 
preparations difficult or dangerous. Preparations to protect life 
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Baja California Sur and along the west coast
of mainland Mexico should monitor the progress of Norma. Additional
watches or warnings could be required tonight or on Friday.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM MDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Norma was located
near latitude 17.9 North, longitude 108.0 West. Norma is moving
toward the north near 6 mph (9 km/h). A turn to the north-northwest
at a similar forward speed is expected during the next couple of
days. A slower northward to northeastward motion is forecast later
this weekend. On the forecast track, Norma is forecast to approach
the southern portion of Baja California on Friday night and
Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Norma is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some weakening is expected during the next 
few days, but Norma is forecast to be a hurricane when it moves 
near the southern portion of Baja California.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150
miles (240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 944 mb (27.88 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Norma can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the warning area in
Baja California Sur by early Saturday, with tropical storm
conditions beginning late Friday night.  Tropical storm conditions
are possible in Las Islas Marias Friday and Friday night, and in the
watch areas in Baja California Sur on Saturday.
 
RAINFALL:  Norma is likely to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10
inches with local maxima of 15 inches through Sunday across the far
southern portion of California Baja Sur.  These rains will likely
produce flash and urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in
areas of higher terrain.

STORM SURGE:  A storm surge could produce coastal flooding in areas 
of onshore winds within the hurricane warning area.  Near the 
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Norma are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur, and will spread
northward along the coast of western Mexico and the Baja California
peninsula during the next couple of days.  These swells are likely 
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM MDT.

Hurricane Norma Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172023
300 PM MDT Thu Oct 19 2023
 
The satellite presentation of Norma has deteriorated since the last 
advisory. The eye has become less defined, and the inner core 
convection has become more asymmetric. The Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunters that investigated Norma reported that the eyewall 
was open to the southeast during their final pass through the 
center. Still, the aircraft data confirm that Norma is a major 
hurricane. The Hurricane Hunters reported peak 700-mb flight-level 
winds of 111 kt, with SFMR retrievals as high as 102 kt. The minimum 
pressure from a recent center dropsonde was 945 mb with 12-kt winds. 
The initial intensity is lowered to 110 kt for this advisory, which 
could be a bit generous based on the recent aircraft data.

Based on recent satellite trends, it is likely that Norma has 
reached its peak intensity. An increase in southerly shear will 
likely cause Norma to become more vertically tilted during the next 
couple of days, while the hurricane moves into a drier and more 
stable environment as diagnosed from the SHIPS guidance. Therefore, 
weakening is forecast beginning tonight and continuing through the 
weekend and into early next week. Still, Norma is forecast to be a 
hurricane when it moves near or over the southern tip of the Baja 
California peninsula, and the government of Mexico has issued a 
Hurricane Warning for this area based on the increased risk of 
hurricane conditions. 
 
The eye of Norma has wobbled some today, but the long-term motion 
remains northward (350/5 kt). A turn toward the north-northwest is 
expected during the next couple of days while Norma approaches the 
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. There are still speed 
differences in the various global and regional models, likely 
related to differences in the steering flow based on the vertical 
depth of the cyclone. The GFS and regional models suggest Norma will 
remain a deeper cyclone and move toward the west coast of mainland 
Mexico in 48-72 h. The 12z ECMWF, Canadian, and UKMET runs show 
Norma making it farther north than previous runs, but still stalling 
near the southern tip of Baja before moving inland over western 
Mexico early next week. The updated NHC track forecast has been 
nudged westward and is faster this cycle, which generally keeps it 
between the HCCA and TVCE aids. This update shows Norma inland by 96 
h and dissipated over western Mexico by day 5, but this could occur 
sooner than forecast if the GFS and regional hurricane models are 
correct. Interests in western Mexico should monitor the latest 
forecast updates, as future track and/or speed adjustments could be 
required.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. A Hurricane Warning is in effect for the far southern portion of 
the Baja California peninsula, where Norma is expected to bring 
hurricane conditions on Saturday when it passes near or over the 
area.
 
2. Heavy rains from Norma will begin to impact the far southern 
portions of California Baja Sur on late Friday, continuing through 
Sunday. This rainfall may produce flash and urban flooding, along 
with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
