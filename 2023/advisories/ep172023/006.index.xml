<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on strengthening <br/>
Hurricane Norma, located several hundred miles south-southeast of <br/>
Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico (EP91):<br/>
A weak area of low pressure located several hundred miles south of <br/>
the Gulf of Tehuantepec is producing a few disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms. Any development of this system during the next couple <br/>
of days is expected to be slow to occur. However, environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to become more favorable for development <br/>
thereafter, and a tropical depression is likely to form over the <br/>
weekend or early next week. The disturbance is forecast to meander <br/>
for the next several days and then drift northward or northwestward <br/>

...NORMA CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM MDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.4N 108.0W
ABOUT 300 MI...485 KM SW OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
ABOUT 465 MI...750 KM SSE OF CABO SAN LUCAS MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 350 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...975 MB...28.80 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Baja California Sur should monitor the progress of
Norma. Watches could be required for portions of the area tonight
or on Thursday.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM MDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Norma was located 
near latitude 16.4 North, longitude 108.0 West. Norma is moving 
toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h). A northward to 
north-northwestward motion at a similar forward speed is anticipated 
for the next couple of days. A slower motion is forecast is expected 
by the weekend. On the forecast track, Norma could approach the 
southern portion of Baja California on Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 90 mph (150 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is expected tonight. 
Slight weakening is forecast to begin late this week or over the 
weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 975 mb (28.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Norma can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Norma are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico, and will spread northward along the coast of
western Mexico and toward Baja California Sur during the next couple
of days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM MDT.

Hurricane Norma Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172023
900 PM MDT Wed Oct 18 2023
 
Norma's rapid intensification continues. Microwave imagery from late 
this afternoon indicated that a very well-defined low- to mid-level 
eye has formed with a surrounding ring of shallow to moderate 
convection associated with rapid intensification. While that eye is 
not yet visible in conventional satellite imagery, subjective 
Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB have increased to 77 kt and 90 
kt, respectively, while recent objective evaluations from UW-CIMSS 
range from about 75 kt to 85 kt. Based on the whole of the data, 
the intensity for Norma has been raised to 80 kt.
 
For the next 24 to 36 hours, the forecast for Norma appears to be 
relatively straightforward. Continued rapid strengthening appears 
likely tonight based on Norma's convective structure and the 
conducive surrounding environment. The hurricane should continue 
moving generally northward during that time, steered by a weak 
mid-level ridge to the east of Norma and an upper-level trough to 
its northwest. Short-term fluctuations in intensity due to eyewall 
replacement cycles will become possible starting tonight, but 
confidence in the forecast is reasonably high through 36 h.
 
After that time, the uncertainty grows considerably. Southwesterly 
upper-level flow associated with the aforementioned upper-level 
trough will continue, but the mid- to lower-level steering will 
likely become light or even switch to northerly. The resulting 
increase in shear should cause Norma to weaken, but the rate of that 
weakening remains in doubt. As long as the hurricane retains its 
vertical depth, upper-level flow should keep it moving northward. 
However, once Norma weakens to the point that its steering is 
dominated by low- to mid-level flow, its forward speed should slow 
down considerably. It is possible, therefore, that Norma will stall 
just south of Baja California peninsula, a solution favored by the 
deterministic ECMWF and a number of its ensemble members. However, 
the hurricane models (HAFS-A/B, HMON, and HWRF), which should 
resolve the structure of Norma better than a global model, all 
indicate that the hurricane will retain its depth long enough to 
reach the Baja California peninsula. The NHC track and intensity 
forecasts favor the regional models, blending their latest consensus 
with the previous forecast to try to maintain continuity. The 
updated official track forecast is slightly faster than the previous 
one, but is generally similar despite the high uncertainty.

Tropical storm or hurricane watches could be required for portions 
of the Baja California peninsula later tonight, and interests there 
should continue to monitor updates on Norma, especially since 
larger-than-normal changes to the forecast are possible due to the 
high uncertainty in this case.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Norma is forecast to continue rapidly strengthening tonight
while it passes well offshore of southwestern Mexico.
 
2. There is a greater than normal uncertainty in the track and
intensity forecasts for Norma later this week and this weekend when
it is expected to approach the Baja California peninsula and
western Mexico. Regardless of Norma's exact track or intensity,
there is an increasing threat of wind and rainfall impacts to
southern portions of Baja California Sur by Saturday, and watches
could be required there later tonight or on Thursday.
