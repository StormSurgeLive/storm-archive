<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
downgraded Tropical Storm Norma, located over the southern tip of <br/>
the Baja California peninsula, north of Cabo San Lucas.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico (EP91):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles south of <br/>
the Gulf of Tehuantepec continues to produce a large area of shower <br/>
and thunderstorm activity. The upper-level winds are expected to <br/>
become more conducive for development of this system during the next <br/>
couple of days, and a tropical depression is likely to form by early <br/>
next week. The system is forecast to meander or drift generally <br/>
northward through early next week.<br/>

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests elsewhere in Baja California Sur and along the west coast
of mainland Mexico should monitor the progress of Norma.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM MDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Norma was
located near latitude 23.5 North, longitude 109.7 West. Norma is
moving toward the north-northeast near 6 mph (9 km/h). This general
motion should continue through tonight, followed by a turn toward
the northeast and east-northeast on Sunday and Sunday night. On the
forecast track, the center of Norma is expected to continue moving
across the southern portion of Baja California Sur tonight. Norma is
forecast to move toward the west coast of mainland Mexico on Sunday
and move inland within the tropical storm warning area on Sunday
night or early Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph (100 km/h)
with higher gusts. Continued weakening is expected during the next
couple of days, and Norma is expected to approach the west coast of
mainland Mexico as a tropical storm.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 989 mb (29.21 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Norma can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are ongoing within the tropical
storm warning areas in Baja California Sur. Tropical storm
conditions are expected in the warning area along the west coast of
mainland Mexico by early Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  Norma will produce rainfall totals of 6 to 12 inches with
maxima of 18 inches across the southern portion of Baja California
Sur through Sunday and through Sinaloa into Monday.  These rains
will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas
of higher terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal
flooding in areas of onshore winds within the tropical storm warning
area in Baja California Sur. Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves. Coastal flooding is
possible along the west coast of mainland Mexico within the tropical
storm warning area.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Norma will continue to affect the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur for
the next couple of days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1200 AM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 300 AM MDT.

Tropical Storm Norma Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172023
900 PM MDT Sat Oct 21 2023
 
Norma continues to move across the southern portion of the Baja 
California peninsula this evening. The satellite depiction of the 
ill-defined low-level center has been difficult to track through the 
terrain as the system has decoupled from the mid-level center. 
Infrared satellite imagery indicates that there continues to be 
bursts of convection on the northwest side. The land interaction, 
increasingly southerly shear and dry air is causing Norma to weaken. 
Subjective and objective Dvorak estimates for this advisory range 
from 55 to 60 kt. Given the current satellite depiction and the 
satellite intensity estimates, the initial intensity for this 
advisory is set to 55 kt.
 
The tropical storm is moving north-northeastward or 30 degrees at 
5 kt. The system will move across the southern portion of Baja 
California Sur through tonight. Norma should emerge over the 
southern Gulf of California early Sunday, then move northeastward to 
east-northeastward and make landfall along the coast of Sinaloa in 
western Mexico within the tropical storm warning area. The updated 
NHC track forecast is similar to the previous, and lies between 
the simple and corrected consensus aids.
 
Norma is expected to continue weakening due to the aforementioned 
vertical wind shear, drier air, and land interaction. Once Norma 
moves inland over mainland Mexico, it will quickly dissipate over 
the high terrain. The intensity forecast is similar to the 
previous advisory. The official forecast shows a 48 hour remnant 
low point for continuity, however it is possible that the system 
could be dissipated by that time.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Norma will continue to impact southern portions
of Baja California Sur through Sunday, and through Sinaloa into
Monday.  This rainfall will produce flash and urban flooding, along
with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions will continue through tonight within
the Tropical Storm Warning area over the southern Baja California
peninsula.
 
3. Norma is forecast to bring tropical storm conditions to portions 
of the west coast of mainland Mexico within the Tropical Storm 
Warning area beginning early Sunday.
