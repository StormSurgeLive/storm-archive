DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM MDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Norma was 
located near latitude 23.3 North, longitude 109.8 West. Norma is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 6 mph (9 km/h). This general 
motion should continue through tonight, followed by a turn toward 
the northeast and east-northeast on Sunday and Sunday night. On the 
forecast track, the center of Norma is expected to continue moving 
across the southern portion of Baja California Sur tonight. Norma is 
forecast to move toward the west coast of mainland Mexico on Sunday 
and move inland within the tropical storm warning area on Sunday 
night or early Monday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h)
with higher gusts. Continued weakening is expected during the next
couple of days, and Norma is expected to approach the west coast of
mainland Mexico as a tropical storm.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 986 mb (29.12 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Norma can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring within the tropical 
storm warning areas in Baja California Sur. Tropical storm 
conditions are expected in the warning area along the west coast of 
Mexico by early Sunday.

RAINFALL:  Norma will produce rainfall totals of 6 to 12 inches with
maxima of 18 inches across the southern portion of Baja California
Sur through Sunday and across much of Sinaloa through Monday. These
rains will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in
areas of higher terrain.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal 
flooding in areas of onshore winds within the tropical storm warning 
area in Baja California Sur. Near the coast, the surge will be 
accompanied by large and destructive waves. Coastal flooding is 
possible along the west coast of mainland Mexico within the tropical 
storm warning area.

SURF:  Swells generated by Norma will continue to affect the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur for
the next couple of days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
