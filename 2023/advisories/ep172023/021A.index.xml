--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

None
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Cabo San Lucas to San Evaristo
* Huatabampito to Mazatlan
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests elsewhere along the west coast of mainland Mexico should
monitor the progress of Norma.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM MDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Norma was
located near latitude 24.9 North, longitude 109.2 West. Norma is
moving toward the northeast near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A turn toward the
east-northeast is expected tonight. On the forecast track, the 
center of Norma is forecast to approach the west coast of mainland 
Mexico today and move inland within the tropical storm warning area 
early Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast today, and Norma is
expected to move over the west coast of mainland Mexico as a
tropical storm early Monday. Rapid weakening is anticipated once 
Norma moves inland over mainland Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 155 miles (250 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Norma can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are ongoing within portions of the
tropical storm warning area in Baja California Sur and mainland
Mexico.
 
RAINFALL:  Norma will produce rainfall totals of 6 to 12 inches with
maxima of 18 inches across Sinaloa into Monday.  These rains will
produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of
higher terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  Coastal flooding along the coast of Baja California
Sur should gradually subside today. Coastal flooding is possible
along the west coast of mainland Mexico within the tropical storm
warning area. Near the coast, the coastal flooding will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Norma will continue to affect the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur for
the next day or two. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM MDT.

Tropical Storm Norma Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172023
300 PM MDT Sun Oct 22 2023
 
Norma continues to have periodic bursts of convection. Despite its 
sheared appearance on visible imagery, recent satellite wind data 
showed that the surface circulation has strengthened slightly.  
Based on these observations, the initial intensity has been raised 
to 55 kt, and the wind radii have been adjusted outward.  Little 
changes in strength is expected in the next 12 h or so before 
landfall.  Norma is forecast to move inland early tomorrow, rapidly 
weaken, and dissipate over elevated terrain in a day or so.
 
Norma has turned northeastward at an estimated 040/3 kt.  A turn to 
the east-northeast is predicted later today as storm approaches 
the coast of mainland Mexico. The track guidance is starting to 
coming into better agreement, and the guidance envelope has shifted 
to the south this cycle. The latest NHC track forecast is nudged 
south as well following the trend.  Regardless of the exact 
landfall location of the center, heavy rainfall and gusty winds 
will continue along the coast of the Mexican state of Sinaloa and 
inland through tonight and into tomorrow morning.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Norma will continue to impact Sinaloa into 
Monday.  This rainfall will produce flash and urban flooding, along 
with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions will continue along portions of the 
west coast of mainland Mexico within the Tropical Storm Warning area 
through tonight.

Tropical Storm Otis Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP182023
400 PM CDT Sun Oct 22 2023

The tropical depression south of Mexico has strengthened into 
Tropical Storm Otis. Satellite imagery shows that the center is just 
east of an increasing area of deep convection that has continued to 
consolidate. With this slight improvement in structure, the initial 
intensity has been raised to 35 kt, which is below the 3.0/45 kt 
Dvorak classifications from TAFB and SAB.
 
Otis is moving northward at 4 kt. A continued slow northward motion 
is expected during the next couple of days as the system moves in a 
light steering flow between a ridge to its northeast and a trough to 
its northwest.  By midweek, the system is expected to weaken as it 
shifts northwestward in the low-level flow. However, by the end of 
the forecast period, there is quite a bit of spread in the track 
guidance making the long-term forecast somewhat uncertain. The NHC 
track forecast is near the various consensus aids and a little to 
the north of the previous one at days 4 and 5.
 
Some slight strengthening is possible during the next couple of days 
while the storm remains in generally conducive environmental 
conditions.  However, beyond that time, an increase in vertical wind 
shear should cause slow weakening, and most of the models show the 
system decoupling or dissipating by the end of the forecast period. 
The NHC intensity forecast lies near the middle of the guidance 
envelope.
