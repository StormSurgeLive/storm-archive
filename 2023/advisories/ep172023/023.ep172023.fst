DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK

At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Norma 
was located near latitude 24.5 North, longitude 108.4 West. The 
depression is moving toward the east near 7 mph (11 km/h) and this 
motion is expected to continue until dissipation occurs later today 
or tonight.  On the forecast track, the center of Norma is forecast 
to move inland along the coast of the Mexican state of Sinaloa later 
this morning. 

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Little change in strength is expected before 
Norma reaches the coast of Mexico.  Weakening and dissipation is 
anticipated once Norma moves inland.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).

RAINFALL:  Rainfall from Norma will diminish across northern

within the state of Sinaloa this morning. 

SURF:  Swells generated by Norma will continue to affect the coast 
of southwestern and west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur for
