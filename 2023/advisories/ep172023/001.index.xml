1100 AM PDT Tue Oct 17 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
South of Southwestern Mexico (EP90):<br/>
Satellite imagery indicates that showers and thunderstorms <br/>
associated with an area of low pressure located a few hundred miles <br/>
offshore of the southwestern coast of Mexico have become better <br/>
organized this morning. If these trends continue, advisories will <br/>
likely be initiated on this system as a tropical depression or <br/>
tropical storm later today. Additional information on this system, <br/>
including gale and storm warnings, can be found in High Seas <br/>
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...near 100 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...near 100 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Guatemala and Southern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure is expected to form south of the coasts of <br/>
Guatemala and southern Mexico in a couple of days. Gradual <br/>
development of the disturbance is expected, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form late this week or over the weekend <br/>
while the system meanders over the far eastern portion of the basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Norma Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172023
300 PM MDT Tue Oct 17 2023
 
Satellite imagery this afternoon depicts that the area the National 
Hurricane Center has been monitoring offshore of the southwestern 
coast of Mexico (EP90) has become better organized. Showers and 
thunderstorms have been consolidating, with curved band features 
developing around a recently well-defined low-level center. 
Subjective Dvorak satellite intensity estimates are T2.5/T3.0 from 
TAFB and SAB, respectively. Given the improved satellite 
presentation and these intensity estimates, advisories are being 
initiated on Tropical Storm Norma with an initial intensity of 35 
kt.

Norma is in a fairly conducive environment for intensification. Low 
vertical wind shear, warm sea surface temperatures, and favorable 
upper-level diffluence will likely lead to steady to rapid 
strengthening for the next few days.  DTOPS and SHIPS rapid 
intensification (RI) indices are between 60 to 70 percent for a 55 
kt increase over the next 48 hours, and the NHC forecast is near 
that value, explicitly forecasting RI between 12 to 36 hours. 
Towards the end of the forecast, increasing vertical wind shear and 
potential drier air intrusions could cause the system to gradually 
weaken. The NHC forecast lies just below the HCCA HFIP corrected 
consensus aids, and it is noted that the HAFS-A/B hurricane regional 
models show a higher, but still plausible, peak intensity.

Norma is moving west-northwestward at an estimated motion of 285/9 
kt. The system is expected to turn more northwestward at a slightly 
slower forward speed during the next few days around the western 
periphery of a mid-level ridge. Towards the end of the forecast 
period as the system moves toward the Baja peninsula, there is a 
notable divergence among the model suite.  A stronger vortex, as 
depicted in the GFS/CMC model, would be picked up by an approaching 
trough from the northwest and move the system northeastward towards 
the Baja peninsula.  However, a weaker vortex would tend to meander 
south of the peninsula and be missed by the approaching trough, 
like the ECMWF/UKMET solutions.  Since the NHC intensity forecast 
is on the strong side of the guidance, the official track is closer 
to the right side of the guidance envelope, more similar to the GFS 
and HCCA models.
