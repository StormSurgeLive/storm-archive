DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 PM MDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Norma was located
near latitude 22.9 North, longitude 110.3 West. Norma is moving
toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h). This general motion should
continue through this evening, followed by a turn toward the
northeast and east-northeast with a reduction in forward speed
tonight through Monday. On the forecast track, the center of Norma
is expected to move over the southern portion of Baja California Sur
within the hurricane warning area today. Norma is forecast to move
toward the west coast of Mexico on Sunday night and move inland
within the tropical storm watch area by early Monday.
 
Data from the Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters indicate that 
maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Continued weakening is expected during the next 
few days, but Norma is expected to remain a hurricane while it moves 
over the southern portion of Baja California Sur.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140
miles (220 km). An observation station in Cabo San Lucas, Baja
California Sur, recently reported a gust of 74 mph (120 km/h).
 
The minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data from the 
aircraft is 977 mb (28.85 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Norma can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are occurring within 
the hurricane and tropical storm warnings areas in Baja California 
Sur. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area 
along the west coast of Mexico by early Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  Norma will produce rainfall totals of 6 to 12 inches with
maxima of 18 inches across the southern portion of Baja California
Sur through Sunday and across much of Sinaloa through Monday. These
rains will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in
areas of higher terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal
flooding in areas of onshore winds within the hurricane warning
area. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves. Coastal flooding is possible along the west coast
of mainland Mexico within the tropical storm warning area.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Norma will continue to affect the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur for
the next couple of days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 300 PM MDT.

<title>Hurricane Norma Forecast Discussion Number 16</title>

Hurricane Norma Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172023
900 AM MDT Sat Oct 21 2023
 
Radar data from Los Cabos, Mexico, show the center of Norma is 
situated just west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas this morning. Surface 
observations indicate that hurricane and tropical storm conditions 
are spreading over southern portions of Baja California Sur within 
the warning areas. Earlier passive microwave images and recent radar 
data indicate convection in the southern portion of Norma's inner 
core has eroded. The hurricane is also vertically tilted due to 
southerly shear, with the low-level center displaced slightly south 
of the mid-level center. These structural changes suggest weakening 
has occurred, which is consistent with the latest subjective and 
objective intensity estimates from TAFB, SAB, and UW-CIMSS. Based on 
the blend of those estimates, the initial intensity is lowered to 85 
kt for this advisory.
 
Norma is moving just west of due north (355/7 kt) this morning. The
hurricane is expected to make landfall in the hurricane warning area
this afternoon, cross the southern portion of Baja California Sur
tonight, and emerge over the southern Gulf of California on Sunday.
Then, the weakening cyclone should turn toward the northeast and
east-northeast and slowly approach the coast of Sinaloa in western
Mexico on Sunday night into early Monday. The updated NHC track
forecast shows a slightly more gradual turn in the near term and
lies slightly west of the previous one. Norma is forecast to move
inland by early Monday and dissipate over the rugged terrain of
western Mexico by Tuesday.
 
Less favorable environmental conditions (increasing southwesterly
shear and reduced mid-level moisture) and land interaction with the
Baja California peninsula should cause Norma to continue weakening
during the next couple of days. This is consistent with the
deteriorating satellite structure of Norma and supported by all of
the latest dynamical and statistical guidance. The updated NHC
forecast is lower than the previous advisory, following the
multi-model consensus trends, but lies on the higher end of the
guidance envelope. Norma is still forecast to reach the west coast
of Mexico by early Monday as a tropical storm.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Norma is expected to bring life-threatening hurricane conditions
and a dangerous storm surge to portions of the far southern Baja
California peninsula within the hurricane warning area today and
tonight.
 
2. Heavy rains from Norma will continue to impact southern portions
of Baja California Sur through Sunday, with heavy rains reaching
Sinaloa later today, continuing through Monday. This rainfall will
produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of
higher terrain.
 
3. Norma is forecast to approach the west coast of Mexico as a
tropical storm on Sunday night and Monday, and a Tropical Storm
Warning is in effect for a portion of that area.
