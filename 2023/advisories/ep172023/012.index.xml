CALIFORNIA SUR DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS...
...TROPICAL STORM WATCH ISSUED FOR A PORTION OF THE WEST COAST OF
MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM MDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.4N 109.2W

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has extended the Tropical Storm Warning
from La Paz northward to San Evaristo along the east coast of the
Baja California peninsula. The government of Mexico has also issued
a Tropical Storm Watch for the west coast of mainland Mexico from
Topolobampo to Bahia Tempehuaya.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Baja California Sur from Todos Santos to Los Barriles
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* North of Los Barriles to San Evaristo
* North of Todos Santos to Santa Fe
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Las Islas Marias
* Topolobampo to Bahia Tempehuaya
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area. A warning is typically issued 36
hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous. Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Baja California Sur and along the west coast
of mainland Mexico should monitor the progress of Norma. Additional
watches or warnings could be required later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Norma was located 
near latitude 19.4 North, longitude 109.2 West. Norma is moving 
toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A 
north-northwestward to northward motion is forecast through 
Saturday, followed by a turn toward the northeast on Sunday. On the 
forecast track, Norma is expected to approach the southern portion 
of Baja California Sur tonight and move near or over the area on 
Saturday. Norma is forecast to move toward the west coast of 
mainland Mexico on Sunday and Sunday night.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 110 mph (175 km/h)
with higher gusts. Gradual weakening is expected during the next
few days, but Norma is forecast to be a hurricane when it moves
near or over the southern portion of Baja California Sur.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 960 mb (28.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Norma can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area in Baja California Sur on Saturday, with tropical
storm conditions beginning late tonight. Tropical storm conditions
are expected in the tropical storm warning areas in Baja California
Sur on Saturday. Tropical storm conditions are possible in Las
Islas Marias today and tonight, and in the watch area along the
west coast of Mexico by Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  Norma is likely to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10
inches with local maxima of 15 inches across the far southern
portion of Baja California Sur through Sunday and across portions of
Sinaloa through Monday. These rains will likely produce flash and
urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher
terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  A storm surge could produce coastal flooding in areas
of onshore winds within the hurricane warning area. Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Norma are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur.
These swells will spread northward along the coast of western Mexico
and the Baja California peninsula this weekend. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1200 PM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 300 PM MDT.

Hurricane Norma Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172023
300 AM MDT Fri Oct 20 2023
 
Earlier low-frequency microwave images indicated that significant
degradation of Norma's eye has occurred during the past few hours,
particularly in the south part of the inner core.  Although
the outflow aloft is still quite impressive, there is evidence in
the UW-CIMSS shear analysis of modest southerly shear below 250 mb
which is apparently affecting Norma's vertical structure.
Subsequently, the initial intensity is lowered to 100 kt for this
advisory and is based on a blend of the subjective and objective
intensity estimates from TAFB, SAB, and UW-CIMSS.
 
Gradual weakening should continue through the period as a result of
increasing south-southwesterly vertical wind shear produced by
an amplifying mid- to upper-level trough approaching the Baja
California peninsula, and a progressively inhibiting thermodynamic
surrounding environment with mid-tropospheric relative humidity
values of less than 50 percent.  Despite the forecast weakening
trend, Norma will likely be a hurricane while it approaches the 
southern portion of Baja California Sur on Saturday.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be north-northwestward, or 330/6 
kt.  Norma is expected to move between mid-level subtropical 
high-pressure east of the cyclone and the above mentioned trough to 
the northwest and north during the next couple of days.  By 
mid-period, Norma should turn north-northeastward to northeastward 
with a reduction in forward speed while approaching the 
west-central coast of Mexico.  The official track forecast lies 
between the TVCE simple deterministic model consensus and the HFIP 
HCCA, and is similar to the previous forecast with a slight 
adjustment to the south of it beyond the 48-hour period.

The initial wind radii have been adjusted slightly based on a 
recent METOP-B scatterometer overpass.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. A Hurricane Warning is in effect for the far southern portion of
the Baja California peninsula, where Norma is expected to bring
hurricane conditions on Saturday when it passes near or over the
area.  Tropical storm conditions are also expected within the 
tropical storm warning areas in Baja California Sur on Saturday.
 
2. Heavy rains from Norma will begin to impact the far southern
portions of California Baja Sur later today, continuing through
Sunday.  This rainfall may produce flash and urban flooding, along
with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
