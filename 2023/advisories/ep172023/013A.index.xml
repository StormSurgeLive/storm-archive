<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Norma, located a couple of hundred miles south of Cabo San Lucas, <br/>
Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico (EP91):<br/>
Visible satellite imagery shows that the broad area of low pressure <br/>
located several hundred miles south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec is<br/>
producing limited shower and thunderstorm activity well to the west <br/>
of its center due to strong upper-level winds.  Environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to become more conducive for development <br/>
over the next couple of days, and a tropical depression is likely <br/>
to form later this weekend or early next week. The system is <br/>
forecast to meander during the next couple of days and then drift <br/>
generally northward late this weekend and into early next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM MDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Norma was located
near latitude 20.4 North, longitude 109.8 West. Norma is moving
toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A turn toward the
north is expected on Saturday, followed by a slower northeastward
motion Saturday night through Monday. On the forecast track, Norma
is expected to move over the southern portion of Baja California Sur
within the hurricane warning area on Saturday. Norma is forecast to
move toward the west coast of Mexico on Sunday and Sunday night and
move inland within the tropical storm watch area on Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Norma is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Some gradual weakening is expected during the 
next day or so, but Norma is expected to be a hurricane when it 
moves near or over the southern portion of Baja California Sur. 
Weakening is forecast to continue through early next week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160
miles (260 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 955 mb (28.20 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Norma can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area in Baja California Sur on Saturday, with tropical storm
conditions beginning late tonight. Tropical storm conditions are
expected in the tropical storm warning areas in Baja California Sur
on Saturday. Tropical storm conditions are possible in Las Islas
Marias through tonight, and in the watch area along the west coast
of Mexico by Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  Norma is likely to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10
inches with local maxima of 15 inches across the far southern
portion of Baja California Sur through Sunday and across portions of
Sinaloa through Monday. These rains will likely produce flash and
urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher
terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal 
flooding in areas of onshore winds within the hurricane warning 
area. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and 
destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Norma are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur.
These swells will spread northward along the coast of western Mexico
and the Baja California peninsula this weekend. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Norma Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172023
300 PM MDT Fri Oct 20 2023
 
After a brief period of weakening earlier today, data from the Air 
Force Hurricane Hunters this afternoon indicate that Norma has 
strengthened back to a major hurricane. The aircraft data showed 
maximum 700-mb flight-level winds of 124 kt, with peak SFMR winds of 
104 kt in the northeast quadrant. Based on these data, the initial 
intensity is raised to 105 kt. The eyewall is open to the southeast 
based on aircraft reports. The eye signature has become better 
defined over the past few hours in radar data from Los Cabos, 
Mexico, as new bursts of intense inner core convection have 
developed. The radar data show that the outer rainbands of Norma are 
beginning to spread over southern portions of Baja California Sur.

In the short term, the renewed inner core of Norma could allow the 
hurricane to resist some of the negative influences of southerly 
shear and drier air in the surrounding environment. The updated NHC 
forecast still shows some weakening but is higher than the previous 
one during the first 24-36 h of the forecast, based largely on the 
higher initial intensity. Land interaction with the Baja California 
peninsula, along with the previously described negative factors, 
should induce a more steady weakening trend through early next week 
while Norma approaches mainland Mexico.

Scatterometer data and aircraft fixes show that Norma has moved 
slightly left-of-track today, and its initial motion is 330/7 kt. 
The hurricane is expected to turn toward the north-northwest and 
north during the next day or so while it moves between a mid- to 
upper-level trough to its northwest and a mid-level ridge to its 
east. This will bring the center of Norma over the southern tip of 
Baja California Sur within the hurricane warning on Saturday. The 
track models have again trended westward this cycle, and the updated 
NHC forecast is nudged in that direction during the next 24-36 h. 
Then, the models generally agree that Norma will turn northeastward 
and approach the coast of Sinaloa in western Mexico, although there 
are still notable speed differences between the various track 
models. This portion of the NHC forecast is similar to the previous 
one, although a bit slower based on the latest consensus aids. Norma 
is forecast to move inland along the coast of Sinaloa on Monday and 
quickly dissipate thereafter over the terrain of western Mexico.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Norma is expected to bring hurricane conditions and a dangerous 
storm surge to portions of the far southern Baja California 
peninsula within the hurricane warning area on Saturday. 
Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to 
completion. 
 
2. Heavy rains from Norma will begin to impact the far southern 
portions of Baja California Sur today and continue through Sunday, 
with heavy rains reaching Sinaloa on Saturday. This rainfall will 
produce flash and urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in 
areas of higher terrain.
 
3. Norma is forecast to approach the west coast of Mexico as a
tropical storm on Sunday and Sunday night, and a Tropical Storm
Watch is in effect for a portion of that area.
