A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Baja California Sur and along the west coast
of mainland Mexico should monitor the progress of Norma.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Norma was located 
near latitude 22.7 North, longitude 110.3 West. Norma is moving 
toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h). This general motion should 
continue through this evening, followed by a turn toward the 
northeast and east-northeast with a reduction in forward speed 
tonight through Monday. On the forecast track, the center of Norma 
is expected to move over the southern portion of Baja California Sur 
within the hurricane warning area today. Norma is forecast to move 
toward the west coast of Mexico on Sunday night and move inland 
within the tropical storm watch area by early Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 100 mph (155 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Continued weakening is expected during the next 
few days, but Norma is expected to remain a hurricane while it moves 
over the southern portion of Baja California Sur.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles 
(220 km). An observation station in Cabo San Lucas, Baja California 
Sur, recently reported sustained winds of 55 mph (89 km/h) and a 
gust to 72 mph (116 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 968 mb (28.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Norma can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area in Baja California Sur today. Tropical storm conditions
are occurring in the warning areas in Baja California Sur. Tropical
storm conditions are expected in the warning area along the west
coast of Mexico by early Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  Norma will produce rainfall totals of 6 to 12 inches with
maxima of 18 inches across the southern portion of Baja California
Sur through Sunday and across much of Sinaloa through Monday. These
rains will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in
areas of higher terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal
flooding in areas of onshore winds within the hurricane warning
area. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves. Coastal flooding is possible along the west coast
of mainland Mexico within the tropical storm warning area.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Norma will continue to affect the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur for
the next couple of days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1200 PM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 300 PM MDT.

Hurricane Norma Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172023
300 AM MDT Sat Oct 21 2023
 
This morning's satellite presentation is less impressive than what
was observed yesterday.  The cloud tops associated with the central 
dense overcast have warmed quite a bit while the cloud mass
has decreased in areal coverage.  The subjective Dvorak intensity 
estimates from TAFB and SAB yield 95 kt while the objective 
analyses from UW-CIMSS average around 100 kt.  Based on
these data, the initial intensity is lowered to 100 kt for this 
advisory.
 
Although most of the dynamical and statistical intensity models
show gradual weakening through the period due to increasing shear
and a stabilizing surrounding atmosphere, Norma is still expected to
be a hurricane while it moves over the Baja California peninsula 
later today.  Toward the end of the period, Norma is expected to 
move inland and over the higher terrain of the state of 
Sinaloa on Monday and quickly dissipate.  The official intensity 
forecast is similar to the previous one and closely follows the 
various consensus intensity aids.
 
Norma's initial motion is estimated to be northward, or 360/8 kt,
with the hurricane moving between a deep-layer trough to its 
northwest and subtropical high pressure located over central Mexico. 
A turn to the northeast to east-northeast is forecast this evening, 
while the hurricane moves over the southern Baja California 
peninsula and rounds the northwestern periphery of the 
above-mentioned mid-tropospheric high.  On the forecast track, Norma 
should emerge over the Gulf of California and approach the Mexico 
state of Sinaloa coast on Monday.  Although there is some 
along-track forward speed uncertainty in the global and regional 
track guidance, the HFIP HCCA corrected consensus model has been 
fairly consistent in both Norma's predicted forward speed and track 
trajectory, and the NHC forecast follows suit.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Norma is expected to bring life-threatening hurricane conditions
and a dangerous storm surge to portions of the far southern Baja
California peninsula within the hurricane warning area today and 
tonight.  Preparations to protect life and property should be 
rushed to completion.
 
2. Heavy rains from Norma will begin to impact the far southern
portions of Baja California Sur today, continuing through Sunday,
with heavy rains reaching Sinaloa also today, continuing
through Monday.  This rainfall will produce flash and urban
flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
3. Norma is forecast to approach the west coast of Mexico as a
tropical storm on Sunday night and Monday, and a Tropical Storm
Warning is in effect for a portion of that area.
