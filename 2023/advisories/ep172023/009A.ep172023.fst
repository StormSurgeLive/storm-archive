A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected 
somewhere within the warning area. A warning is typically issued 36 
hours before the anticipated first occurrence of 
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside 
preparations difficult or dangerous. Preparations to protect life 
and property should be rushed to completion.

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.

Interests elsewhere in Baja California Sur and along the west coast
of mainland Mexico should monitor the progress of Norma. Additional
watches or warnings could be required tonight or on Friday.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM MDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Norma was located
near latitude 17.9 North, longitude 108.0 West. Norma is moving
toward the north near 6 mph (9 km/h). A turn to the north-northwest
at a similar forward speed is expected during the next couple of
days. A slower northward to northeastward motion is forecast later
this weekend. On the forecast track, Norma is forecast to approach
the southern portion of Baja California on Friday night and
Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Norma is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some weakening is expected during the next 
few days, but Norma is forecast to be a hurricane when it moves 
near the southern portion of Baja California.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150
miles (240 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 944 mb (27.88 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Norma can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the warning area in
Baja California Sur by early Saturday, with tropical storm
conditions beginning late Friday night.  Tropical storm conditions
are possible in Las Islas Marias Friday and Friday night, and in the
watch areas in Baja California Sur on Saturday.

RAINFALL:  Norma is likely to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10
inches with local maxima of 15 inches through Sunday across the far
southern portion of California Baja Sur.  These rains will likely
produce flash and urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in
areas of higher terrain.

STORM SURGE:  A storm surge could produce coastal flooding in areas 
of onshore winds within the hurricane warning area.  Near the 
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Norma are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur, and will spread
northward along the coast of western Mexico and the Baja California
peninsula during the next couple of days.  These swells are likely 
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
