Remnants Of Twenty-One Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL212023
1100 AM EDT Tue Oct 24 2023
 
Satellite images show that the convection associated with Tropical 
Depression Twenty-One has weakened, and there are no signs of a 
well-defined surface center.  Thus the system has dissipated over 
Nicaragua and the initial wind speed is set to 20 kt.  The remnants 
of the system are forecast to continue west-northwestward to 
westward and cross over to the eastern Pacific by Wednesday.  Heavy 
rainfall with flash and urban flooding remain the primary impacts 
even as the system dissipates.
 
This is the last advisory from the National Hurricane Center on
this system.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rains from the remnants of the depression will continue to 
impact portions of Nicaragua through Tuesday night with heavy 
rainfall spreading into Honduras during the day on Tuesday. This 
rainfall is likely to produce flash and urban flooding, along with 
possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain.

Hurricane Tammy Advisory Number  25

...HURRICANE TAMMY HOLDS STEADY WHILE MOVING NORTHEASTWARD OVER
SOUTHWESTERN ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.2N 62.3W
ABOUT 580 MI...935 KM SSE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 35 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...987 MB...29.15 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located
near latitude 24.2 North, longitude 62.3 West. Tammy is moving
toward the northeast near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this general motion
is expected to continue through Wednesday. A turn toward the north
at a slower forward speed is forecast to begin on Thursday, 
followed by a bend to the northwest on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Slight strengthening is possible during the next day or so 
followed by steady weakening. Tammy is forecast to become a
post-tropical cyclone on Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto
Rico during the next few days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Tammy Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
1100 AM AST Tue Oct 24 2023
 
The hurricane has held steady this morning.  Satellite imagery 
depicts deep bursts of convection mainly to the north of the center 
and a large curved band around the northern and eastern portions of 
the system.  The most recent TAFB Dvorak satellite estimate is still 
T4.0/65kt, and the initial intensity remains at 65 kt for this 
advisory.
 
Tammy is moving northeastward with an estimated motion of 035/6 kt. 
A mid-latitude trough over the northwestern Atlantic should steer 
the hurricane more northward in a day or so.  By day 2, most of the 
global model guidance shows Tammy turning westward and slowing down 
between two mid-level ridges through the remainder of the forecast 
period.  Only minor adjustments have been made in the latest NHC 
track prediction, which lies in the middle of the track guidance 
envelope. 

Intensity guidance continues to suggest Tammy should slightly 
strengthen in the near term.  As the hurricane approaches the 
mid-latitude trough, it should enter a region with enhanced 
upper-level divergence, and thus strengthen.  After about a day or 
so, strong deep-layer vertical wind shear and cooling sea surface 
temperatures should gradually weaken the cyclone.  Tammy is still 
expected to become a gale-force extratropical cyclone by 60 h.
