DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression
Twenty-One was located near latitude 12.4 North, longitude 83.4
West. The depression is moving toward the northwest near 5 mph (7
km/h) and this motion is expected to continue tonight. On the 
forecast track, the depression will move inland over the next few 
hours over eastern Nicaragua.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast. The depression is forecast 
to dissipate inland over Nicaragua tomorrow.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Twenty-One can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO
header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL:  The tropical depression is expected to produce additional
rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches with maximum amounts of 12 inches
across Nicaragua and 2 to 4 inches with maximum amounts of 6 inches
across southern and eastern Honduras. These rains are likely to
produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of
higher terrain.

Tropical Depression Twenty-One Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL212023
1100 PM EDT Mon Oct 23 2023
 
It has been a challenge to find the center of the depression this 
evening. Surface observations from Bluefields Airport in Nicaragua 
indicated that the center of the depression likely moved northeast 
of the observing station earlier this evening, but pressures in the 
area were not particularly low. Since then, a robust mid-level 
circulation has been visible in shortwave-infrared imagery, but it 
isn't clear if this extends to the surface. ASCAT data is expected 
within the next couple of hours, which should provide clarity over 
whether the center of the depression has reformed under the 
mid-level circulation, or if has already moved inland. TAFB and SAB 
Dvorak estimates still support an intensity near 25 kt.

Once inland, the depression should quickly weaken and dissipate. 
However, its worth noting that if the center is still over water 
and remains there for any period of time overnight, some slight 
strengthening could occur since the environment is otherwise 
favorable for intensification. The long-term estimated motion is 
around 310/4 kt, but this is highly uncertain. The depression, or 
its remnants, are forecast to continue northwestward tonight, and 
then generally head westward toward the eastern Pacific after that. 

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rains from the depression will continue to impact portions
of Nicaragua through Tuesday night with heavy rainfall spreading
into Honduras during the day on Tuesday. This rainfall is likely to
produce flash and urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in
areas of higher terrain.

Hurricane Tammy Advisory Number  23

...TAMMY STILL A HURRICANE AS IT HEADS NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...22.9N 63.1W
ABOUT 655 MI...1060 KM S OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 45 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...987 MB...29.15 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located
near latitude 22.9 North, longitude 63.1 West. Tammy is moving
toward the northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general motion
is expected to continue through Wednesday. A turn toward the north
at a slower forward speed is forecast to begin on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts. Slight strengthening is possible during the next day or two.
Weakening is expected after that. Tammy is forecast to become a
post-tropical cyclone on Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches)
based on data from a NOAA Saildrone.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto
Rico during the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.

<title>Hurricane Tammy Forecast Discussion Number 23</title>

Hurricane Tammy Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
1100 PM AST Mon Oct 23 2023
 
Microwave data from multiple polar-orbiting satellites received
during the last few hours indicate that Tammy still has a
well-organized low- to mid-level circulation, even as its deep
convection is getting sheared northward. The most recent TAFB Dvorak
classification was a 4.0/65 kt, which supports maintaining Tammy as
a hurricane.
 
While Tammy's future path remains unusually unclear, especially at
the 4-5 day range, very little change was made to the official track
forecast. The hurricane is currently moving north-northeastward, and
it should get steered northward starting in about 2 days as the
hurricane interacts with a mid-latitude trough approaching from the
northwest. The uncertainty in the forecast increases considerably
after that point as Tammy will likely reach a col point in the
steering flow over the western Atlantic. Many models and ensemble
members indicate another mid-latitude trough will cause the cyclone
to begin to accelerate eastward or northeastward. However, it
appears equally likely that Tammy will then turn westward or
southwestward under the influence of a mid-level ridge that
should build behind the second trough. With no clear reason to
support one solution or another, the NHC track forecast is unchanged
for now. It remains near the consensus of the GFS and ECMWF through
about 72 h, and then favors the ECMWF and ECENS mean after that.
 
Conversely, the intensity forecast appears to be more 
straightforward. Most of the intensity guidance indicates that 
slight strengthening is possible during the next day or so, as Tammy 
gets a convective boost while interacting with an upper-level 
trough. However, after about 48 h, it should begin to weaken and 
transition to a post-tropical cyclone. Based on simulated satellite 
imagery, this process is expected to complete in about 72 h, though 
Tammy will likely continue to produce gale- to storm-force winds for 
several days thereafter.
