Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 PM PDT Sun Aug 13 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
upgraded Hurricane Fernanda, located several hundred miles southwest <br/>
of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Western East Pacific (EP99): <br/>
Satellite-derived winds indicate that the area of low pressure <br/>
located about 1300 miles east-southeast of the Hawaiian Islands has <br/>
a well-defined circulation.  Showers and thunderstorms continue to <br/>
show signs of organization and any increase in this activity is <br/>
likely to lead to the formation of a tropical depression either <br/>
tonight or on Monday.  The system is expected to move westward to <br/>
west-northwestward, crossing into the Central Pacific basin late <br/>
tonight.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Off the Coast of Southern Mexico:<br/>
A tropical wave continues to produce a large area of disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms over the far eastern portion of the east <br/>
Pacific. Environmental conditions appear conducive for development <br/>
during the next several days, and a tropical depression is expected <br/>
to form by midweek while the system moves west-northwestward, <br/>
roughly parallel to the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Fernanda Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072023
500 PM HST Sun Aug 13 2023
 
Fernanda continues to rapidly intensify this evening. Since the 
prior advisory, the eye signature on visible satellite has become 
much more distinct as infrared cold cloud tops between -65 to -75 C 
have grown and encircled the eye. The last few microwave passes 
indicate quickly improving structure, with a 2331 UTC GMI pass 
showing a thick closed eyewall on the 89 and 37 GHz channels. 
Satellite intensity estimates have responded by rapidly increasing, 
with subjective estimates at 0000 UTC from TAFB and SAB between 77- 
to 90-kt, and objective estimates covering a similar range. Given 
the improvement of Fernanda's structure on satellite since that 
time, the initial intensity is set near the top of those estimates 
at 90 kt this advisory.
 
The hurricane continues to move generally westward to 
west-northwestward at 280/8 kt. As mentioned previously, the 
hurricane has been moving rather slowly over the last 24 hours due 
to a weak mid-level ridge that has been eroded some by a cutoff low 
located further north near the California coast. However, the 
ridging north of Fernanda should gradually build back in as this 
cutoff low retrogrades off to the northwest. The net effect of this 
change should lead to the hurricane gradually accelerating over the 
next several days. As Fernanda becomes more vertically shallow 
towards the end of the forecast, it should also turn more westward. 
The official track forecast is quite similar to the prior one, but 
just a little faster, favoring a blend of the latest HCCA and TVCE 
consensus aids.
 
Given the most recent microwave imagery showing Fernanda developing 
a well-defined single closed eyewall, the hurricane seems poised to 
continue rapidly intensifying. Vertical wind shear is forecast to 
remain under 5 kt and sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) remaining near 
29 C for the next day or so. In fact, SHIPS-RII shows a 67 percent 
chance of another 30 kt increase in intensity over the next 24 
hours, and the latest NHC intensity forecast now shows Fernanda 
becoming a powerful Category 4 hurricane in the next day or so. 
Thereafter, Fernanda will move into an increasingly dry and stable 
environment, as SSTs rapidly drop off along the forecast track. 
These negative factors should lead to initially gradual, and 
then more rapid weakening towards the second half of the forecast 
period. The latest NHC intensity forecast is above most of the 
guidance over the next 24 hours, in light of its continued rapid 
intensification, but falls back closer to the HCCA and IVCN 
intensity aids between days 2-4. Both the GFS and ECMWF models 
suggest the cyclone will become devoid of organized convection by 
120 hours, and the latest intensity forecast now shows the system 
becoming a remnant low by that time.

Tropical Depression Eight-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082023
500 PM HST Sun Aug 13 2023

The low pressure system that NHC has been monitoring over the far 
western portion of the east Pacific basin has become a tropical 
depression.  An ASCAT pass from several hours ago revealed that 
the system has a well-defined circulation and recent infrared 
satellite images indicate that deep convection has been persisting 
near and to the west of the center.  Based on the ASCAT data and 
Dvorak estimates of T1.5 and T2.0 from TAFB and SAB, respectively, 
the initial intensity is set at 30 kt.

The depression is moving west-northward at 12 kt.  A westward to 
west-northwestward motion is expected during the next few days as 
the system remains steered by a mid-level ridge to its northeast 
and moves toward a weakness in that ridge.  Beyond a few days, a 
turn to the west is forecast as the weakening system moves in the 
low- to mid-level flow.  The models are in good agreement and show 
this system moving well to the south of the Hawaiian Islands.  This 
forecast lies near the middle of the guidance envelope.

The depression is in generally conducive conditions to strengthen 
during the next couple of days while it remains over warm waters 
and in a relatively moist and low wind shear environment.  Beyond 
that time, however, increasing shear, drier air, and slightly 
cooler waters should cause a slow weakening trend.  There is not a 
significant spread in the intensity models and none of them show 
this system reaching hurricane strength.  The NHC intensity 
forecast is in good agreement with the HCCA and IVCN models.

The depression should cross into the central Pacific basin by 1200 
UTC.
