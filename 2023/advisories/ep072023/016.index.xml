Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 AM PDT Wed Aug 16 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Fernanda, located about 1100 miles west-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Off the Coast of Southwestern Mexico (EP90):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms are continuing to show signs of <br/>
organization in association with a broad area of low pressure <br/>
located several hundred miles south-southeast of Manzanillo, Mexico. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear conducive for continued development, <br/>
and a tropical depression or tropical storm is likely to form within <br/>
the next day or so. The system is expected to move <br/>
west-northwestward to northwestward, roughly parallel to the coast <br/>
of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula during the <br/>
next several days.  Additional information on this system, including <br/>
gale warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the <br/>
National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Central America and Southern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure could form south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec <br/>
over the weekend. Some gradual development of this system is <br/>
possible thereafter while it moves generally west-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service<br/>
can be found under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 <br/>

...FERNANDA NOW A TROPICAL STORM...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM HST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.1N 126.8W
ABOUT 1165 MI...1875 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 260 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...994 MB...29.36 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM HST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fernanda was
located near latitude 17.1 North, longitude 126.8 West.  Fernanda is
moving toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h) and this general 
motion is expected to continue for the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Continued rapid weakening is forecast during the 
next 48 hours, and Fernanda is likely to become a post-tropical 
remnant low within a couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).

Tropical Storm Fernanda Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072023
500 AM HST Wed Aug 16 2023
 
Fernanda's rapid weakening continues, and there is little if any 
deep convection remaining in association with the system.  Given the 
lack of convection, it is difficult to estimate the current 
intensity of the cyclone via the Dvorak satellite technique.  
However assuming a fairly rapid spin down, the current intensity is 
set to 55 kt for this advisory, with a significant amount of 
uncertainty.

The storm has turned a little to the left and the current motion is 
just slightly south of due west, or 260/13 kt.  The steering pattern 
is expected to be fairly straightforward with a mid-level ridge 
established the north of the cyclone.  This should result in a 
continued westward motion for the next few days.  The official track 
forecast is close to the corrected dynamical model consensus 
guidance.

Fernanda is crossing the SST gradient and should be moving over 
progressively cooler waters.  Therefore, the system is not likely to 
regenerate sustained deep convection, and continued rapid weakening 
is likely. The cyclone should drop below tropical storm strength 
tomorrow and weaken to dissipation in 72 hours if not sooner.
