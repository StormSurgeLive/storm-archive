Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 PM PDT Sat Aug 12 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
upgraded Tropical Storm Fernanda, located several hundred miles <br/>
south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California <br/>
peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Western East Pacific (EP99): <br/>
A broad area of low pressure located about 1500 miles east- <br/>
southeast of the Hawaiian Islands continues to produce disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions are expected <br/>
to remain conducive for development, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form within the next couple of days.  The system is <br/>
forecast to move west or west-northwestward at about 10 mph across <br/>
the far western portion of the basin through Sunday, and then cross <br/>
into the Central Pacific basin Sunday night.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Off the Coast of Southern Mexico:<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the far eastern <br/>
portion of the east Pacific are associated with a tropical wave. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear conducive for development over the <br/>
next several days, and a tropical depression is expected to form <br/>
during the early or middle part of next week while it moves <br/>
generally west-northwestward, roughly parallel to the coast of <br/>
southern and southwestern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Fernanda Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072023
200 AM PDT Sun Aug 13 2023
 
Geostationary satellite imagery shows that banding associated with 
Fernanda has continued to increase overnight with a small central 
dense overcast feature recently developing.  Unfortunately there 
have been no recent microwave or scatterometer overpasses to help 
ascertain the inner core structure and wind field of the small 
tropical cyclone.  The latest subjective Dvorak estimates range 
from T2.5  (35 kt) from TAFB to T3.5 (55 kt) from SAB.  The initial 
intensity for this advisory is set at 45 kt, using a blend of those 
subjective estimates. 

Fernanda is currently traversing SSTs of around 29 degrees Celsius 
and is within an area of low vertical wind shear  These conditions 
favor steady to rapid strengthening during the next 24 to 36 hours.  
The only negative factor is some nearby dry mid-level air, but the 
low shear conditions suggest that the small cyclone is likely to 
intensify.  Although the NHC intensity forecast does not quite 
predict rapid strengthening during the next 24 hours, it does 
forecast a fairly substantial 40 kt increase in wind speed during 
the next 36 hours, showing rapid intensification (RI) between the 
12 and 36 hour period.  After 60 hours, decreasing SSTs and a more 
stable environment along the track of Fernanda are expected to 
cause steady weakening later in the period.  The latest NHC 
intensity forecast is a little above the SHIPS guidance, but lies 
near the ICON consensus aid.  This is a little below the latest 
HFIP corrected consensus model. 

The tropical storm is moving west-northwestward at about 9 kt.  A 
westward to west-northwestward motion is expected to continue 
during the next few days at a slightly slower forward speed.  After 
that time, a faster westward motion is anticipated as the ridge to 
the north of Fernanda strengthens.  There is some cross-track 
spread in the guidance beyond 72 hours which is primarily related 
to how much latitude Fernanda gains during the next few days. 
The NHC track prediction is near the middle of the guidance 
envelope, close to a blend of the GFS and ECMWF models.
