Post-Tropical Cyclone Fernanda Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072023
500 AM HST Thu Aug 17 2023
 
Fernanda has lacked convective activity since yesterday evening and 
is therefore considered a post-tropical cyclone.  With no 
convective activity, Dvorak estimates are no longer a reliable 
source for intensity guidance.  The initial intensity is lowered to 
30 kt for this advisory largely based on the trend in geostationary 
satellite imagery.  An occasional burst of convection is still 
possible given 25-26 degrees C sea surface temperatures along the 
forecast track of Fernanda. Model guidance indicates the cyclone 
will continue to weaken in an increasingly dry and stable 
environment for the next few days and is likely to dissipate by 
day 3. 

The remnant low is moving westward at 13 kt.  This general motion 
is expected to continue for the next few days as the system is 
steered by the low-level flow around a ridge to its north.

For additional information on the remnant low please see High
Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.  Those 
forecasts can be found under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI and WMO 
header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php.

moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this
general motion is expected to continue through tonight.  A turn
toward the northwest is expected Friday morning, followed by a turn
toward the north-northwest and north on Saturday.  On the forecast
track, the center of Hilary will approach the Baja California
peninsula over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 75 mph (120 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Rapid strengthening is forecast, and Hilary 
could become a major hurricane by tonight or early Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (115 km) from 
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275 
miles (445 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 982 mb (29.00 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area by Friday night or early Saturday.
 
RAINFALL:  Hilary is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 3 to 6
inches, with isolated maximum amounts of 8 inches, across portions
of the Baja California Peninsula through Monday morning.  Flash
flooding, locally significant, will be possible.
 
Heavy rainfall in association with Hilary is expected to impact the
Southwestern United States from Friday through early next week,
peaking on Sunday and Monday.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula over
the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Hurricane Hilary Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>

Tropical Storm Hilary Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092023
300 AM MDT Thu Aug 17 2023
 
Hilary is a large tropical storm.  An elongated band of deep 
convection curves around the southern and eastern side of the 
circulation, and a Central Dense Overcast has begun to develop due 
to new convection near Hilary's center, with possibly the formative 
stages of an eye.  Subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB 
have jumped to a consensus T3.5/55 kt, and given the improved 
satellite presentation since 06 UTC, the initial intensity is set at 
60 kt.
 
Hilary is moving toward the west-northwest (300/11 kt), to the south 
of a mid-tropospheric high stretching from the U.S. Rockies 
southward into northern Mexico.  The ridge is expected to shift 
eastward to the Central Plains during the next 48 hours, while a 
mid- to upper-level low moves eastward to the California coast. This 
steering pattern evolution should cause Hilary to recurve toward the 
northwest and then north during the next 3 days.  Model guidance is 
in generally good agreement on Hilary's future path, with a fairly 
tightly packed guidance envelope for much of the forecast period.  
Therefore, the new NHC track forecast is very close to a blend of 
the previous forecast with the HFIP Corrected Consensus aid (HCCA) 
and the TVCE consensus.  Despite the high confidence in the track, 
Hilary's oblique angle of approach to the west coast of the Baja 
California peninsula does make it nearly impossible to know at this 
point if the center will remain just offshore or move over the 
peninsula before reaching the southwestern United States.
 
Negligible shear, very warm waters of 30 degrees Celsius, and 
plentiful atmospheric moisture mean the environment is ripe for 
Hilary to rapidly intensify during the next couple of days.  In 
fact, many of the SHIPS Rapid Intensification (RI) indices are 
showing a 100 percent chance of RI during the next 48 hours.  The 
NHC intensity forecast follows this thinking and shows Hilary 
becoming a hurricane very soon and then a major hurricane by tonight 
or early Friday, more or less a blend of the HCCA aid and the SHIPS 
solutions.  Hilary should reach waters colder than 26 degrees 
Celsius soon after 72 hours, and fast weakening is indicated after 
that time, especially if the storm crosses over the Baja California 
peninsula.  The surface circulation is likely to be dissipated by 
day 5, but a day 5 forecast point (as a remnant low) is still 
provided to maintain a forecast track north of the Baja California 
peninsula.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Hilary has the potential to bring significant impacts to the
Baja California Peninsula and portions of the southwestern United
States this weekend and early next week, including after it becomes
post-tropical.  Although it is too soon to determine the location
and magnitude of wind impacts, interests in these areas should
monitor the progress of Hilary and updates to the forecast.  A
Tropical Storm Watch is now in effect for southern portions of Baja
California Sur, and additional watches or warnings will likely be
required later today.
 
2. Heavy rainfall associated with Hilary may produce areas of flash 
flooding and result in landslides over portions of the Baja 
California peninsula from late Friday into late Sunday.  Rainfall 
impacts from Hilary within the Southwestern United States are 
expected to peak on Sunday and Monday.
 
3. Large swells from Hilary will spread northward along the coast
of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California Peninsula during the
next several days.
