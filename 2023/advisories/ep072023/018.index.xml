Tropical Storm Fernanda Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072023
500 PM HST Wed Aug 16 2023
 
Fernanda has refused to give in to the increasingly inhibiting
environment and has recently produced a fragmented band with
associated -63 degree Celsius cloud top temperatures in the
west quadrant of the cyclone.  Assuming, however, that the
new burst is insufficient to maintain Fernanda's previous advisory
intensity of 45 kt, the initial intensity is lowered to 40 kt.
 
Cooler oceanic temperatures (sub 26C) and an very dry, stable 
marine-layer air mass should result in continued weakening. Fernanda 
is expected to degenerate into a post-tropical cyclone in 12 hours, 
with dissipation occurring this weekend.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be just south of due west, or 
265/13 kt.  There has been no change to the forecast track 
philosophy.  A subtropical ridge should remain anchored to the north 
of Fernanda during the next few days.  Accordingly, Fernanda is 
forecast to move generally westward through the period.  The track 
guidance remains tightly clustered, and only a slight along-track 
adjustment was needed for the latest NHC forecast.

Tropical Storm Hilary Advisory Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092023
400 PM CDT Wed Aug 16 2023
 
...HILARY EXPECTED TO BECOME A HURRICANE TOMORROW...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 400 PM CDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...13.7N 103.7W
ABOUT 370 MI...590 KM S OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1002 MB...29.59 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Baja California Sur should monitor the progress of this
system.  Watches will likely be required for a portion of that area
as soon as this evening.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Hilary was 
located near latitude 13.7 North, longitude 103.7 West. Hilary is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h). This general 
motion is expected to continue with a gradual turn to the northwest 
by Friday followed by a turn to the north-northwest on Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Steady to rapid strengthening is forecast for the next few days.
Hilary is expected to become a hurricane on Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula over
the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Hilary Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092023
400 PM CDT Wed Aug 16 2023
 
Hilary has not changed much this afternoon.  A large burst of 
convection, with cloud top temperatures colder than -85 degrees C, 
continues to obscure the low-level circulation and some outflow has 
developed on the southern semicircle of the storm.  Subjective and 
objective satellite intensity estimates range from 30 to 43 kt and 
the initial intensity is remains at 35 kt.
 
The storm is moving to the west-northwest at 13 kt.  Hilary is 
forecast to gradually turn, first to the northwest by day 2 and 
then to the north-northwest by day 3 with the same general forward 
motion. This is likely driven by a building ridge over the United 
States and a trough off the coast of California.  The short-term 
track prediction has shifted to the right of the previous forecast, 
largely due to an adjustment in the rather uncertain initial 
position.  It is closest to the simple consensus aid, TVCE.  
 
Strengthening is still expected due to the conducive atmospheric 
conditions and warm sea surface temperatures.  Hilary is forecast to 
be in an area of weak vertical wind shear through 72-96 hours and 
remain over warm waters through 72 hours.  Therefore, steady to 
rapid intensification is anticipated and the official forecast 
shows Hilary becoming a hurricane in 24 hours.  However, the system 
is broad and it could take slightly longer to initially consolidate 
and strengthen.  Beyond day 3, Hilary is forecast to cross over a 
gradient of cooling ocean waters which should induce a weakening 
trend.  The system is still expected to be post-tropical by the end 
of the forecast period.
 
It is important to remind users to not focus on the exact forecast 
track and intensity of Hilary, especially in the latter parts of the 
forecast period.  Due to the nearly parallel angle of approach to 
the Baja California peninsula, small changes in the cross track 
position may result in large changes to when and where the system 
ultimately approaches the coast.  Regardless, wind and rainfall 
impacts are likely to extend far from the center of Hilary.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Hilary has the potential to bring impacts to the Baja California
Peninsula and portions of the southwestern United States this
weekend.  Although it is too soon to determine the location and
magnitude of rainfall and wind impacts, interests in these areas
should monitor the progress of Hilary and updates to the forecast.
 
2. Large swells from Hilary will spread northward along the coast
of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California Peninsula during the
next days.
