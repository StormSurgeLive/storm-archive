Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 AM PDT Sat Aug 12 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Central East Pacific (EP98):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to become better organized in <br/>
association with a low pressure system located several hundred <br/>
miles south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California <br/>
peninsula, and it appears that a tropical depression or tropical <br/>
storm could be forming.  If these trends continue, advisories would <br/>
likely be initiated on this system later today.  The low is expected <br/>
to move westward to west-northwestward at about 10 mph across the <br/>
central portion of the basin during the next few days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western East Pacific (EP99): <br/>
A broad area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave is <br/>
producing a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms <br/>
well to the east-southeast of the Hawaiian Islands.  Conditions <br/>
appear conducive for development of this system, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form during the next few days while moving <br/>
toward the west or west-northwest at about 10 mph across the far <br/>
western portion of the basin, crossing into the Central Pacific <br/>
basin late Sunday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Off the Coast of Southern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure is forecast to form offshore of Central <br/>
America and the southern coast of Mexico in a couple of days from <br/>
a tropical wave currently moving across the southern portion of <br/>
Central America.  Environmental conditions are expected to be <br/>
conducive for development of this system, and a tropical depression <br/>
is likely to form during the early or middle part of next week while <br/>
it moves generally west-northwestward, roughly parallel to the coast <br/>
of southern and southwestern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Seven-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072023
300 PM MDT Sat Aug 12 2023

Satellite images indicate that the area of low pressure located 
several hundred miles south-southwest of the southern tip of the 
Baja California peninsula has attained sufficient organization to be 
classified as a tropical depression.  The last couple of microwave 
satellite overpasses show a similar scenario, with cold 
convective curved bands becoming better organized around a low-level 
center, which appears to be located near the northern edge of the 
convective cloud mass based on recent visible satellite images. The 
latest TAFB subjective Dvorak estimate is T-2.0.  Based on these 
data, Invest 98E is upgraded to Tropical Depression Seven-E with an 
initial intensity of 30 kt.

Weak mid-level ridging well to the north of the depression will 
steer the cyclone toward the west-northwest at about 10 kt over the 
next few days.  Beyond 72 h, the ridge should strengthen enough to 
cause a turn to the west with a slight increase in forward speed.  
The NHC forecast track is in best agreement with the HCCA and TVCE 
consensus models.

Environmental conditions are quite favorable for strengthening over 
the next 48-60 h, with warm ocean temperatures, low vertical 
wind shear and a relatively moist low to mid-level troposphere. The 
NHC forecast peaks the system at 75 kt in 48-60 h, which is near 
the middle of the intensity guidance. The ECMWF version of the 
SHIPS RI index shows a 52 percent chance of a 65 kt increase in 
winds over the next 72 h, so there is a chance the cyclone could 
strengthen more than forecast. After that time, the cyclone is 
forecast to move into a much drier environment along with slowly 
decreasing sea-surface temperatures. There is high confidence on 
significant weakening beyond 72 h due to the very dry airmass that 
the cyclone will be moving into.
