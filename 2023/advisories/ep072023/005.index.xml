Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 AM PDT Sun Aug 13 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Fernanda, located several hundred miles southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. <br/>
<br/>
Western East Pacific (EP99): <br/>
Showers and thunderstorms are becoming better organized in <br/>
association with an area of low pressure located about 1400 miles <br/>
east-southeast of the Hawaiian Islands. Environmental conditions <br/>
appear conducive for continued development, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form during the next day or so as it moves <br/>
westward or west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph. The system is <br/>
forecast to cross into the Central Pacific basin late tonight.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Off the Coast of Southern Mexico:<br/>
A tropical wave continues to produce a large area of disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms over the far eastern portion of the east <br/>
Pacific. Environmental conditions appear conducive for development <br/>
during the next several days, and a tropical depression is expected <br/>
to form by midweek while the system moves west-northwestward, <br/>
roughly parallel to the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

<title>Hurricane Fernanda Forecast Discussion Number 5</title>

Hurricane Fernanda Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072023
200 PM PDT Sun Aug 13 2023

Satellite imagery indicates that small Fernanda has been 
strengthening rapidly today.  A faint eye has become apparent on 
visible satellite imagery, and outer banding features are becoming 
better defined.  Since the presence of a visible eye is usually a 
good indicator that a tropical cyclone has become a hurricane, the 
system is being upgraded on this advisory.  This intensity is also 
in agreement with a Dvorak classification from SAB.  The upper-level 
outflow pattern has also become more symmetric over the circulation.

Fernanda continues moving west-northwestward at a slightly slower 
pace with an estimated motion of 285/8 kt.  The mid-level ridge to 
the north of the tropical cyclone is currently rather weak due to 
the presence of a cutoff low near the California coast.  Over 
the next few days, the ridge to the north of Fernanda is forecast 
to strengthen as the influence of the cutoff low lessens.  As a 
result, the system should move somewhat faster to the 
west-northwest during the next 72 hours or so while turning 
westward later in the forecast period.  The official track forecast 
remains very close to the previous one and is also very similar to 
the dynamical model consensus aid TVCE.

The hurricane should continue to pass over SSTs of around 29 deg C 
for the next day or two while remaining in a very low vertical shear 
environment.  The rapid intensification (RI) indices such as SHIPS,
RII, and DTOPS continue to show a good chance of RI continuing over 
the next day or so.  Thus, the official forecast will again call for 
RI over the next 24 hours. However, in about 48 hours, drier 
mid-level air should halt the strengthening process.  The numerical 
guidance is in good agreement that Fernanda will steadily weaken in 
2-5 days, and this is reflected in the NHC intensity forecast, which 
is fairly close to the latest corrected consensus prediction.
