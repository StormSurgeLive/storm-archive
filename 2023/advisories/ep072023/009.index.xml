Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 AM PDT Mon Aug 14 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Fernanda, located several hundred miles southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Off the Coast of Southern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave is <br/>
producing widespread showers and thunderstorms off the southern <br/>
coasts of Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Environmental <br/>
conditions appear conducive for development, and a tropical <br/>
depression is expected to form within the next few days, while the <br/>
system moves west-northwestward, roughly parallel to the coast of <br/>
southern and southwestern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of the Bay of Campeche:<br/>
Another area of low pressure could form south of the Gulf of <br/>
Tehuantepec over the weekend. Some gradual development of the <br/>
system is possible thereafter while it moves generally westward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

<title>Hurricane Fernanda Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Hurricane Fernanda Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072023
1100 AM HST Mon Aug 14 2023

Fernanda has been maintaining a well-defined eye some 10 n mi in 
diameter with very cold surrounding convective cloud tops.  The 
upper-level outflow pattern remains well defined, particularly to 
the north.  Dvorak current intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB 
remain at 115 kt and objective ADT estimates from UW-CIMSS are also 
near that value.  Thus the intensity estimate is held at 115 kt, 
i.e. category 4 strength, for this advisory.

Although there have been some trochoidal wobbles in the motion, 
which is fairly common in intense hurricanes, the overall motion 
continues to be westward or slightly north of westward at a rather 
slow pace, 6 kt.  The mid-level ridge to the north of Fernanda is 
still rather weak due to the influence of a cutoff low near the 
California coast.  Global model predictions show the ridge becoming 
better established over the next several days, which should result 
in some increase in forward speed.  In 3-5 days, the shallower and 
weaker cyclone is likely to be carried on a westward track 
following the lower-level trade wind flow.  The official forecast 
track is basically an extension of the previous one and remains in 
good agreement with the simple and corrected dynamical model 
consensus solutions.

Although it is likely that Fernanda has reached its peak intensity, 
the hurricane should remain in a favorable SST and atmospheric 
thermodynamic environment until tonight so some additional 
short-term strengthening is possible.  After about 12 hours, the 
influences of drier air and cooler waters should begin to take their 
toll, so the official forecast shows a steady weakening trend in 1-4 
days.  This is in good agreement with the corrected consensus, HCCA, 
prediction.
