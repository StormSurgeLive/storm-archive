<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Fernanda, located several hundred miles southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula. The National Hurricane Center <br/>
has issued its last advisory on Tropical Storm Greg, which has <br/>
moved into the central Pacific Basin. Future advisories on Greg <br/>
will be issued by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center.<br/>
<br/>
Off the Coast of Southern Mexico:<br/>
A tropical wave continues to produce a broad area of disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms off the southern coasts of Mexico, <br/>
Guatemala, and El Salvador. Environmental conditions appear <br/>
conducive for development, and a tropical depression is expected to <br/>
form within the next few days, while the system moves <br/>
west-northwestward, roughly parallel to the coast of southern and <br/>
southwestern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
Future information on Greg can be found in Public Advisories issued <br/>
by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center beginning at 500 AM HST, <br/>

Hurricane Fernanda Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072023
500 AM HST Mon Aug 14 2023
 
Fernanda has continued to intensify this morning.  The 10 nmi- 
diameter eye is very well defined and is surrounded by a ring of
-70 deg C or colder convective cloud tops.  The hurricane's
upper-level outflow pattern remains quite symmetric.  Dvorak data
T-numbers for the system are now around 6.0 which supports an
intensity of 115 kt, i.e. category 4 intensity.  This is also in
good agreement with objective ADT estimates from UW-CIMSS.
 
A westward to west-northwestward track continues with an initial
motion estimate of about 280/7  kt.  There are no significant
changes to the track forecast reasoning from the previous
advisory.  A weak mid-tropospheric ridge to the north of
Fernanda should gradually strengthen over the next several days.
This should result in a continued west-northwestward or slightly
north of westward movement with some increase of forward speed over
the next several days.  Late in the forecast period, the weakening
cyclone should move mostly westward, following the low-level
environmental flow.  The official track forecast is close to both
the simple and corrected dynamical model consensus guidance.
 
The hurricane should traverse SSTs of 28-29 deg C today while
remaining in a low-vertical wind shear environment.  Therefore some
additional strengthening will probably occur today.  By early
tomorrow and thereafter, Fernanda should begin to encounter the
drier low- to mid-level air mass that is seen in the GOES-18
lower-level water vapor imagery not far to the west-northwest of the
tropical cyclone.  This, along with cooler ocean waters, should
result in steady weakening of the system over the next 2-5 days.
The official intensity forecast calls for Fernanda to degenerate
into a post-tropical cyclone at 96 h. However, based on the
latest simulated satellite imagery from the global models, a faster
rate of weakening is certainly possible.
