<title>Hurricane Fernanda Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Hurricane Fernanda Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072023
1100 PM HST Sun Aug 13 2023
 
Fernanda continues to rapidly intensify this evening. The
well-defined eye has warmed and continues to be surrounded by a
solid core of cold cloud tops around -70C. Microwave imagery from
earlier this evening showed a thick closed eyewall and a well
defined structure. Satellite intensity estimates have continued to
increase this evening as well, with subjective estimates from TAFB
and SAB T5.5/T6.0, respectively. CIMMS ADT/AiDT objective satellite
estimates are in a similar range. Using a blend of these estimates
the initial intensity for this advisory is set at 110 kt.
 
The hurricane continues to move generally westward to
west-northwestward at 280/7 kt.  Fernanda is being steered by a weak
mid-level ridge with a generally west to west-northwest motion
expected throughout the period. As the ridge begins to re-strengthen
in the next day or so, the hurricane will begin to move faster, 
with a gradually accelerating forward speed over the next several 
days. The official track forecast is quite similar to the prior 
one, with just a slight adjustment northward in the short term.
 
Fernanda is now a major hurricane and is in an environment that will 
continue to allow for further intensification.  Vertical wind shear 
is forecast to remain under 10 kt and with warm sea surface 
temperatures. Thereafter, Fernanda will move into an increasingly 
dry and stable environment, with mid-level relative humidity levels 
dropping below 40 percent in about 48 hrs. This will occur at the 
same time the SSTs also begin to drop off along the forecast track. 
These factors should lead to initially gradual, and then more rapid 
weakening. The latest NHC intensity forecast is above most of the 
guidance over the next 24 hours, but is closer to the consensus aids 
in days 2-4. However, there is some guidance that show an even 
faster decay than what is currently forecast, with the system 
becoming void of convection due to the very dry airmass.

Tropical Depression Eight-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082023
500 PM HST Sun Aug 13 2023

The low pressure system that NHC has been monitoring over the far 
western portion of the east Pacific basin has become a tropical 
depression.  An ASCAT pass from several hours ago revealed that 
the system has a well-defined circulation and recent infrared 
satellite images indicate that deep convection has been persisting 
near and to the west of the center.  Based on the ASCAT data and 
Dvorak estimates of T1.5 and T2.0 from TAFB and SAB, respectively, 
the initial intensity is set at 30 kt.

The depression is moving west-northward at 12 kt.  A westward to 
west-northwestward motion is expected during the next few days as 
the system remains steered by a mid-level ridge to its northeast 
and moves toward a weakness in that ridge.  Beyond a few days, a 
turn to the west is forecast as the weakening system moves in the 
low- to mid-level flow.  The models are in good agreement and show 
this system moving well to the south of the Hawaiian Islands.  This 
forecast lies near the middle of the guidance envelope.

The depression is in generally conducive conditions to strengthen 
during the next couple of days while it remains over warm waters 
and in a relatively moist and low wind shear environment.  Beyond 
that time, however, increasing shear, drier air, and slightly 
cooler waters should cause a slow weakening trend.  There is not a 
significant spread in the intensity models and none of them show 
this system reaching hurricane strength.  The NHC intensity 
forecast is in good agreement with the HCCA and IVCN models.

The depression should cross into the central Pacific basin by 1200 
UTC.
