DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM PDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Hilary was located
near latitude 28.8 North, longitude 115.5 West.  The hurricane is
moving toward the north-northwest near 21 mph (33 km/h).  Hilary is
expected to accelerate as it moves north-northwestward to northward
during the next day or so.  On the forecast track, the center of
Hilary will move close to the west-central coast of the Baja
California Peninsula during the next few hours, and then move across
southern California this afternoon.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts. Weakening is expected, but Hilary is likely to still be a
hurricane while it passes near the west coast of the central Baja
California Peninsula this morning.  Hilary is expected to weaken to
a tropical storm before it reaches southern California.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230
miles (370 km). A sustained wind of 52 mph (83 km/h) and a gust of
67 mph (108 km/h) were recently reported at Isla Cedros, Mexico.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hilary can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml.
 
RAINFALL:  Hilary is expected to produce storm total rainfall
amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated maximum amounts up to 10
inches, across portions of the northern Baja California Peninsula
through tonight. Flash and urban flooding, locally catastrophic, is
expected, especially in the northern portions of the peninsula.
 
Heavy rainfall in association with Hilary is expected across the
Southwestern United States, most intense from today into Monday
morning.  Rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated amounts
of 10 inches, are expected across portions of southern California
and southern Nevada.  Dangerous to catastrophic flooding is
expected.  Across portions of Oregon and Idaho, rainfall totals of
1 to 3 inches with local maxima to 5 inches are expected through
Tuesday morning, resulting in localized, some significant, flash
flooding.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area this morning and are possible within the hurricane
watch area later today.  Tropical storm conditions are occurring
within the southern portion of the tropical storm warning area and
will spread northward today.  Tropical storm conditions are expected
to begin in southern California later today.
 
Winds could be particularly strong and gusty in and near areas of
elevated terrain.  Higher gusts are expected well inland and will
persist even after the system becomes post-tropical.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal
flooding along the western Baja California peninsula of Mexico near
where the center passes the coast in areas of onshore winds, or east
of the center if Hilary makes landfall. The surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.  Coastal flooding is
possible along the northern coast of the Gulf of California today
through early Monday.
 
TORNADOES: A tornado or two may occur today from mid-morning through
the evening over parts of the lower Colorado River Valley, Mojave
Desert, and Imperial Valley regions.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the
Baja California Peninsula and southern California over the next
day or two.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Hilary Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092023
200 AM PDT Sun Aug 20 2023
 
The coverage and intensity of deep convection associated with
Hilary has gradually diminished.  However, numerous convective
bands over the eastern semicircle of the circulation continue to
spread northward over the Baja California peninsula and the Gulf of
California, and into the extreme southwestern United States.  Air
Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft observations indicate that Hilary
is slowly weakening as evidenced by flight-level winds and
dropsonde measurements of the central pressure.  The advisory
intensity estimate is set at 75 kt, although this might be a little
generous.
 
Hilary is beginning to accelerate toward the north-northwest and the
initial motion estimate is now 345/18 kt.  Over the next day or two,
the cyclone should continue to accelerate within the flow between a
strong mid-level ridge over the south-central United States and a
mid- to upper-level low near the central California coast.  This
motion will bring the center of Hilary near the northern Baja
California peninsula and then into southern California later today.
 The official track forecast is similar to the previous one, albeit
a little faster in accord with the latest consensus model guidance.
 Users are reminded that the exact details of the track forecast,
including where Hilary might make landfall, are of little overall
importance since strong winds and heavy rainfall extend far from the
center.  These hazards are already spreading northward well in
advance of the arrival of the center.
 
Hilary should continue to weaken due to cooler waters, the intrusion
of drier air into the circulation, and increasing vertical shear.
However, confidence remains high that the system will still be of
tropical storm intensity when it moves into southern California.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Preparations for flooding impacts associated with Hilary should
be completed as soon as possible, as heavy rainfall is about to
begin.  In the Southwestern United States, the potentially historic
amount of rainfall is expected to cause flash, urban, and arroyo
flooding including landslides, mudslides, and debris flows.
Dangerous to locally catastrophic flooding impacts are expected
through Monday morning.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are expected along the west-central coast of
the Baja California Peninsula within the hurricane warning area
during the next few hours, and are possible in the Hurricane Watch
area a little later today.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin later today in
portions of the southwestern U.S. within the Tropical Storm Warning
area.  Winds could be particularly strong and gusty in and near
areas of higher terrain.  Gusty winds are expected to spread
well inland across the western United States.
 
4. Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the
Baja California Peninsula and southern California over the next
couple of days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.
