DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM PDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Hilary was
located near latitude 33.9 North, longitude 118.2 West. Hilary is
moving toward the north-northwest near 28 mph (44 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue into Monday. On the forecast 
track, the center of Hilary will move across portions of southern 
California through early Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is expected to continue, and Hilary is forecast to become 
a post-tropical cyclone by early Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km), 
primarily to the east of the center. A sustained wind of 41 mph (66 
km/h) and a gust of 54 mph (87 km/h) was recently reported at the 
Salton Sea in southern California.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface observations 
is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hilary can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml.
 
RAINFALL:  Hilary is expected to produce storm total rainfall
amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with maximum amounts up to 10 inches,
across portions of the northern Baja California Peninsula through
Sunday night. Flash and urban flooding, locally catastrophic, is
expected.
 
Intense heavy rainfall associated with Hilary is expected across the
Southwestern United States through early Monday morning. Rainfall
amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated maximum amounts of 10
inches, are expected across portions of southern California and
southern Nevada leading to dangerous to catastrophic flooding.
Across portions of Oregon and Idaho, rainfall totals of 1 to 3
inches with local maxima to 5 inches are expected through Tuesday
morning, resulting in localized, some significant, flash flooding.
 
A list of rainfall observations compiled by the NOAA Weather
Prediction Center for this storm can be found at:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue for the next few
hours within the Tropical Storm Warning area along the northern Gulf
of California. Tropical storm conditions will continue into tonight
in the warning area in southern California.
 
Winds could be particularly strong and gusty in and near areas of
elevated terrain.  Higher gusts are expected well inland and will
persist even after the system becomes post-tropical.
 
STORM SURGE:  Coastal flooding is possible along the northern coast
of the Gulf of California through early Monday.
 
TORNADOES: A brief tornado or two will be possible this evening
across southeast California, northwest Arizona, southern Nevada and
far southwest Utah.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the
Baja California Peninsula and southern California through early
Monday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1100 PM PDT.
Next complete advisory at 200 AM PDT.

Tropical Storm Hilary Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092023
800 PM PDT Sun Aug 20 2023
 
Radar images, satellite data, and surface observations indicate the 
center of Hilary is becoming more diffuse while moving near the 
coast of southern California. Rainbands associated with the storm 
continue to spread northward across the southwestern United States. 
The wind field of Hilary has become very asymmetric this evening, 
with tropical-storm-force winds now confined to the eastern portion 
of the circulation well away from the center. Based on the latest 
observations and assuming some continued decay over land, the 
initial intensity is set at 40 kt.
 
Hilary remains embedded within strong southerly flow between a ridge 
over the south-central U.S. and a mid- to upper-level low near the 
central California coast. Thus, a fast north-northwestward motion is 
expected to continue until dissipation occurs. The forecast track 
with this update has shifted slightly left of the previous one based 
on the adjusted initial position of the storm. Ultimately, this is 
of little consequence as the rainfall and wind impacts extend far 
from the center. Continued land interaction and strong upper-level 
winds will result in additional degradation of the storm's 
structure, and Hilary is forecast to become post-tropical by early 
Monday. Regardless, gusty winds are expected to continue well to the 
east of Hilary's center, especially in areas of higher terrain.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Across the Southwestern United States, the ongoing and
potentially historic amount of rainfall is expected to cause
life-threatening to locally catastrophic flash, urban, and arroyo
flooding including landslides, mudslides, and debris flows through
early Monday morning. Localized flooding impacts, some significant,
are also expected across northern portions of the Intermountain
West.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the
southwestern U.S. within the Tropical Storm Warning area through
tonight. Winds could be particularly strong and gusty in and near
areas of higher terrain. Gusty winds are expected to spread well
inland across the western United States.
 
3. Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the Baja
California Peninsula and southern California through early Monday.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.
