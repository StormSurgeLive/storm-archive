DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 PM MDT (1800 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Hilary was located
near latitude 18.2 North, longitude 111.8 West. Hilary is moving
toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A turn toward the
north-northwest is expected today and tonight, followed by a faster
motion toward the north Saturday night and Sunday.  On the forecast
track, the center of Hilary will move close to the west coast of the
Baja California peninsula over the weekend and reach southern
California by Sunday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Hilary is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Fluctuations in intensity are likely over the
next day or so.  Weakening is expected to begin by Saturday, but
Hilary will still be a hurricane when it approaches the west coast
of the Baja California peninsula Saturday night and Sunday.  Hilary
is expected to weaken to a tropical storm by Sunday afternoon before
it reaches southern California.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 290
miles (465 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 939 mb (27.73 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hilary can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml.
 
RAINFALL:  Hilary is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 3 to 6
inches, with isolated maximum amounts up to 10 inches, across
portions of the Baja California Peninsula through Sunday night.
Flash flooding, locally significant, will be possible.
 
Heavy rainfall in association with Hilary is expected to impact the
Southwestern United States through next Wednesday, peaking on Sunday
and Monday. Rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated amounts
of 10 inches, are expected across portions of southern California
and southern Nevada. Rare and dangerous flooding will be possible.
Elsewhere across portions of the Western United States, rainfall
totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area Saturday night and are possible within the hurricane
watch by early Sunday. Tropical storm conditions are expected
within the warning area by late today, and are possible within the
watch area in Mexico on Saturday and in southern California
beginning Sunday.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal
flooding along the western Baja California peninsula of Mexico near
where the center passes the coast in areas of onshore winds, or
east of the center if Hilary makes landfall. The surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula over
the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Hilary Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092023
900 AM MDT Fri Aug 18 2023
 
After an impressive 70-kt increase in winds over the past 24 hours,
Hilary's intensity has leveled off.  Satellite data indicate that
Hilary remains an impressive major hurricane with a 15-20 n mi
diameter eye and symmetric convective cloud pattern surrounding that
feature.  A blend of the latest satellite intensity estimates
support holding the initial intensity steady at 125 kt.  Microwave
data is showing some signs of a double eyewall structure, which is
quite common in strong hurricanes like Hilary.  Hilary is quite
large with its tropical-storm-force winds extending up to 250 n mi
from the center. The Air Force Hurricane Hunters are scheduled to
investigate the hurricane later today, and the data they collect
will provide a better assessment of the system's strength and
structure.
 
Hilary has turned to the northwest with the initial motion estimated 
to be 305/9 kt.  A general north-northwest to north motion with a 
steady increase in forward speed is expected later today and through 
the weekend as the system is steered by the flow between a strong 
subtropical ridge over the south-central U.S. and a mid- to 
upper-level low off the central California coast.  This pattern 
should take the core of Hilary near the central Baja California 
Peninsula coast Saturday night and then inland over southern 
California Sunday night.  The models are in fairly good agreement, 
and little change was made to the previous track forecast.  It 
should be noted that strong winds and heavy rains will occur well 
ahead of the center.
 
Fluctuations in the hurricane's strength are expected today, but
Hilary is expected to begin weakening late tonight as it moves over
progressively cooler SSTs and into an environment of increasing
shear and drier air.  The NHC intensity forecast follows the HCCA
and IVCN models and is largely an update of the previous one.
 
Based on the forecast, a Tropical Storm Watch has been issued for
portions of southern California.  This is the first time NHC has
issued a watch for that region.  Supplemental soundings (weather
balloons) are being launched by much of the National Weather Service
offices across the western U.S.  This effort is highly appreciated
as the data should help provide a better assessment of the
environment and steering pattern ahead of Hilary.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall associated with Hilary could produce areas of
flash flooding and result in landslides over portions of the Baja
California Peninsula late tonight through late Sunday.  Rainfall
impacts from Hilary within the Southwestern United States are
expected to peak this weekend into Monday. Flash, urban, and arroyo
flooding is expected, with the potential for rare and dangerous
impacts.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are expected within portions of the
hurricane warning area along the west-central coast of the Baja
California Peninsula on Sunday and are possible in the Hurricane
Watch area.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Sunday in portions of
southern California where a Tropical Storm Watch has been issued.
 
4. Large swells from Hilary will spread northward along the coast of
southwestern Mexico and the Baja California Peninsula.  These swells
will reach the Gulf of California and northern portions of the Baja
California Peninsula later this weekend.
