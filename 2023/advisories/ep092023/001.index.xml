Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 AM PDT Wed Aug 16 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Fernanda, located about 1100 miles west-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Off the Coast of Southwestern Mexico (EP90):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms are continuing to show signs of <br/>
organization in association with a broad area of low pressure <br/>
located several hundred miles south-southeast of Manzanillo, Mexico. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear conducive for continued development, <br/>
and a tropical depression or tropical storm is likely to form within <br/>
the next day or so. The system is expected to move <br/>
west-northwestward to northwestward, roughly parallel to the coast <br/>
of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula during the <br/>
next several days.  Additional information on this system, including <br/>
gale warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the <br/>
National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Central America and Southern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure could form south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec <br/>
over the weekend. Some gradual development of this system is <br/>
possible thereafter while it moves generally west-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service<br/>

SUMMARY OF 500 AM HST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.1N 126.8W
ABOUT 1165 MI...1875 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM HST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fernanda was
located near latitude 17.1 North, longitude 126.8 West.  Fernanda is
moving toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h) and this general 
motion is expected to continue for the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Continued rapid weakening is forecast during the 
next 48 hours, and Fernanda is likely to become a post-tropical 
remnant low within a couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).

Tropical Storm Fernanda Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072023
500 AM HST Wed Aug 16 2023
 
Fernanda's rapid weakening continues, and there is little if any 
deep convection remaining in association with the system.  Given the 
lack of convection, it is difficult to estimate the current 
intensity of the cyclone via the Dvorak satellite technique.  
However assuming a fairly rapid spin down, the current intensity is 
set to 55 kt for this advisory, with a significant amount of 
uncertainty.

The storm has turned a little to the left and the current motion is 
just slightly south of due west, or 260/13 kt.  The steering pattern 
is expected to be fairly straightforward with a mid-level ridge 
established the north of the cyclone.  This should result in a 
continued westward motion for the next few days.  The official track 
forecast is close to the corrected dynamical model consensus 
guidance.

Fernanda is crossing the SST gradient and should be moving over 
progressively cooler waters.  Therefore, the system is not likely to 
regenerate sustained deep convection, and continued rapid weakening 
is likely. The cyclone should drop below tropical storm strength 
tomorrow and weaken to dissipation in 72 hours if not sooner.

located near latitude 12.4 North, longitude 102.6 West. Hilary is
moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this
general motion is expected to continue with a gradual turn to the
northwest in a day or so.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Steady to rapid strengthening is forecast for the next few days.
Hilary is expected to become a hurricane on Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the 
coast of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula over 
the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Hilary Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092023
1000 AM CDT Wed Aug 16 2023

The disturbance south of the southern coast of Mexico has increased 
in organization this morning.  Satellite imagery indicates that it 
has a well-defined circulation, with convective banding features 
that are becoming better defined.  Subjective Dvorak estimates from 
TAFB and SAB are at T1.5 and T2.0, respectively, however the 
T-number from TAFB was constrained.  First-light visible satellite 
imagery confirms the organizing trend and, based on the improved 
appearance of the cloud pattern over the past few hours, the system 
is being upgraded to Tropical Storm Hilary.

Hilary is moving west-northwestward at 12 kt.  A building ridge over 
the United States and a trough off the coast of California are the 
main steering features affecting the storm.  The tropical cyclone 
is forecast to make a gradual turn to the northwest in 24 hours, 
and then turn more northward between the trough and the western 
periphery of the ridge by day 3.  Global model guidance is 
relatively well-clustered for the first 3 days, with some larger 
cross-track differences by day 4 and beyond.  The official track 
forecast is closest to the simple and corrected consensus aids.   

The environmental and oceanic conditions appear ripe for further 
strengthening.  Sea surface temperatures are at or near a warm 30 
degrees C through 72 h, vertical wind shear is expected to be 
weak, and the near-storm relative humidities are moist.  
Statistical intensity guidance show high probabilities of rapid 
intensification in the next couple of days.  Therefore, the NHC 
intensity prediction explicitly shows rapid intensification in the 
first 24 hours and Hilary is expected to become a hurricane on 
Thursday.  However, the system is broad and it could take slightly 
longer to consolidate and strengthen.  The storm is likely to reach 
its peak intensity in 60-72 hours.  By day 4, the vertical wind 
shear is forecast to increase and the track forecast moves Hilary 
over waters cooler than 26 degree C.  Convection will likely 
collapse and the system is expected to become post-tropical by day 
5.

It is important to remind users to not focus on the exact forecast 
track and intensity of Hilary, especially in the latter parts of 
the forecast period. 

KEY MESSAGES:

1. Hilary has the potential to bring impacts to the Baja California 
Peninsula and portions of the southwestern United States this 
weekend.  Although it is too soon to determine the location and 
magnitude of rainfall and wind impacts, interests in these areas 
should monitor the progress of Hilary and updates to the forecast.

2. Large swells from Hilary will spread northward along the coast 
of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California Peninsula during the 
next days.
