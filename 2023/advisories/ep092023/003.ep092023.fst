DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Hilary was 
located near latitude 13.4 North, longitude 105.1 West. Hilary is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). This general 
motion should continue for the next day or so, followed by a turn 
northwestward on Friday, and north-northwestward on Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Rapid intensification is forecast over the next 
24-36 hours, and Hilary is forecast to become a major hurricane by 
the end of the week. 

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the 
coast of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula over 
the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
