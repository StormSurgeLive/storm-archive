DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM PDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Hilary was located
near latitude 27.4 North, longitude 115.0 West.  The hurricane is
moving toward the north-northwest near 21 mph (33 km/h).  Hilary is
expected to accelerate as it moves north-northwestward to northward
during the next day or two.  On the forecast track, the center of
Hilary will move close to the west-central coast of the Baja
California Peninsula during the next few hours, and then move across
southern California this afternoon.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts. Weakening is expected, but Hilary is likely to still be a
hurricane while it passes near the west coast of the central Baja
California Peninsula this morning.  Hilary is expected to weaken to
a tropical storm before it reaches southern California.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles
(370 km). A sustained wind of 44 mph (71 km/h) and a gust of 67 mph
(108 km/h) were recently reported at Isla Cedros, Mexico.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 974 mb (28.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hilary can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml.
 
RAINFALL:  Hilary is expected to produce storm total rainfall
amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated maximum amounts up to 10
inches, across portions of the northern Baja California Peninsula
through tonight. Flash and urban flooding, locally catastrophic, is
expected, especially in the northern portions of the peninsula.
 
Heavy rainfall in association with Hilary is expected across the
Southwestern United States, most intense from today into Monday
morning.  Rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated amounts
of 10 inches, are expected across portions of southern California
and southern Nevada.  Dangerous to catastrophic flooding is
expected.  Across portions of Oregon and Idaho, rainfall totals of
1 to 3 inches with local maxima to 5 inches are expected through
Tuesday morning, resulting in localized, some significant, flash
flooding.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area this morning and are possible within the hurricane
watch area later today.  Tropical storm conditions are occurring
within the southern portion of the tropical storm warning area and
will spread northward today.  Tropical storm conditions are expected
to begin in southern California later today.
 
Winds could be particularly strong and gusty in and near areas of
elevated terrain.  Higher gusts are expected well inland and will
persist even after the system becomes post-tropical.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal
flooding along the western Baja California peninsula of Mexico near
where the center passes the coast in areas of onshore winds, or east
of the center if Hilary makes landfall. The surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.  Coastal flooding is
possible along the northern coast of the Gulf of California today
through early Monday.
 
TORNADOES: A tornado or two may occur today from mid-morning through
the evening over parts of the lower Colorado River Valley, Mojave
Desert, and Imperial Valley regions.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the
Baja California Peninsula and southern California over the next
couple of days.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.

Hurricane Hilary Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092023
900 PM MDT Sat Aug 19 2023
 
Hilary's cloud pattern has continued to gradually decay this
evening.  The eye is no longer discernible and the convective cloud
tops have warmed near the center.  However, there are plenty of
curved bands around the circulation, and these continue to spread
well northward into the Baja California Peninsula. Subjective and
objective satellite intensity estimates have continued to decrease
and the initial intensity has been reduced to 80 kt. Another Air
Force Reserve reconnaissance mission is schedule overnight which
should provide better information about the structure and intensity
of the cyclone.
 
The initial motion estimate is north-northwestward or 345/15 kt.
The flow between a strong mid-level ridge over the south-central
United States and a mid- to upper-level low over off the central
coast of California will steer Hilary north-northwestward at an
increasingly faster pace during the next 12 to 24 hours.  This will
bring the center of Hilary near the west-central coast of the Baja
California peninsula late tonight or early Sunday and into southern
California by late Sunday afternoon.  The NHC track forecast is
again very similar to the previous advisory and lies near the
middle of the tightly clustered guidance envelope.  Users are
reminded that the exact details of the track forecast, including
where Hilary might make landfall, are of little overall importance
since strong winds and heavy rainfall will extend far from the
center.  These hazards are already spreading northward over the
Baja California Peninsula well in advance of the arrival of the
center.
 
Cooler waters, drier air, and increasing vertical wind will continue
to cause a decrease in intensity as Hillary moves northward.
However, the cyclone is expected to still be a hurricane when it
moves near or over the west-central coast of the Baja California
Peninsula overnight, and confidence remains high that Hilary will 
move into southern California as a tropical storm. 
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Preparations for flooding impacts associated with Hilary should
be completed as soon as possible, as heavy rainfall will begin well
in advance of the center. In the Southwestern United States, the
potentially historic amount of rainfall is expected to cause flash,
urban, and arroyo flooding including landslides, mudslides, and
debris flows. Dangerous to locally catastrophic flooding impacts are
expected early Sunday through early Monday.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are expected along the west-central coast of
the Baja California Peninsula within the hurricane warning area
tonight and Sunday morning, and are possible in the Hurricane Watch
area on Sunday.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin Sunday in
portions of the southwestern U.S. within the Tropical Storm
Warning area.  Winds could be particularly strong and gusty in and
near areas of higher terrain.  Gusty winds are expected to spread
well inland across the western United States.
 
4. Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the
Baja California Peninsula and southern California over the next
couple of days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.
