Post-Tropical Cyclone Fernanda Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072023
500 AM HST Thu Aug 17 2023
 
Fernanda has lacked convective activity since yesterday evening and 
is therefore considered a post-tropical cyclone.  With no 
convective activity, Dvorak estimates are no longer a reliable 
source for intensity guidance.  The initial intensity is lowered to 
30 kt for this advisory largely based on the trend in geostationary 
satellite imagery.  An occasional burst of convection is still 
possible given 25-26 degrees C sea surface temperatures along the 
forecast track of Fernanda. Model guidance indicates the cyclone 
will continue to weaken in an increasingly dry and stable 
environment for the next few days and is likely to dissipate by 
day 3. 

The remnant low is moving westward at 13 kt.  This general motion 
is expected to continue for the next few days as the system is 
steered by the low-level flow around a ridge to its north.

For additional information on the remnant low please see High
Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.  Those 
forecasts can be found under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI and WMO 
header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 PM MDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Hilary was
located near latitude 15.8 North, longitude 108.4 West.  Hilary is
moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h), and this
general motion is expected to continue through tonight.  A turn
toward the northwest is expected Friday morning, followed by a turn
toward the north-northwest and north on Saturday.  On the forecast
track, the center of Hilary will approach the Baja California
peninsula over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 105 mph (165 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional rapid strengthening is forecast 
during the next day or so, and Hilary is likely to become a major 
hurricane later today.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275
miles (445 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 965 mb (28.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Hilary is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 3 to 6
inches, with isolated maximum amounts up to 10 inches, across
portions of the Baja California Peninsula through Sunday night.
Flash flooding, locally significant, will be possible.
 
Heavy rainfall in association with Hilary is expected to impact the
Southwestern United States from Friday through early next week,
peaking on Sunday and Monday.  Rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches,
with isolated amounts in excess of 8 inches, will be possible across
portions of southern California and southern Nevada.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area by late Friday, and are possible within the watch area by
early Saturday.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula over
the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

<title>Hurricane Hilary Forecast Discussion Number 5</title>

Hurricane Hilary Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092023
900 AM MDT Thu Aug 17 2023
 
Hilary has continued to intensify rapidly.  The cloud pattern of 
this large hurricane is very impressive, with extremely intense 
deep convection and cloud tops to -80 deg C or colder.  
Well-defined banding features are evident over all quadrants of the 
circulation. The upper-level outflow pattern is quite symmetric and 
expanding.  Satellite intensity estimates are wide-ranging and 
the Dvorak technique rules do not allow subjective current 
intensity estimates much above 65-70 kt.  However based on data 
T-numbers the advisory intensity is set, perhaps conservatively, to 
75 kt. 
 
The hurricane is moving west-northwestward, or about 300/12 kt.  
Over the next few days, a mid-level ridge to the north of Hilary 
is forecast to shift eastward while a mid-level low remains near 
the California coast.  This evolution of the steering currents 
should result in a gradual turn toward the north in a couple of 
days, which would bring Hilary near the Baja California peninsula 
in 72 hours or so and near the U.S./California border in 3-4 days.  
The official forecast track is very similar to the previous one, 
and follows the HFIP corrected consensus, HCCA, guidance.  Although 
there is fairly high confidence in the track prediction, Hilary's 
oblique angle of approach to the west coast of the Baja California 
peninsula makes it nearly impossible to know at this point if the 
center will remain just offshore or move over the peninsula before 
reaching the southwestern United States.

Hilary is in an environment of low shear and high mid- to low-level 
humidity, and over very warm waters.  The SHIPS rapid 
intensification (RI) indices show extremely high probabilities of 
rapid intensification during the next day or so.  Therefore the 
official intensity forecast shows a 40-kt increase over the next 24 
hours.  Later in the forecast period, cooler waters and land 
interaction should result in some weakening.  The official wind 
speed forecast is near or a little above the latest HCCA guidance.  
The surface circulation is likely to be dissipated by day 5, but a 
day 5 forecast point (as a remnant low) is still provided to 
maintain a forecast track over southern California.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall associated with Hilary may produce areas of flash 
flooding and result in landslides over portions of Baja California 
Peninsula from late Friday into late Sunday.  Rainfall impacts from 
Hilary within the Southwestern United States are expected to peak 
this weekend into Monday. Flash, urban, and arroyo flooding, is 
possible with the potential for significant impacts.

2. Hilary has the potential to bring significant impacts to the
Baja California Peninsula and portions of the southwestern United
States this weekend and early next week, including after it becomes
post-tropical.  Although it is too soon to determine the location
and magnitude of wind impacts, interests in these areas should
monitor the progress of Hilary and updates to the forecast.  
Tropical Storm Warnings and Watches are now in effect for 
southern portions of Baja California Sur, and additional watches or 
warnings will likely be required later today.
 
3. Large swells from Hilary will spread northward along the coast
of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California Peninsula during the
next several days.
