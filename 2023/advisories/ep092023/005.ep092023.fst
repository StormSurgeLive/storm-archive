DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Hilary was located
near latitude 15.5 North, longitude 107.8 West.  Hilary is moving
toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue through tonight.  A turn toward the 
northwest is expected Friday morning, followed by a turn toward the 
north-northwest and north on Saturday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Hilary will approach the Baja California peninsula over 
the weekend.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Rapid strengthening is forecast during the next 
day or so, and Hilary could become a major hurricane later today.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275
miles (445 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Hilary is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 
inches, with isolated maximum amounts up to 10 inches, across 
portions of the Baja California Peninsula through Sunday night. 
Flash flooding, locally significant, will be possible.

Heavy rainfall in association with Hilary is expected to impact the 
Southwestern United States from Friday through early next week, 
peaking on Sunday and Monday. Rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches, 
with isolated amounts in excess of 8 inches, will be possible across 
portions of southern California and southern Nevada.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area by late Friday, and are possible within the watch area by
early Saturday.

SURF:  Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula over
the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
