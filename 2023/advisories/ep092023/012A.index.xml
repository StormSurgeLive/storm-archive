DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM MDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Hilary was located
near latitude 21.5 North, longitude 113.4 West.  Hilary is moving
toward the north-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A faster motion
toward the north-northwest is expected to begin later today, 
followed by an even faster motion toward the north by Sunday night. 
On the forecast track, the center of Hilary will move close to the
west-central coast of the Baja California peninsula tonight and on
Sunday and move across southern California Sunday afternoon and 
Sunday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Hilary is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Weakening is expected to begin today, but
Hilary will still be a hurricane when it approaches the west coast
of the Baja California peninsula tonight and Sunday morning. Hilary
is expected to weaken to a tropical storm by midday Sunday before it
reaches southern California.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 50 miles (85 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 265
miles (425 km).  A sustained wind of 46 mph (74 km/h) and a gust to
62 mph (100 km/h) were recently reported at the Cabo San Lucas
Marina.
 
The minimum central pressure is estimated to be 943 mb (27.85 
inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hilary can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml.
 
RAINFALL:  Hilary is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 3 to 6
inches, with isolated maximum amounts up to 10 inches, across
portions of the Baja California Peninsula through Sunday night.
Flash and urban flooding, locally catastrophic, will be likely,
especially in the northern portions of the peninsula.
 
Heavy rainfall in association with Hilary is expected across the
Southwestern United States, peaking on Sunday, and possibly lasting
through Monday. Rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated
amounts of 10 inches, are expected across portions of southern
California and southern Nevada. Dangerous to locally catastrophic
flooding will be likely.  Elsewhere across portions of the Western
United States, rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected,
resulting in localized flash flooding.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area tonight and early Sunday and are possible within the
hurricane watch on Sunday.  Tropical storm conditions are occurring
within the southern portion of the tropical storm warning area and
will spread northward today and Sunday.  Tropical storm conditions
are possible within the tropical storm watch area today and tonight.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in southern
California on Sunday.
 
Winds could be particularly strong and gusty in and near areas of
higher terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal
flooding along the western Baja California peninsula of Mexico near
where the center passes the coast in areas of onshore winds, or
east of the center if Hilary makes landfall. The surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two may occur Sunday over parts of the
lower Colorado River Valley, Mojave Desert and Imperial Valley
regions.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico, the Baja California peninsula, and
southern California over the next few days.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Hilary Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092023
300 AM MDT Sat Aug 19 2023
 
Hilary continues to display a large and well-defined eye, surrounded 
by very cold convective cloud tops of -75 degrees Celsius.  There 
has been some noticeable thinning of the convection on the western 
side of the circulation, which could indicate that the hurricane is 
beginning to pull down cooler, more stable air from the north.  That 
said, an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft measured peak 
700-mb flight-level winds of 128 kt, which still supports an initial 
intensity of 115 kt.  The plane also found that the central pressure 
has dropped slightly to 943 mb.
 
Hilary continues to move toward the north-northwest, or 335/11 kt.  
Southerly flow between a large mid-level high over the Central 
Plains and a cut-off low near the central California coast is 
expected to accelerate Hilary north-northwestward and then 
northward during the next 48 hours, with its forward motion likely 
reaching 25-30 kt by the time the system reaches southern 
California on Sunday.  In fact, the track guidance has sped up 
again on this cycle, and the updated NHC track forecast is a little 
faster than the previous forecast after 24 hours.  Users are 
reminded that the exact details of the track forecast, including 
where Hilary might make landfall, are of little overall importance 
since strong winds and heavy rainfall will extend far from the 
center.  These hazards will also begin well in advance of the 
arrival of the center.
 
The degradation of the convection on Hilary's western side probably 
suggests that weakening will begin very soon.  Hilary's circulation 
will begin moving over sea surface temperatures colder than 26 
degrees Celsius later this morning, and the cooler waters and 
corresponding more stable air mass are likely to cause fast 
weakening over the next couple of days.  Hilary is expected to pass 
near the west-central coast of the Baja California peninsula still 
as a hurricane tonight, but then weaken to a tropical storm by 
Sunday while it's moving near the northwestern coast of the 
peninsula.  Hilary will still be producing tropical-storm-force 
winds when it reaches southern California on Sunday.  The 
circulation is likely to dissipate around or soon after 48 hours, 
but a 60-hour forecast point is still provided for track continuity.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall associated with Hilary will begin well in advance 
of the center, from the Baja California Peninsula into the 
Southwestern United States. Preparations for the impacts of flooding 
from rainfall should be completed as soon as possible, as heavy rain 
will increase ahead of the center today. In the Southwestern United 
States, flash, urban, and arroyo flooding is expected, with 
dangerous and locally catastrophic impacts likely from tonight into 
Monday.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are expected along the west-central coast of 
the Baja California Peninsula within the hurricane warning area 
tonight and Sunday morning, and are possible in the Hurricane Watch 
area on Sunday.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin on Sunday in 
southern California within the Tropical Storm Warning area.  Winds 
could be particularly strong and gusty in and near areas of higher 
terrain.
 
4. Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico, the Baja California peninsula, and
southern California over the next few days. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
