ABOUT 1235 MI...1990 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 260 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM HST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fernanda was
located near latitude 16.8 North, longitude 127.8 West. Fernanda is
moving toward the west near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this general
motion is expected to continue for the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Continued weakening is forecast during the next 
couple of days, and Fernanda is likely to become a post-tropical 
cyclone by tonight and dissipate by the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).

Tropical Storm Fernanda Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072023
1100 AM HST Wed Aug 16 2023
 
Fernanda's weakening trend appears to be continuing.  Deep
convection remains minimal, and is confined to a few cells over the
southwestern portion of the circulation while the system moves over
marginal SSTs and into a dry low- to mid-level air mass. There have
been no recent scatterometer overpasses from which to estimate
intensity.  Assuming a continued spin down of the circulation, the
advisory intensity is set to a somewhat uncertain 45 kt.
 
The cyclone has been moving just slightly south of due west or
260/12 kt.  A mid-level ridge is forecast to remain established to
the north of Fernanda through 72 hours.  This should maintain a
mostly westward track for the next few days.  There is little
change to the new official track forecast, which remains close to
the multi-model dynamical consensus.
 
Sea surface temperatures beneath the cyclone should gradually
decrease and the environmental air mass is expected to become even
drier over the next couple of days.  Therefore, continued weakening
is expected which should result in Fernanda degenerating into a
post-tropical cyclone in 12 hours and dissipating within 72 hours.

Tropical Storm Hilary Advisory Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092023
400 PM CDT Wed Aug 16 2023
 
...HILARY EXPECTED TO BECOME A HURRICANE TOMORROW...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 400 PM CDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...13.7N 103.7W
ABOUT 370 MI...590 KM S OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1002 MB...29.59 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Baja California Sur should monitor the progress of this
system.  Watches will likely be required for a portion of that area
as soon as this evening.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Hilary was 
located near latitude 13.7 North, longitude 103.7 West. Hilary is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h). This general 
motion is expected to continue with a gradual turn to the northwest 
by Friday followed by a turn to the north-northwest on Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Steady to rapid strengthening is forecast for the next few days.
Hilary is expected to become a hurricane on Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula over
the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult

<title>Tropical Storm Hilary Forecast Discussion Number 1</title>

Tropical Storm Hilary Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092023
1000 AM CDT Wed Aug 16 2023

The disturbance south of the southern coast of Mexico has increased 
in organization this morning.  Satellite imagery indicates that it 
has a well-defined circulation, with convective banding features 
that are becoming better defined.  Subjective Dvorak estimates from 
TAFB and SAB are at T1.5 and T2.0, respectively, however the 
T-number from TAFB was constrained.  First-light visible satellite 
imagery confirms the organizing trend and, based on the improved 
appearance of the cloud pattern over the past few hours, the system 
is being upgraded to Tropical Storm Hilary.

Hilary is moving west-northwestward at 12 kt.  A building ridge over 
the United States and a trough off the coast of California are the 
main steering features affecting the storm.  The tropical cyclone 
is forecast to make a gradual turn to the northwest in 24 hours, 
and then turn more northward between the trough and the western 
periphery of the ridge by day 3.  Global model guidance is 
relatively well-clustered for the first 3 days, with some larger 
cross-track differences by day 4 and beyond.  The official track 
forecast is closest to the simple and corrected consensus aids.   

The environmental and oceanic conditions appear ripe for further 
strengthening.  Sea surface temperatures are at or near a warm 30 
degrees C through 72 h, vertical wind shear is expected to be 
weak, and the near-storm relative humidities are moist.  
Statistical intensity guidance show high probabilities of rapid 
intensification in the next couple of days.  Therefore, the NHC 
intensity prediction explicitly shows rapid intensification in the 
first 24 hours and Hilary is expected to become a hurricane on 
Thursday.  However, the system is broad and it could take slightly 
longer to consolidate and strengthen.  The storm is likely to reach 
its peak intensity in 60-72 hours.  By day 4, the vertical wind 
shear is forecast to increase and the track forecast moves Hilary 
over waters cooler than 26 degree C.  Convection will likely 
collapse and the system is expected to become post-tropical by day 
5.

It is important to remind users to not focus on the exact forecast 
track and intensity of Hilary, especially in the latter parts of 
the forecast period. 

KEY MESSAGES:

1. Hilary has the potential to bring impacts to the Baja California 
Peninsula and portions of the southwestern United States this 
weekend.  Although it is too soon to determine the location and 
magnitude of rainfall and wind impacts, interests in these areas 
should monitor the progress of Hilary and updates to the forecast.

2. Large swells from Hilary will spread northward along the coast 
of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California Peninsula during the 
next days.
