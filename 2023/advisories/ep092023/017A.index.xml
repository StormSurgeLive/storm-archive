DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM PDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Hilary was 
located on the coast near latitude 29.9 North, longitude 115.6 West. 
Hilary is moving quickly toward the north-northwest near 25 mph (41 
km/h). Hilary is expected to accelerate even more as it moves 
north-northwestward to northward during the next day or so.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Hilary will move over the northern 
portion of the Baja California Peninsula during the next few hours, 
and then move across southern California later this afternoon.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Weakening is expected, but Hilary is expected to remain a
tropical storm before it reaches southern California.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km)
from the center.  An observation in Round Potrero, California, 
recently reported a sustained wind of 39 mph (64 km/h) with a gust 
to 63 mph (102 km/h).  An observation in Crestwood, California, 
recorded a sustained wind of 38 mph (61 km/h) and a gust of 53 mph 
(85 km/h).  In Playa El Paraiso, Mexico, an observation recorded 
sustained winds of 36 mph (57 km/h) and a gust of 53 mph (85 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 988 mb (29.18 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hilary can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml.
 
RAINFALL:  Hilary is expected to produce storm total rainfall
amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with maximum amounts up to 10 inches,
across portions of the northern Baja California Peninsula through
tonight. Flash and urban flooding, locally catastrophic, is
expected.
 
Intense heavy rainfall associated with Hilary is expected across the
Southwestern United States through early Monday morning. Rainfall
amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated maximum amounts of 10
inches, are expected across portions of southern California and
southern Nevada leading to dangerous to catastrophic flooding.
Across portions of Oregon and Idaho, rainfall totals of 1 to 3
inches with local maxima to 5 inches are expected through Tuesday
morning, resulting in localized, some significant, flash flooding.
 
A list of rainfall observations compiled by the NOAA Weather
Prediction Center for this storm can be found at:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring within the tropical
storm warning area within the Baja California Peninsula and will
continue through today.  Tropical storm conditions are beginning in 
the tropical storm warning in southern California and will spread 
northward through the afternoon.
 
Winds could be particularly strong and gusty in and near areas of
elevated terrain.  Higher gusts are expected well inland and will
persist even after the system becomes post-tropical.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal
flooding along the western Baja California peninsula of Mexico near
where the center passes the coast in areas of onshore winds, or east
of the center if Hilary makes landfall. The surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.  Coastal flooding is
possible along the northern coast of the Gulf of California today
through early Monday.
 
TORNADOES: A couple tornadoes are possible through this evening over
southeast California, western Arizona, southern Nevada, and far
southwest Utah.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the
Baja California Peninsula and southern California over the next
day or so.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 200 PM PDT.

Tropical Storm Hilary Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092023
800 AM PDT Sun Aug 20 2023
 
The core of Hilary continues to move quickly north-northwestward
along or just off the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula.
Heavy rains are streaming northward and are now affecting portions
of western Mexico, the northern Baja California Peninsula and the
Southwestern United States.  The satellite appearance of Hilary
continues to degrade as dry and stable air wraps into the
circulation.  The Air Force Hurricane Hunters are investigating
Hilary and found that the pressure has increased to 984 mb and
maximum winds have dropped to near 60 kt, making Hilary a tropical
storm.
 
The storm is accelerating to the north-northwest, with the latest
initial motion estimated to be 345/22 kt.  An even faster motion to
the north-northwest is expected during the next day or so as Hilary
moves in the fast flow between a ridge over the south-central U.S.
and a mid- to upper-level low off the central California coast.
The center of Hilary is forecast to move into southern California
this afternoon and dissipate over the western U.S. on Monday.
 
Continued weakening due to cool waters, dry air, and land
interaction is expected, but Hilary is forecast to remain a
tropical storm before it reaches southern California later today.
The strongest winds are expected to be to the east of the center
and in areas of high terrain.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Preparations for flooding impacts across the Southwestern United
States should be completed with the peak intensity of heavy rainfall
expected later today through early Monday morning. The potentially
historic amount of rainfall is expected to cause life-threatening to
locally catastrophic flash, urban, and arroyo flooding including
landslides, mudslides, and debris flows through early Monday
morning. Localized flooding impacts, some significant, are also
expected across northern portions of the Intermountain West.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected across the central and
northern portions of the Baja California Peninsula within the
Tropical Storm Warning area through tonight.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin later today in
portions of the southwestern U.S. within the Tropical Storm Warning
area.  Winds could be particularly strong and gusty in and near
areas of higher terrain.  Gusty winds are expected to spread
well inland across the western United States.
 
4. Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the
Baja California Peninsula and southern California over the next
day or two. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.
