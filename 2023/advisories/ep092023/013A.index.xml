DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 PM MDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Hilary was 
located near latitude 22.8 North, longitude 113.9 West. Hilary is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h). The 
hurricane is expected to accelerate as it moves north-northwestward 
to northward during the next day or two. On the forecast track, the 
center of Hilary will move close to the west-central coast of the 
Baja California Peninsula tonight and Sunday morning then move 
across southern California Sunday afternoon and Sunday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Hilary is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Weakening is expected, but Hilary will still
be a hurricane when it approaches the west coast of the Baja
California Peninsula. Hilary is expected to weaken to a tropical
storm before it reaches southern California.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 50 miles (85 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 265
miles (425 km).  A sustained wind of 36 mph (57 km/h) and a gust to
52 mph (83 km/h) were recently reported at the Cabo San Lucas
Marina.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on data from the Air 
Force Hurricane Hunters is 958 mb (28.29 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hilary can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml.
 
RAINFALL:  Hilary is expected to produce storm total rainfall
amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated maximum amounts up to 10
inches, across portions of the northern Baja California Peninsula
through Sunday night. Flash and urban flooding, locally
catastrophic, is expected, especially in the northern portions of
the peninsula.
 
Heavy rainfall is expected across the Southwestern United States,
peaking late tonight through Sunday night. Rainfall amounts of 3 to
6 inches, with isolated amounts of 10 inches, are expected across
portions of southern California and southern Nevada. Dangerous to
catastrophic flooding is expected.  Elsewhere across portions of the
Western United States, rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are
expected, resulting in localized, some significant, flash flooding.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area tonight and early Sunday and are possible within the
hurricane watch on Sunday.  Tropical storm conditions are occurring
within the southern portion of the tropical storm warning area and
will spread northward today and Sunday.  Tropical storm conditions
are possible within the tropical storm watch area through tonight.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in southern
California Sunday afternoon.
 
Winds could be particularly strong and gusty in and near areas of
elevated terrain.  Higher gusts are expected well inland near and
along the forecast track.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal
flooding along the western Baja California peninsula of Mexico near
where the center passes the coast in areas of onshore winds, or
east of the center if Hilary makes landfall. The surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.  Coastal flooding is
possible along the northern coast of the Gulf of California Sunday
through early Monday.
 
TORNADOES: A tornado or two may occur Sunday from mid-morning
through the evening over parts of the lower Colorado River Valley,
Mojave Desert, and Imperial Valley regions.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the
Baja California Peninsula and southern California over the next
couple of days.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.

Hurricane Hilary Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092023
900 AM MDT Sat Aug 19 2023
 
Although Hilary continues to maintain a well-defined circular eye,
the convective pattern has become increasingly asymmetric during the
past several hours.  Deep convection has been eroding on the
system's west side as dry and stable air has been wrapping into
that portion of the circulation.  A blend of the latest satellite
intensity estimates supports nudging the initial intensity downward
to 110 kt for this advisory.  The Air Force Hurricane Hunters are
scheduled to investigate the system later today, and the data they
collect will provide a better assessment of Hilary's intensity and
structure.

The major hurricane continues to turn to the right, and the latest 
initial motion is north-northwestward, or 345/14 kt.  The steering 
currents are well established and consist of a strong mid-level high 
pressure area over the south-central U.S. and a mid- to upper-level 
low off the central California coast.  The flow between these 
features should cause Hilary to accelerate to the north-northwest or 
north during the next day or two, with the core of the system 
reaching the central portion of the Baja California Peninsula 
tonight and southern California Sunday afternoon or evening.  Users 
are reminded that the exact details of the track forecast, including 
where Hilary might make landfall, are of little overall importance 
since strong winds and heavy rainfall will extend far from the 
center.  These hazards will also begin well in advance of the 
arrival of the center.

Hilary is expected to weaken quickly while it moves northward due to 
significantly cooler waters, drier air, and an increase in vertical 
wind shear.  Even though weakening is anticipated, Hilary is still 
expected to be a hurricane when it moves near or over the central 
portion of the Baja California peninsula, but is expected to decay 
to a tropical storm before it moves over southern California. The 
intensity models are in good agreement, and the NHC forecast is 
near the middle of the guidance envelope.


KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Preparations for flooding impacts should be completed as soon as 
possible, as heavy rainfall will begin well in advance of the 
center. In the Southwestern U.S., the potentially historic 
amount of rainfall is expected to cause flash, urban, and arroyo 
flooding including landslides, mudslides, and debris flows. 
Dangerous to locally catastrophic flooding impacts are expected late 
tonight through early Monday.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are expected along the west-central coast of
the Baja California Peninsula within the hurricane warning area
tonight and Sunday morning, and are possible in the Hurricane Watch
area on Sunday.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin Sunday afternoon 
in portions of the southwestern U.S. within the Tropical Storm 
Warning area.  Winds could be particularly strong and gusty in and 
near areas of higher terrain.
 
4. Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the 
Baja California Peninsula and southern California over the next 
couple of days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening 
surf and rip current conditions.
