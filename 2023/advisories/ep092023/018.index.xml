DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM PDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Hilary was
located inland near latitude 31.3 North, longitude 116.1 West. 
Hilary is moving toward the north near 23 mph (37 km/h) and the 
storm is expected to accelerate even more as it moves
north-northwestward to northward during the next day or so.  On the
forecast track, the center of Hilary will move across southern 
California in the next few hours.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is expected to continue, but Hilary is forecast to remain 
a tropical storm while it moves across southern California.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
from the center.  A sustained wind of 47 mph (75 km/h) with a gust 
of 70 mph (113 km/h) was reported at Sill Hill, California.   A 
sustained wind of 47 mph (75 km/h) with a gust of 72 mph (116 km/h) 
was reported at Hauser Mountain, California.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.24 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hilary can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml.
 
RAINFALL:  Hilary is expected to produce storm total rainfall
amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with maximum amounts up to 10 inches,
across portions of the northern Baja California Peninsula through
tonight. Flash and urban flooding, locally catastrophic, is
expected.
 
Intense heavy rainfall associated with Hilary is expected across the
Southwestern United States through early Monday morning. Rainfall
amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated maximum amounts of 10
inches, are expected across portions of southern California and
southern Nevada leading to dangerous to catastrophic flooding.
Across portions of Oregon and Idaho, rainfall totals of 1 to 3
inches with local maxima to 5 inches are expected through Tuesday
morning, resulting in localized significant flash flooding.
 
A list of rainfall observations compiled by the NOAA Weather
Prediction Center for this storm can be found at:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue through the evening 
in the Tropical Storm Warning area in the Baja California 
Peninsula.  Tropical storm conditions will continue through tonight 
in the warning area in southern California.
 
Winds could be particularly strong and gusty in and near areas of
elevated terrain.  Higher gusts are expected well inland and will
persist even after the system becomes post-tropical.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal
flooding along the western Baja California peninsula of Mexico near
where the center passes the coast in areas of onshore winds, or east
of the center if Hilary makes landfall. The surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.  Coastal flooding is
possible along the northern coast of the Gulf of California today
through early Monday.
 
TORNADOES: A couple tornadoes are possible through this evening over
southeast California, western Arizona, southern Nevada, and far
southwest Utah.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the
Baja California Peninsula and southern California over the next
day or so.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 500 PM PDT.
Next complete advisory at 800 PM PDT.

Tropical Storm Hilary Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092023
200 PM PDT Sun Aug 20 2023
 
Hilary made landfall over the northern Baja California Peninsula a
few hours ago with maximum winds estimated to be around 55 kt.
Since then the storm has continued to move north-northwestward with
the center now nearing the California/Mexico border.  Maximum
sustained winds are now estimated to be near 50 kt based on the
earlier aircraft data and satellite estimates.  Surface
observations indicate that tropical-storm-force winds have spread
into southern California and there have been a few reports of gusts
around hurricane force.  In addition, radar images show that bands
of heavy rain have spread across portions of the southwestern United
States and this will continue through early Monday.
 
The storm is moving quickly to the north-northwest, with the latest
initial motion estimated to be 345/20 kt.  An even faster motion to
the north-northwest is expected during the next day or so as Hilary
moves in the fast flow between a ridge over the south-central U.S.
and a mid- to upper-level low off the central California coast.
Little change was made to the previous track forecast.
 
Continued weakening due to dry air, and land interaction is 
expected, but Hilary is forecast to remain a tropical storm while it 
moves over southern California through tonight. The strongest winds 
are expected to be to the east of the center and in areas of high 
terrain.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Preparations for flooding impacts across the Southwestern United
States should be completed with the peak intensity of heavy rainfall
expected later today through early Monday morning. The potentially
historic amount of rainfall is expected to cause life-threatening to
locally catastrophic flash, urban, and arroyo flooding including
landslides, mudslides, and debris flows through early Monday
morning. Localized flooding impacts, some significant, are also
expected across northern portions of the Intermountain West.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue across the
northern portion of the Baja California Peninsula within the
Tropical Storm Warning area during the next few hours.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the
southwestern U.S. within the Tropical Storm Warning
area through tonight.  Winds could be particularly strong and
gusty in and near areas of higher terrain.  Gusty winds are
expected to spread well inland across the western United States.
 
4. Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the
Baja California Peninsula and southern California over the next
day or so. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.
