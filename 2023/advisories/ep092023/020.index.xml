DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM PDT (0900 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Hilary 
was located near latitude 38.3 North, longitude 117.9 West. The 
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the north near 29 mph (46 
km/h), and this general motion is expected to continue today. On the 
forecast track, the center of post-tropical Hilary will move quickly 
across Nevada today.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Post-tropical Hilary is forecast to dissipate later today.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hilary can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml.
 
RAINFALL:  Post-Tropical Hilary is expected to produce additional
rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches, with isolated storm total amounts
to 12 inches, across portions of Southern California and Southern
Nevada through today. Continued flash and urban flooding, locally
catastrophic, is expected.
 
Across portions of Oregon and Idaho, rainfall totals of 1 to 3
inches with local maxima to 5 inches are expected through Tuesday
morning, resulting in localized, some significant, flash flooding.
 
A list of rainfall observations compiled by the NOAA Weather
Prediction Center for this storm can be found at:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html
 
WIND:  Post-tropical Hilary is still expected to produce strong and
gusty winds in and near areas of elevated terrain today.
 
SURF:  Large swells will continue to affect portions of the Baja
California Peninsula and southern California through this morning.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane 
Center on Post-tropical Hilary. Future information on this system 
can be found in Public Advisories issued by the Weather Prediction 
Center beginning at 800 AM PDT, under AWIPS header TCPEP4, WMO

Post-Tropical Cyclone Hilary Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092023
200 AM PDT Mon Aug 21 2023
 
The circulation of Hilary has become quite diffuse tonight, making 
it difficult to track a coherent low-level center over the complex 
topography of southern California and Nevada. Satellite imagery 
indicates the storm has lost all tropical characteristics, as strong 
upper-level southerly winds have stripped away most of the 
associated shower activity well to the north. Hilary no longer 
satisfies the criteria of a tropical cyclone, and thus it has become 
post-tropical. Based on recent surface observations, the estimated 
maximum sustained winds are reduced to 30 kt for this advisory.
 
Despite its post-tropical classification, the system is still 
expected to produce heavy rainfall, significant flooding, and gusty 
winds as it races northward across the western United States today. 
Users should refer to products issued by their local National 
Weather Service office for more specific information on these 
threats. The circulation of post-tropical Hilary has been 
significantly disrupted by land interaction, and the system is 
likely to dissipate later today.
 
This is the last tropical cyclone discussion issued by the National
Hurricane Center on post-tropical Hilary. Future information on this
system can be found in discussions issued by the Weather Prediction
Center beginning at 800 AM PDT, under AWIPS header TCDEP4, WMO
header WTPZ44 KWNH, and on the web at www.hurricanes.gov.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Across the Southwestern United States, the ongoing and historic
amount of rainfall is expected to cause life-threatening to locally
catastrophic flash, urban, and arroyo flooding including landslides,
mudslides, and debris flows today. Localized flooding impacts, some
significant, are also expected across northern portions of the
Intermountain West into Tuesday morning.
 
2. Strong and gusty winds are expected to persist across portions
of the western United States today, particularly in and near areas
of higher terrain.
