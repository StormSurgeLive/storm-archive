DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM MDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Hilary was located
near latitude 19.1 North, longitude 112.4 West. Hilary is moving
toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). A turn toward the
north-northwest is expected tonight, followed by a faster motion
toward the north Saturday night and Sunday.  On the forecast track,
the center of Hilary will move close to the west coast of the Baja
California peninsula over the weekend and reach southern California
by Sunday night.

Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Hilary is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Fluctuations in intensity are likely through
tonight.  Weakening is expected to begin by Saturday, but Hilary
will still be a hurricane when it approaches the west coast of the
Baja California peninsula Saturday night and Sunday.  Hilary is
expected to weaken to a tropical storm by late Sunday before it
reaches southern California.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 50 miles (85 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275
miles (445 km). An automated weather station on Socorro Island has 
measured peak sustained winds of 47 mph (76 km/h) with a gust to 
79 mph (128 km/h) today.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 948 mb (28.00 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hilary can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml.

RAINFALL:  Hilary is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 3 to 6
inches, with isolated maximum amounts up to 10 inches, across
portions of the Baja California Peninsula through Sunday night.
Flash and urban flooding, locally catastrophic, will be possible,
especially in the northern portions of the peninsula.

Heavy rainfall in association with Hilary is expected to impact the
Southwestern United States through next Wednesday, peaking on Sunday
and Monday. Rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated amounts
of 10 inches, are expected across portions of southern California
and southern Nevada. Dangerous to locally catastrophic flooding will
be possible.  Elsewhere across portions of the Western United
States, rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected, resulting in
localized flash flooding.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area beginning Saturday night and are possible within the
hurricane watch by early Sunday. Tropical storm conditions are
expected within the warning area tonight, and are possible
within the watch area in Mexico on Saturday and Sunday and in
southern California beginning late Sunday.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal
flooding along the western Baja California peninsula of Mexico near
where the center passes the coast in areas of onshore winds, or
east of the center if Hilary makes landfall. The surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.

SURF:  Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico, the Baja California peninsula, and
south California over the next few days.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
