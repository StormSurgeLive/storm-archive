DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM MDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Hilary was located
near latitude 24.4 North, longitude 114.2 West. Hilary is moving
toward the north-northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h). The hurricane is
expected to accelerate as it moves north-northwestward to northward
during the next day or two. On the forecast track, the center of
Hilary will move close to the west-central coast of the Baja
California Peninsula tonight and Sunday morning then move across
southern California Sunday afternoon and Sunday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Continued weakening is expected, but Hilary will still be a
hurricane when it approaches the west coast of the Baja California
Peninsula tonight. Hilary is expected to weaken to a tropical storm 
before it reaches southern California.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 265
miles (425 km).  A sustained wind of 46 mph (74 km/h) and a gust of
58 mph (93 km/h) were recently reported at Loreto, Mexico.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 964 mb (28.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hilary can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml.
 
RAINFALL:  Hilary is expected to produce storm total rainfall
amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated maximum amounts up to 10
inches, across portions of the northern Baja California Peninsula
through Sunday night. Flash and urban flooding, locally
catastrophic, is expected, especially in the northern portions of
the peninsula.
 
Heavy rainfall is expected across the Southwestern United States,
peaking late tonight through Sunday night. Rainfall amounts of 3 to
6 inches, with isolated amounts of 10 inches, are expected across
portions of southern California and southern Nevada. Dangerous to
catastrophic flooding is expected.  Elsewhere across portions of the
Western United States, rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are
expected, resulting in localized significant flash flooding.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area tonight and early Sunday and are possible within the
hurricane watch on Sunday.  Tropical storm conditions are occurring
within the southern portion of the tropical storm warning area and
will spread northward tonight and Sunday.  Tropical storm conditions
are possible within the tropical storm watch area through tonight.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in southern
California on Sunday.
 
Winds could be particularly strong and gusty in and near areas of
elevated terrain.  Higher gusts are expected well inland and will
persist even after the system becomes post-tropical.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is likely to produce coastal
flooding along the western Baja California peninsula of Mexico near
where the center passes the coast in areas of onshore winds, or
east of the center if Hilary makes landfall. The surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.  Coastal flooding is
possible along the northern coast of the Gulf of California Sunday
through early Monday.
 
TORNADOES: A tornado or two may occur Sunday from mid-morning
through the evening over parts of the lower Colorado River Valley,
Mojave Desert, and Imperial Valley regions.
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the
Baja California Peninsula and southern California over the next
couple of days.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Hilary Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092023
300 PM MDT Sat Aug 19 2023
 
Hilary appears to be weakening quickly.  The eye is filling
and the cloud tops in the eyewall and rainbands have been warming
during the past several hours.  In addition, the hurricane has
become increasingly asymmetric with dry air continuing to wrap into
the western half of the circulation.  The Air Force Hurricane
Hunters have been investigating Hilary during the past few hours and
found that the minimum pressure has risen to 959 mb.  Blending the
aircraft flight-level wind and SFMR data, as well as some of the
satellite estimates yields an initial intensity of 95 kt, but that
could be a little generous.  Areas of heavy rain are already
spreading across portions of the Baja California Peninsula and the
Southwestern U.S.  Hilary is also producing a large area of high
seas along the coast of Baja California and the Gulf of California, 
with maximum significant wave heights estimated to be higher
than 40 ft.
 
The hurricane is still moving north-northwestward, or 345/15 kt. The
steering currents are well established and consist of a strong
mid-level high pressure area over the south-central U.S. and a mid-
to upper-level low off the central California coast.  The flow
between these features should cause Hilary to accelerate to the
north-northwest or north during the next day or two, with the core
of the system reaching the central portion of the Baja California
Peninsula tonight and southern California Sunday afternoon or
evening.  The NHC track forecast is largely the same as the previous
one and near the middle of the guidance envelope. Users are reminded
that the exact details of the track forecast, including where Hilary
might make landfall, are of little overall importance since strong
winds and heavy rainfall will extend far from the center.  These
hazards will also begin well in advance of the arrival of the
center.
 
Hilary is expected to continue weakening rather quickly while it 
moves northward due to significantly cooler waters, drier air, and 
an increase in vertical wind shear.  However, Hilary is still 
expected to be a hurricane when it makes landfall or moves very near 
the central portion of the Baja California Peninsula.  There is high 
confidence that Hilary will move into southern California as a 
tropical storm.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Preparations for flooding impacts should be completed as soon as
possible, as heavy rainfall will begin well in advance of the
center. In the Southwestern U.S., the potentially historic
amount of rainfall is expected to cause flash, urban, and arroyo
flooding including landslides, mudslides, and debris flows.
Dangerous to locally catastrophic flooding impacts are expected late
tonight through early Monday.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are expected along the west-central coast of
the Baja California Peninsula within the hurricane warning area
tonight and Sunday morning, and are possible in the Hurricane Watch
area on Sunday.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin Sunday in 
portions of the southwestern U.S. within the Tropical Storm
Warning area.  Winds could be particularly strong and gusty in and
near areas of higher terrain.  Gusty winds are expected to spread
well inland across the western U.S.
 
4. Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the
Baja California Peninsula and southern California over the next
couple of days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.
