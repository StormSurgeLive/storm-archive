moving toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h) and this general
motion is expected to continue for the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Continued weakening is forecast during the next
couple of days, and Fernanda is likely to become a post-tropical
cyclone tonight or Thursday and dissipate by the weekend.

 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).

Tropical Storm Fernanda Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072023
500 PM HST Wed Aug 16 2023
 
Fernanda has refused to give in to the increasingly inhibiting
environment and has recently produced a fragmented band with
associated -63 degree Celsius cloud top temperatures in the
west quadrant of the cyclone.  Assuming, however, that the
new burst is insufficient to maintain Fernanda's previous advisory
intensity of 45 kt, the initial intensity is lowered to 40 kt.
 
Cooler oceanic temperatures (sub 26C) and an very dry, stable 
marine-layer air mass should result in continued weakening. Fernanda 
is expected to degenerate into a post-tropical cyclone in 12 hours, 
with dissipation occurring this weekend.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be just south of due west, or 
265/13 kt.  There has been no change to the forecast track 
philosophy.  A subtropical ridge should remain anchored to the north 
of Fernanda during the next few days.  Accordingly, Fernanda is 
forecast to move generally westward through the period.  The track 
guidance remains tightly clustered, and only a slight along-track 
adjustment was needed for the latest NHC forecast.

-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...13.4N 105.1W
ABOUT 390 MI...630 KM S OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
ABOUT 725 MI...1170 KM SSE OF CABO SAN LUCAS MEXICO

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Baja California Sur should closely monitor the progress
of this system.  Watches will likely be required for a portion of
that area as soon as tomorrow morning.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Hilary was 
located near latitude 13.4 North, longitude 105.1 West. Hilary is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). This general 
motion should continue for the next day or so, followed by a turn 
northwestward on Friday, and north-northwestward on Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Rapid intensification is forecast over the next 
24-36 hours, and Hilary is forecast to become a major hurricane by 
the end of the week. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Large swells generated by Hilary will affect portions of the 
coast of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula over 
the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

Tropical Storm Hilary Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092023
400 PM CDT Wed Aug 16 2023
 
Hilary has not changed much this afternoon.  A large burst of 
convection, with cloud top temperatures colder than -85 degrees C, 
continues to obscure the low-level circulation and some outflow has 
developed on the southern semicircle of the storm.  Subjective and 
objective satellite intensity estimates range from 30 to 43 kt and 
the initial intensity is remains at 35 kt.
 
The storm is moving to the west-northwest at 13 kt.  Hilary is 
forecast to gradually turn, first to the northwest by day 2 and 
then to the north-northwest by day 3 with the same general forward 
motion. This is likely driven by a building ridge over the United 
States and a trough off the coast of California.  The short-term 
track prediction has shifted to the right of the previous forecast, 
largely due to an adjustment in the rather uncertain initial 
position.  It is closest to the simple consensus aid, TVCE.  
 
Strengthening is still expected due to the conducive atmospheric 
conditions and warm sea surface temperatures.  Hilary is forecast to 
be in an area of weak vertical wind shear through 72-96 hours and 
remain over warm waters through 72 hours.  Therefore, steady to 
rapid intensification is anticipated and the official forecast 
shows Hilary becoming a hurricane in 24 hours.  However, the system 
is broad and it could take slightly longer to initially consolidate 
and strengthen.  Beyond day 3, Hilary is forecast to cross over a 
gradient of cooling ocean waters which should induce a weakening 
trend.  The system is still expected to be post-tropical by the end 
of the forecast period.
 
It is important to remind users to not focus on the exact forecast 
track and intensity of Hilary, especially in the latter parts of the 
forecast period.  Due to the nearly parallel angle of approach to 
the Baja California peninsula, small changes in the cross track 
position may result in large changes to when and where the system 
ultimately approaches the coast.  Regardless, wind and rainfall 
impacts are likely to extend far from the center of Hilary.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Hilary has the potential to bring impacts to the Baja California
Peninsula and portions of the southwestern United States this
weekend.  Although it is too soon to determine the location and
magnitude of rainfall and wind impacts, interests in these areas
should monitor the progress of Hilary and updates to the forecast.
 
2. Large swells from Hilary will spread northward along the coast
of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California Peninsula during the
next days.
