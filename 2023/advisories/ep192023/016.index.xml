<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Pilar, located about 100 miles south of the coast of El <br/>
Salvador.<br/>
<br/>
Central East Pacific (EP93):<br/>
An area of low pressure located several hundred miles south- <br/>
southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula has <br/>
become a little better defined since yesterday.  However, the <br/>
thunderstorm activity remains limited and displaced well to the <br/>
north of the circulation center. Environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to become increasingly unfavorable for development during <br/>
the next day or two, and significant development of this system <br/>
appears unlikely as it meanders over the central portion of the <br/>
eastern Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

* Entire coast of El Salvador
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case over the next 6 to 12
hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was
located near latitude 12.5 North, longitude 90.5 West. Pilar is
moving toward the west near 7 mph (11 km/h). A faster west- 
southwestward motion is expected by tonight, and that motion should 
continue into Saturday. On the forecast track, the center of Pilar 
will be moving away from the coast of Central America later today 
and tonight. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of
days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Pilar is expected to produce additional rainfall of 2 to
4 inches, with local amounts to 6 inches, for portions of Central
America from southern El Salvador, across southern Honduras, western
Nicaragua, and northern Costa Rica through today. The additional
rainfall will likely produce flash and urban flooding, along with
mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting
the Pacific coast of Central America during the next couple of days.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the Tropical
Storm Watch area in El Salvador through early this afternoon.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
1000 AM CDT Wed Nov 01 2023
 
Deep convection has continued to burst over the western portion of 
Pilar's circulation this morning.  However, the cloud tops have been 
warming during the past couple of hours, and recent visible imagery 
still indicates that the low-level circulation is located near the 
eastern edge of the convection.  The initial intensity is again held 
at 50 kt, which is a blend of the latest subjective Dvorak T- and 
CI-numbers from TAFB and SAB.
 
Recent satellite fixes show that Pilar is now moving westward or
270 degrees at 6 kt. A much faster westward to west-southwestward
motion is expected during the next few days as a narrow mid-level
ridge builds across southern Mexico.  The dynamical model guidance
continues to trend toward a faster solution, and the NHC track
forecast has again been sped up from the previous advisory.  The
new forecast track lies between the previous interpolated forecast
and the latest HCCA and TVCE consensus aids.
 
The moderate shear that has been plaguing Pilar is expected to
continue for another day or so.  Although the shear may decrease
somewhat after that time, the storm is likely to encounter a drier
and more stable airmass from an ongoing Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind
event.  In addition, Pilar is expected to pass over an area of
slightly cooler upwelled waters to the south and southwest of the
Gulf of Tehuantepec.  As a result of these unfavorable conditions,
most of the dynamical model guidance shows gradual weakening
during the next few days, and the NHC intensity forecast follows
suit.  It should be noted that simulated satellite imagery from the
GFS suggests that Pilar could struggle to maintain organized deep
convection by the weekend.  The NHC forecast maintains Pilar as a
tropical cyclone for the entire 5-day period, but it is possible
that the system degenerates into a remnant low or trough before the
end of the period.  There is still a fair amount of uncertainty in 
the longer range status and intensity of the system.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Additional heavy rainfall from Pilar will produce flash and urban
flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain of the
Pacific coast of Central America from southern El Salvador, across
southern Honduras, western Nicaragua into northern Costa Rica
through today.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the
Pacific coast of El Salvador where a Tropical Storm Watch remains
in effect.
 
3. Swells generated by Pilar will continue to affect the Pacific
coast of Central America during the next day or two.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.
