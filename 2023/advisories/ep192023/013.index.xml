SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Entire coast of El Salvador
* Pacific coast of Honduras including the Gulf of Fonseca
* Honduras/Nicaragua border southward to Puerto Sandino
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within 24 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the Pacific coast of Nicaragua and in
southern Guatemala should monitor the progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was 
located near latitude 11.4 North, longitude 89.5 West. Pilar is 
moving toward the east-northeast near 3 mph (6 km/h). Pilar is 
forecast to move little tonight into early Wednesday. On the 
forecast track, Pilar could move a little closer to the coast of El 
Salvador or Nicaragua tonight through early Wednesday, though the 
core of the system is expected to remain offshore. The storm is 
forecast to begin moving west-southwestward away from land by 
Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some slight strengthening is possible over the next day or so before 
gradual weakening likely begins on Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5
to 10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, over portions of
Central America from southern El Salvador, across southern Honduras,
western Nicaragua into northern Costa Rica through Wednesday.  This
rainfall will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides
in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting
the Pacific coast of Central America during the next few days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the Tropical
Storm Watch area during the next day or so.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
1000 AM CDT Tue Oct 31 2023
 
Pilar's structure has changed little since last night.  GOES-16
one-minute visible satellite imagery shows that the center is
exposed to the southeast of the main convective mass, with some
banding noted over the far northeastern portion of the circulation.
Subjective Dvorak satellite estimates from both TAFB and SAB were
T3.0 or 45 kt at 1200 UTC, and the initial intensity remains at
that value for this advisory.
 
Pilar is still moving slowly eastward or 090/3 kt.  The storm is 
forecast to stall later today as the steering current over the far 
eastern Pacific collapse.  On Wednesday, a narrow mid-level
ridge is forecast to build to the north and northeast of Pilar
which should cause the storm to begin moving west-southwestward. A
west-southwestward to westward motion is then expected into the 
weekend as the ridge builds westward to the north of the storm.  The
latest NHC track forecast is similar to the previous advisory and
is a blend of the the ECMWF, GFS, and the latest consensus aids.
The Tropical Storm Watch for portions of Central America remains in
effect, but given the latest model trends it could be discontinued
later today or this evening.  Although the threat of tropical-storm- 
force winds appears to be diminishing, the risk of heavy rain and 
flash flooding is expected to continue over portions of Central 
America during the next couple of days.
 
Some slight strengthening is possible during the next day or so
as the storm is located within moderate vertical wind shear and
over warm sea surface temperatures. However, the latest NHC
forecast calls for a little less intensification during this time
than before.  As Pilar moves westward the shear could relax, but
intrusions of dry air from a gap wind event are likely to hold the
intensity in check.  Very late in the period, the intensity guidance
suggests that environmental conditions could become a little more
conducive to support some strengthening during the weekend, and the
NHC wind speed forecast has been adjusted accordingly.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Pilar will produce flash and urban flooding, 
along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain of the Pacific coast 
of Central America from southern El Salvador, across southern 
Honduras, western Nicaragua into northern Costa Rica through 
Wednesday.

2. Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the
Pacific coast of El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, where a
Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect.
 
3. Swells generated by Pilar will continue to affect the Pacific
coast of Central America during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
