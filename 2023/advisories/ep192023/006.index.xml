products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was 
located near latitude 11.0 North, longitude 92.0 West. Pilar is 
moving toward the east-northeast near 5 mph (7 km/h) and a continued 
east-northeastward motion is anticipated for the next couple of 
days.  On the forecast track, Pilar could be near the coast 
of El Salvador on Tuesday night or early Wednesday, though the core 
of the system is forecast to stay offshore.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast over the 
next couple of days, and Pilar could be near hurricane strength by 
Tuesday. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Pilar is expected to produce storm total 
rainfall of 5 to 10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, in and 
around much of the Pacific coast of Central America, including the 
country of El Salvador, through Wednesday.  This rainfall will 
produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of 
higher terrain.

SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to reach portions of 
the Pacific coast of Central America on Monday. These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions could begin in the Tropical
Storm Watch area early on Tuesday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Depression Nineteen-E Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
400 PM CDT Sun Oct 29 2023

Deep convection has been increasing near the center of the 
depression during the past several hours, mostly on the northwestern 
side of the circulation.  A scatterometer pass at 1600 UTC, however, 
showed only 25-30 kt winds a fair distance northeast of the center.  
With the subjective Dvorak estimates also 30 kt or less, the initial 
wind speed will stay 30 kt on this advisory.  

The scatterometer data suggested that the center was a bit southeast 
of previous estimates, with only a northeastward drift noted during 
the past 24 hours.  The depression should begin to move more 
steadily northeastward or east-northeastward by early Monday due to 
steering flow associated with a mid- to upper-level trough over the 
northwestern Caribbean.  This pattern will likely take the system 
near the coast of El Salvador late on Tuesday, close enough 
to warrant a Tropical Storm Watch, though most of the guidance 
keeps the system offshore. The NHC forecast is shifted southeast of 
the previous one, similar to the guidance trend. A strong cold front 
is expected to push the system west-southwestward away from Central 
America by late Wednesday. Confidence in the details of the track 
forecast remains low since the model guidance has been inconsistent 
with the track of the system, as well as the dependence on the 
incoming cold front.

Gradual intensification is forecast during the next couple of days 
with the system moving over warm waters in light or moderate shear. 
Increasingly southeasterly shear is noted in all of the global 
models on Tuesday, so the NHC forecast will level off then, but is 
still close to hurricane strength.  The latest guidance has come 
down a bit, though since the corrected-consensus guidance is 
unchanged, the NHC forecast is about the same as the previous one.   
At long range, strong vertical wind shear and intrusions of dry and 
stable air will likely cause a weakening trend. 

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from the tropical depression will produce flash and
urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain
along the Pacific coast of Central America, including El Salvador,
through Wednesday.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible by early Tuesday into 
Wednesday along portions of the coast of El Salvador where a 
Tropical Storm Watch is now in effect. Interests elsewhere along 
the Pacific coast of Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua should 
monitor the progress of this system as additional watches or 
warnings could be needed tonight or tomorrow.

3. Swells generated by the depression will begin to affect portions 
of the Pacific coast of Central America, including El Salvador, 
beginning on Monday.  These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
