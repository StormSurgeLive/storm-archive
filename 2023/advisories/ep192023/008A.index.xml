* Honduras/Nicaragua border southward to Puerto Sandino.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are

Interests elsewhere along the Pacific coast of Nicaragua
and in southern Guatemala should monitor the progress of this
system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was
located near latitude 11.5 North, longitude 91.2 West. Pilar has 
recently been moving more northeastward, but an east-northeastward 
motion near 6 mph (9 km/h) is expected to resume later today. On the 
forecast track, Pilar could be near the coast of El Salvador or 
Nicaragua Tuesday through early Wednesday, though the core of the 
system is expected to remain offshore.  The storm is forecast to 
move west-southwestward away from land on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Further strengthening is expected during the next day or 
so, and Pilar could be near hurricane strength on Tuesday. 
Weakening is expected to begin on Wednesday and continue through 
Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to
10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, for portions of Central
America from El Salvador southward to Costa Rica through Wednesday.
This rainfall will produce flash and urban flooding, along with
mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting
the Pacific coast of Central America during the next few days.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions could begin in the Tropical
Storm Watch area early Tuesday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
1000 AM CDT Mon Oct 30 2023

Pilar appears to have intensified this morning.  Satellite imagery 
indicate that very deep convection is located to the northwest of 
the center, with more organization in low-level banding features 
noted in recent microwave passes.  The initial wind speed is set to 
45 kt, which matches the recent TAFB satellite classification and is 
close to the UW-CIMSS satellite consensus value.  An Air Force 
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to be in the system 
this afternoon for a more precise look at the storm.

The storm continues moving slowly to the east-northeast, and most 
models continue this motion for the next day or so.  Thereafter, 
nearly all of the models stall Pilar near the coast of Central 
America by Tuesday night, though they still keep the core of the 
storm offshore.  On Wednesday, Pilar will likely turn west- 
southwestward away from land as a mid-level ridge builds to the 
north of the system, and most of the guidance shows the storm moving 
very close to or just north of its track on approach to Central 
America.  Only small changes were made to the previous NHC 
forecast, generally near or a bit north of the last track 
prediction.

Pilar has a day or two to intensify in moderate shear conditions 
within a very warm and moist environment.  Most of the guidance 
respond to this forcing by showing Pilar near hurricane strength, 
and the official forecast continues the same peak as the last 
advisory.  In 36 to 48 hours, an increase in southeasterly shear 
could cause Pilar to level off in intensity and eventually weaken, 
along with any dry air intrusions from a gap wind event or 
storm-induced upwelling.  The long-range intensity guidance is a bit 
higher than the last cycle, so the official forecast is adjusted 
upward at that time frame.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Pilar will produce flash and urban flooding,
along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain, near the Pacific 
coast of Central America from El Salvador southward to Costa Rica 
through Wednesday.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible beginning early Tuesday 
along portions of the Pacific coast of El Salvador, Honduras, and 
Nicaragua, where a Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect. Interests 
elsewhere along the Pacific coast of Guatemala, and Nicaragua should 
monitor the progress of this system as additional watches or 
warnings could be needed later today.
 
3. Swells generated by Pilar will continue to affect the Pacific 
coast of Central America during the next few days.  These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
