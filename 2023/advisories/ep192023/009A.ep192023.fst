DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was
located near latitude 11.6 North, longitude 90.9 West.  Pilar is
moving toward the east-northeast near 5 mph (7 km/h) and this motion
is expected to continue through early Wednesday.  On the forecast
track, Pilar could be near the coast of El Salvador or Nicaragua
Tuesday through early Wednesday, though the core of the system is
expected to remain offshore.  The storm is forecast to move
west-southwestward away from land on Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Further strengthening is expected during the next day or so,
and Pilar could be near hurricane strength on Tuesday.  Weakening is
expected to begin on Wednesday and continue through Thursday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC

RAINFALL: Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to
10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, over portions of Central
America from El Salvador southward to Costa Rica through Wednesday.
This rainfall will produce flash and urban flooding, along with
mudslides in areas of higher terrain.

SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting
the Pacific coast of Central America during the next few days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions could begin in the Tropical
Storm Watch area early Tuesday.
