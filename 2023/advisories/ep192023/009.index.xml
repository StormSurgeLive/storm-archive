Interests elsewhere along the Pacific coast of Nicaragua
and in southern Guatemala should monitor the progress of this
system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was 
located near latitude 11.4 North, longitude 91.2 West. Pilar is 
moving toward the east-northeast near 5 mph (7 km/h) and this motion 
is expected to continue through early Wednesday.  On the forecast 
track, Pilar could be near the coast of El Salvador or Nicaragua 
Tuesday through early Wednesday, though the core of the system is 
expected to remain offshore.  The storm is forecast to move 
west-southwestward away from land on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Further strengthening is expected during the next day or so, and 
Pilar could be near hurricane strength on Tuesday. Weakening is 
expected to begin on Wednesday and continue through Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to
10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, for portions of Central
America from El Salvador southward to Costa Rica through Wednesday.
This rainfall will produce flash and urban flooding, along with
mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting 
the Pacific coast of Central America during the next few days. These 
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions could begin in the Tropical
Storm Watch area early Tuesday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
400 PM CDT Mon Oct 30 2023
 
Pilar seems to have held somewhat steady this afternoon.  1-minute 
geostationary satellite visible imagery shows the low-level 
circulation beginning to be exposed just east of the deep convection 
as the central deep overcast gradually clears.  Recent microwave 
imagery revealed a decent curved band wrapping around the western 
and northern portions of the core.  Subjective and objective 
satellite intensity estimates range from 39-51 kt and the initial 
intensity is held at 45 kt, closest to the SAB T3.0/45 kt value.
 
The storm continues to move slowly east-northeastward.  Models 
generally agree on this motion, which should continue for the next 
day or so.  By Tuesday evening, Pilar is forecast to stall near the 
coast of El Salvador with the core of the storm offshore.  By 
Wednesday the storm is expected to turn west-southwestward, away 
from the coastline, in the flow of a building ridge over the western 
Caribbean and Central America.  The latest NHC track forecast is 
shifted slightly north of the previous prediction, largely due to 
the northward shift in the initial position.
 
Moderate east-southeasterly shear appears to be affecting Pilar.  
However, most of the model guidance indicates that the storm should 
steadily strengthen for the next day or so over the warm waters and 
in a moist airmass.  After 36 h, the deep-layer shear should 
increase which will likely induce a weakening trend. By days 3-5, 
the shear is expected to abate somewhat.  Once again, the long-range 
official intensity forecast has been increased slightly and is close 
to the various consensus aids.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Pilar will produce flash and urban flooding,
along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain, near the Pacific
coast of Central America from El Salvador southward to Costa Rica
through Wednesday.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible beginning early Tuesday
along portions of the Pacific coast of El Salvador, Honduras, and
Nicaragua, where a Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect. Interests
elsewhere along the Pacific coast of Guatemala, and Nicaragua should
monitor the progress of this system as additional watches or
warnings could be needed later tonight.
 
3. Swells generated by Pilar will continue to affect the Pacific
coast of Central America during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
