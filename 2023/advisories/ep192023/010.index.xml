SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Entire coast of El Salvador
* Pacific coast of Honduras including the Gulf of Fonseca
* Honduras/Nicaragua border southward to Puerto Sandino.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are

Interests elsewhere along the Pacific coast of Nicaragua
and in southern Guatemala should monitor the progress of this
system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was
located near latitude 11.3 North, longitude 90.9 West.  Pilar is
moving toward the east-northeast near 5 mph (7 km/h) and this 
general motion is expected to continue through Tuesday night.  On 
the forecast track, Pilar could be near the coast of El Salvador or 
Nicaragua Tuesday through early Wednesday, though the core of the 
system is expected to remain offshore.  The storm is forecast to 
begin moving west-southwestward away from land by late Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast, and Pilar could be near hurricane 
strength by late Tuesday.  Weakening is expected to begin by late 
Wednesday and continue through Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to 
10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, over portions of 
Central America from El Salvador southward to Costa Rica through 
Wednesday.  This rainfall will produce flash and urban flooding, 
along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting
the Pacific coast of Central America during the next few days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions could begin in the Tropical
Storm Watch area Tuesday morning.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 AM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
1000 PM CDT Mon Oct 30 2023

Pilar has not strengthened this evening.  In fact, the system looks 
less organized on satellite images with the center becoming exposed 
on the southern side of a ragged-looking area of deep convection.  
There are some poorly-defined banding features over the western 
portion of the circulation, and the upper-level outflow does not 
appear to be very pronounced.  Subjective Dvorak T-numbers from 
TAFB and SAB are 3.0 which corresponds to 45 kt, and objective 
satellite intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS have decreased a bit 
from earlier today.  The intensity estimate is held at 45 kt for 
this advisory.

The initial motion estimate is slowly east-northeastward, or 070/4 
kt, which is about the same as in the previous advisory.  There is 
currently a weakness in the ridge to the northeast of Pilar which is 
apparently inducing the east-northeastward motion.  This movement is 
expected to continue a little while longer, bringing the center of 
the cyclone closer to the coast on Tuesday.  Over the next few days, 
a mid-level ridge is forecast to build to the northeast and north of 
the system.  This steering evolution should cause Pilar to make a 
sharp turn and move west-southwestward away from the coast beginning 
Wednesday.  A continued west-southwestward to westward track is 
likely for the rest of the forecast period.  The official track 
forecast is close to the model consensus, and does not bring the 
center of Pilar closer to the coast than previously forecast.

Although moderate vertical wind shear is likely to continue 
affecting Pilar, a moist and unstable air mass along with warm ocean 
waters should allow some strengthening during the next day or so.  
Later in the forecast period, easterly shear could inhibit 
strengthening.  The official intensity forecast is a blend of the 
simple and corrected model consensus predictions.


Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Pilar will produce flash and urban flooding, 
along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain of the Pacific coast 
of Central America from El Salvador southward to Costa Rica through 
Wednesday.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible beginning early Tuesday
along portions of the Pacific coast of El Salvador, Honduras, and
Nicaragua, where a Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect. Interests
elsewhere along the Pacific coast of Guatemala, and Nicaragua should
monitor the progress of this system as additional watches or
warnings could be needed tomorrow. 
 
3. Swells generated by Pilar will continue to affect the Pacific
coast of Central America during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
