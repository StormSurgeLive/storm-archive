----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...11.0N 91.5W
ABOUT 240 MI...390 KM SW OF SAN SALVADOR EL SALVADOR
ABOUT 360 MI...580 KM WSW OF MANAGUA NICARAGUA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 75 DEGREES AT 3 MPH...6 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Entire coast of El Salvador
* Pacific coast of Honduras including the Gulf of Fonseca
* Honduras/Nicaragua border southward to Puerto Sandino.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the Pacific coast of Nicaragua
and in southern Guatemala should monitor the progress of this
system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was
located near latitude 11.0 North, longitude 91.5 West. Pilar is
moving toward the east-northeast near 3 mph (6 km/h) and a continued
slow east-northeastward motion is expected during the next day or
two. On the forecast track, Pilar could be near the coast of El
Salvador Tuesday through early Wednesday, though the core of the
system is expected to remain offshore.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Strengthening is expected during the next day or 
so, and Pilar could be near hurricane strength on Tuesday.  
Weakening is expected to begin by Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to
10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, in and near the Pacific
coast of Central America from El Salvador southward to Costa Rica
through Wednesday.  This rainfall will produce flash and urban
flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to reach portions of
the Pacific coast of Central America later today. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions could begin in the Tropical
Storm Watch area early Tuesday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
400 AM CDT Mon Oct 30 2023
 
There has been little change with Pilar overnight.  The storm is 
still producing a concentrated area of deep convection, but 
microwave data suggest that the low-level center is located near the 
southeastern edge of the thunderstorms.  The latest satellite 
intensity estimates range from 35 to 45 kt, but an ASCAT pass from a 
few hours ago showed maximum reliable winds closer to 30 kt.  Based 
on a blend of all of these data, the initial intensity is held at 35 
kt.

Pilar is moving slowly to the east-northeast, and that motion should 
continue for the next couple of days.  Nearly all of the models 
stall Pilar near the coast of Central America on Tuesday and Tuesday 
night, but at this point the reliable models keep the core of the 
storm offshore.  On Wednesday, Pilar will likely turn southwestward 
away from land as a mid-level ridge builds to the north of the 
system.  The cyclone will likely accelerate westward after that in 
part due to an anticipated Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind event.  Only 
small changes were made to the previous NHC track forecast and this 
one lies fairly close to the consensus aids.

The storm will have an opportunity to strengthen during the next day 
or so as it remains over warm SSTs and in relatively favorable 
atmospheric conditions.  Pilar is expected to be near hurricane 
strength when it is close to the coast of Central America.  
However, beyond that time, the slow motion of the system could 
cause ocean upwelling and the Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind event 
will likely result in an increase in shear and intrusions of dry 
and stable air.  Therefore, a weakening trend is forecast beginning 
late Tuesday or early Wednesday.  The NHC intensity forecast lies 
at the high end of the guidance in the short term, but falls closer 
to the middle of the guidance envelope from 72-120 hours.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Pilar will produce flash and urban flooding, 
along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain of the Pacific coast 
of Central America from El Salvador southward to Costa Rica through 
Wednesday.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible beginning early Tuesday 
along portions of the Pacific coast of El Salvador, Honduras, and 
Nicaragua, where a Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect. 
Interests elsewhere along the Pacific coast of Guatemala,
and Nicaragua should monitor the progress of this system as
additional watches or warnings could be needed later today.
 
3. Swells generated by Pilar will begin to affect portions
of the Pacific coast of Central America later today.  These swells 
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.
