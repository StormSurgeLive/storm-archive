...PILAR CONTINUING WESTWARD...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1000 PM CDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...12.4N 92.6W
ABOUT 315 MI...505 KM SE OF SALINA CRUZ MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 270 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1002 MB...29.59 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was
located near latitude 12.4 North, longitude 92.6 West.  Pilar is
moving toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h), and a faster westward 
to west-southwestward motion is expected over the next few days.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Some additional weakening is possible during the 
next couple of days.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Pilar is expected to produce additional rainfall of 1 to
2 inches, with local amounts to 4 inches, mainly in portions of El
Salvador and southern Guatemala overnight.  The additional rainfall
may produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas
of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar and strong winds near the Gulf of
Tehuantepec are expected to continue affecting the Pacific coast of
Central America during the next day or two.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
1000 PM CDT Wed Nov 01 2023

Deep convection near the center of Pilar has diminished 
significantly this evening.  Cloud tops associated with the cyclone 
are now generally warmer than -50 deg C.  This degradation in the 
cloud structure could be at least partially be caused by the 
system's passage over upwelled ocean waters near the coast.  Another 
factor could be some disruption due to the influence of a nearby 
Tehuantepec gap wind event.  Given the decrease in convection, it is 
assumed that some weakening has occurred and the current intensity 
is set at 40 kt for this advisory.  This is close to the mean of 
final T-numbers and CI numbers from TAFB and SAB. 

Center fixes indicate that the westward track is continuing with a 
motion estimate of 270/10 kt.  A prominent mid-level subtropical 
ridge is expected to remain north of Pilar, and strengthen further, 
during the next few days.  This should force a westward to 
west-southwestward motion with some increase in forward speed.  The 
official track forecast is again a little faster than the previous 
one and is a blend of the simple and corrected dynamical model 
consensus predictions.

The gap wind event and easterly vertical wind shear could cause 
some additional weakening during the next day or so.  Later in the 
forecast period, moderate shear and marginal thermodynamic 
conditions are likely to inhibit strengthening.  The NHC forecast 
shows very slow weakening through the period.  However, there is a 
possibility that the system will degenerate into a remnant low or a 
trough within the next 5 days.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. The combination of previous heavy rainfall and any additional 
rainfall from Pilar may produce flash and urban flooding, along with 
mudslides in areas of higher terrain of the Pacific coast from El 
Salvador into southern Guatemala overnight.
 
2. Swells generated by Pilar and strong winds near the Gulf of
Tehuantepec are expected to continue affecting the Pacific coast of 
Central America during the next day or two.  These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
