700 AM CDT Tue Oct 31 2023
 
...HEAVY RAINS FROM PILAR AFFECTING PORTIONS OF CENTRAL AMERICA...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 700 AM CDT...1200 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...11.4N 90.2W
ABOUT 175 MI...280 KM SSW OF SAN SALVADOR EL SALVADOR
ABOUT 270 MI...430 KM W OF MANAGUA NICARAGUA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 75 DEGREES AT 3 MPH...6 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Entire coast of El Salvador
* Pacific coast of Honduras including the Gulf of Fonseca
* Honduras/Nicaragua border southward to Puerto Sandino
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within 24 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the Pacific coast of Nicaragua and in
southern Guatemala should monitor the progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was
located near latitude 11.4 North, longitude 90.2 West. Pilar is
moving toward the east-northeast near 3 mph (6 km/h), and this
general motion is expected to continue today.  On the forecast
track, Pilar could be approaching the coast of El Salvador or
Nicaragua late today through early Wednesday, though the core of the
system is expected to remain offshore.  The storm is forecast to
begin moving west-southwestward away from land by Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Pilar could intensify some over the next day or two before
gradual weakening likely begins on Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to
10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, over portions of
Central America from El Salvador southward to Costa Rica through
Wednesday.  This rainfall will produce flash and urban flooding,
along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting
the Pacific coast of Central America during the next few days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions could begin in the Tropical Storm
Watch areas this morning.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
400 AM CDT Tue Oct 31 2023

While deep convection has increased with Pilar overnight, the 
center of the storm remains mostly exposed on the southeastern 
side of a burst of deep convection.  It seems like moderate shear 
is preventing the system from strengthening, with basically no
thunderstorm activity southeast of the center.  The initial wind 
speed remains 45 kt based on a blend of the available intensity 
estimates.  
 
Pilar continues to creep east-northeastward, or 075/3 kt, a little 
slower than the previous advisory.  The steering flow is expected to 
collapse later today, with most of the guidance stalling Pilar just 
east of 90W, then accelerating the storm west-southwestward as a 
mid-level ridge builds by Thursday.  Generally, the model guidance 
stays a touch farther offshore than the last cycle, and the official 
forecast follows the trend.  Little change was made at long range, 
with the previous forecast coming in very close to the model 
consensus.  It is possible that later today the Tropical Storm Watch 
could be discontinued for portions of Central America, but there 
remains a significant heavy rain and flash flooding threat.

The storm still has a chance to intensify over the next day or so 
within moderate wind shear conditions but in a moist and unstable 
air mass along with warm ocean waters.  It seems like the chances of 
Pilar becoming a hurricane have decreased, and the peak NHC wind 
speed forecast is dropped 5 kt from the previous one, slightly above 
the model consensus.  It remains to be seen how Pilar maintains 
itself in a challenging environment after 60 hours, with dry air 
intrusions from a gap wind event and easterly wind shear.  The 
intensity forecast is maintained at 45 kt at long range, blending 
reliable guidance showing tropical depression to hurricane strength, 
and the uncertainty is high at long range.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Pilar will produce flash and urban flooding,
along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain of the Pacific coast
of Central America from El Salvador southward to Costa Rica through
Wednesday.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible beginning later today
along portions of the Pacific coast of El Salvador, Honduras, and
Nicaragua, where a Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect. 
 
3. Swells generated by Pilar will continue to affect the Pacific
coast of Central America during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
