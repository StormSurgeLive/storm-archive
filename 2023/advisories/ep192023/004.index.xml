SUMMARY OF 1000 AM CDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...11.0N 92.8W
ABOUT 305 MI...495 KM SW OF SAN SALVADOR EL SALVADOR
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 25 DEGREES AT 2 MPH...4 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1005 MB...29.68 INCHES

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression
Nineteen-E was located near latitude 11.0 North, longitude 92.8
West. The depression is moving toward the north-northeast near 2 mph
(4 km/h).  The system is forecast to begin moving northeastward or
east-northeastward tonight, and it could be near the coast of El
Salvador or Guatemala on Tuesday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual strengthening is forecast, and the system could be
near hurricane strength in a couple of days.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for the depression can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  The tropical depression is expected to produce storm
total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches,
in and near much of the Pacific coast of Central America, including
the country of El Salvador, through Wednesday.  This rainfall will
produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of
higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are expected to reach
portions of the Pacific coast of Central America on Monday.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Tropical Depression Nineteen-E Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
1000 AM CDT Sun Oct 29 2023
 
The depression is becoming a bit better organized this morning, 
with a curved band seeming to wrap around the apparent center.   
While overnight satellite showed multiple low-level swirls within 
the large circulation envelope, it seems like the system is 
consolidating now near a large burst of convection.  Satellite 
estimates still support an initial intensity of about 30 kt for this 
advisory.
 
There hasn't been a lot of net movement with the system, with 
perhaps a slight north-northeastward motion recently.  The system 
should begin to move northeastward or east-northeastward at a slow 
pace later today as it becomes more steered by the flow associated 
with a mid- to upper-level trough over the northwestern Caribbean.  
This pattern will likely take the system near the coasts of El 
Salvador or Guatemala later on Tuesday.  There has been a slight 
southeastward trend in the model guidance, and the NHC forecast is 
nudged in that direction.  After that time, the synoptic pattern is 
unchanged with a strong cold front expected to move across Mexico 
and the Gulf of Mexico, forcing the cyclone to reverse its course 
and head southwestward away from land. The NHC track forecast is 
again a little slower than the previous one at long range.  
Confidence in the details of the track forecast remains low since 
the forward speed of the cyclone and timing of the cold front will 
make the difference in whether or not the system moves inland over 
Central America or remains offshore.
 
If the low-level center can continue consolidating, then some 
slow strengthening should begin later today.  More significant 
intensification is possible Monday assuming a central core can 
develop, with almost all guidance showing the system near hurricane 
strength on Tuesday. After that, strong vertical wind shear, 
possible land interaction, and intrusions of dry air and stable air 
will likely cause a weakening trend.  Very little change was made 
to the intensity forecast, which remains near the 
corrected-consensus aids.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from the tropical depression will produce flash and
urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain
along the Pacific coast of Central America, including El Salvador,
through Wednesday.
 
2. The depression is expected to strengthen as it approaches
Guatemala and El Salvador, and tropical storm or hurricane watches
could be required for portions of those areas later today.
