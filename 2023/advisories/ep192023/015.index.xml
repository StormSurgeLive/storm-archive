DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was 
located near latitude 12.3 North, longitude 89.9 West. Pilar is 
moving toward the northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h). Pilar is forecast 
to turn westward later today and then accelerate west-southwestward 
through Friday. On the forecast track, Pilar will remain in close 
proximity to the coast of Central America through this morning, but 
the core of the storm is expected to remain offshore.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to
10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, for portions of Central
America from southern El Salvador, across southern Honduras, western
Nicaragua into northern Costa Rica through today. This rainfall will
produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of
higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting
the Pacific coast of Central America during the next couple of days.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the Tropical
Storm Watch area this morning.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 AM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
1000 PM CDT Tue Oct 31 2023
 
After the previous advisory, a significant convective burst formed 
mainly to the west of the center of Pilar that is now waning. 
While the most recent GPM microwave pass missed the center of 
the storm, it did catch a prominent curved band on the 37-GHz 
channel extending to the northwest away from the center. Subjective 
Dvorak estimates were T3.0/45 kt from TAFB and T3.5/55 kt from SAB. 
Taking a blend of these estimates, the initial intensity is set at 
50 kt this advisory. This value also assumes a bit of undersampling 
from the ASCAT-B/C passes that had peak wind retrievals of 45 kt 
outside of the convection earlier today. While the wind-radii were 
adjusted a bit based on that scatterometer data, the 34-kt winds 
remain just offshore of El Salvador.
 
Pilar has nudged a bit closer to the coast of El Salvador, with the 
estimated motion a drift to the north at 360/2 kt. The upper-level 
trough that had weakened the ridging over Mexico is lifting out, and 
in response, mid-level ridging is becoming re-established over 
Mexico. In addition, a significant gale-force gap wind event is 
currently ongoing to the west of Pilar in the Gulf of Tehuantepec. A 
combination of these low and mid-level steering influences is 
expected to start moving Pilar to the west and then west-southwest 
beginning tomorrow and continuing through the end of this week. The 
track guidance remains in fairly good agreement on this solution, 
though was a bit further north early on given the initial position, 
and further south towards the end of the forecast. The NHC track has 
been adjusted accordingly, and still lies in between the reliable 
TVCE and HCCA consensus aids.
 
Pilar could be near its peak intensity as it continues to battle 
moderate vertical wind shear out of the east. While this shear is 
forecast to decrease in the next 24-48 hours, this is expected to be 
offset by ocean upwelling, which is likely occurring near the slow 
moving storm currently, in addition to the strong gap-wind flow 
further west also putting a dent in the sea-surface temperatures 
along Pilar's forecast track. This effect is most accurately 
captured by the atmospheric-ocean coupled hurricane regional 
guidance, which are all notably lower than the consensus aids as 
they show Pilar traversing SSTs below 26 C over the next few days. 
The aforementioned gap winds may also import dry mid-latitude air 
near the circulation of Pilar as it begins to lose latitude. The 
most recent GFS and ECMWF runs also show a weaker system than before 
after the next 36-48 hours, so a bit more weakening is shown in the 
latest NHC forecast. This forecast splits the difference between the 
higher IVCN and HCCA consensus aids, and the lower hurricane 
regional model guidance.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Pilar will produce flash and urban flooding,
along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain of the Pacific coast
of Central America from southern El Salvador, across southern
Honduras, western Nicaragua into northern Costa Rica through
Wednesday.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the
Pacific coast of El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, where a
Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect.
 
3. Swells generated by Pilar will continue to affect the Pacific
coast of Central America during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
