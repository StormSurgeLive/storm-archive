<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Pilar, located about 100 miles south of the coast of El <br/>
Salvador.<br/>
<br/>
Central East Pacific (EP93):<br/>
An area of low pressure located several hundred miles south- <br/>
southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula has <br/>
become a little better defined since yesterday.  However, the <br/>
thunderstorm activity remains limited and displaced well to the <br/>
north of the circulation center. Environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to become increasingly unfavorable for development during <br/>
the next day or two, and significant development of this system <br/>
appears unlikely as it meanders over the central portion of the <br/>
eastern Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

* Entire coast of El Salvador
* Pacific coast of Honduras including the Gulf of Fonseca
* Honduras/Nicaragua border southward to Puerto Sandino
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case over the next 6 to 12
hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was
located near latitude 12.3 North, longitude 89.9 West. Pilar is
moving toward the northwest near 1 mph (2 km/h). Pilar has moved 
little the past few hours, but it is forecast to turn westward later 
today and then accelerate west-southwestward through Friday. On the 
forecast track, Pilar will remain in close proximity to the coast 
of Central America through this morning, but the core of the storm 
is expected to remain offshore.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of
days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to
10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, for portions of Central
America from southern El Salvador, across southern Honduras, western
Nicaragua into northern Costa Rica through today. This rainfall will
produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of
higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting
the Pacific coast of Central America during the next couple of days.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the Tropical
Storm Watch area through early this afternoon.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
400 AM CDT Wed Nov 01 2023
 
Deep convection associated with Pilar has increased over the western 
portion of the circulation this morning. Despite some continued 
east-southeasterly shear over the cyclone, the cold dense overcast 
has begun to expand eastward, and proxy-visible and shortwave 
infrared satellite images suggest the center is no longer exposed. 
The latest objective intensity estimates seem too low based on 
recent satellite trends and yesterday's scatterometer data. A blend 
of subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates from SAB and TAFB 
support holding the initial intensity at 50 kt.
 
Satellite images and recent fixes suggest Pilar is now moving
northwestward (325/3 kt). A more westward motion is expected later
today, followed by an acceleration to the west-southwest through
Friday as a mid-level ridge builds over central Mexico. This motion
away from land should be reinforced by the low-level northerly flow
well downstream of a strong Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind event. The
only notable change to the NHC track forecast is a faster forward
speed during the first few days of the forecast, which is supported
by the latest TVCE and HCCA consensus aids.
 
While the satellite structure of Pilar has improved during the
diurnal maximum period, the storm will continue to be impacted by
moderate shear during the next couple of days. Also, the regional
hurricane models show that the slow-moving cyclone has upwelled some
cooler waters, and Pilar is forecast to move over this cool wake
during the next day or two. In addition, model-simulated satellite
imagery indicates the storm's convection could be disrupted while it
encounters the drier low-level flow downstream of the ongoing gap
wind event. Not surprisingly, most of the intensity guidance shows
some gradual weakening during the next couple of days, and the
official NHC forecast follows suit. Later in the period, there is a
large spread in the intensity guidance, as the statistical-dynamical
aids show strengthening while the global and regional hurricane
models are much weaker. Similar to the previous prediction, this
forecast stays near the simple consensus (IVCN) and shows little
intensity change from days 3-5.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Pilar will produce flash and urban flooding, 
along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain of the Pacific coast 
of Central America from southern El Salvador, across southern 
Honduras, western Nicaragua into northern Costa Rica through today.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the
Pacific coast of El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, where a
Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect.
 
3. Swells generated by Pilar will continue to affect the Pacific
coast of Central America during the next couple of days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.
