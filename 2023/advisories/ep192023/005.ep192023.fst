DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK

At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression
Nineteen-E was located near latitude 10.8 North, longitude 92.5
West. The depression is moving toward the northeast near 3 mph (6
km/h), and a northeast or east-northeastward motion is anticipated 
for the next few days.  On the forecast track, the depression could 
be near the coast of El Salvador on Tuesday night or early 
Wednesday, though the core of the system is likely to stay offshore.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and 
the system could be near hurricane strength in a couple of days.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for the depression can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml

RAINFALL:  The tropical depression is expected to produce storm
total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches,
in and near much of the Pacific coast of Central America, including
the country of El Salvador, through Wednesday.  This rainfall will
produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of
higher terrain.

SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are expected to reach
portions of the Pacific coast of Central America on Monday.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions could begin in the Tropical 
Storm Watch area early on Tuesday.
