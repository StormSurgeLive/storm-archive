SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Entire coast of El Salvador
* Pacific coast of Honduras including the Gulf of Fonseca
* Honduras/Nicaragua border southward to Puerto Sandino
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case over the next 12 to 24
hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the Pacific coast of Nicaragua and in
southern Guatemala should monitor the progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was 
located near latitude 11.9 North, longitude 89.4 West. Pilar is 
drifting toward the north near 2 mph (4 km/h). Beginning tomorrow 
into Thursday, Pilar is forecast to start moving westward to 
west-southwestward. On the forecast track, the storm may remain in 
close proximity to coastal Central America into tomorrow, but 
Pilar's core is forecast to remain offshore.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h)
with higher gusts. Little change in strength is anticipated over
the next day or so, followed by gradual weakening.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5
to 10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, for portions of
Central America from southern El Salvador, across southern
Honduras, western Nicaragua into northern Costa Rica through
Wednesday. This rainfall will produce flash and urban flooding,
along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting
the Pacific coast of Central America during the next few days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the Tropical
Storm Watch area during the next day or so.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 AM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
400 PM CDT Tue Oct 31 2023
 
Satellite imagery shows that Pilar's center remains exposed on the 
southeast side of the main convective plume. Earlier AMSR2 and 
SSMI/S microwave imagery depicts some partial banding features 
within the northern semi-circle. Scatterometer ASCAT-B and -C passes 
this afternoon shows satellite derived winds are around 40 to 45 
knots. These values are in good agreement with the latest Dvorak 
satellite intensity estimates from both TAFB and SAB, T/3.0 or 45 
knots. Therefore, given the combination of data this the 
initial intensity remains at 45 kt for this advisory.
 
Pilar is moving slowly east-northeastward or 060/3 kt. The storm is 
forecast to move very little tonight as the steering currents over 
the far eastern Pacific collapse. A mid-level ridge is then forecast 
to build to the north and northeast of Pilar, which should cause the 
storm to begin moving west-southwestward. As the mid-level ridge 
continues to build westward, Pilar will be steered on a 
west-southwestward to westward motion along the southern side of the 
ridge. The latest NHC track forecast is similar to the previous 
advisory and lies near the latest consensus aids. The threat of 
tropical-storm-force winds should begin to diminish as Pilar starts 
moving westward, but the risk of heavy rain and flash-flooding is 
expected to continue over portions of Central America over the next 
couple of days.
 
Some slight strengthening is possible during the next day or so as 
the storm is located over warm sea surface temperatures and moderate 
vertical wind shear. In about 2 to 3 days vertical wind shear is 
forecast to weaken, but dry air from a gap wind event from the Gulf 
of Tehuantepec may limit intensification.  Towards the end of the 
period, the environmental conditions may become a little more 
conducive and the official forecast depicts strengthening once 
again. The NHC intensity forecast lies near the corrected HCCA 
consensus aids.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Pilar will produce flash and urban flooding, 
along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain of the Pacific coast 
of Central America from southern El Salvador, across southern 
Honduras, western Nicaragua into northern Costa Rica through 
Wednesday.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the
Pacific coast of El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, where a
Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect.
 
3. Swells generated by Pilar will continue to affect the Pacific
coast of Central America during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
