Tropical Depression Twelve-E Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP122023
1100 AM HST Sat Sep 16 2023
 
The structure of the depression has degraded during the last
several hours.  The low-level center is now completely exposed and
well removed to the west of a decaying area of deep convection.
The initial intensity is held at 30 kt, but this could be a little
generous.
 
The system is moving westward at 10 kt.  A westward to
west-southwestward motion is expected in the low- to mid-level flow
during the next day or so.  The depression, or its remnant low,
is expected to move into the Central Pacific basin this afternoon.
 
Strong shear and dry air will continue to affect the depression and
should ultimately cause the system to lose the remaining
convection by tonight, as persistently forecast by the GFS and
ECMWF models.   Dissipation is likely to occur by 36 hours.

Future information on this system can be found in Public Advisories 
issued by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center beginning at 500 PM 
HST, under AWIPS header HFOTCPCP4, WMO header WTPA34 PHFO. Products 
will continue to be available on the web at hurricanes.gov
