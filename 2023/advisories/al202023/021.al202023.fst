RAINFALL:  Rain bands south of Hurricane Tammy are expected to
produce an additional 1 to 3 inches of rainfall across portions of
the Virgin Islands and northern Leeward Islands today, bringing
storm total maximum amounts to 12 inches in the Leeward Islands. The
additional rainfall may produce isolated flash and urban flooding,
along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain.

SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto
Rico during the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
