1100 PM AST Tue Oct 24 2023
 
...TAMMY STRENGTHENS OVER OPEN WATERS...
...FORECAST TO BECOME A POWERFUL EXTRATROPICAL CYCLONE BY
THURSDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.9N 60.7W
ABOUT 570 MI...915 KM SSE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...85 MPH...140 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 50 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...976 MB...28.82 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located 
near latitude 24.9 North, longitude 60.7 West. Tammy is moving 
toward the northeast near 9 mph (15 km/h). A northward turn is 
expected on Wednesday, followed by a slower northwestward motion on 
Thursday and Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Some additional strengthening is possible through 
early Wednesday, followed by weakening through late this week. Tammy 
is forecast to become a powerful post-tropical cyclone by Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 976 mb (28.82 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto
Rico during the next couple of days. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

<title>Hurricane Tammy Forecast Discussion Number 26</title>

Hurricane Tammy Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
500 PM AST Tue Oct 24 2023
 
There have not been many changes in the satellite appearance of 
Tammy since the previous advisory.  Bursts of convection continue to 
wrap around the estimated surface center.  An AMSR2 microwave 
satellite pass at 1657 UTC showed a closed low-level circulation. 
While a couple of ASCAT passes showed surface winds less than 
hurricane strength, the resolution of the instrument likely cannot 
capture the peak winds in Tammy's small inner core.  The initial 
intensity is held at 65 kt, closest to the TAFB satellite intensity 
estimate, though this could be generous.
 
Simulated satellite imagery suggests Tammy could strengthen slightly 
within a day or so when the hurricane enters a region of enhanced 
upper-level divergence.  Beyond this time frame, strong 
southwesterly shear, dry mid-level relative humidities, and cooling 
sea surface temperatures should cause Tammy to steadily weaken.  
Global models now indicate the hurricane should transition into a 
gale-force extratropical cyclone by 48 h, and this is reflected in 
the official intensity prediction.

Tammy is moving to the northeast at about 7 kt.  A mid-latitude 
trough should turn the hurricane north-northeastward and northward 
in a day or so.  By Thursday, Tammy should bend to the northwest and 
slow down within the light steering currents between two ridges.  A 
gradual westward turn is expected by the end of the forecast period. 
The latest NHC track prediction is slightly to the south of the 
previous advisory, and forward speed in the long-term forecast has 
been slowed.
