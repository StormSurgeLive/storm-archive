Hurricane Tammy Advisory Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
1100 AM AST Wed Oct 25 2023
 
...TAMMY STRENGTHENS FURTHER WHILE MOVING NORTHEASTWARD...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...26.6N 59.3W
ABOUT 515 MI...825 KM SE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...105 MPH...165 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 45 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...965 MB...28.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located 
near latitude 26.6 North, longitude 59.3 West. Tammy is moving 
toward the northeast near 13 mph (20 km/h). A northward turn is 
expected later today, followed by a slower northwestward to 
west-northwestward motion on Thursday and Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 105 mph (165 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Gradual weakening is expected for the next few 
days. Tammy is forecast to become a powerful post-tropical cyclone 
by Thursday. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 965 mb (28.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of 
Bermuda, the northern Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin 
Islands, and Puerto Rico during the next couple of days. These 
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Tammy Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
1100 AM AST Wed Oct 25 2023

Tammy has improved its satellite presentation this morning. Since 
the previous advisory, the hurricane briefly had a symmetric eye in 
the satellite infrared and microwave imagery. A nearby deep-layer 
trough appears to be limiting the western portion of Tammy's 
outflow. The subjective and objective intensity estimates have 
increased to 89 to 92 kt, and therefore the initial intensity has 
been raised to 90 kt. 

The upper-level environmental conditions are expected to be 
conducive for the next few hours with enhanced 200 mb divergence 
associated with the aforementioned trough. After 12 hours, the 
divergence is expected to decrease and strong shear, cooling SSTs, 
and surrounding dry subsident air should gradually weaken the 
hurricane. Model guidance suggests Tammy will undergo extratropical 
transition by Thursday and as a result, the tropical-storm-force 
wind field is expected to expand. The official intensity forecast is 
similar to the previous advisory and follows the various consensus 
aids.

Tammy is moving northeastward at about 11 kt, within the flow 
between a deep-layer trough over the western Atlantic and a 
subtropical ridge over the central Atlantic. Later today, the 
cyclone is expected to turn northward followed by a 
north-northwestward to northwestward turn on Thursday with a slower 
forward speed. By Friday, Tammy is expected to meander over the 
northwestern Atlantic in the light steering currents between two 
building ridges over the eastern Atlantic and southeastern United 
States. The 3- to 5-day steering flow forecast is rather uncertain 
and as a result there is a large spread in the track model guidance 
after 48 hours. The latest NHC track forecast is east of the 
previous prediction and favors the left side of the guidance 
envelope.
