DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Tammy was
located near latitude 13.5 North, longitude 56.4 West. Tammy is
moving toward the west near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A slower westward to 
west-northwestward motion is expected through tonight.  A turn 
toward the northwest is forecast on Friday, and this motion should 
continue into the weekend.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Tammy will move near or over the Leeward Islands Friday and 
Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual strengthening is expected during the next few days,
and Tammy is forecast to be at or near hurricane intensity when it
moves near the Leeward Islands.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km) 
primarily to the east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data is 
1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tammy can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical
storm warning area beginning Friday.  Hurricane conditions 
are possible in portions of the Leeward Islands Friday night and 
Saturday. Tropical storm conditions are possible within the tropical 
storm watch area beginning on Friday.
 
RAINFALL:  Through Sunday, Tammy is expected to produce storm total
rainfall of 3 to 6 inches, with maximum amounts of 10 inches, across
portions of the northern Windward and Leeward Islands.  Rainfall
totals of 1 to 2 inches with maximum amounts of 4 inches are
expected for the British and U.S. Virgin Islands into eastern Puerto
Rico. These rains may produce isolated flash and urban flooding,
along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above normal tide levels near where the center of Tammy
moves across the Leeward Islands.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will begin affecting portions of
the Lesser Antilles today, and will continue into the weekend.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.

Tropical Storm Tammy Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
1100 AM AST Thu Oct 19 2023
 
Tammy is a sheared tropical cyclone with the center located on the 
northwestern edge of the main convective mass.  Despite this 
structure, the storm has strengthened since yesterday. A NOAA 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft that investigated Tammy this morning found 
peak 700-mb flight-level winds of 49 kt and peak SFMR winds of 50 
kt. Based on these data, the intensity was increased to 50 kt on a 
Special advisory that was issued at 1200 UTC.  The plane did not 
find any stronger winds since that time, and the initial intensity 
remains 50 kt for this advisory.  An Air Force Reserve 
reconnaissance aircraft is scheduled to investigate Tammy this 
afternoon. 

Tammy is moving west-northwestward or 285 degrees at 13 kt. The 
storm is forecast to reach the southwestern periphery of a 
subtropical ridge over the central Atlantic by Friday, and this 
should cause Tammy to slow down and turn northwestward during the 
next 24 to 36 hours. This motion is forecast to bring the center of 
the storm near or over portions of the Leeward Islands late Friday 
and Saturday.  After Tammy moves north of the Leeward Islands, the 
storm is expected to turn northward around the western side of the 
ridge.  There is still significant spread on exactly when the 
northwestward turn occurs with the GFS and ECMWF along the right 
side of the guidance envelope, with some of the regional hurricane 
models along the left side.  The NHC track is near the middle of 
the guidance envelope closest to the HFIP corrected consensus 
model. 
 
Tammy will be moving over warm SSTS as it nears the Leeward Islands, 
which should allow for gradual strengthening despite the presence 
of light to moderate wind shear.  Given the current sheared 
structure, the NHC intensity forecast is a bit more conservative 
during the first day or two than much of the intensity guidance.  
Despite that, the updated NHC forecast calls for Tammy to be at or 
near hurricane strength when it moves near or over the Leeward 
Islands.   Additional strengthening is expected after Tammy moves 
north of the Leeward Islands and recurves over the central 
Atlantic. 
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in portions 
of the Lesser Antilles on Friday, where a tropical storm warning is 
in effect.  Tropical storm and hurricane conditions are possible 
elsewhere in the Leeward Islands where hurricane and tropical storm 
watches are currently in effect. Additional watches and warnings
will likely be required later today.
 
2.  Heavy rains from Tammy will begin to affect the northern
Windward and Leeward Islands on Friday, spreading into the British
and U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico over the weekend.  This
rainfall may produce isolated flash and urban flooding, along with
isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
