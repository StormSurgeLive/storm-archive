Remnants Of Twenty-One Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL212023
1100 AM EDT Tue Oct 24 2023
 
Satellite images show that the convection associated with Tropical 
Depression Twenty-One has weakened, and there are no signs of a 
well-defined surface center.  Thus the system has dissipated over 
Nicaragua and the initial wind speed is set to 20 kt.  The remnants 
of the system are forecast to continue west-northwestward to 
westward and cross over to the eastern Pacific by Wednesday.  Heavy 
rainfall with flash and urban flooding remain the primary impacts 
even as the system dissipates.
 
This is the last advisory from the National Hurricane Center on
this system.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rains from the remnants of the depression will continue to 
impact portions of Nicaragua through Tuesday night with heavy 
rainfall spreading into Honduras during the day on Tuesday. This 
rainfall is likely to produce flash and urban flooding, along with 
possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain.

Hurricane Tammy Advisory Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
500 PM AST Tue Oct 24 2023
 
...TAMMY MOVING NORTHEASTWARD OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.6N 61.7W
ABOUT 565 MI...910 KM SSE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 40 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...987 MB...29.15 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located 
near latitude 24.6 North, longitude 61.7 West. Tammy is moving 
toward the northeast near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this general motion 
is expected to continue through Wednesday. A turn toward the north 
at a slower forward speed is forecast to begin on Thursday, followed 
by a bend to the northwest on Thursday night or Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Slight strengthening is possible during the next day or so, 
followed by steady weakening. Tammy is forecast to become a 
post-tropical cyclone on Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto
Rico during the next few days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

<title>Hurricane Tammy Forecast Discussion Number 26</title>

Hurricane Tammy Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
500 PM AST Tue Oct 24 2023
 
There have not been many changes in the satellite appearance of 
Tammy since the previous advisory.  Bursts of convection continue to 
wrap around the estimated surface center.  An AMSR2 microwave 
satellite pass at 1657 UTC showed a closed low-level circulation. 
While a couple of ASCAT passes showed surface winds less than 
hurricane strength, the resolution of the instrument likely cannot 
capture the peak winds in Tammy's small inner core.  The initial 
intensity is held at 65 kt, closest to the TAFB satellite intensity 
estimate, though this could be generous.
 
Simulated satellite imagery suggests Tammy could strengthen slightly 
within a day or so when the hurricane enters a region of enhanced 
upper-level divergence.  Beyond this time frame, strong 
southwesterly shear, dry mid-level relative humidities, and cooling 
sea surface temperatures should cause Tammy to steadily weaken.  
Global models now indicate the hurricane should transition into a 
gale-force extratropical cyclone by 48 h, and this is reflected in 
the official intensity prediction.

Tammy is moving to the northeast at about 7 kt.  A mid-latitude 
trough should turn the hurricane north-northeastward and northward 
in a day or so.  By Thursday, Tammy should bend to the northwest and 
slow down within the light steering currents between two ridges.  A 
gradual westward turn is expected by the end of the forecast period. 
The latest NHC track prediction is slightly to the south of the 
previous advisory, and forward speed in the long-term forecast has 
been slowed.
