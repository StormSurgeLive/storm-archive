RAINFALL:  The tropical depression is expected to produce additional 
rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches with maximum amounts of 12 inches 
across Nicaragua and 2 to 4 inches with maximum amounts of 6 inches 
across southern and eastern Honduras. These rains are likely to 
produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of

Tropical Depression Twenty-One Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL212023
500 AM EDT Tue Oct 24 2023
 
Proxy-vis satellite imagery indicates that the center of Tropical 
Depression Twenty-One has moved inland over Nicaragua tonight. This 
was confirmed from both ASCAT B and -C scatterometer passes that 
depicted there was no circulation offshore. Infrared imagery 
indicates that deep convection remains just offshore. The initial 
intensity is held at 25 kt for this advisory.
 
Since the center of the circulation has moved inland, the depression 
should become a remnant low or dissipate later today. Heavy 
rainfall with flash and urban flooding remain the primary impacts 
even as the system dissipates. The estimated motion is around 310/5 
kt. The depression and then the remnants, are forecast to continue 
northwestward, and then generally head westward toward the eastern 
Pacific after that.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rains from the depression will continue to impact portions 
of Nicaragua through Tuesday night with heavy rainfall spreading 
into Honduras during the day on Tuesday. This rainfall is likely to 
produce flash and urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in 
areas of higher terrain.

Hurricane Tammy Advisory Number  25

...HURRICANE TAMMY HOLDS STEADY WHILE MOVING NORTHEASTWARD OVER
SOUTHWESTERN ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.2N 62.3W
ABOUT 580 MI...935 KM SSE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 35 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...987 MB...29.15 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located
near latitude 24.2 North, longitude 62.3 West. Tammy is moving
toward the northeast near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this general motion
is expected to continue through Wednesday. A turn toward the north
at a slower forward speed is forecast to begin on Thursday, 
followed by a bend to the northwest on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Slight strengthening is possible during the next day or so 
followed by steady weakening. Tammy is forecast to become a
post-tropical cyclone on Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto
Rico during the next few days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

<title>Hurricane Tammy Forecast Discussion Number 24</title>

Hurricane Tammy Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
500 AM AST Tue Oct 24 2023
 
Tammy's satellite depiction has improved slightly compared to the 
sheared convective pattern from yesterday evening. The latest 
infrared satellite imagery depicts convective bursts are once again 
wrapping around the southern portion of the system. Earlier 
microwave imagery showed a well organized low-to mid-level 
circulation. The most recent TAFB Dvorak satellite estimate held 
steady at T4.0/65kt, which supports maintaining an initial intensity 
of 65 kt for this advisory.
 
The hurricane is currently moving northeastward, and should 
continue this motion for the next day or two. A mid-latitude trough 
approaching the system from the northwest will cause Tammy to begin 
to move more northward during the middle of the forecast period. It 
is after this point, the model guidance becomes increasingly 
divergent. Models are split on whether another mid-latitude trough 
will cause the system to accelerate east to northeastward, or have 
Tammy not being picked up by this trough and move the system 
westward to southwestward under a building mid-level ridge. The GFS 
has trended towards the west-southwest track scenario, closer to 
the ECMWF. Therefore, the NHC forecast track, which already favored 
the ECMWF solution, remains similar to the previous advisory and is 
close to a blend of GFS and ECMWF.

There is considerably better agreement among most of the 
intensity guidance, which indicates slight strengthening is possible 
during the next day or two, as Tammy interacts with an upper-level 
trough.  After 48 hours the system should begin to weaken and  
start to transition into a post-tropical cyclone. The latest model 
simulated satellite imagery depicts that this process is expected 
to be complete in about 60 h, though Tammy will likely continue to 
produce gale-to storm-force winds for several days even after this 
transition occurs.
