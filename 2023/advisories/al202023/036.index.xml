WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Tammy was
located near latitude 33.0 North, longitude 60.1 West. Tammy is
moving toward the northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h). This northeast
motion will continue through this afternoon, followed by a faster
eastward to east-southeastward motion tonight through Monday. On the
forecast track, Tammy will continue to move away from Bermuda today.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h)
with higher gusts. Weakening is expected during the next few days,
and Tammy is forecast to become a post-tropical remnant low early
next week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect Bermuda
through tonight. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Tammy Discussion Number  36
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
500 AM AST Sat Oct 28 2023
 
Tammy continues to be a sheared system with limited convection this
morning. Cloud tops have been warming since last evening, with only
occasional burst near the center. A partial scatterometer pass that
arrived shortly after the previous advisory, depicted winds on the
eastern side of the system were 40-45 knots. This ASCAT data is in
good agreement with the latest TAFB satellite intensity estimate of
T3.0/45 kt. Therefore, the initial intensity is lowered to 45 kt
based on this data and the degraded satellite presentation.
 
Strong vertical wind shear is expected to continue over Tammy the 
next few days, which should result in further weakening. While sea 
surface temperatures are marginal, there is increasingly dry air 
along the forecast track. The GFS and ECMWF model-simulated 
satellite data indicate Tammy could be completely devoid of 
convection within 36- 48 hours. The updated NHC intensity forecast 
is lower than the previous one, following the latest consensus aids. 
Post-tropical remnant low status is now shown in 48 h, although this 
could occur even sooner than forecast.
 
Tammy has turned northward and then northeastward overnight. The
long-term motion of Tammy is northeast at 50/6 kt. A faster eastward
to southeastward motion is forecast throughout the weekend as Tammy
moves around the northern and eastern sides of a mid-level ridge.
As the cyclone weakens and becomes more shallow it is forecast to
slow down and turn southward-southwestward early next week as the
ridge becomes positioned to its west. The NHC track forecast is a
little faster than the previous, and lies between the simple and
corrected consensus aids.
