Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Wed Oct 18 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
East of the Windward Islands (AL94):<br/>
Recent visible satellite images indicate that the circulation <br/>
associated with an area of low pressure located about 700 miles <br/>
east of the Windward Islands is gradually becoming better defined.  <br/>
In addition, the associated shower and thunderstorm activity is <br/>
becoming more organized, and satellite-derived wind data indicated <br/>
that the system is already producing winds to tropical storm force. <br/>
Continued development is anticipated, and a tropical storm is <br/>
expected to form later today or tonight while moving westward or <br/>
west-northwestward toward the Lesser Antilles.<br/>
<br/>
Interests in the Lesser Antilles should continue to monitor the <br/>
progress of the disturbance.  Advisories may be initiated on this <br/>
system as early as later this afternoon, and could include the <br/>
issuance of watches for some of the islands.  Regardless of <br/>
development, this system has the potential to bring gusty winds, <br/>
heavy rainfall, and flash flooding to portions of the Lesser <br/>
Antilles beginning on Friday.  Additional information, including <br/>
storm warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the <br/>
National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and <br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Tammy was 
located near latitude 13.0 North, longitude 51.7 West.  Tammy is 
moving toward the west near 23 mph (37 km/h).  A westward motion at 
a slower forward speed is expected through Thursday.  A turn toward 
the west-northwest is forecast by Thursday night, followed by a turn 
toward the northwest Friday night or Saturday.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Tammy will move near or over the Leeward 
Islands Friday and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
to the northeast of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tammy can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC 
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml 

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area beginning on Friday.
 
RAINFALL:  Through Saturday night, Tammy is expected to produce 
storm total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches, with maximum amounts of 10 
inches, across portions of the northern Windward into the Leeward 
Islands.  Rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches with maximum amounts of 
4 inches are expected for the British and U.S. Virgin Islands into 
eastern Puerto Rico.  These rains may produce isolated flash and 
urban flooding, along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher 
terrain. 
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will begin affecting portions of
the Lesser Antilles on Thursday.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Tammy Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
500 PM AST Wed Oct 18 2023
 
The tropical disturbance that NHC has been monitoring for many days 
as it traversed the tropical Atlantic (AL94) has finally become 
sufficiently organized, both convectively and circulation-wise, to 
be designated as a tropical cyclone.  The circulation still appears 
a bit elongated in visible satellite images, but the convective 
activity suggests that a well-defined center has formed.  Earlier 
scatterometer data showed winds of 30-35 kt to the northeast of the 
center, and TAFB provided a Dvorak estimate of T2.5/35 kt.  
Therefore, advisories are being initiated on Tropical Storm Tammy, 
with an initial intensity of 35 kt.

The initial motion is westward (275 degrees) at a fast 20 kt, but 
there is uncertainty in this estimate given that the center has 
likely just recently formed.  A strong mid-level ridge to the north 
is forecast to keep Tammy on a westward motion, but slower, over the 
next 24 hours or so.  After that, a deep-layer trough moving across 
the eastern United States is expected to push the ridge eastward, 
allowing Tammy to turn toward the northwest and then north into the 
weekend.  The track models agree on this general scenario, with 
Tammy moving over or near the Leeward Islands Friday and Saturday.  
However, there are some notable differences, with some of the 
stronger models (e.g., HWRF and GFS) showing a turn just before 
Tammy reaches the islands, while the weaker models (e.g., HAFS and 
HMON) move the storm farther west into the northeastern Caribbean 
Sea.  The initial NHC track forecast is between these two periphery 
scenarios, and is close to the ECMWF, TVCA, and HCCA solutions.  
After passing the Leeward Islands, Tammy is expected to 
accelerate northeastward over the central Atlantic ahead of the 
trough.

Global model fields and SHIPS model diagnoses suggest that Tammy may 
deal with some vertical shear, and possibly some dry air in the 
vicinity, over the next few days.  On the other hand, the storm will 
be moving over very warm waters of 29-30 degrees Celsius.  
Therefore, gradual strengthening is forecast during the next couple 
of days, with the NHC intensity prediction very close to the IVCN 
and HCCA aids.  While the forecast depicts a 55-kt tropical storm 
moving across the islands, there could be adjustments to this 
forecast once Tammy's current intensity and structure become 
clearer, and users should be prepared for possible forecast changes. 
After Tammy passes the Leeward Islands, the intensity models suggest 
that some further intensification will be possible as it accelerates 
northeastward over the central Atlantic.


KEY MESSAGES:

1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible across portions of the 
Lesser Antilles beginning on Friday.  Tropical storm watches are 
currently in effect for Barbados, Dominica, Martinique, and 
Guadeloupe, and additional watches or warnings will likely be 
required tonight or on Thursday.

2.  Heavy rains from Tammy will begin to affect the northern 
Windward and Leeward Islands on Friday, spreading into the British 
and U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico over the weekend.  This 
rainfall may produce isolated flash and urban flooding, along with 
isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
