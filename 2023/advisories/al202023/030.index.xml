Hurricane Tammy Advisory Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
500 PM AST Wed Oct 25 2023
 
...TAMMY INTERACTING WITH A NEARBY FRONT...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...28.0N 57.9W
ABOUT 510 MI...815 KM SE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...100 MPH...155 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 45 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...969 MB...28.62 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located
near latitude 28.0 North, longitude 57.9 West.Tammy is moving
toward the northeast near 14 mph (22 km/h). A northward turn is
expected tonight, followed by a turn to the west-northwest by Friday
with a decrease in forward speed.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 100 mph (155 km/h)
with higher gusts. Steady weakening is expected for the next few
days. Tammy is forecast to become a powerful extratropical cyclone
by Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 969 mb (28.62 inches).
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
Bermuda, the northern Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin
Islands, and Puerto Rico during the next couple of days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Tammy Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
500 PM AST Wed Oct 25 2023
 
Tammy is beginning to interact with a front to its north. The eye 
has lost some of its definition as the northern eyewall slowly 
erodes. Outflow is now limited to the southern and eastern portions 
of the circulation. Subjective and objective satellite intensity 
estimates have fallen since the last advisory. Final T-numbers from 
SAB and TAFB are both T4.5 and ADT is down to T4.2. Given the recent 
degradation in satellite appearance, the initial intensity has been 
lowered to 85 kt.
 
It appears that Tammy has moved out of the region with favorable 
upper-level dynamics. Strong upper-level winds and surrounding dry 
air are expected to steadily weaken the system through the forecast 
period. Model guidance shows that the hurricane should become 
entangled with the frontal feature to its north and transition into 
an extratropical cyclone within the next 24 hours. By 48 hours, the 
global models depict Tammy occluding and shedding its front. 
Therefore, the most recent NHC forecast shows the system as a 
post-tropical cyclone instead of extratropical beginning at day 2. 
There is a possibility that Tammy could regain tropical or 
subtropical status as the vortex meanders over sufficiently warm 
ocean waters during days 2 and 3.
 
Tammy is still moving northeastward, but model guidance insists that 
the hurricane will make a turn to the north shortly. This is 
followed by a northwestward turn with a slower forward speed by 
Thursday. By Friday, Tammy is expected to meander over the 
northwestern Atlantic in the light steering currents between two 
building ridges over the eastern Atlantic and southeastern United 
States. The official NHC track forecast shows Tammy slowly turning 
back to the east by the weekend. However, more model guidance is 
showing a faster turn to the east resulting in a large spread in the 
track guidance envelope. The current forecast is on the western edge 
of the track solutions and is closest to the GFS. Further 
adjustments may be needed if these trends continue.
