DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located
near latitude 17.9 North, longitude 62.1 West. Tammy is moving
toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h) and this general
motion is expected through today, followed by a turn toward the
north on Monday.  On the forecast track, the center of Tammy will
move north of the northern Leeward Islands by this afternoon.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some slight strengthening is possible during the next couple
of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125
miles (205 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Reserve 
reconnaissance aircraft observations is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tammy can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected over portions of the 
northern Leeward Islands through this morning.  Tropical storm 
conditions are expected within the tropical storm warning areas 
through this morning.
 
RAINFALL: Tammy is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall:
 
Leeward Islands: 4 to 8 inches with storm total maximum amounts of
12 inches
 
Martinique and Dominica: Additional 2 to 4 inches, storm total
maximum 6 inches
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands into eastern Puerto Rico: 1 to 2
inches with maximum storm total amounts of 4 inches
 
These rains may produce isolated flash and urban flooding, along
with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above normal tide levels near where the center of Tammy
moves across the Leeward Islands.  Near the coast, the surge will
be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Lesser Antilles during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

<title>Hurricane Tammy Forecast Discussion Number 15</title>

Hurricane Tammy Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
1100 PM AST Sat Oct 21 2023
 
Air Force and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft data, along with radar
imagery from Guadeloupe, indicate that the center of Tammy passed
over the island of Barbuda a couple of hours ago.  The hurricane
continues to produce intense convection in a small CDO feature with
some ill-defined bands north and northeast of the center.  The
eyewall has generally not been closed on the radar images.  There
are still some areas of strong convection affecting portions of the
Lesser Antilles to the south of Tammy.  Flight-level and SFMR winds
along with Doppler velocity data suggested that the maximum winds 
had decreased slightly, but there was an unofficial report of a 
sustained wind of 78 kt from Barbuda.  Based on a blend of the 
aircraft data and the Barbuda observation, the intensity is held at 
75 kt for this advisory.

Center fixes indicate that the hurricane continues on its 
north-northwestward trek with an estimated motion of 330/9 kt. Over 
the next couple of days, Tammy should turn northward while it moves 
along the western side of a large subtropical high.  Then, the 
system should turn, at least temporarily, northeastward on the 
southeastern periphery of a mid-tropospheric trough over the western 
Atlantic.  Beginning around 3 days, the track forecast becomes 
challenging, since the global models indicate that the western 
Atlantic trough will bypass Tammy after 72 hours while it continues 
eastward.  A ridge could then build in to the northwest of the 
system and cause it to turn to the left.  As noted earlier, there is 
a very large spread in the track guidance in the latter part of the 
forecast period.  There is low confidence in the 4- and 5-day NHC 
forecast positions.
 
Tammy should remain over very warm waters with moderate vertical
wind shear for the next couple of days.  So, some slight 
strengthening is still forecast.  By 60 or 72 hours, increasing 
shear is likely to induce a weakening trend.  The official intensity 
forecast is similar to the latest Decay-SHIPS guidance.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are expected in portions
of the northern Leeward Islands through early Sunday.
 
2.  The heaviest rains from Tammy will continue over the Leeward
Islands through Sunday. This rainfall may produce isolated flash and
urban flooding, along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher
terrain.
 
3.  A storm surge could produce coastal flooding in areas of onshore
winds as the center of Tammy moves near or over the Leeward Islands.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous
waves.
