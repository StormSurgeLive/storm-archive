...TAMMY EXPECTED TO BECOME A POWERFUL FRONTAL LOW SOON...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...29.9N 57.8W
ABOUT 445 MI...715 KM ESE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 15 DEGREES AT 20 MPH...31 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...973 MB...28.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located
near latitude 29.9 North, longitude 57.8 West. Tammy is moving
toward the north-northeast near 20 mph (31 km/h). A northward to 
northwestward turn is expected overnight, followed by a slower 
west-northwestward motion on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 90 mph (150 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Some weakening is expected during the next few 
days. Tammy is forecast to become a powerful post-tropical cyclone 
early on Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles
(315 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 973 mb (28.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swell will continue to affect portions of Bermuda, the
northern Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico during the next couple of days. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

<title>Hurricane Tammy Forecast Discussion Number 31</title>

Hurricane Tammy Discussion Number  31
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
1100 PM AST Wed Oct 25 2023
 
The extratropical transition of Tammy appears to be well underway. 
The eye is no longer apparent in satellite images, and deep 
convection has eroded over the western portion of the circulation. A 
dry slot has become evident between the small area of convection 
near Tammy's center and a long, linear convective band well to its 
east and southeast. Based on the lower satellite intensity estimates 
this evening, the initial intensity is brought down to 80 kt for 
this advisory.

If it hasn't already, Tammy is expected to completely merge with a 
nearby front soon. In the near term, the increasing shear and drier 
air associated with a deep-layer trough to the west should result in 
a significant disruption of Tammy's convection. However, Tammy will 
remain a powerful cyclone even after it becomes post-tropical, with 
an expanding outer wind field during this time. After the rapid warm 
seclusion process is completed, global model fields indicate Tammy 
could shed its frontal structure by 36 h. A reduction in wind shear 
is forecast soon thereafter, and convection could redevelop near 
Tammy's center in 2-3 days while it moves over 25-26C waters. Though 
it is not explicitly forecast, there is some potential based on the 
GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite imagery that Tammy could reacquire 
tropical characteristics this weekend or early next week.

The long-term motion of Tammy is 015 degrees/17 kt, but more 
recently the cyclone appears to be turning northward as expected. 
Over the next day or so, Tammy is forecast to slow down and move 
generally northwestward. From there, the global and regional models 
offer little clarity regarding the future track of Tammy, with 
extremely divergent solutions beyond about 36 h. The track 
differences appear to be related to the extent of Tammy's 
interaction with a cutoff mid-level low that develops to the 
southwest of Tammy later this week. Several of the global models 
(ECMWF, UKMET, CMC) show this feature moving westward and remaining 
far enough away from Tammy that little interaction occurs. These 
models move Tammy generally eastward through early next week. The 
latest GFS and regional model runs show Tammy rotating around this 
mid-level feature and moving much farther west and southwest over 
the southwestern Atlantic. The spread between the 96-h GFS and ECMWF 
forecast positions is almost 1400 n mi, making the longer-term track 
forecast highly uncertain. Given this enormous spread, little change 
was made to the official forecast tonight.
