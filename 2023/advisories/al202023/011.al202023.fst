DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK

At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located
near latitude 14.7 North, longitude 60.2 West.  Tammy is moving
toward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A turn toward the
northwest is anticipated tonight, followed by a north-northwestward
and northward turn Saturday night through Sunday night.  On the
forecast track, the center of Tammy will move near or over portions
of the Leeward Islands tonight through Saturday night, and then move
north of the northern Leeward Islands on Sunday.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is forecast during 
the next day or so while the hurricane moves near or over portions 
of the Leeward Islands.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).

The minimum central pressure estimated from Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft observations is 992 mb (29.30 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical
storm warning area beginning tonight.  Hurricane conditions are
expected in the hurricane warning area by late tonight or early
Saturday.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch
area in the Leeward Islands on Saturday. Tropical storm conditions
are possible within the tropical storm watch area beginning tonight.

RAINFALL: Tammy is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall:

Leeward Islands: 4 to 8 inches with maximum amounts of 12 inches.

Portions of the Windward Islands: 2 to 4 inches with maximum amounts
of 6 inches.

British and U.S. Virgin Islands into eastern Puerto Rico: 1 to 2
inches with maximum amounts of 4 inches.

These rains may produce isolated flash and urban flooding, along
with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain.

STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above normal tide levels near where the center of Tammy
moves across the Leeward Islands.  Near the coast, the surge will
be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Lesser Antilles during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
