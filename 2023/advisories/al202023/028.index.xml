Hurricane Tammy Advisory Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
500 AM AST Wed Oct 25 2023
 
...TAMMY STRENGTHENS OVER THE OPEN ATLANTIC...
...FORECAST TO BECOME A POWERFUL EXTRATROPICAL CYCLONE...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...25.6N 60.2W
ABOUT 540 MI...870 KM SSE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...100 MPH...155 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 45 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...969 MB...28.62 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located
near latitude 25.6 North, longitude 60.2 West. Tammy is moving
toward the northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h). A northward turn is
expected later today, followed by a slower northwestward motion on
Thursday and Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 100 mph (155 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is possible today, 
followed by weakening through late this week. Tammy is forecast to 
become a powerful post-tropical cyclone by Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 969 mb (28.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto
Rico during the next couple of days. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Tammy Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
500 AM AST Wed Oct 25 2023
 
Satellite data indicate Tammy has strengthened this morning. 
Proxy-vis and infrared imagery depict a ragged eye has developed 
with deep convection wrapping around the center. There has been no 
microwave imagery this morning, but earlier SSMI/S and GMI 
images showed a tight inner core. The subjective Dvorak final-T 
intensity estimates have increased this cycle with a T5.0 and T4.5 
from SAB and TAFB, respectively. Given the improved satellite 
imagery and using a blend of these estimates, the initial intensity 
is raised to 85 kt for this advisory.

Although vertical wind shear is analyzed to have increased over 
the hurricane, the system is strengthening beneath upper-level 
divergence associated with a deep-layer trough over the western 
Atlantic. Models suggest some additional strengthening is possible 
over the next 12 hours or so, which is reflected in the NHC 
intensity forecast. Tammy is then expected to merge with a cold 
front, which is currently analyzed by TAFB and OPC just northwest of 
the system. Tammy is expected to undergo an extratropical 
transition, with this transition forecast to be complete within 24 
hours. As this transition occurs Tammy's wind field will expand as 
it becomes a hurricane-force extratropical cyclone. Global models 
are in fairly good agreement that the cyclone will then weaken 
throughout the remainder of the forecast period. There is some 
potential it could shed its frontal structure this weekend, but for 
now the model-simulated satellite imagery does not show much 
increase in convection during that time.
 
Tammy is moving northeastward at an estimated motion of 45 degrees 
at 9 knots, within the flow between a deep-layer trough over the 
western Atlantic and a subtropical ridge over the central Atlantic. 
Tammy is expected to turn northward later today, then move slowly 
northwestward in 2-3 days within weaker steering currents. The 
long-range forecast remains uncertain, with not much run-to-run 
model consistency and ensemble solutions that move in opposite 
directions. Given the uncertainty, there is little change from the 
previous forecast at this time range, with the NHC forecast track 
showing the cyclone slowing and meandering through the end of the 
the period.
