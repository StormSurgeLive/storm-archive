DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located
near latitude 16.0 North, longitude 60.7 West. Tammy is moving
toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue through tonight.  A turn toward the
north-northwest is forecast on Sunday, followed by a turn toward the
north on Monday.  On the forecast track, the center of Tammy will
move near or over portions of the Leeward Islands through early
Sunday, and then move north of the northern Leeward Islands by
Sunday afternoon.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Fluctuations in intensity are possible during the next few
days, but Tammy is expected to remain a hurricane while it passes
near or over the Leeward Islands.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).
 
The minimum central pressure based on data from the Air Force and
NOAA Hurricane Hunters is 988 mb (29.18 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tammy can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to begin in the hurricane
warning area during the next few hours and spread northward across
the Leeward Islands through tonight.  Tropical storm conditions
are expected within the tropical storm warning areas today and
tonight, and hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane
watch areas through tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible on Martinique today and the British Virgin Islands tonight
and Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: Tammy is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall:
 
Leeward Islands: 4 to 8 inches with maximum amounts of 12 inches
 
Martinique and Dominica: Additional 2 to 4 inches with maximum
amounts of 6 inches
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands into eastern Puerto Rico: 1 to 2
inches with maximum amounts of 4 inches
 
These rains may produce isolated flash and urban flooding, along
with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above normal tide levels near where the center of Tammy
moves across the Leeward Islands.  Near the coast, the surge will
be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Lesser Antilles during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Tammy Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
1100 AM AST Sat Oct 21 2023
 
The center of Tammy is now located just to the east-southeast of 
Guadeloupe in the Leeward Islands.  Satellite and radar data 
indicate that the core of the hurricane is quite compact and despite 
its close proximity to the islands, the strong winds remain just 
offshore. The NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunters have been 
investigating Tammy this morning, and a combination of the data they 
have collected indicate that the hurricane has strengthened a 
little. The initial intensity is nudged upward to 75 kt based on 
maximum 700 mb flight-level winds of 86 kt and a peak SFMR wind of 
74 kt. However, as noted above, the hurricane-force winds are 
occurring over a small region very near the center.
 
The hurricane has turned to the right over the past several hours,
and the initial motion is now northwestward, 325 degrees, at 7 kt.
A continued northwestward motion is expected during the next 12-24
hours, taking the core of Tammy over or just east of the Leeward
Islands during that time.  After the hurricane clears the islands,
a turn to the north seems likely when the system moves in the flow
between a ridge over the central Atlantic and a large trough over
the western Atlantic.  There is a significant amount of spread in
the models in the days 3-5 time frame, which seems to be associated
with model differences in the magnitude of the trough and vertical
depth/intensity of Tammy.  The NHC track forecast is a little to
the right and slower than the previous one based on the initial
position/motion and latest model guidance.  However, given that the
spread in the model positions of Tammy are about 900 miles at day 5,
confidence is low in Tammy's long range track.
 
Tammy will likely fluctuate in strength over the next few days
while it remains in mixed environmental conditions of very warm
SSTs and moderate wind shear.  The NHC intensity forecast is a
touch higher than the previous one and generally near the IVCN and
HCCA models. Gradual weakening seems likely by the middle of next
week when it moves into a region of stronger shear, but the
intensity forecast at that range is of low confidence since its
future strength will likely be correlated to the track.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are expected in portions
of the Leeward and northern Windward Islands through early Sunday.
 
2.  Heavy rains from Tammy will affect the Lesser Antilles north of 
Martinique today, spreading across the British and U.S. Virgin 
Islands and possibly eastern Puerto Rico on Sunday. This rainfall 
may produce isolated flash and urban flooding, along with isolated 
mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
3.  A storm surge could produce coastal flooding in areas of onshore
winds as the center of Tammy moves near or over the Leeward Islands.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous
waves.
