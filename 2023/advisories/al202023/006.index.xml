DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Tammy was
located near latitude 13.7 North, longitude 56.6 West. Tammy is
moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A slower 
west-northwestward motion is expected tonight.  A turn toward the 
northwest is forecast on Friday, and this motion should continue 
through Saturday.  A northward motion is forecast to begin Saturday 
night or Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Tammy will 
move near or over the Leeward Islands Friday and Saturday, and then 
move north of the Leeward Islands Saturday night and Sunday.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft indicate that 
the maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Little change in strength is expected tonight, but gradual 
strengthening is expected to begin on Friday and continue into this 
weekend. Tammy is forecast to be at or near hurricane intensity when 
it moves near the Leeward Islands Friday night and Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km) 
primarily to the east of the center.
 
The latest minimum central pressure is estimated from reconnaissance 
aircraft data is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tammy can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical
storm warning area beginning Friday.  Hurricane conditions
are possible in portions of the Leeward Islands Friday night and
Saturday. Tropical storm conditions are possible within the tropical
storm watch area beginning on Friday.
 
RAINFALL:  Tammy is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 3 to
6 inches, with maximum amounts of 10 inches, across the Leeward and
northern Windward Islands. Rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches with
maximum amounts of 4 inches are expected for the British and U.S.
Virgin Islands into eastern Puerto Rico. These rains may produce
isolated flash and urban flooding, along with isolated mudslides in
areas of higher terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above normal tide levels near where the center of Tammy
moves across the Leeward Islands.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Lesser Antilles during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Tammy Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
500 PM AST Thu Oct 19 2023
 
Tammy has not become any better organized since this morning. The
center of the cyclone has become partially exposed to the west and
northwest of the main area of deep convection, and there is little
evidence of banding except over the southeastern portion of the
storm.  An Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft has been
investigating Tammy this afternoon and has reported peak 850 mb
flight-level winds of 53 kt and SFMR values of around 40 kt.
Earlier scatterometer data revealed some 40-45 kt vectors over the
southeastern portion of the circulation.  Based on these data, the
initial intensity is held at 50 kt for this advisory.
 
After taking a more westward jog earlier this afternoon, the latest
aircraft fixes suggest the west-northwestward motion has resumed.
The latest motion estimate is 285 degrees at 11 kt.  Tammy is
nearing the western periphery of a subtropical ridge over the
central Atlantic and the cyclone should turn northwestward within
the next day or so.  This motion is expected to bring the center of
Tammy near or over portions of the Leeward Islands late Friday and
Saturday.  Once Tammy is north of the Leeward Islands on Sunday,
it is expected to turn northward around the western side of the
aforementioned ridge.  There has been little overall change with
the track guidance this cycle.  The GFS and ECMWF models remain
along the eastern side of the guidance envelope, while the models
that show less strengthening are along the far western side of the
guidance.  The NHC track forecast remains nears the middle of the
guidance envelope between the HFIP corrected consensus and the TCVA
simple consensus aid.
 
The current structure of Tammy does not suggest that it will
strengthen very quickly during the next day or so, but warm SSTs
and moderate vertical shear conditions could allow for some
modest intensification after that and the NHC official forecast
still calls for Tammy to become a hurricane in a couple of days.
After that time, some additional strengthening is forecast after
Tammy moves north of the Leeward Islands and recurves over the
central Atlantic.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in portions
of the Lesser Antilles beginning Friday, where a tropical storm
warning is in effect.  Tropical storm and hurricane conditions are
possible elsewhere in the Leeward Islands where hurricane and
tropical storm watches are currently in effect. Additional watches
and warnings will likely be required tonight.
 
2.  Heavy rains from Tammy will begin to affect the Leeward and
northern Windward Islands on Friday, spreading into the British and
U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico over the weekend.  This rainfall
may produce isolated flash and urban flooding, along with isolated
mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
