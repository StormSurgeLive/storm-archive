DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located
near latitude 22.9 North, longitude 63.1 West. Tammy is moving
toward the northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general motion
is expected to continue through Wednesday. A turn toward the north
at a slower forward speed is forecast to begin on Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts. Slight strengthening is possible during the next day or two.
Weakening is expected after that. Tammy is forecast to become a
post-tropical cyclone on Thursday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches)

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto
Rico during the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
