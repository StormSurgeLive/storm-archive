<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Tammy, located a few hundred miles north of the northern Leeward <br/>

In addition, the associated showers and thunderstorms continue to <br/>
show signs of organization.  If the current trends continue, <br/>
advisories could be initiated later this afternoon or evening on a <br/>
short-lived tropical depression.  The low is expected to move inland <br/>
over Nicaragua by early Tuesday and will likely produce heavy rains <br/>
over portions of Central America during the next couple of days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression
Twenty-One was located near latitude 11.6 North, longitude 83.5
West. The depression is moving toward the west near 5 mph (7 km/h)
and a west to west-northwest motion is expected until it dissipates.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts.
No strengthening is expected as the depression will be inland soon. 
Dissipation is likely to occur tomorrow.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Twenty-One can be found in the 
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO 
header WTNT41 KNHC.

RAINFALL:  The tropical depression is expected to produce additional 
rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches with maximum amounts of 12 inches 
across Nicaragua and 2 to 4 inches with maximum amounts of 6 inches 
across southern and eastern Honduras. These rains are likely to 
produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of 
higher terrain.

Tropical Depression Twenty-One Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL212023
500 PM EDT Mon Oct 23 2023

The area of low pressure in the southwestern Caribbean Sea that the 
NHC has been monitoring for the past few days has developed a 
well-defined circulation. Convection is well-organized and has 
persisted for over 12 hours, thus the disturbance is upgraded to 
Tropical Depression Twenty-One. Scatterometer satellite data from a 
few hours ago indicate that the intensity is around 25 kt. This is 
also confirmed by the most recent Dvorak estimates provided by 
TAFB and SAB.

The initial motion is estimated at an uncertain 280/4. The tropical 
depression is on the western periphery of the upper level ridge, 
which should keep it on a generally westward track over the next few 
days. On this track, this system will be making landfall in southern 
Nicaragua later this evening or tonight. 

The tropical depression is in a favorable environment with low 
wind shear values and warm sea-surface temperatures. However, 
no strengthening is forecast since the depression is expected to 
move inland soon. The depression will weaken quickly over Nicaragua 
and dissipation is likely to occur tomorrow.

KEY MESSAGES:

1. Heavy rains from the depression will continue to impact portions 
of Nicaragua through Tuesday night with heavy rainfall spreading 
into Honduras during the day on Tuesday. This rainfall is likely to 
produce flash and urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in 
areas of higher terrain.

Hurricane Tammy Advisory Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
500 PM AST Mon Oct 23 2023
 
...TAMMY TURNING NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...22.3N 63.6W
ABOUT 695 MI...1115 KM S OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 15 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...990 MB...29.24 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located
near latitude 22.3 North, longitude 63.6 West. Tammy is moving
toward the north-northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A turn toward the
northeast is expected to by Tuesday and this general motion should
continue through Wednesday.  On Thursday a turn back toward the
north and north-northwest is forecast.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some slight strengthening is possible during the next day or
so followed by steady weakening.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on recent NOAA 
Saildrone data is 990 mb (29.24 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto
Rico during the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

<title>Hurricane Tammy Forecast Discussion Number 22</title>

Hurricane Tammy Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
500 PM AST Mon Oct 23 2023
 
Moderate southwesterly vertical wind shear seems to be disrupting
Tammy's circulation.  Deep convection is being pulled northward away
from the estimated low-level center and mid-level dry air is working
its way around the southern side of the cyclone.  Satellite
intensity estimate have decreased this cycle to 55 and 65 kt from
SAB and TAFB, respectively.  The initial intensity has therefore
been lowered to 65 kt.  While ASCAT missed the majority of the
hurricane's core, it did show winds on the western portion of the
circulation have decreased and the radii have been adjusted inward
accordingly.
 
Tammy is moving north-northeastward at 6 kt.  A turn toward the 
northeast is forecast shortly as Tammy is steered by a mid-level 
ridge centered over the central subtropical Atlantic and the flow 
ahead of a mid-latitude trough over the western Atlantic.  Between 
48-60 h, the model solutions begin to bifurcate.  The ECMWF turns 
the hurricane northward and then westward by the end of the forecast 
period.  The GFS and regional models tend to turn Tammy toward the 
north and northeastward by day 5.  The official forecast still 
favors the ECMWF forecast and is similar to the previous advisory.
 
Models suggest that environmental conditions will be relatively 
unfavorable.  The deep-layer vertical wind shear is forecast to 
increase and surrounding mid-level moisture to decrease through most 
of the forecast period.  However, in a day or so, when the hurricane 
begins to interacts with the trough to its west, upper-level 
divergence could enhance convection and cause some strengthening 
through about 48 h.  Tammy is then expected to gradually weaken and 
complete its transition into an extratropical cyclone by day 3.  The 
NHC intensity forecast is similar to the previous prediction, with a 
slightly lower peak intensity of 75 kt.
