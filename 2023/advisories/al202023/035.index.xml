...SHEARED TAMMY WILL MOVE AWAY FROM BERMUDA TONIGHT...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...32.7N 61.3W
ABOUT 205 MI...330 KM E OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 335 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...991 MB...29.27 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Tammy was 
located near latitude 32.7 North, longitude 61.3 West. Tammy is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h). A turn toward 
the north and northeast is expected through early Saturday, followed 
by a faster eastward to east-southeastward motion on Sunday and 
Monday. On the forecast track, Tammy will move away from Bermuda on 
Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Weakening is expected during the next few days, and 
Tammy is forecast to become a post-tropical remnant low early next 
week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.27 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect Bermuda
through Saturday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Tropical Storm Tammy Discussion Number  34
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
500 PM AST Fri Oct 27 2023
 
Tammy's cloud pattern hasn't changed much on satellite images since 
earlier today.  There has been some cooling of the convective cloud 
tops to about -60 deg C near the center of circulation along with a 
few banding features.  There is limited upper-level outflow to the 
south and east of the system.  The current intensity is held at 55 
kt in agreement with an objective ADT Dvorak estimate from UW-CIMSS.

Tammy is currently situated over SSTs of around 25 deg C in a 
marginally moist mid-level air mass.  The dynamical guidance 
indicates a significant increase in vertical wind shear during the 
next day or so.  This should cause a gradual weakening trend to 
commence soon.  Later in the forecast period, although the ocean 
waters under Tammy should get a little warmer, strong shear and 
substantially drier air should cause continued weakening.  The 
official intensity forecast is above most of the model guidance, so 
Tammy could weaken to a depression sooner than shown here.

Tammy is currently moving slowly northwestward at about 320/3 
kt.  The cyclone should soon turn to an eastward track and move 
along the northern side of a subtropical ridge for a couple of 
days.  Later in the forecast period, Tammy is expected to turn 
southward and move along the eastern side of a mid-level high.  The 
official track forecast lies between the simple and corrected 
dynamical model consensus solutions.
