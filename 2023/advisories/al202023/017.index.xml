Caribbean Sea.  Gradual development of this system is possible, and <br/>
a tropical depression could form before the system moves inland over <br/>
Nicaragua by early Tuesday.  Regardless of development, this system <br/>
could produce heavy rains over portions of Central America during <br/>
the next couple of days.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located
near latitude 19.1 North, longitude 63.0 West. Tammy is moving
toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this general
motion is expected today.  A turn toward the north is expected
tonight, followed by a north-northeast or northeast motion on
Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast during the next few
days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tammy can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Tammy is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall:
 
Leeward Islands: 4 to 8 inches with storm total maximum amounts of
12 inches
 
Martinique and Dominica: Additional 2 to 4 inches, storm total
maximum 6 inches
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands into eastern Puerto Rico: 1 to 2
inches with maximum storm total amounts of 4 inches
 
These rains may produce isolated flash and urban flooding, along
with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Lesser Antilles during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Tammy Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
1100 AM AST Sun Oct 22 2023
 
Tammy is slowly pulling away from the northern Leeward Islands and
all of the hurricane warnings were dropped at the 1200 UTC
intermediate advisory.  However, there is still a trailing area of
showers and thunderstorms that will likely cause heavy rain across
portions of the Windward and Leeward Islands throughout the day.
The hurricane is exhibiting a central dense overcast pattern in
satellite images with very cold cloud tops persisting near the
center.  Both the NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunters are
investigating Tammy, and based on the data they have collected, the
initial intensity is nudged downward slightly to 70 kt.  Tammy
remains a fairly compact and asymmetric tropical cyclone with
hurricane-force and tropical-storm-force winds only extending up to
20 n mi and 120 n mi from the center, respectively.  The wind radii
are particularly small on the southwest side of the system.
 
The hurricane is moving northwestward at 8 kt on the southwestern
periphery of a subtropical ridge centered over the central Atlantic.
A turn to the north is forecast to occur tonight, followed by a
northeastward motion on Tuesday and Wednesday when a large-scale
trough over the northeast U.S. shifts eastward, eroding the ridge.
After that time, the models show the trough cutting off and merging
with Tammy, which could cause a turn to the left.  Although the
models are in better agreement than they were yesterday, there is
still a considerable amount of spread at long range due to
differences in the synoptic pattern and model predicted intensity
of Tammy.  Only small changes were made to the previous NHC track
forecast, and it continues to lie close to the HCCA guidance.
 
The environmental factors for Tammy appear to be mixed.  The system
is expected to remain over warm SSTs during at least the next few
days, but it will also be in an environment of moderate vertical
wind shear.  Therefore, fluctuations in strength seem likely over
the next few days.  After Tammy merges with the trough, dry air
entrainment and stronger shear should cause some weakening and
likely lead to extratropical transition in 4 to 5 days.  The NHC
intensity forecast is a little lower than the previous one, and near
the middle of the guidance envelope.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  The heaviest rains from Tammy will continue over the Leeward
Islands through tonight.  This rainfall may produce isolated flash
and urban flooding, along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher
terrain.
