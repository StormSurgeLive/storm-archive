DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Tammy was
located near latitude 13.5 North, longitude 55.1 West. Tammy is
moving toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h). A turn toward the
west-northwest is forecast by tonight, followed by a turn toward the
northwest Friday night or Saturday.  On the forecast track, the
center of Tammy will move near or over the Leeward Islands Friday
and Saturday.
 
Data from an a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that 
the maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Gradual strengthening is forecast during the next few days 
and Tammy could be near hurricane intensity by early Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tammy can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area beginning on Friday.
 
RAINFALL:  Through Saturday night, Tammy is expected to produce
storm total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches, with maximum amounts of 10
inches, across portions of the northern Windward into the Leeward
Islands.  Rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches with maximum amounts of
4 inches are expected for the British and U.S. Virgin Islands into
eastern Puerto Rico.  These rains may produce isolated flash and
urban flooding, along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher
terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will begin affecting portions of
the Lesser Antilles later today.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Tammy Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
500 AM AST Thu Oct 19 2023
 
Tammy has not changed much overnight.  Satellite images show a
persistent area of deep convection, but the pattern remains ragged
with little evidence of banding features.  The low-level center has
occasionally been exposed near the western edge of the convection
due to westerly vertical wind shear.  The initial intensity is held
at 35 kt, in agreement with the Dvorak classification from TAFB.
The NOAA Hurricane Hunters will be investigating the storm later
this morning, and the data they collect will provide a better
assessment of Tammy's intensity, center position, and overall
structure.
 
The storm is moving generally westward at about 15 kt.  Tammy is
expected to turn west-northwestward later today and likely
northwestward on Friday as it moves along the southwestern periphery
of a subtropical ridge over the central Atlantic.  This should take
Tammy near or over the Leeward Islands Friday and Friday night.
After that time, a gradual turn to the north and then the northeast
is predicted as Tammy moves in the flow between the ridge and an
approaching mid- to upper-level trough over the western Atlantic.
The NHC track forecast is similar to the previous one in the short
term, but is slower at days 4 and 5 based on the new model guidance. 
The GFS and ECMWF models have come into better agreement this 
cycle, and both lie a little to the right of the NHC forecast 
during from 12 to 72 hours.
 
Tammy will be moving over very warm 30 C SSTs as it nears the 
Leeward Islands, which should allow the storm to strengthen despite 
continued moderate wind shear.  The storm will likely be near 
hurricane strength when it moves near the Leeward Islands. 
Additional strengthening is expected when the system recurves over 
the central Atlantic while it remains over warm water and also gains 
baroclinic support from the aforementioned trough. The NHC 
intensity forecast is largely an update of the previous one and is 
in line with the HCCA and IVCN consensus guidance.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible across portions of the
Lesser Antilles beginning on Friday, where tropical storm 
watches are currently in effect. Additional watches and warnings 
will likely be required later today.
 
2.  Heavy rains from Tammy will begin to affect the northern 
Windward and Leeward Islands on Friday, spreading into the British 
and U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico over the weekend.  This 
rainfall may produce isolated flash and urban flooding, along with 
isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
