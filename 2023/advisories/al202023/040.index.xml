<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Tammy, located several hundred miles east of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic Ocean (AL96):<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity is showing signs of organization <br/>
in association with an area of low pressure located a couple of <br/>
hundred miles north of the Dominican Republic.  A short-lived <br/>
tropical depression or storm could form later today while the <br/>
system moves west-northwestward.  By Monday, however, strong <br/>
upper-level winds and dry air should end the chances of further <br/>
development.  An Air Force reconnaissance aircraft is scheduled to <br/>
investigate the system later today, if necessary.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

<title>Post-Tropical Cyclone Tammy Forecast Discussion Number 40</title>

Post-Tropical Cyclone Tammy Discussion Number  40
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
500 AM AST Sun Oct 29 2023
 
During the past 18 to 24 hours, Tammy has only been maintaining a
small and disorganized patch of deep convection well to the
northeast of the fully exposed center.  Accordingly, the Dvorak
classifications have been decreasing, and the latest estimate from
TAFB is a T1.0/2.0.  Satellite images also show that the low-level
center has become elongated and is losing definition.  Based on
these characteristics, Tammy no longer qualifies as a tropical
cyclone, and this is the last advisory on this system.  The
initial intensity is held at 35 kt.
 
Tammy is moving eastward at 16 kt in the mid-latitude westerlies. A 
fairly sharp turn to the south is expected to occur tonight followed 
by a motion to the southwest on Monday and Tuesday as the 
post-tropical cyclone moves around the east side of a building 
subtropical ridge.  Tammy is expected to slowly weaken due to 
continued strong vertical wind shear and dry air entrainment, and it 
will likely dissipate in a few days.
 
Additional and future information on this system can be found in
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under
AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
