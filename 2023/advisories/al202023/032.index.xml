Post-Tropical Cyclone Tammy Advisory Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
500 AM AST Thu Oct 26 2023
 
...TAMMY BECOMES POST-TROPICAL, BUT IT IS STILL PRODUCING
HURRICANE-FORCE WINDS...
... THIS IS THE LAST ADVISORY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...30.5N 58.4W
ABOUT 395 MI...640 KM ESE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...85 MPH...140 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 355 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...973 MB...28.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Tammy 
was located near latitude 30.5 North, longitude 58.4 West. The 
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the north near 12 mph (19 
km/h). The system should begin to move northwestward later this 
morning, followed by a slower west-northwestward motion on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Some weakening is expected during the next few 
days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles
(315 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 973 mb (28.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swell will continue to affect portions of Bermuda, the
northern Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico during the next couple of days. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system.

Additional information on this system can be found in High Seas
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS

Post-Tropical Cyclone Tammy Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
500 AM AST Thu Oct 26 2023
 
Tammy appears to have completed its transition to a post-tropical 
cyclone, merging with the nearby front. The cloud pattern has become 
more comma shaped, with a long linear convective band, and  is no 
longer producing deep convection near the center. The cyclone is 
now frontal but likely still has a warm core, indicating that it is 
a warm seclusion-type of extratropical cyclone. Despite the 
transition, it remains a strong cyclone, and the initial intensity 
is 75 kt, based on current intensity satellite estimates. 
 
The cyclone has slowed down and made a northward turn overnight, and 
recently the system is turning more north-northwestward. The 
estimated long-term motion is 355/10 kt. Over the next day or so, 
Tammy is forecast to slow down and move generally northwestward to 
west-northwestward. Beyond 36 h there continues to be high 
uncertainty in the track forecast, with no more clarity from the 
latest global model runs. The global models continue to have 
enormous spread, and ensemble solutions that diverge in opposite 
directions. Given the uncertainty, there is little change from the 
previous forecast at this time range.

Although post-tropical, Tammy remains a powerful cyclone. In the 
near term, the increasing shear and drier air associated with a 
deep-layer trough to the west should continue to cause convection to 
dissipate, and the system to weaken over the next few days. Global 
model fields indicate Tammy could shed its frontal structure by 36 
h. A reduction in wind shear is forecast soon thereafter, and 
convection could redevelop near Tammy's center in about 2-3 days 
while it moves over 25-26C sea surface temperatures. Though it is 
not explicitly forecast, there is some potential based on the GFS 
and ECMWF simulated satellite imagery that Tammy could reacquire 
tropical characteristics this weekend or early next week. The 
chances of the system transitioning back to a tropical cyclone will 
be evaluated in routine Tropical Weather Outlooks.

This is the last NHC advisory. Additional information on this system 
can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather 
Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and 
online at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
