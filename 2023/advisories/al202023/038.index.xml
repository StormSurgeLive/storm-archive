For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Tammy, located a few hundred miles east-northeast of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Atlantic Ocean (AL96):<br/>
A small area of low pressure has formed about 120 miles northeast <br/>

strong for further development by late Monday while the system <br/>
turns northward east of the northwestern Bahamas. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Caribbean Sea:<br/>
An area of disturbed weather continues over the southwestern <br/>
Caribbean Sea in associated with a broad area of low pressure.  <br/>
Further development of this system appears unlikely while it drifts <br/>
northward or north-northwestward over the central Caribbean Sea.<br/>

Tropical Storm Tammy Discussion Number  38
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
500 PM AST Sat Oct 28 2023
 
As anticipated, Tropical Storm Tammy has weakened slightly today. 
The convection has waned in the vicinity of the low-level 
circulation center, which is now completely exposed on visible 
satellite imagery and largely devoid of convection. Current 
subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates have 
continued to trend downward, and a blend of these estimates supports 
a reduction of Tammy's initial intensity to 40 kt for this advisory.
 
The intensity forecast reasoning remains unchanged from the prior 
NHC forecast. It is possible that convection may return episodically 
during the next day or so, but a combination of strong shear and a 
dry mid-level airmass will likely preclude intensification 
throughout the forecast period. Tammy is forecast to gradually 
weaken over the next few days and become a remnant low early next 
week. The NHC forecast is similar to the prior forecast and 
represents a blend of the prior forecast and the intensity consensus 
guidance.
 
After accelerating earlier this morning, Tammy is now moving 
steadily eastward at 90/13 kt. Beginning tonight, the tropical storm 
is expected to gradually turn southeastward and then southward 
during the next day or two as it tracks along the northern and 
eastern periphery of a mid-level ridge. Early next week, Tammy and 
its remnants are forecast to make a gradual turn to the southwest 
before dissipating. The new NHC forecast is slightly faster than the 
prior advisory and represents a blend of consensus aids and the 
prior NHC forecast.
