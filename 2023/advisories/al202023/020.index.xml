...TAMMY TURNING NORTHWARD...
...HEAVY RAINS STILL OCCURING OVER PARTS OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.4N 64.0W
ABOUT 230 MI...370 KM NNW OF ANGUILLA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...80 MPH...130 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 355 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...993 MB...29.33 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located 
near latitude 21.4 North, longitude 64.0 West. Tammy is now moving 
toward the north near 10 mph (17 km/h). A turn toward the 
north-northeast or northeast is expected to begin later today 
and continue into Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Some slight strengthening is possible during the next couple 
of days followed by weakening. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 993 mb (29.33 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tammy can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Tammy is expected to produce an additional 1 to 3 inches 
of rainfall across portions of the British Virgin Islands, the 
Leeward Islands, and the northern Windward Islands through this 
morning, bringing storm total maximum amounts to 12 inches in the 
Leeward Islands.  These rains may produce isolated flash and urban 
flooding, along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of 
the Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto 
Rico during the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Tammy Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
1100 PM AST Sun Oct 22 2023
 
Satellite images show that Tammy has not become better organized
over the past several hours.  In fact, the Central Dense Overcast
(CDO) has become more fragmented in appearance and the center
appears to be near the southern portion of the CDO.  There are
however a couple of prominent convective bands over the eastern
portion of the circulation.  Upper-level outflow is restricted over
the southern semicircle of the system, suggesting the influence of
southerly vertical wind shear.  SFMR-observed surface winds from a
NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft conducting a research mission into
Tammy support a current intensity of 70-75 kt, so the advisory
intensity estimate is unchanged.
 
A center position estimate from the aircraft indicates that the
motion remains northwestward, or 325/8 kt at this time.  The
cyclone should turn northward to northeastward over the next 72
hours or so while moving around the western side of a mid-level
subtropical high.  Later in the forecast period, Tammy should begin
to interact with a cyclonic circulation that cuts off from an
eastward-moving mid-latitude trough over the western Atlantic.  
This should cause the system to turn westward around the northern 
side of the larger circulation in 3-5 days.  There continues to be 
a fairly large spread in the track guidance in this time frame, 
however.

The dynamical guidance indicates that Tammy will be in an 
environment of significant south-southwesterly vertical wind shear 
for the next few days.  This negative influence could be 
counteracted somewhat by the presence of a moist and unstable 
air mass along with warm ocean waters.  Therefore some slight 
strengthening is still predicted, along the lines of the 
Decay-SHIPS model.  This is also similar to the previous official 
intensity forecast.  By day 4, Tammy should begin to merge with a 
baroclinic zone and simulated satellite imagery from the GFS and 
ECMWF models depict a frontal appearance.  Therefore the system is 
forecast to have become extratropical by 96 hours.
  
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Heavy rain from Tammy will remain possible over the British
Virgin Islands, Leeward Islands, and northern Windward Islands into
Monday morning.  This rainfall may produce isolated flash and urban
flooding, along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
