DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Tammy was
located near latitude 13.6 North, longitude 55.7 West. Tammy is
moving toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h).  A slower 
west-northwest motion is expected through tonight.  A turn toward 
the northwest is forecast on Friday, and this motion should 
continue into the weekend.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Tammy will move near or over the Leeward Islands Friday and 
Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Gradual strengthening is expected during the next few days, and 
Tammy is forecast to be at or near hurricane intensity when it moves 
near the Leeward Islands. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tammy can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical 
storm warning area by late Friday.  Hurricane conditions are 
possible in portions of Leeward Islands Friday night and Saturday. 
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the tropical storm 
watch area beginning on Friday.
 
RAINFALL:  Through Sunday, Tammy is expected to produce storm total 
rainfall of 3 to 6 inches, with maximum amounts of 10 inches, across 
portions of the northern Windward and Leeward Islands.  Rainfall 
totals of 1 to 2 inches with maximum amounts of 4 inches are 
expected for the British and U.S. Virgin Islands into eastern Puerto 
Rico. These rains may produce isolated flash and urban flooding, 
along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain. 

STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 
to 3 feet above normal tide levels near where the center of Tammy 
moves across the Leeward Islands.

SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will begin affecting portions of 
the Lesser Antilles today, and will continue into the weekend.  
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather 
office.

Tropical Storm Tammy Special Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
800 AM AST Thu Oct 19 2023
 
A NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigating Tammy has found that
the system has strengthened overnight.  The plane has measured peak
700-mb flight level winds of 49 kt and several SFMR winds of 50 kt
in both the northeast and northern quadrants of the storm.
Therefore, the initial intensity has been raised to 50 kt. The 
intensity forecast calls for gradual strengthening during the next 
few days while Tammy moves over warm SSTS and remains within an 
environment of low to moderate vertical wind shear.  Additional 
updates to the intensity forecast may be required later this 
morning. 
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are possible across portions of the
Lesser Antilles beginning on Friday, where tropical storm
watches are currently in effect. Additional watches and warnings
will likely be required later today.
 
2.  Heavy rains from Tammy will begin to affect the northern
Windward and Leeward Islands on Friday, spreading into the British
and U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico over the weekend.  This
rainfall may produce isolated flash and urban flooding, along with
isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
