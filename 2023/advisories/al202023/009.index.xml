DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located
near latitude 14.1 North, longitude 58.6 West. Tammy is moving
toward the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue through this afternoon.  A turn 
toward the northwest is anticipated by this evening, followed
by a north-northwestward and northward turn Saturday night through
Sunday night.  On the forecast track, the center of Tammy will move
near or over portions of the Leeward Islands tonight and on
Saturday, and then move north of the northern Leeward Islands on
Sunday.
 
Data from NOAA and Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft 
indicate that the maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 
km/h) with higher gusts.  Gradual strengthening is forecast during 
the next couple of days, and Tammy is expected to be a hurricane 
while it moves near or over portions of the Leeward Islands.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from reconnaissance aircraft 
data is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tammy can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical
storm warning area beginning later today or tonight.  Hurricane 
conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area by late 
tonight or early Saturday.  Hurricane conditions are possible in 
the hurricane watch area in the Leeward Islands on Saturday.  
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the tropical storm 
watch area beginning later today.
 
RAINFALL: Tammy is expected to produce the following storm total 
rainfall:

Leeward Islands: 4 to 8 inches with maximum amounts of 12 inches

Northern Windward Islands: 2 to 4 inches with maximum amounts of 6 
inches

British and U.S. Virgin Islands into eastern Puerto Rico: 1 to 2 
inches with maximum amounts of 4 inches

These rains may produce isolated flash and urban flooding, along 
with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain. 
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above normal tide levels near where the center of Tammy
moves across the Leeward Islands.  Near the coast, the surge will 
be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Lesser Antilles during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM AST.

Hurricane Tammy Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
1100 AM AST Fri Oct 20 2023
 
Recent data from both NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter
aircraft and radar imagery from Barbados shows that the inner core
structure of the storm has become much better organized this
morning. The radar imagery has depicted strong convection that has
quickly evolved into a curved band, and more recently a closed eye. 
The aircraft data indicates that there is still some tilt to the 
circulation, but the most recent center fixes indicate that the 
pressure has fallen quickly to around 992 mb this morning.  The 
plane has reported flight-level winds of 71 kt at 700 mb, and SFMR 
values of 65-70 kt.  Based on these data, the initial intensity has 
been increased to 65 kt for this advisory, making Tammy a hurricane.
 
Tammy is moving slowly west-northwestward at about 6 kt. The storm 
should turn northwestward later today as an amplified trough moving 
off the east coast of the U.S. and into the western Atlantic erodes 
the western portion of a subtropical ridge over the central 
Atlantic. This motion is expected to bring the center of Tammy near 
or over portions of the Leeward Islands tonight and Saturday. The 
latest track prediction is similar to the previous advisory and 
lies closest to the HFIP corrected consensus during the first 
36-48 hours.  After Tammy moves north of the Leeward Islands, the 
storm is forecast to turn northward and then begin to recurve in 
the mid-latitude westerlies by days 4 and 5. There is increasing 
along-track spread in the guidance after 72 hours due to how fast 
Tammy accelerates northeastward.  Much of the guidance has been 
trending slower, and the official forecast has followed suit. 

The environment consisting of warm SSTs and light to moderate 
shear favors some additional strengthening during the next couple of 
days. The updated NHC intensity forecast calls for strengthening 
during the next 36-48 hours while Tammy approaches the Leeward 
Islands. Once Tammy is north of the Leeward Islands, increasing 
vertical wind shear is likely to limit additional intensification.  
Near the end of the period, Tammy is likely to begin its 
extratropical transition, but it is still shown to be a hurricane 
at day 5. 

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Hurricane conditions are expected in portions of the Leeward 
Islands by late tonight or Saturday morning. Tropical storm 
conditions are expected to begin in portions of the Lesser Antilles 
within the warning area later today.  
 
2.  Heavy rains from Tammy will begin to affect the Leeward and 
northern Windward Islands later today and into Saturday morning, 
spreading into the British and U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico 
as early as Sunday.  This rainfall may produce isolated flash and 
urban flooding, along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher 
terrain. 
 
3. A storm surge could produce coastal flooding in areas of onshore 
winds as the center of Tammy moves near or over the Leeward Islands. 
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous 
waves.
