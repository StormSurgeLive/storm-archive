become a powerful post-tropical cyclone by Thursday.

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto

cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
