<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Tammy, located just north of the northern Leeward Islands. <br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Caribbean Sea (AL95):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms have changed little in organization since <br/>
this morning in association with a low pressure system located over <br/>
the southwestern Caribbean Sea.  However, environmental conditions <br/>
are favorable for development, and a tropical depression could form <br/>
before the system moves inland over Nicaragua by early Tuesday.  <br/>
Regardless of development, this system could produce heavy rains <br/>
over portions of Central America during the next couple of days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located
near latitude 19.9 North, longitude 63.4 West.  Tammy is moving
toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A turn toward the north
is expected late tonight, followed by a north-northeast or

Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some slight strengthening is possible during the next few 
days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 988 mb (29.18 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tammy can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Tammy is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall:
 
Leeward Islands: 4 to 8 inches with storm total maximum amounts of
12 inches
 
Martinique and Dominica: Additional 2 to 4 inches, storm total
maximum 6 inches
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands into eastern Puerto Rico: 1 to 2
inches with maximum storm total amounts of 4 inches
 
These rains may produce isolated flash and urban flooding, along
with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Lesser Antilles during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.

Hurricane Tammy Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
500 PM AST Sun Oct 22 2023
 
The core of Tammy continues to pull away from the northern Leeward 
Islands, but a trailing area of heavy rain continues to affect 
portions of the Windward and Leeward Islands.  The NOAA Hurricane 
Hunters found maximum 750-mb flight-level winds of 83 kt and peak 
SFMR winds of around 70 kt.  In addition, the minimum pressure has 
fallen to 988 mb.  These data support nudging the initial intensity 
up to 75 kt.  Tammy continues to have a small central dense 
overcast pattern in satellite images with very cold cloud tops 
evident near the center.  An ASCAT-B pass from a few hours ago was 
helpful in adjusting the 34- and 50-kt wind radii, and it confirmed 
that Tammy remains a relatively compact tropical cyclone.
 
The hurricane is moving northwestward at 8 kt on the southwestern
periphery of a subtropical ridge centered over the central Atlantic.
A turn to the north is forecast to occur late tonight, followed by a
northeastward motion beginning Monday night when a large-scale
trough over the northeast U.S. shifts eastward, eroding the ridge.
After that time, the models show the trough cutting off and merging
with Tammy, which will likely cause a sharp turn to the left.  The
models have come in slightly better agreement in the overall
scenario, and only small changes were made to the previous NHC track
forecast.
 
Tammy will likely fluctuate in strength during the next few days
while it remains over warm SSTs and in a moderate wind shear
environment.  After Tammy merges with the trough, dry air
entrainment and stronger shear should cause weakening and likely
lead to extratropical transition in 3 to 4 days.  The NHC intensity
forecast is similar to the previous one and roughly in the middle
of the guidance envelope.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  The heaviest rains from Tammy will continue over the Leeward
Islands through tonight.  This rainfall may produce isolated flash
and urban flooding, along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher
terrain.
