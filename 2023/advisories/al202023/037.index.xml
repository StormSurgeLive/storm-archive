DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Tammy was
located near latitude 33.3 North, longitude 58.7 West. Tammy is
moving toward the east near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this motion is
expected to continue today, followed by a turn to the southeast
tonight. Early next week, Tammy is forecast to turn southward and
eventually southwestward as a remnant low.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and Tammy is
forecast to become a post-tropical remnant low early next week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect Bermuda
through today. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Tammy Discussion Number  37
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
1100 AM AST Sat Oct 28 2023
 
Tammy has not changed much this morning. The impact of strong
westerly wind shear is evident, with an exposed low-level center
apparent in visible satellite imagery. Modest deep convection
remains confined to the eastern half of the circulation, and cloud
tops have continued to gradually warm. The subjective TAFB
satellite estimate of T3.0/45 kt and a blend of objective satellite
estimates continue to support an initial intensity of 45 kt for this
advisory.
 
Under the continued influence of strong shear for the next 48
hours, as well as a dry mid-level airmass approaching from the
northwest, Tammy is expected to continue weakening. Global and
regional models suggest that most of the deep convection will
diminish by late Sunday or Monday, at which time Tammy is forecast
to become a remnant low.  The NHC forecast is similar to the prior
forecast and represents a blend of the prior forecast and intensity
consensus models.
 
Tammy has accelerated this morning and is now moving east-northeast
or 080/10 kt. The tropical storm is expected to continue eastward
and southeastward for the next day or so along the northern
periphery of a mid-level ridge. Early next week, Tammy and its
remnants are forecast to make a gradual turn toward the
south and southwest before dissipating. The new NHC forecast is
slightly faster than the prior advisory and represents a blend of
consensus aids HCCA and TVCN with the prior NHC forecast.
