DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located
near latitude 15.2 North, longitude 60.4 West.  Tammy is now moving
toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion
is expected to continue through tonight.  A turn toward the
north-northwest is forecast on Sunday, followed by a turn toward
the north on Monday.  On the forecast track, the center of Tammy
will move near or over portions of the Leeward Islands through
early Sunday, and then move north of the northern Leeward Islands
by Sunday afternoon.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Fluctuations in intensity are possible during the next few
days, but Tammy is expected to remain a hurricane while it passes
near or over the Leeward Islands.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.27 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tammy can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to begin in the hurricane
warning area later this morning and spread northward across the
Leeward Islands today and tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected within the tropical storm warning areas today and tonight.
Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch areas
today and tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are possible on
Martinique today and the British Virgin Islands tonight and Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: Tammy is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall:
 
Leeward Islands: 4 to 8 inches with maximum amounts of 12 inches.
 
Portions of the Windward Islands: 2 to 4 inches with maximum amounts
of 6 inches.
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands into eastern Puerto Rico: 1 to 2
inches with maximum amounts of 4 inches.
 
These rains may produce isolated flash and urban flooding, along
with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above normal tide levels near where the center of Tammy
moves across the Leeward Islands.  Near the coast, the surge will
be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Lesser Antilles during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Tammy Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
500 AM AST Sat Oct 21 2023
 
Mosaic radar data from Martinique, Guadeloupe, and Barbados show
that Tammy's core is passing just to the east of Martinique and
Dominica.  The eyewall has become more pronounced during the past
several hours although it is open on the south side.  In infrared
satellite imagery, the hurricane has a relatively small CDO and a
prominent trailing convective band to the south, but no evidence of
an eye.  Based on earlier Air Force Reserve reconnaissance data,
Tammy's initial intensity remains 70 kt.
 
Aircraft fixes and the radar data indicate that Tammy has finally
turned northwestward at 305/8 kt.  A strong mid-latitude trough
moving off the east coast of the United States is eroding the
western portion of the Atlantic subtropical ridge, which should
cause Tammy to continue northwestward across the Leeward Islands
through tonight and early Sunday, and then turn north-northwestward
and northward Sunday and Monday.  For the first 3 days of the
forecast, the new NHC track prediction is nearly on top of the
previous forecast and is close to the HCCA consensus aids.  There
has been a dramatic change in the global model solutions beyond day
3.  Some models (the ECMWF and UKMET) show the trough completely
bypassing Tammy and leaving the cyclone to stall north of Puerto
Rico and the Virgin Islands, while others (the GFS and Canadian)
initially show Tammy turning northeastward but then interacting
with a shortwave trough and slowing down over the western Atlantic.
The NHC track forecast has been shifted significantly westward on
days 4 and 5 to account for these latest model trends.
 
Tammy will continue moving over very warm waters of 29-30 degrees
Celsius during the next few days, but the storm will also continue
to contend with some moderate westerly or southwesterly vertical
shear.  Fluctuations in intensity will be possible during the next
few days depending on if the oceanic or atmospheric factors win
out, but all in all little change in strength is predicted during
the next 3 to 4 days.  Some weakening is possible at the end of the
forecast period due to a more significant increase in shear.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are expected in portions
of the Leeward and northern Windward Islands through Sunday.
 
2.  Heavy rains from Tammy will affect the Windward and Leeward
Islands today, spreading into the British and U.S. Virgin Islands
and eastern Puerto Rico as early as Sunday.  This rainfall may
produce isolated flash and urban flooding, along with isolated
mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
3.  A storm surge could produce coastal flooding in areas of onshore
winds as the center of Tammy moves near or over the Leeward Islands.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous
waves.
