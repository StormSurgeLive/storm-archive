DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located
near latitude 17.8 North, longitude 61.9 West. Tammy is moving
toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h) and this general
motion is expected through Sunday, followed by a turn toward the
north on Monday.  On the forecast track, the center of Tammy will
move north of the northern Leeward Islands by Sunday afternoon.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some slight strengthening is possible during the next 
couple of days.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft observations is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tammy can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected over portions of the
northern Leeward Islands tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected within the tropical storm warning areas through tonight.
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the British Virgin Islands
tonight and Sunday.
 
RAINFALL: Tammy is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall:
 
Leeward Islands: 4 to 8 inches with storm total maximum amounts of
12 inches
 
Martinique and Dominica: Additional 2 to 4 inches, storm total
maximum 6 inches
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands into eastern Puerto Rico: 1 to 2
inches with maximum storm total amounts of 4 inches
 
These rains may produce isolated flash and urban flooding, along
with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above normal tide levels near where the center of Tammy
moves across the Leeward Islands.  Near the coast, the surge will
be accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Lesser Antilles during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Tammy Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
500 PM AST Sat Oct 21 2023
 
Tammy passed just east of Guadeloupe around 18Z and is now located
near Antigua.  Radar imagery continues to show a tight and
well-organized inner core, and the earlier aircraft data indicated
that the hurricane-force winds were confined to that region.
Despite Tammy having passed just east of Dominica and Guadeloupe
today, surface observations indicate that winds did not get
particularly high at those locations due to Tammy being a very
compact hurricane.  The initial intensity is held at 75 kt based on
the earlier aircraft data and steady state appearance in radar
images.  Both the NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunters are
scheduled to investigate Tammy again this evening.
 
The hurricane is moving north-northwestward, 335 degrees, at 9 kt.
A continued northwest to north-northwest motion is expected during
the next 12-24 hours, taking the core of Tammy over or just east of
the Leeward Islands during that time.  After the hurricane pulls
north of the islands on Sunday, a turn to the north seems likely
when the system moves in the flow between a ridge over the central
Atlantic and a large trough over the western Atlantic.  The spread
in the guidance continues to be very large in the 4- and 5-day time
frame.  In fact, the difference in the model predicted center
positions of Tammy at day 5 is more than 1000 miles.  The NHC
intensity forecast is similar is the previous one through day 3, but
is again slower than the earlier forecast at days 4 and 5, trending
toward the HCCA guidance.
 
Tammy is expected to remain over very warm 29 to 30 C SSTs during
the next few days, however, it will also remain in a moderate wind
shear environment.  These conditions will likely result in slow
strengthening during the next few days.  The opportunity for
strengthening will likely end early next when Tammy moves into a
region of stronger shear, which should cause a weakening trend.  The
NHC intensity is again nudged upward, trending toward the latest
consensus models.  However, the intensity forecast at long range is
of low confidence since Tammy's future strength will likely be
correlated to the track.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are expected in portions
of the Leeward Islands through early Sunday.
 
2.  The heaviest rains from Tammy will continue over the Leeward
Islands through Sunday. This rainfall may produce isolated flash and
urban flooding, along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher
terrain.
 
3.  A storm surge could produce coastal flooding in areas of onshore
winds as the center of Tammy moves near or over the Leeward Islands.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous
waves.
