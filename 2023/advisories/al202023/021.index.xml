...TAMMY MOVING NORTHWARD...
...HEAVY RAINS LINGERING OVER PORTIONS OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.9N 63.9W
ABOUT 260 MI...420 KM N OF ANGUILLA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...80 MPH...130 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 5 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...993 MB...29.33 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Tammy was located 
near latitude 21.9 North, longitude 63.9 West. Tammy is moving 
toward the north near 7 mph (11 km/h). A turn toward the 
north-northeast or northeast is expected to begin later today and 
continue into Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Some slight strengthening is possible during the next day or 
so followed by weakening.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 993 mb (29.33 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tammy can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Rain bands south of Hurricane Tammy are expected to
produce an additional 1 to 3 inches of rainfall across portions of
the Virgin Islands and northern Leeward Islands today, bringing
storm total maximum amounts to 12 inches in the Leeward Islands. The
additional rainfall may produce isolated flash and urban flooding,
along with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto
Rico during the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Tammy Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
1100 AM AST Mon Oct 23 2023
 
Tammy appears to be holding steady in spite of the moderate 
southwesterly vertical wind shear.  There have been regular bursts 
of deep convection over the center and a fragmented band around the 
eastern portion of the circulation.  The latest intensity is held at 
70 kt to represent a blend of the subjective satellite intensity 
estimates from TAFB and SAB, which were 77 kt and 65 kt, 
respectively.

The hurricane is moving northward at 005/6 kt.  Tammy should 
continue to turn north-northeastward to northeastward in the flow 
between a mid-latitude trough over the western Atlantic and a 
mid-level ridge over the central subtropical Atlantic.  Beyond 60 h, 
there is still a significant spread in the model guidance.  Most of 
the regional models and the GFS model forecast Tammy to continue 
northward around the western side of the ridge.  A different cluster 
of model solutions, including the ECMWF, merge Tammy with a cutoff 
low that forms from the trough and turns the cyclone northwestward 
to westward.  The latest NHC track forecast favors the latter 
scenario and has been nudged slightly north of the previous 
prediction.

Southwesterly shear appears to be influencing Tammy's structure.  
The vertical wind shear is expected to persist and likely increase 
in about 36 h, forcing some dry mid-level air into the cyclone's 
circulation.  These environmental conditions should lead to gradual 
weakening.  Model guidance predicts that Tammy should undergo 
structural changes over the next couple of days as it interacts with 
the aforementioned cutoff low.  The latest official intensity 
forecast now shows Tammy becoming extratropical in 72 hours. 
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Heavy rain from Tammy will remain possible over the British 
Virgin Islands and Leeward Islands through today.  This rainfall may 
produce isolated flash and urban flooding, along with isolated 
mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
