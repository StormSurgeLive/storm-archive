DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Tammy was
located near latitude 13.8 North, longitude 58.0 West. Tammy is
moving toward the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A gradual
turn to the northwest with a decrease in forward speed is forecast 
later today, and this motion should continue through Saturday.  A 
more northward motion is forecast to begin Saturday night or Sunday. 
On the forecast track, the center of Tammy will move near or over 
the Leeward Islands later today through Saturday, and then move 
north of the Leeward Islands Saturday night and Sunday.
 
Data collected so far by a Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft indicate that maximum sustained winds remain near 60 mph 
(95 km/h) with higher gusts.  Gradual strengthening is expected to 
begin later today and continue into this weekend.  Tammy is forecast 
to be at or near hurricane intensity when it moves near the Leeward 
Islands tonight and Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data is 1002 mb 
(29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tammy can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical
storm warning area beginning later today.  Hurricane conditions
are possible in portions of the Leeward Islands tonight and
Saturday. Tropical storm conditions are possible within the tropical
storm watch area beginning later today.
 
RAINFALL: Tammy is expected to produce the following storm total
rainfall:
 
Leeward Islands: 4 to 8 inches with maximum amounts of 12 inches
 
Northern Windward Islands: 2 to 4 inches with maximum amounts of 6
inches
 
British and U.S. Virgin Islands into eastern Puerto Rico: 1 to 2
inches with maximum amounts of 4 inches
 
These rains may produce isolated flash and urban flooding, along
with isolated mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above normal tide levels near where the center of Tammy
moves across the Leeward Islands.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tammy will continue to affect portions of
the Lesser Antilles during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Tammy Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202023
1100 PM AST Thu Oct 19 2023
 
Tammy appears to be in the process of reorganizing. The low-level 
circulation we had been following appears to have slowed down 
tonight, as confirmed by the last few fixes from the NOAA-P3 
reconnaissance aircraft that has been in the storm tonight. In 
addition, the Tail-Doppler Radar (TDR) on board the aircraft has 
shown that the tilt between the low-level (1 km) and mid-level (5 
km) center has been reduced as a result of this slowdown. There is 
also evidence of convection beginning to wrap into the up-shear 
quadrant of the system on both GPM microwave imagery available at 
2350 UTC and recent radar images from Barbados. However, this 
restructuring has not yet resulted in an increase in the maximum 
sustained winds, which remain about 50 kt for this advisory, in 
agreement with a blend of the subjective Dvorak data and the 
earlier TDR data in the northeast quadrant. 

Recon fixes indicate the Tammy is still moving generally 
west-northwestward but slower at 290/9 kt. There is not much new to 
report from the track reasoning this cycle. An enhanced mid-level 
ridge (anomalously strong for this time of year) is beginning to 
shift eastward as a sharp mid-latitude trough approaches from the 
west. This shift should allow Tammy to turn gradually to the 
northwest and then north-northwest over the next 2-3 days. However, 
the forward motion related to this turn is forecast to be rather 
slow, related to an upper-level cutoff low south of the mid-level 
ridge weakening its steering influence on Tammy. Compared to 24 
hours ago, the global model guidance is in better agreement on this 
track solution, but continues to trend slower and a bit east of the 
prior cycle. Thus, the NHC track forecast has been adjusted quite a 
bit slower and a little further east of the prior one, blending the 
prior track with the consensus aids HCCA and TVCN. It should be 
noted that both the GFS and ECMWF remain on the east side of the 
guidance envelope, and further adjustments in that direction may be 
needed in subsequent cycles. Tammy is still forecast to recurve to 
the north-northeast by the end of the forecast period. However, 
there is a substantial amount of spread in the along-track direction 
in both the GFS and ECMWF ensembles, related to whether or not Tammy 
is fully picked up by the mid-latitude trough.
 
Assuming Tammy is in the process of becoming better vertically 
aligned, the storm has an opportunity to intensify as shear remains 
light to moderate (10-20 kt) and sea-surface temperatures remain 
quite warm (near 30 C). The guidance this cycle shows a bit more 
short-term intensification than before, and the NHC intensity 
forecast follows suit, showing gradual intensification to hurricane 
intensity in 36 h and a bit more intensification through day 4. 
Increasing southwesterly vertical wind shear at the end of the of 
forecast period may begin to induce weakening as Tammy moves into 
the stronger mid-latitude flow ahead of the mid-latitude trough. The 
NHC intensity forecast is close to or just a shade under the latest 
consensus aids HCCA and IVCN.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in portions
of the Lesser Antilles beginning Friday, where a tropical storm
warning is in effect.  Tropical storm and hurricane conditions are
possible elsewhere in the Leeward Islands where hurricane and
tropical storm watches are currently in effect. Additional watches
and warnings could be required on Friday.
 
2.  Heavy rains from Tammy will begin to affect the Leeward and 
northern Windward Islands on Friday, spreading into the British and 
U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico over the weekend.  This rainfall 
may produce isolated flash and urban flooding, along with isolated 
mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
