NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 AM PDT Thu Aug 3 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Dora, located several hundred miles southwest of the southern tip <br/>
of the Baja California Peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Off the coast of Southern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms located <br/>
several hundred miles south of the coast of southern Mexico is <br/>
associated with a tropical wave. An area of low pressure is expected <br/>
to develop from this feature during the next day or so, and <br/>
environmental conditions appear conducive for development of this <br/>
system. A tropical depression is likely to form over the weekend as <br/>
it moves west-northwestward or northwestward, parallel to but not <br/>
far offshore of the southwestern coast of Mexico. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

<title>Hurricane Dora Forecast Discussion Number 13</title>

Hurricane Dora Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052023
1100 AM HST Thu Aug 03 2023

Microwave satellite data received between 12-14Z suggests that Dora 
has been undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle.  In addition, the 
eye has been becoming more distinct during the past hour or two, 
although it is not much larger than the pinhole eye seen last night. 
Based on the satellite intensity estimates and the apparent 
eyewall replacement, the initial intensity is set at 105 kt.
 
The initial motion remains 265/16 kt.  As mentioned before, a 
well-established low- to mid-level ridge north of Dora is expected 
to maintain this general motion for the next several days. The 
track guidance, while tightly clustered, has shifted a little to 
the south from the previous advisory, and the forecast track is 
also nudged southward.  The new forecast track is close to the 
various consensus models.

The latest shear estimates and forecasts suggest the expected 
increase in easterly shear has not yet occurred. Based on this, 
there is probably a 6-12 h window for Dora to re-intensify as the 
eyewall replacement cycle ends, and the new intensity forecast 
shows modest intensification during that time.  After 12 h, 
increased shear and slowly decreasing sea surface temperatures along 
the forecast track should cause weakening through 48 h.  After 48 h, 
the shear is forecast to decrease while Dora is over water 
temperatures of 26-27C.  The intensity guidance during this time 
shows a more gradual weakening than during the 12-48 h period, and 
this part of the intensity forecast follows the overall trend of the 
guidance.  While the wind field of Dora may expand slightly due to 
the eyewall replacement, it is expected to remain a compact system 
that could be more prone than normal to rapid intensity 
fluctuations.
