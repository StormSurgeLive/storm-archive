500 PM PDT Fri Aug 4 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Dora, located more than 1300 miles west-southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California Peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Off the coast of Southwestern Mexico (EP97):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to show signs of organization in <br/>
association with a broad area of low pressure located a couple of <br/>
hundred miles south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Satellite data suggest <br/>
the circulation of the system is becoming better defined, and a <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form later tonight or on Saturday <br/>
as it moves generally northwestward at about 15 mph, parallel to but <br/>
not far offshore of the southwestern coast of Mexico. Interests <br/>
along the southwestern coast of Mexico and the southern portion of <br/>
the Baja California peninsula should monitor the progress of this <br/>
system during the next few days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Dora Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052023
500 PM HST Fri Aug 04 2023
 
Deep convection continues to burst within Dora's eyewall, and due
to the resulting convective canopy, there have not been any hints
of an eye during the past few hours.  In fact, a recent 0052 UTC 
SSMIS microwave pass doesn't show an eye either, but instead a 
compact curved band wrapping into the center.  TAFB and SAB both 
used the Dvorak embedded center pattern and provided consensus 
estimates of T5.0/5.0, which closely matches the latest objective 
ADT and AiDT numbers from UW-CIMSS.  Dora's initial intensity is 
therefore set at 90 kt.
 
Dora's motion remains westward at 265/16 kt.  The low- to mid-level
ridge to the north of the hurricane is expected to strengthen in a
couple of days, which should result in Dora moving faster toward the
west while it passes well to the south of Hawaii early next week.
The track guidance has been tightly clustered and unwavering, and
the new NHC forecast is merely an update of the previous prediction,
lying close to a blend of the HCCA and TVCE consensus aids.
 
It appears that some moderate mid-level westerly shear (beneath the
outflow layer) may develop in Dora's environment in a couple of
days as a result of the strengthening low- to mid-level steering
flow.  The thermodynamic environment is not ideal with (1) sea
surface temperatures along Dora's forecast path only marginally
warm at 26-27C, (2) the hurricane about to move through a more
stable environment during the next 48 hours, followed by (3) a
drier mid-level environment after 48 hours.  Since the worst of
these conditions doesn't appear to overlap in time and space,
Dora's intensity is forecast to decrease gradually or be relatively
steady with some fluctuations for much of the next 5 days.  The
updated NHC intensity forecast is a blend of the previous forecast
with the latest HCCA corrected-consensus model.
