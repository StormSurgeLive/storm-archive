Tropical Storm Eugene Advisory Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062023
300 PM MDT Sat Aug 05 2023
 
...DEPRESSION BECOMES THE FIFTH TROPICAL STORM OF THE EASTERN
NORTH PACIFIC HURRICANE SEASON...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM MDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.2N 107.7W
ABOUT 290 MI...470 KM SSE OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 315 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1004 MB...29.65 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the southern portion of the Baja California peninsula
should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM MDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Eugene was
located near latitude 19.2 North, longitude 107.7 West. Eugene is
moving toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this motion
should continue through the weekend followed by a turn toward the
west-northwest early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some further strengthening is forecast during the next couple of 
days.  Afterward, weakening is expected and the cyclone should 
quickly become a remnant low in 3 days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Heavy rainfall associated with Eugene will remain mostly 
off the southwest Mexican coast.  The outer edges of rainfall from 
the depression may produce 1 to 2 inches of rain along the coastal 
sections of the southwestern Mexican states of Colima, Jalisco, 
Nayarit and the southern portion of Baja California Sur.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM MDT.

Tropical Storm Eugene Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062023
300 PM MDT Sat Aug 05 2023
 
This afternoon's satellite presentation of the system has improved, 
with a well-developed curved band in its eastern semicircle and a 
recent burst of deep convection with -75 Celsius cloud tops just 
east of the surface circulation.  Based on this and a consensus of 
the objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS, the system is being 
upgraded to Tropical Storm Eugene, making it the fifth tropical 
storm of the eastern North Pacific hurricane season.
 
Although dry mid-tropospheric air originating from mainland Mexico 
may be negatively affecting the cyclone's intensification rate, as 
indicated by the presence of a few arc clouds, a brief window of 
opportunity still exists for further strengthening during the next 
day or so.  By mid-period, Eugene is expected to move over the 
cooler water west of the Baja California peninsula and enter a 
surrounding dry and stable marine-layer air mass.  The NHC forecast 
calls for the cyclone to degenerate to a remnant low by 72 hours, or 
sooner, and dissipation in 5 days which is slightly below the Decay 
SHIPS statistical guidance, but close to the LGEM and the usually 
reliable intensity consensus guidance.
 
The initial estimated motion is northwestward or 315/13 kt.  The
track forecast philosophy remains unchanged, and Eugene should move
generally northwestward in the short term within the southeasterly
mid-level steering flow provided by a subtropical ridge to the
north.  By 48 hours, the vertically shallow cyclone should turn
toward the west-northwest in the lower boundary trade wind flow
while a reduction in forward speed takes place, possibly meandering
before dissipating next week.  The updated NHC track forecast is
very similar to the previous official forecast and lies near the
various consensus models.  Although the track forecast is currently
off the southwestern coast of Mexico, enough uncertainty still
exists that interests in the southern portion of the Baja
California peninsula should monitor the progress of this system.

Hurricane Dora Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052023
500 PM HST Sat Aug 05 2023
 
Dora has acquired annular traits, highlighted by a circular and 
relatively large eye (compared to the size of the hurricane itself), 
a wide band of very cold cloud tops within the CDO, and dissolving 
outer bands around the periphery of the circulation.  As a 
reflection of this, the Annular Hurricane Index (AHI) has increased 
to about 85 out of 100.  The maximum winds are now estimated to be 
125 kt, which best matches a Dvorak estimate of T6.5/127 kt from SAB 
and objective ADT and AiDT numbers of 123-125 kt.
 
There's no new news to report regarding Dora's forecast track.  A
ridge building westward to the north of the hurricane is expected
to push Dora faster toward the west while it passes well south of
Hawaii in the next 2-4 days.  The track guidance--and the NHC
official forecast--have been remarkably steady for the past few
days, and the new forecast is basically an update of the previous
prediction.
 
Fluctuations in intensity are possible during the next 6-12 hours
while Dora becomes increasingly annular.  The hurricane is forecast
to continue moving nearly parallel to the sea surface temperature
gradient, over waters of 26-27C for the next several days.
Deep-layer shear is expected to remain light, although Dora is
likely to move into a drier, more subsident environment into early
next week.  That said, annular hurricanes have a proclivity for
weakening more slowly than expected or suggested by intensity
models, and the new NHC forecast therefore lies near the upper
bound of the available guidance, showing only gradual weakening
through the 5-day forecast period.  This forecast is closest to the 
SHIPS guidance during the first couple of days, and then trends 
close to the HCCA and IVCN consensus aids thereafter.
