BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Eugene Advisory Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062023
800 PM PDT Sun Aug 06 2023
 
...EUGENE CONTINUES TO MOVE AWAY FROM BAJA CALIFORNIA SUR...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 PM PDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...23.3N 115.0W
ABOUT 325 MI...525 KM W OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 20 MPH...31 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...997 MB...29.44 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM PDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Eugene was
located near latitude 23.3 North, longitude 115.0 West.  Eugene is
moving toward the west-northwest near 20 mph (31 km/h), and this
motion should continue for the next day or so, followed by a turn
to the north and a sharp reduction in forward speed.  Eugene should
continue moving farther away from Baja California Sur.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Eugene is forecast to weaken to a tropical 
depression on Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Eugene will affect portions of the coasts
of west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur during the next day
or so. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM PDT.

Tropical Storm Eugene Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062023
800 PM PDT Sun Aug 06 2023
 
Deep convection associated with Eugene has been decreasing as the 
cyclone begins to move over cooler waters.  There is 
significant uncertainty in the current intensity of the storm, 
which is set at 50 kt based on a blend of subjective and objective 
Dvorak estimates.  Given the diminishing convection, this may be a 
generous estimate, however.

Eugene continues to move briskly toward the west-northwest with an 
initial motion estimate of 295/17 kt.  A pronounced weakness in the 
mid-level subtropical ridge along 120W-125W should cause the 
cyclone to slow down considerably in 24 to 36 hours.  Thereafter 
Eugene is likely to turn northward into the weakness, and by 48-60 
hours, the system should drift slowly as the steering currents 
collapse.  The official track forecast follows the corrected 
multi-model consensus, HCCA, and is quite similar to the previous 
NHC prediction.

The cyclone will be moving over progressively cooler waters and 
into an increasingly drier air mass.  Thus Eugene should continue 
to weaken and degenerate into a post-tropical remnant low pressure 
system in 36 hours, or sooner.  The NHC intensity forecast is close 
to the model consensus, IVCN.  Given the recent decay of 
convection, however, the system could weaken even faster than 
shown here.
