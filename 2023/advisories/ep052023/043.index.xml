Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 PM PDT Thu Aug 10 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Central East Pacific (EP98):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave located <br/>
several hundred miles south-southwest of the coast of southwestern <br/>
Mexico have become a little better organized since yesterday. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear conducive for gradual development of <br/>
this system, and a tropical depression is likely to form late this <br/>
weekend or early next week while it moves generally westward at <br/>
about 15 mph across the central portion of the basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western East Pacific: <br/>
Another tropical wave located well to the southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula is producing some disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms. Some slow development of this system is <br/>
possible during the next several days while it moves westward at 10 <br/>
to 15 mph across the far western portion of the basin and into the <br/>
Central Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Off the Coast of Southern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure is forecast to form offshore of Central <br/>
America in a few days. Environmental conditions are expected to be <br/>
conducive for gradual development of this system, and a tropical <br/>
depression could form during the early or middle part of next week <br/>
while it moves generally west-northwestward, roughly parallel to the <br/>
coast of southern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
