Tropical Storm Eugene Advisory Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062023
300 PM MDT Sat Aug 05 2023
 
...DEPRESSION BECOMES THE FIFTH TROPICAL STORM OF THE EASTERN
NORTH PACIFIC HURRICANE SEASON...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM MDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.2N 107.7W
ABOUT 290 MI...470 KM SSE OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 315 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1004 MB...29.65 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the southern portion of the Baja California peninsula
should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM MDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Eugene was
located near latitude 19.2 North, longitude 107.7 West. Eugene is
moving toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this motion
should continue through the weekend followed by a turn toward the
west-northwest early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some further strengthening is forecast during the next couple of 
days.  Afterward, weakening is expected and the cyclone should 
quickly become a remnant low in 3 days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Heavy rainfall associated with Eugene will remain mostly 
off the southwest Mexican coast.  The outer edges of rainfall from 
the depression may produce 1 to 2 inches of rain along the coastal 
sections of the southwestern Mexican states of Colima, Jalisco, 
Nayarit and the southern portion of Baja California Sur.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM MDT.

Tropical Storm Eugene Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062023
300 PM MDT Sat Aug 05 2023
 
This afternoon's satellite presentation of the system has improved, 
with a well-developed curved band in its eastern semicircle and a 
recent burst of deep convection with -75 Celsius cloud tops just 
east of the surface circulation.  Based on this and a consensus of 
the objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS, the system is being 
upgraded to Tropical Storm Eugene, making it the fifth tropical 
storm of the eastern North Pacific hurricane season.
 
Although dry mid-tropospheric air originating from mainland Mexico 
may be negatively affecting the cyclone's intensification rate, as 
indicated by the presence of a few arc clouds, a brief window of 
opportunity still exists for further strengthening during the next 
day or so.  By mid-period, Eugene is expected to move over the 
cooler water west of the Baja California peninsula and enter a 
surrounding dry and stable marine-layer air mass.  The NHC forecast 
calls for the cyclone to degenerate to a remnant low by 72 hours, or 
sooner, and dissipation in 5 days which is slightly below the Decay 
SHIPS statistical guidance, but close to the LGEM and the usually 
reliable intensity consensus guidance.
 
The initial estimated motion is northwestward or 315/13 kt.  The
track forecast philosophy remains unchanged, and Eugene should move
generally northwestward in the short term within the southeasterly
mid-level steering flow provided by a subtropical ridge to the
north.  By 48 hours, the vertically shallow cyclone should turn
toward the west-northwest in the lower boundary trade wind flow
while a reduction in forward speed takes place, possibly meandering
before dissipating next week.  The updated NHC track forecast is
very similar to the previous official forecast and lies near the
various consensus models.  Although the track forecast is currently
off the southwestern coast of Mexico, enough uncertainty still
exists that interests in the southern portion of the Baja
California peninsula should monitor the progress of this system.

Hurricane Dora Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052023
1100 AM HST Sat Aug 05 2023

Dora has become significantly better organized over the past six 
hours, with a well-defined 15 n mi wide eye inside a cold central 
dense overcast.  The various subjective and objective satellite 
intensity estimates are now in the 100-120 kt range, and the 
initial intensity is increased to 115 kt in best agreement with the 
subjective estimates from TAFB and SAB.

As noted in the last several advisories, Dora continues moving 
westward along the southern side of a deep-layer ridge to the north. 
This ridge is expected to build westward for the next three days 
or so, which should induce a somewhat faster forward speed while it 
passes well south of Hawaii early next week.  There has been little 
change to the track guidance since the last advisory, and the new 
forecast track is again almost identical to the old track.

Dora is moving over sea surface temperatures near 27C, and it is 
currently in a light-shear environment. This is at least partly 
responsible for the current intensification.  The intensity 
guidance suggests this round of intensification should be almost 
over, although there is some uncertainty in this since it 
underestimated how strong the storm would get today.  Based on the 
current trends and the current guidance, the intensity forecast 
calls for some additional strengthening during the next 12 h, 
followed by some weakening.  After 48 h, while Dora should remain 
over 27C sea surface temperatures and in light shear through 96 h, 
it is expected to encounter a drier environment and an area of 
upper-level convergence.  These factors should lead to continued 
gradual weakening, with the caveat that there is a large spread in 
the guidance on how much weakening will occur.  The early part of 
the intensity forecast follows the upper edge of the intensity 
guidance, while the 60-120 h portion is in best agreement with the 
SHIPS model.
