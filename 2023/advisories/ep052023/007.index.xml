1100 PM PDT Tue Aug 1 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
upgraded Hurricane Dora, located several hundred miles off the <br/>
southwestern coast of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Off the coast of Southern Mexico:<br/>
A tropical wave near Guatemala is expected to lead to the formation <br/>
of an area of low pressure a few hundred miles south of the coast of <br/>
southern Mexico in a day or two.  Thereafter, gradual development of <br/>
this system is possible, and a tropical depression could form over <br/>
the weekend while it moves west-northwestward or northwestward, <br/>
roughly parallel to the southwestern coast of Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Dora Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052023
1100 PM HST Tue Aug 01 2023
 
Dora is still rapidly intensifying and is well on its way to 
becoming a major hurricane.  An eye is apparent in microwave 
imagery and is beginning to show up in geostationary images as well. 
The current intensity has been boosted to 80 kt in agreement with 
the latest objective and subjective Dvorak estimates, which is an 
increase of about 45 kt over the past 24 hours.  The system remains 
quite small, with a radius of maximum winds of 10 n mi or even less. 
The cirrus-level outflow pattern is quite symmetric and well 
defined.
 
Dora has been moving just slightly south of due west, or about 
260/14 kt.  A 500 mb ridge is well established to the north of the 
hurricane, and global model guidance indicates that the ridge 
should build westward over the next couple of days.  This steering 
scenario should result in a continued westward to 
west-southwestward motion over most of the forecast period.  The 
NHC track forecast lies between the latest simple and corrected 
consensus, TVCE and HCCA, guidance and is near or just a bit south 
of the previous official forecast.

The hurricane is moving over ocean waters with SSTs above 29 deg C 
and in an environment of weak vertical wind shear.  All 
indications are that the rapid intensification (RI) episode should 
continue for at least the next 24 hours.  This is supported by the 
various RI indices, for example the Deterministic to Probabilistic 
Statistical Model (DTOPS) which shows a 63 percent chance of RI for 
today.  One complicating factor for the intensity forecast is a 
possible eyewall replacement cycle which could slow Dora's rate of 
strengthening.  In 48 hours or so, some increase in easterly shear 
and a cooler waters are expected to induce gradual weakening.  The 
official intensity forecast is generally near the high end of the 
model guidance.
