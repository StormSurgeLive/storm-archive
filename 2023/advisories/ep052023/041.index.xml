Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 AM PDT Thu Aug 10 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Central East Pacific:<br/>
A tropical wave continues to produce a large area of disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms several hundred miles south-southwest of <br/>
the coast of southwestern Mexico. Environmental conditions appear <br/>
conducive for gradual development of this system, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form late this weekend or early next week <br/>
while it moves westward at about 15 mph across the central portion <br/>
of the basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western East Pacific: <br/>
Another tropical wave located well to the southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula is producing some disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms. Some slow development of this system is <br/>
possible during the next several days while it moves generally <br/>
westward at 10 to 15 mph across the far western portion of the basin <br/>
and into the Central Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Off the Coast of Southern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure is forecast to form offshore of Central <br/>
America in a few days. Environmental conditions are expected to be <br/>
conducive for gradual development of this system, and a tropical <br/>
depression could form during the early or middle part of next week <br/>
while it moves generally west-northwestward, roughly parallel to the <br/>
coast of southern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
