Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 AM PDT Fri Aug 11 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Central East Pacific (EP98):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles southwest <br/>
of Manzanillo, Mexico, continues to produce disorganized showers and <br/>
a few thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions are conducive for <br/>
gradual development of this system, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form late this weekend or early next week while it moves <br/>
westward or northwestward at about 10 mph across the central portion <br/>
of the basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western East Pacific: <br/>
Another tropical wave located well to the southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula is producing a large area <br/>
of disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Some slow development <br/>
of this system is possible during the next several days while it <br/>
moves westward to west-northwestward at about 10 mph across the far <br/>
western portion of the basin, crossing into the Central Pacific <br/>
basin on Sunday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Off the Coast of Southern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure is forecast to form offshore of Central <br/>
America in a few days.  Environmental conditions are expected to be <br/>
conducive for gradual development of this system, and a tropical <br/>
depression could form during the early or middle part of next week <br/>
while it moves generally west-northwestward, roughly parallel to the <br/>
coast of southern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
