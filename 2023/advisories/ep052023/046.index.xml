Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 AM PDT Fri Aug 11 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Central East Pacific (EP98):<br/>
Visible satellite images indicate that the circulation associated <br/>
with an area of low pressure located several hundred miles southwest <br/>
of Manzanillo, Mexico, is becoming better defined.  However, the <br/>
associated shower and thunderstorm activity remains disorganized.  <br/>
Environmental conditions are conducive for gradual development of <br/>
this system, and a tropical depression is likely to form late this <br/>
weekend or early next week while it moves westward or northwestward <br/>
at about 10 mph across the central portion of the basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western East Pacific: <br/>
Another tropical wave located well to the southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula is producing a large area of <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Conditions appear conducive <br/>
for development of this system, and a tropical depression could form <br/>
during the next few days while moving toward the west or <br/>
west-northwest at about 10 mph across the far western portion of the <br/>
basin, crossing into the Central Pacific basin on Sunday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Off the Coast of Southern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure is forecast to form offshore of Central <br/>
America and the southern coast of Mexico in a few days.  <br/>
Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive for <br/>
development of this system, and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form during the early or middle part of next week while it moves <br/>
generally west-northwestward, roughly parallel to the coast of <br/>
southern and southwestern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
