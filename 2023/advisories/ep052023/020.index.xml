500 AM PDT Sat Aug 5 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Dora, located more than 1500 miles west-southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California Peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Off the coast of Southwestern Mexico (EP97):<br/>
During the past several hours, showers and thunderstorms have <br/>
increased in association with a low pressure area centered about <br/>
150 miles southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. Environmental conditions <br/>
are conducive for additional development, and a tropical depression <br/>
is likely to form later today or tonight.  The disturbance is <br/>
forecast to move northwestward at about 15 mph, parallel to but not <br/>
far offshore of the southwestern coast of Mexico.  Interests along <br/>
the southwestern coast of Mexico and the southern portion of the <br/>
Baja California peninsula should monitor the progress of this <br/>
system this weekend.  Additional information on this system, <br/>
including gale warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued <br/>
by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

<title>Hurricane Dora Forecast Discussion Number 19</title>

Hurricane Dora Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052023
1100 PM HST Fri Aug 04 2023
 
There is a hint of Dora's eye clearing once again this evening. 
Since the last advisory, geostationary satellite imagery has shown 
deep and persistent bursts of convection near the estimated center. 
A couple of satellite microwave passes from 0241 and 0253 UTC showed 
an eye open to the north.  Subjective analyses from TAFB and SAB 
both gave a T5.0/90 kt, however given recent satellite trends, the 
initial intensity is set at 95 kt for this advisory.
 
The hurricane is moving westward at 16 kt along the southern
periphery of a ridge to its north.  This ridge is expected to build
westward, which should induce a faster forward speed while it passes
well south of Hawaii early next week.  The track guidance is still
well-clustered and the latest official track forecast is largely
unchanged.
 
Unlike the track model guidance, there is quite a bit of spread in
the intensity guidance.  Thus, there is lower-than-normal confidence
in this prediction.  Global models suggest the moderate deep-layer
vertical wind shear should decrease within 24 h, but there may
be some mid-layer shear caused by the building ridge that could
weaken Dora in a couple days.  Sea surface temperatures along the
forecast track remain relatively conducive (26-27 degrees C), but
the environmental moisture gradually decreases.  The latest NHC
intensity forecast is similar to the previous advisory and overall
shows some gradual weakening.  However, slight fluctuations
in intensity are possible through much of the forecast period.
