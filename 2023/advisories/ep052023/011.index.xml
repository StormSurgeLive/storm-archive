1100 PM PDT Wed Aug 2 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Dora, located several hundred miles southwest of the southern tip <br/>
of the Baja California Peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Off the coast of Southern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms located <br/>
several hundred miles south of the coast of southern Mexico is <br/>
associated with a tropical wave. An area of low pressure is expected <br/>
to develop from this feature during the next day or two, and <br/>
environmental conditions appear conducive for development of this <br/>
system. A tropical depression is likely to form over the weekend as <br/>
it moves west-northwestward or northwestward, parallel to but not <br/>
far offshore of the southwestern coast of Mexico. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

<title>Hurricane Dora Forecast Discussion Number 10</title>

Hurricane Dora Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052023
500 PM HST Wed Aug 02 2023
 
Satellite data reveal that compact Dora has rapidly strengthened. A 
small, symmetric eye has emerged and warmed during the past several 
hours, surrounded by a solid ring of very deep convection with cloud 
tops colder than -70 to -75 deg C. As a result, the latest satellite 
intensity estimates have significantly risen since earlier today. 
Based on a blend of the 00 UTC Dvorak estimates from TAFB (T6.0/115 
kt) and SAB (T5.5/102 kt), the initial intensity is raised to 110 kt 
for this advisory, which marks a 45-kt increase in intensity over 
the past 24 hours. Dora is now the second major hurricane of the 
season in the eastern North Pacific basin.

Dora continues to move westward at 260/14 kt. The track forecast 
reasoning is unchanged, as a well-established ridge to the north of 
Dora will keep the hurricane moving quickly on a heading just south 
of due west for the next several days. The latest track guidance 
remains in very good agreement, and overall confidence is above 
average on this component of the forecast. The updated NHC track is 
very similar to the previous one, generally falling in between the 
HCCA and TVCE multi-model aids.

Given its impressive satellite structure and well-formed inner core, 
some additional near-term strengthening seems likely tonight as Dora 
moves over SSTs greater than 28C and within a low deep-layer shear 
environment. The updated peak intensity of 125 kt lies just above 
the consensus aids but below the latest HAFS-A/B runs. The easterly 
shear is forecast to increase on Thursday and into Friday while Dora 
moves over somewhat cooler SSTs, which is expected to bring an end 
to its intensification and induce some weakening of the small 
hurricane. However, the deep-layer shear diagnosed in both the GFS 
and ECMWF SHIPS guidance diminishes between 60-120 h, and the 
forecast track keeps Dora over SSTs of 26.5-27C through the end of 
the period. Thus, the official forecast does not show as much 
weakening and follows the multi-model consensus during this time. 
Uncertainty remains high with the intensity forecast since the 
compact system could be more prone to rapid intensity fluctuations.
