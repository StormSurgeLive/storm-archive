Post-Tropical Cyclone Eugene Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062023
200 PM PDT Mon Aug 07 2023

Eugene has not had any organized deep convection for over 12 hours 
now, and since it is over very cold water, no further thunderstorm 
activity is anticipated.  Thus, Eugene has transitioned into a 
post-tropical cyclone, and this is the last NHC advisory.  The 
initial wind speed is reduced to 30 kt, in accordance with the 
remaining Dvorak estimates.  The system should gradually spin down 
and become a trough of low pressure in about 2 days.  The remnants 
of Eugene should turn northward tomorrow into a break in the 
low- level ridge and slow down as it gets caught in weak steering 
flow. No significant changes were made to the NHC track or 
intensity forecasts.

For additional information on the remnant low please see High Seas
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php
