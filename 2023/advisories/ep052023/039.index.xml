Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 PM PDT Wed Aug 9 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Central East Pacific:<br/>
A tropical wave is producing a large area of disorganized showers <br/>
and thunderstorms several hundred miles south of the coast of <br/>
southwestern Mexico.  Environmental conditions are expected to be <br/>
conducive for gradual development of this system, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form by the weekend or early next week <br/>
while it moves generally westward at about 15 mph across the central <br/>
portion of the basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western East Pacific:<br/>
Another tropical wave located well to the southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula is producing some disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions could support <br/>
some gradual development of this system during the next several days <br/>
while it moves generally westward at 10 to 15 mph across the far <br/>
western portion of the basin and into the Central Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Off the Coast of Southern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure is forecast to form early next week <br/>
offshore of Central America.  Some gradual development of this <br/>
system is possible during the early and middle parts of next week <br/>
while it moves generally west-northwestward, roughly parallel to the <br/>
coast of southern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
