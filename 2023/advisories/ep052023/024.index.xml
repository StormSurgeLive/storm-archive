BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Eugene Advisory Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062023
300 AM MDT Sun Aug 06 2023
 
...EUGENE CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN AND COULD BECOME A HURRICANE
LATER TODAY...
...GUSTY WINDS LIKELY ACROSS SOUTHERN BAJA CALIFORNIA PENINSULA
TODAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM MDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.9N 109.9W
ABOUT 140 MI...220 KM S OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 315 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...994 MB...29.36 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the southern portion of the Baja California peninsula
should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Eugene was
located near latitude 20.9 North, longitude 109.9 West. Eugene is
moving toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A turn to the 
west-northwest is expected later today, and that motion should 
continue through Monday.  On the forecast track, Eugene should pass 
to the south of the southern portion of the Baja California Sur 
today.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Continued strengthening is expected and 
Eugene could become a hurricane later today.  Weakening should 
begin by tonight.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: The outer edges of the rainfall pattern from Eugene may
produce storm total amounts of 1 to 2 inches along sections of the
southwestern Mexican states of Sinaloa, Jalisco, Nayarit, and
the southern portion of Baja California Sur.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Eugene will affect portions of the coasts
of west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur during the next day
or so. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
WIND: Gusty winds are likely across the southern portion of Baja
California Sur today.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.

Tropical Storm Eugene Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062023
300 AM MDT Sun Aug 06 2023
 
Eugene continues to steadily strengthen.  An ASCAT-C pass from a few
hours ago showed peak winds around 50 kt, and the initial intensity
is increased to 55 kt since that instrument often is unable to
resolve the peak winds.  This intensity value is higher than the
current satellite intensity estimates.  The cloud pattern of Eugene
resembles a central dense overcast with the deepest convection near
the estimated center.  Eugene is about 120 n mi south of Cabo San
Lucas and it could get a little closer to that area later this
morning before pulling away late today.  It should be noted that
Eugene is a relatively small tropical storm, with its 34-kt wind
radii currently extending no more than 60 n mi from the center.
 
The storm continues to move northwestward, or 315 degrees, at about 
12 kt.  Eugene should turn to the west-northwest later today and 
continue in that direction through Monday as it moves in the flow on 
the south side of a fairly strong mid-level ridge.  By early 
Tuesday, however, the western portion of the ridge is expected to 
erode due to an approaching shortwave trough.  In response, Eugene 
is forecast to slow down and turn northward or northeastward during 
the middle part of the week.  The NHC track forecast is similar to 
the previous one and lies near the northern edge of the model 
guidance in the short term, in best agreement with the HCCA model.
 
Since Eugene will be over warm waters for another 12 hours or so,
continued strengthening is forecast, and Eugene is now predicted to
become a hurricane later today.  However, by tonight, the system
will be moving over progressively cooler waters and into a drier air
mass, which should end the strengthening trend and promote a steady
decay.  The NHC intensity forecast is a little higher than the
previous one during the next couple of days, but falls in line with
the old forecast after that.  Eugene is still expected to become a
remnant low over cool 20 degree C waters in about 60 hours and
dissipate in 4 to 5 days.
 
Eugene will likely produce areas of heavy rains and gusty winds
across southern portions of the Baja California Sur today as it
passes to the south of the peninsula.  Interests there should
monitor the progress of this system.

Hurricane Dora Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052023
500 PM HST Sat Aug 05 2023
 
Dora has acquired annular traits, highlighted by a circular and 
relatively large eye (compared to the size of the hurricane itself), 
a wide band of very cold cloud tops within the CDO, and dissolving 
outer bands around the periphery of the circulation.  As a 
reflection of this, the Annular Hurricane Index (AHI) has increased 
to about 85 out of 100.  The maximum winds are now estimated to be 
125 kt, which best matches a Dvorak estimate of T6.5/127 kt from SAB 
and objective ADT and AiDT numbers of 123-125 kt.
 
There's no new news to report regarding Dora's forecast track.  A
ridge building westward to the north of the hurricane is expected
to push Dora faster toward the west while it passes well south of
Hawaii in the next 2-4 days.  The track guidance--and the NHC
official forecast--have been remarkably steady for the past few
days, and the new forecast is basically an update of the previous
prediction.
 
Fluctuations in intensity are possible during the next 6-12 hours
while Dora becomes increasingly annular.  The hurricane is forecast
to continue moving nearly parallel to the sea surface temperature
gradient, over waters of 26-27C for the next several days.
Deep-layer shear is expected to remain light, although Dora is
likely to move into a drier, more subsident environment into early
next week.  That said, annular hurricanes have a proclivity for
weakening more slowly than expected or suggested by intensity
models, and the new NHC forecast therefore lies near the upper
bound of the available guidance, showing only gradual weakening
through the 5-day forecast period.  This forecast is closest to the 
SHIPS guidance during the first couple of days, and then trends 
close to the HCCA and IVCN consensus aids thereafter.
