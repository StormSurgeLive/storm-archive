Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 AM PDT Thu Aug 3 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Dora, located several hundred miles southwest of the southern tip <br/>
of the Baja California Peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Off the coast of Southern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms located <br/>
several hundred miles south of the coast of southern Mexico is <br/>
associated with a tropical wave. An area of low pressure is expected <br/>
to develop from this feature during the next day or two, and <br/>
environmental conditions appear conducive for development of this <br/>
system. A tropical depression is likely to form over the weekend as <br/>
it moves west-northwestward or northwestward, parallel to but not <br/>
far offshore of the southwestern coast of Mexico. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

<title>Hurricane Dora Forecast Discussion Number 12</title>

Hurricane Dora Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052023
500 AM HST Thu Aug 03 2023

Dora's rapid intensification has ended during the past several 
hours.  While the eyewall cloud tops remain quite cold, the eye has 
become cloud-filled and indistinct. The various subjective and 
objective satellite intensity estimates have decreased a little, so 
based on this the initial intensity is set at 110 kt.

The initial motion is now 265/16.  As mentioned in the previous 
forecast discussion, a well-established low- to mid-level ridge 
north of Dora is expected to maintain this general motion for the 
next several days.  The track guidance remains tightly clustered in 
both speed and direction, and the new forecast track, which is close 
to the consensus models, has only minor adjustments from the 
previous forecast.

Dora has likely peaked in intensity.  While the storm is currently 
over sea surface temperatures near 28C, the global model forecasts 
indicate that increasing upper-level easterly winds should produce 
shear during the next 36-48 h, and this is likely to cause problems 
for the small inner core.  Thus, the intensity forecast follows 
the trend of the guidance in showing weakening during this time.  
After 48 h, the shear is forecast to decrease while Dora is over 
water temperatures of 26-27C.  The intensity guidance during this 
time shows a more gradual weakening than what is expected earlier 
in the forecast period, and this part of the intensity forecast is 
near or a little below the intensity consensus.  Uncertainty 
remains high with the intensity forecast since this compact system 
could be more prone than normal to rapid intensity fluctuations.
