WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Bermuda Weather Service has upgraded the Tropical Storm Watch
for Bermuda to a Tropical Storm Warning.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.

Interests in eastern New England and Atlantic Canada should monitor 
the progress of Philippe.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products 
issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 22.6 North, longitude 65.9 West.  Philippe is
moving toward the north near 12 mph (19 km/h).  This general motion 
with an increase in forward speed is expected through Saturday.  On 
the forecast track, the center of Philippe will approach and pass 
near Bermuda Thursday night and Friday, and approach eastern New 
England and Atlantic Canada on Saturday.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft and 
satellite-derived winds indicate that maximum sustained winds are 
near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.  Little change in strength 
is forecast during the next day or so.  Some strengthening is 
possible on Friday and Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
to the east of the center.
 
The minimum central pressure based on aircraft data is 1004 mb 
(29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Philippe can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Rainfall will begin to affect Bermuda on Thursday with
rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches expected through Friday.
 
These rainfall amounts may result in scattered flash flooding.
 
Rainfall across the U.S. and British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico
will continue to diminish this evening.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning
Friday morning.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands,
and Puerto Rico for another day or so.  Large swells are already
affecting Bermuda from another weather system but will begin to
increase further on Thursday as Philippe approaches the island.
These conditions are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
currents. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Philippe Forecast Discussion Number 45</title>

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  45
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 AM AST Wed Oct 04 2023
 
Visible satellite images this morning indicate that Philippe's
low-level circulation remains elongated, and the center is still
located on the northwestern edge of an area of deep convection.
This convective activity continues to produce heavy rains over the
U.S. and British Virgin Islands, as well as northeastern Puerto
Rico.  The initial intensity remains 40 kt based on a blend of the
latest subjective and objective satellite estimates, with sustained
tropical-storm-force winds limited to the eastern semicircle.
 
Philippe has turned toward the north-northwest with an initial
motion of 335/6 kt.  The flow between a strong mid-tropospheric
high over the central Atlantic and a deep-layer trough just off the 
east coast of Florida is expected to steer Philippe northward, and 
at a faster forward speed, beginning tonight and continuing for the 
next few days.  The track guidance is in good agreement on this 
general scenario, although there is some east-to-west spread among 
the models related to how Philippe interacts with a non-tropical 
low that is forecast to develop to its west in about 2-3 days.  
After day 3, a deeper trough is forecast to swing across eastern 
North America, and much of the guidance suggests that Philippe 
might bend back to the left a bit and approach Atlantic Canada or 
eastern Maine in 3-4 days.  Overall, the NHC track forecast is near 
the middle of the guidance envelope, close to the TVCX and HCCA 
consensus aids, and is also nearly identical to the previous 
prediction.

Overall, moderate-to-strong vertical shear is expected to persist 
over Philippe during the next few days, and very little change in 
intensity is forecast during that time.  Once Philippe begins to 
interact with the developing low pressure to its west and the 
associated upper-level trough, baroclinic influences could support 
some strengthening.  This strengthening is shown by most of the 
intensity models, including the GFS and ECMWF global models, and 
the official forecast therefore shows a peak intensity of 50 kt at 
60 and 72 hours.  Model-based phase-space diagrams, simulated 
satellite imagery, and SHIPS diagnostics all suggest that Philippe 
will become attached to a front between days 3 and 4 to the north 
of Bermuda, and the official forecast therefore shows a completion 
of extratropical transition by Sunday morning.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Philippe is expected to produce scattered 
flash flooding across portions of the U.S. and British Virgin 
Islands through today.  Heavy rainfall from Philippe will begin to 
affect Bermuda on Thursday. 
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning 
Friday morning, and a Tropical Storm Watch is now in effect for the 
island.
 
3. Philippe is likely to move over portions of Atlantic Canada and 
eastern New England, likely as a post-tropical cyclone, this 
weekend.  Regardless of Philippe's intensity or structure, 
interests in those areas should monitor the storm's progress and be 
prepared for the possibility of strong winds and heavy rainfall.
