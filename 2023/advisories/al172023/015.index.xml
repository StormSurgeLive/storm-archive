Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 PM AST Tue Sep 26 2023
 
After the previous advisory, there was a convective burst with cloud 
tops as cold as -80C that formed near the circulation center. More 
recently, this burst has been waning in intensity, and it would not 
be surprising to see the vortex become exposed again shortly as 
20-30 kt southwesterly vertical wind shear continues. While 
subjective and objective intensity estimates continue to suggest a 
weaker storm, a helpful 0015 UTC ASCAT-B pass still showed a large 
region of 35-40 kt winds in the northeastern side of the 
circulation, in fact requiring an expansion of the tropical storm 
force winds in that quadrant. Based primarily on the scatterometer 
data, Philippe's intensity remains 40 kt for this advisory.
 
The intensity forecast appears rather straightforward. The current
vertical wind shear over Philippe is expected to continue through
most of the forecast period, helping to import drier air into the
circulation, that should prevent additional convective bursts from
organizing the system. By 72 hours, both the GFS and ECMWF are in
agreement that Philippe should no longer have organized deep
convection, which is when the forecast shows the system becoming a
post-tropical remnant low. As mentioned previously, this could
happen sooner than forecasted given the unfavorable environment.
 
After moving south of due west earlier today, Philippe appears to
have resumed a north of due west heading, estimated at 280/10 kt.
The track guidance is in good agreement on this motion continuing
with a bend westward in 36-48 hours as the cyclone becomes 
primarily steered by the low-level flow. The latest NHC track 
forecast remains along or just south of the model guidance consensus 
aids, and is between the GFS and ECMWF solutions.
