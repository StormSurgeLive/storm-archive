1100 AM AST Fri Sep 29 2023
 
...PHILIPPE BARELY MOVING...
...EXPECTED TO DRIFT AROUND EAST OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
THROUGH THE WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.3N 55.3W
ABOUT 510 MI...825 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WSW OR 245 DEGREES AT 2 MPH...4 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1003 MB...29.62 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, the U.S. and British
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of this
system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 18.3 North, longitude 55.3 West. Philippe is
moving very slowly toward the west-southwest near 2 mph (4 km/h), 
and this general motion is expected to continue through Saturday 
night.  A gradual turn toward the west and northwest is forecast 
Sunday and Sunday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is forecast during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, and Puerto Rico through the weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 AM AST Fri Sep 29 2023
 
There has been little change in Philippe's satellite appearance this 
morning.  The storm remains sheared with the low-level center 
located near the western edge of the main area of deep convection.  
The satellite intensity estimates continue to have a large spread, 
ranging from 30 to 55 kt.  ASCAT data should be available soon, and 
the Air Force Hurricane Hunters are scheduled to investigate 
Philippe this afternoon.  Both of these datasets will provide a 
better assessment of Philippe's intensity and structure.

Philippe has only moved roughly 40 miles over the past 24 hours, and 
it has been generally drifting to the southwest during that time.  
The slow motion over the past day or so is due to its interaction 
with Tropical Storm Rina several hundred miles to its east.  Since 
these tropical cyclones are expected to continue to interact through 
the weekend, Philippe is forecast to crawl southwestward during the 
next 2 or 3 days.  After that time, Rina is expected to separate 
from Philippe as a mid-level ridge builds over the subtropical 
central Atlantic.  In response, Philippe should turn sharply 
northward early next week.  Although there remains a fair amount of 
spread in the models, they are in considerably better agreement 
today compared to the past couple of days.  Overall, little change 
was made to the previous track forecast, and it continues to lie 
close to the various consensus models.  

Although Philippe is still being affected by shear, the environment 
over the next several days appears to become less hostile.  Light 
to moderate wind shear, increasing mid-level humidities around the 
storm, and very warm SSTs should allow Philippe to gradually 
strengthen.  The NHC intensity forecast has been nudged upward 
again this cycle, but still lies on the lower end of the model 
guidance.  Additional upward revisions seem likely if the 
guidance persists.

<title>Tropical Storm Rina Forecast Discussion Number 5</title>

Tropical Storm Rina Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182023
1100 AM AST Fri Sep 29 2023

Over the last few hours, Rina's center has become exposed with less 
convective organization noted in the GOES-E satellite imagery. The 
subjective satellite intensity estimates held steady at 45 kt, 
while the objective estimates are lower around 35 to 40 kt. Based 
on a blend of these data, the initial intensity is set to 40 kt. 

Rina's current motion remains nearly the same, moving 
north-northwestward at 335/5 kt. Most of the track guidance shows 
Rina moving generally northwestward through the weekend between 
nearby Tropical Storm Philippe and a subtropical ridge over the 
central Atlantic. By early next week, Rina will start to make a turn 
to the north within the flow between the subtropical ridge and an 
upper-level trough moving across the western Atlantic. Most of the 
model guidance shows a shift to the right of the previous forecast 
track with a faster forward speed. The official NHC forecast track 
reflects these trends and is adjusted closer to the latest consensus 
aids. The one notable outlier is the GFS, which shows more of an 
interaction between Rina and Philippe. 

The exposed center of Rina indicates a sheared environment, and 
strong deep-layer shear (partially associated with Philippe) is 
forecast to persist during the next few days. The official NHC track 
intensity is held steady through the next day or so, followed by 
gradual weakening as supported by the latest intensity guidance. By 
early next week, Rina is forecast to become a post-tropical remnant 
low as it begins that turn to the north and open up into a trough by 
day 5. Some model guidance suggests dissipation could occur even 
sooner. The NHC intensity forecast is based on this weakening 
trend, in agreement with the multi-model consensus.
