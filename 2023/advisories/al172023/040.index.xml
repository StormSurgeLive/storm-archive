...PHILIPPE BRINGING HEAVY RAINS AND FLASH FLOODING TO PORTIONS OF 
THE NORTHERN WINDWARD ISLANDS AND THE LEEWARD ISLANDS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.5N 62.9W
ABOUT 25 MI...40 KM NNE OF ANGUILLA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Barbuda
* Antigua
* Anguilla
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests elsewhere in the northern Leeward Islands should monitor
the progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 18.5 North, longitude 62.9 West. Philippe is
moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this general 
motion should continue today.  A turn toward the north-northwest is 
forecast by tonight, followed by a northward motion on Wednesday. 
On the forecast track, the center of Philippe is expected to move 
north of the Leeward Islands today.  However, the strongest winds 
and heaviest rains will likely occur in the islands to the south of 
the center.  
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next day or two,
but Philippe could begin to strengthen after midweek. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
primarily to the east and southeast of the center.  A wind gust to 
47 mph (76 km/h) was reported on Antigua a few hours ago. 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Philippe can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Philippe is forecast to produce the following rainfall 
amounts into early Wednesday:

Barbuda southward to Dominica: 4 to 8 inches

Rest of Leeward Islands and northern Windward Islands: 3 to 5 inches

Virgin Islands: 1 to 3 inches

This rainfall is expected to result in scattered flash flooding.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the
warning area today.  Strong gusty winds are also likely elsewhere in
the Leeward Islands today.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, and Puerto Rico through midweek. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  40
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
500 AM AST Tue Oct 03 2023
 
High clouds from a recent convective burst just southeast of
Philippe's center has obscured the low-level center for much of the 
night.  However, surface observations and microwave imagery indicate 
that the center is still located near the northwestern edge of the 
large convective mass, and it is passing very near Anguilla in the 
northern Leeward Islands.  Most of the stronger winds are located
over the southern and southeastern portions of the circulation
where a wind gust to 41 kt was reported on Antigua a few hours ago.
The Leeward Islands are likely to experience strong gusty winds and
heavy rains even as the center moves north of those islands this
morning.  The intensity of the cyclone remains 45 kt, based on
earlier SFMR and dropwindsonde data from an Air Force Reserve
reconnaissance aircraft.  The next mission into Philippe is
scheduled for later this morning.

Philippe's motion has been wobbling between west-northwest and 
northwest at about 7 kt.  A more definitive northwestward heading is 
expected to begin today as Philippe moves around the western portion 
of a mid-level ridge over the central subtropical Atlantic. The 
storm's motion should become north-northwestward to northward on 
Wednesday and Wednesday night as it moves between the ridge to its 
east and trough off the southeastern United States coast. By late in 
the forecast period, there is significant bifurcation in the track 
guidance with the GFS slowing the system down, while the ECMWF and 
UKMET show the cyclone moving quickly northward into Atlantic Canada 
ahead of a deep-layer trough.  The GFS track appears to be an 
eastern outlier at this time. Thus, the NHC track forecast was 
shifted westward at days 4 and 5 to be closer to the multi-model 
consensus aids. Additional adjustments in the long-range track 
forecast may be required in subsequent advisories.
 
Strong vertical shear is forecast to linger over Philippe during
the next two to three days, and little change in strength is
forecast during that time.  The system could encounter a region of
diffluent upper-level winds later in the period which could support
some strengthening.  The NHC intensity forecast shows a slightly
lower peak than before as the intensity guidance and global models
generally show less strengthening than before.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected across Barbuda, Antigua,
and Anguilla this morning. Strong gusty winds are also likely
elsewhere in the Leeward Islands today.
 
2. Heavy rainfall from Philippe is expected to produce scattered
flash flooding across portions of the Leeward and northern Windward
Islands, particularly between Barbuda and Dominica, into early
Wednesday.
