the progress of this system.  Additional tropical storm watches 
could be required later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was 
located near latitude 16.9 North, longitude 59.5 West.  Philippe is 
moving toward the northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h).  A track toward the 
northwest is expected to continue today followed by a northward 
motion by late Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Philippe is expected to pass near or just northeast of the northern 
Leeward Islands later today and tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast during the next 48
hours, but Philippe could begin to intensify more significantly
around the middle of the week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km),
primarily east and southeast of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Philippe can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Philippe is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts through Tuesday:
 
Barbuda and Antigua: 4 to 6 inches
Rest of the Leeward Islands: 2 to 4 inches
 
This rainfall may result in isolated to scattered flash flooding.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch areas by
later this morning.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, and Puerto Rico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  35
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 PM AST Sun Oct 01 2023
 
Philippe's cloud pattern has not become significantly better 
organized since earlier today.  The system is still producing very 
deep convection with cloud tops to -80 deg C or colder mainly over 
the southeastern quadrant of the circulation.  There are no obvious 
curved convective banding features at this time.  Some new 
thunderstorms have developed near and over the center and this was 
noted by the Air Force Hurricane Hunters who have been investigating 
the storm this evening.  Observations from the aircraft indicate 
little change in strength, with peak SFMR-observed surface winds 
near 45 kt.

The tropical cyclone has moved rather slowly over the past several 
hours and the initial motion estimate is west-northwestward, or 
300/4 kt.  Philippe should turn northwestward to northward along 
the western periphery of a mid-level high pressure area for the 
next few days.  Then, the system should turn north-northeastward 
and move through a weakness in the ridge.  The track guidance 
through 48 hours has shifted eastward on this cycle.  In an attempt 
to maintain continuity from the previous forecasts, the NHC track 
is not shifted eastward as much as shown by the model consensus, 
and the change through 24 hours is fairly slight.  Late in the 
forecast period, there is uncertainty as to how soon the cyclone 
will move into the higher-latitude westerlies.  The new GFS model 
run suggests that the system may turn eastward and stay in the 
subtropics through 5 days.  If this turns out to be true, then 
Philippe could have a prolonged existence.

The environment for Philippe in the short term does not appear 
conducive for significant strengthening, with fairly strong 
westerly vertical wind shear likely to continue to affect the 
system through Monday.  When the system moves farther north over 
the Atlantic, it may encounter a region of reduced shear as 
indicated by some of the dynamical guidance.  The official forecast 
still shows the system becoming a hurricane in the 3- to 5-day time 
frame and this is also supported by the IVCN model intensity 
guidance.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are possible across portions of the
northern Leeward Islands Monday and Monday night while Philippe
passes near or just northeast of the area, and a Tropical Storm
Watch is in effect for Antigua and Barbuda.  Interests elsewhere
in the northern Leeward Islands should continue to monitor this
system as additional watches or warnings could be required later
tonight or Monday.
 
2. Heavy rainfall from Philippe could produce isolated to scattered
flash flooding, particularly across Barbuda and Antigua, through
Tuesday.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Rina Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182023
1100 PM AST Sun Oct 01 2023
 
The depression's surface circulation has become increasingly diffuse 
this evening while the cyclone has been devoid of organized deep 
convection for over 18 hours.  Only a few small intermittent bursts 
of convection have been present just to the east and south of the 
center during the past couple of hours. Therefore, this is the final 
advisory on Rina, and the system is now considered to be a 
post-tropical remnant low and is likely to open up into a surface 
trough on Monday.
 
The initial motion of the low-level cloud swirl is moving
northward, or 010/11 kt, and this general motion should continue 
until the remnants of Rina completely dissipate over the central 
subtropical Atlantic.
