SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Antigua, Barbuda
 
Interests elsewhere in the northern Leeward Islands should monitor
the progress of this system.  Additional tropical storm watches or
warnings may be required later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 16.1 North, longitude 58.7 West. Philippe is
moving toward the west near 7 mph (11 km/h). A west-northwestward
to northwestward motion is expected to begin today and continue
into tonight.  A turn toward the northwest with an increase in
forward speed is expected on Monday, followed by a northward
motion on Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Philippe
is forecast to pass near or just northeast of the northern Leeward
Islands on Monday and Monday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast during the next 48 
hours, and Philippe could begin to intensify more significantly 
around the middle of the week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 170 miles (275 km), 
primarily east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches) 
based on dropsonde data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Philippe can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC 
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Philippe is forecast to produce the following rainfall
amounts through Tuesday:
 
Barbuda and Antigua: 4 to 6 inches
Rest of Leeward Islands: 2 to 4 inches
 
This rainfall may result in isolated to scattered flash flooding.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch areas by
Monday morning.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, and Puerto Rico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Philippe Forecast Discussion Number 32</title>

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
500 AM AST Sun Oct 01 2023
 
The center of Philippe has become exposed to the northwest of the
large convective mass seen infrared satellite imagery.  A very
timely AMSR2 microwave overpass helped to pinpoint the center
location around 0600 UTC, and since that time the center has become
more apparent in the geostationary satellite imagery.  Philippe is
still producing a large area of convection with clouds tops colder
than -80 deg C to the southeast of its center.  The latest Dvorak
satellite estimates range from 45 kt from SAB to 55 kt from TAFB.
The initial intensity is held at 45 kt in agreement with the
earlier scatterometer data.  An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter
aircraft is scheduled to investigate Philippe again this morning.
 
Philippe is moving a little faster toward the west overnight.  A 
weak mid-level ridge to the northeast of the cyclone should begin 
to steer Philippe west-northwestward to northwestward by later 
today, and that motion is expected to continue into Monday.  The
track guidance has once more shifted westward during the first
couple of days, which has again necessitated a westward shift in 
the NHC track forecast during that time.  The new track forecast is 
a little closer to the northern Leeward Islands.  It should be 
noted that the model guidance continues to show very little outward 
extent of tropical-storm-force winds over the western semicircle of 
Philippe through 48 hours, however given the typical track forecast 
uncertainty tropical storm watches or warnings could be required 
for a portion of the northern Leeward Islands later today.  After 
48 hours, Philippe is expected to turn northward as it moves around 
the western side of the ridge.  Later in the forecast  period, a 
mid-tropospheric trough over the western Atlantic should cause 
Philippe to turn north-northeastward.
 
The global models and the SHIPS intensity guidance indicate that 
the west-northwesterly vertical shear over Philippe will remain 
strong during the next couple of days.  Therefore, little change in 
strength is expected during that time.  Later in the forecast
period, the vertical shear could lessen somewhat allowing Philippe 
to strengthen.  The intensity models are generally lower this 
cycle, and the NHC forecast has been adjusted downward but it 
remains at the upper end of guidance. 

KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Philippe is forecast to pass near or just northeast of the 
northern Leeward Islands Monday and Monday night.  Interests 
there should continue to monitor the progress of this system as 
tropical storm watches or warnings could be required for a portion 
of that area later today.

Tropical Storm Rina Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182023
1100 AM AST Sun Oct 01 2023
 
Despite continued northwesterly shear, a small area of deep 
convection has persisted to the south and southeast of the center of 
Rina this morning. The low-level center remains exposed in visible 
satellite images, and recent ASCAT data suggests the center is 
becoming less defined with weak winds noted on the southwest side of 
the circulation. Based on the scatterometer winds, the initial 
intensity is held at 35 kt for this advisory, with the strongest 
winds confined to the southeastern quadrant of the storm.
 
Rina is still moving northwestward at 320/13 kt. The system is
expected to turn more northward later today and tonight while it
moves around the periphery of a subtropical ridge over the central
Atlantic. The track models are in good agreement, and the updated
NHC forecast is very similar to the previous one. The environmental
conditions are forecast to remain hostile going forward, and Rina is
forecast to gradually weaken over the next day or so due to the
negative influences of moderate to strong wind shear and dry
mid-level air. Simulated satellite imagery from the global models
suggest Rina could become a post-tropical remnant low by tonight,
and the system is forecast to open into a trough of low pressure and
dissipate by late Monday.
