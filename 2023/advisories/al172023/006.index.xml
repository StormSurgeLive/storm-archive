Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Sun Sep 24 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Philippe, located over the central tropical Atlantic. <br/>
<br/>
Southeastern Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the southeastern Gulf <br/>
of Mexico are associated with a surface trough of low pressure and <br/>
an upper-level trough.  Further development, if any, is expected to <br/>
be slow to occur over the next few days while the system moves <br/>
slowly westward.  By the middle of the week, upper-level winds <br/>
are forecast to become too strong for additional development.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL91):<br/>
A small area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
south-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands continues to produce <br/>
disorganized shower activity.  Environmental conditions are forecast <br/>
to be conducive for gradual development, and a tropical depression <br/>
could form around mid-week while the system moves <br/>
west-northwestward across the central tropical Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 AM AST Sun Sep 24 2023

Philippe is a challenging tropical cyclone to analyze this morning. 
On one hand, the overall satellite presentation has improved since 
yesterday, and a 0907Z SSMIS microwave pass shows a possible 
mid-level eye.  Yet the 1-min GOES16 imagery reveals a weak 
low-level swirl southwest of the main convective blob, and ASCAT-B 
near 12Z showed a disorganized inner core with less wind than one 
might expect (albeit very contaminated with rain).  Overall, 
intensity estimates have risen since the last advisory, so the 
initial wind speed is set to 45 kt, similar to the TAFB/SAB values, 
but this should be considered fairly uncertain.

Little change in intensity is forecast with the storm during the 
next couple of days as increasing shear is forecast to otherwise 
counteract a conducive environment.  There are a variety of 
solutions after that point, with some models showing a stronger 
Philippe after finding a lower-shear environment, while others 
suggesting that the storm succumbs to the shear from an 
upper-level trough.  There are no easy answers here with moderate 
shear cases in high SST/moisture conditions well known to have 
higher errors due to an inherent lack of predictability.  The new 
forecast splits the difference in the model guidance, lying near 
the consensus and the previous forecast, and we will just have to 
see if a trend emerges for the eventual intensity of Philippe.

The long-term motion of the storm is westward or 280/10 kt. The 
subtropical ridge to the north of Philippe is forecast to gradually 
weaken and slide eastward in a day or two, allowing the tropical 
storm to move more west-northwestward and northwestward by the 
middle of the week.  Uncertainty grows after that point, with the 
track seemingly dependent on the intensity.  A stronger system 
would probably turn northward, like the GFS/HWRF/HMON models, while 
a weaker one, like the UKMET/ECMWF solutions, would take a left 
turn under the low-level subtropical ridge.  For now, little change 
was made to the long-range forecast given all of the uncertainty.
