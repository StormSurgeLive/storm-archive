Tropical Storm Philippe Advisory Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
500 AM AST Sun Oct 01 2023
 
...PHILIPPE MOVING WESTWARD WITH NO CHANGE IN STRENGTH...
...INTERESTS IN THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS SHOULD MONITOR THE
PROGRESS OF PHILIPPE...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.4N 58.2W
ABOUT 210 MI...340 KM E OF GUADELOUPE
ABOUT 250 MI...405 KM ESE OF BARBUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 280 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands should monitor the
progress of this system.  Tropical storm watches or warnings may
be required for a portion of that area later today.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 16.4 North, longitude 58.2 West. Philippe is
moving toward the west near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A west-northwestward 
to northwestward motion is expected to begin today and continue 
into tonight.  A turn toward the northwest with an increase in 
forward speed is expected Sunday and Monday, followed by a northward 
motion on Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Philippe 
is forecast to pass near or just northeast of the northern Leeward 
Islands on Monday and Monday night. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is expected during the next day or 
so.  Some strengthening is possible by late Monday as Philippe 
begins to move north of the Leeward Islands. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km) 
primarily to the east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Philippe can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC. 

RAINFALL:  Philippe is forecast to produce 1 to 4 inches of rain
across portions of the Leeward Islands by Monday into Tuesday. This
rainfall may result in isolated flash flooding.
 
WIND:  Gusty winds are possible in portions of the northern
leeward islands by Monday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, and Puerto Rico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Philippe Forecast Discussion Number 31</title>

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  31
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 PM AST Sat Sep 30 2023
 
Philippe's convective cloud pattern remains rather ragged-looking,
but there are very cold cloud tops of -80 deg C or colder over the
southeastern part of the circulation.  The center of circulation is
estimated to be near the northwestern edge of the main area of deep
convection.  There is little evidence of banding features at this
time.  The current intensity estimate is kept at 45 kt in agreement 
with the latest Dvorak classification from TAFB although objective 
satellite estimates are somewhat lower.  A recent scatterometer 
pass showed slightly higher winds over the southeastern quadrant 
but these are believed to be rain-inflated.  Another Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate Philippe tomorrow 
morning to check on the intensity of the storm.
 
The motion is somewhat uncertain since the center is not easy to
locate in nighttime satellite imagery.  However it appears that
Philippe is moving more to the right and the initial motion
estimate is now 230/4 kt.  Steering currents are expected to remain 
ill-defined for the next day or two, but a weak mid-level high to 
the northeast of the system should cause Philippe to turn 
northwestward on Sunday.  In about 3 days, a turn to the north is 
expected as the cyclone moves along the western side of the high.  
Late in the forecast period, the system should turn toward the 
north-northeast on the southeast side of a mid-tropospheric trough 
over the western Atlantic.  The latest track guidance for the next 
48 hours or so, in particular the new GFS, has shifted westward 
from the previous cycle.  This has resulted in a westward shift of 
the model consensus and necessitated a westward shift in the NHC 
track as well, which is now closer to the northern Leeward Islands. 
It should be noted that the model guidance continues to show very 
little outward extent of tropical-storm-force winds over the 
western semicircle of Philippe through 48 hours, and this forecast 
still does not necessitate the issuance of tropical storm watches 
for those islands.  However, interests there should continue to 
monitor the progress of Philippe.
 
Based on the global model forecasts, the system is likely to
continue experiencing significant vertical wind shear for the next
day or two.  Therefore only a slow increase in intensity is
forecast during the next couple of days.  Later in the forecast 
period, vertical shear is expected to lessen somewhat which should 
allow the system to strengthen into a hurricane, as suggested by 
the regional hurricane model, HAFS-A.  However, the official 
intensity forecast is now above most of the model guidance.

Tropical Storm Rina Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182023
500 AM AST Sun Oct 01 2023
 
Strong northwesterly shear continues to take a toll on Rina.  The
cyclone has been producing an area of deep convection overnight,
but it is disorganized and located well southeast of the exposed
center.  Any convection that has occurred near the center during
the past 12-18 hours has been very short-lived.  Given the tight 
circulation that is noted in infrared satellite imagery, the 
initial wind speed is held at a possibly generous 35 kt for this 
advisory.  Scatterometer data later this morning should help to 
determine if Rina is still producing tropical-storm-force winds. 
 
Environmental conditions consisting of moderate to strong vertical
wind shear and dry mid-level air should cause gradual weakening 
during the next day or two.  Rina is forecast to become a remnant 
low later today or tonight, and the global models indicate that the 
circulation will open up into a trough of low pressure and 
dissipate within a couple of days.
 
Rina is moving northwestward at about 12 kt. The cyclone is
expected to turn northward later today as it is steered between a
low- to mid-level ridge to its northeast and a mid-tropospheric
trough over the western Atlantic. The latest NHC track forecast is
near the center of the guidance envelope, which is slightly east of 
the previous advisory.
