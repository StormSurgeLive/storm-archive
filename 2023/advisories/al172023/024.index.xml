BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Philippe Advisory Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
500 AM AST Fri Sep 29 2023
 
...PHILIPPE LIKELY TO LOITER JUST EAST OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD
ISLANDS FOR ANOTHER 3 TO 4 DAYS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.5N 55.2W
ABOUT 520 MI...835 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...SW OR 235 DEGREES AT 2 MPH...4 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1003 MB...29.62 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, the U.S. and British
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of this
system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 18.5 North, longitude 55.2 West.  Philippe is
moving toward the southwest near 2 mph (4 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue through Saturday night.  A gradual 
turn toward the west and northwest is forecast Sunday and Sunday 
night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is expected during the next day or so, 
but some strengthening is possible over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, and Puerto Rico through the weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Philippe Forecast Discussion Number 24</title>

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
500 AM AST Fri Sep 29 2023
 
A 0546 UTC GMI microwave pass showed that Philippe continues to 
have a broad circulation, with the low-level center located 
somewhere near the northwestern edge of a large area of deep 
convection.  There is a large range in the subjective Dvorak 
estimates (30-55 kt), but the various objective numbers from 
UW-CIMSS are in closer agreement (35-45 kt).  Using a blend of 
these values, as well as ASCAT data from last evening, Philippe's 
intensity is held at 40 kt.

While there is a bit of uncertainty in the exact location of the 
center, the storm does appear to be drifting toward the southwest 
(235 degrees) at about 2 kt.  Philippe's movement during the next 
3-4 days is likely to be dictated by binary interaction with 
Tropical Storm Rina to the east.  The bulk of the track guidance 
indicates that Philippe will dip farther toward the southwest during 
the next 48 hours due to Rina's influence, but then turn toward the 
northwest and north on days 3 through 5 as a mid-tropospheric high 
builds over the central Atlantic.  The new NHC track forecast is 
not much different from the previous prediction and is close to the 
TVCA and HCCA consensus aids.  The HAFS regional hurricane models 
show little to no interaction between Philippe and Rina during the 
next few days.  However, with the two storms located only 500 n mi 
apart from each other, some degree of interaction is likely, and 
therefore the western solutions shown by those models (near or over 
the northern Leeward Islands) appear to be outliers at this time.  
That said, there continues to be larger-than-normal uncertainty in 
Philippe's future track.

A combination of shear, dry air, and Philippe's proximity to Rina 
are likely to cause little change in intensity for the next day or 
so.  However, the global models have trended toward Philippe not 
only surviving the next few days, but also deepening in an 
environment of increasing upper-level divergence (and still over 
very warm waters of 29-30 degrees Celsius).  The NHC intensity 
forecast has been nudged upward from 36 hours onward, although it 
still sits well below most of the intensity models, including the 
consensus aids, during the latter part of the forecast period.  
Until it becomes more clear how Philippe will evolve over the next 
couple of days, the official intensity forecast will remain on the 
conservative side, but future adjustments to the forecast are 
becoming more likely.

<title>Tropical Storm Rina Forecast Discussion Number 3</title>

Tropical Storm Rina Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182023
1100 PM AST Thu Sep 28 2023
 
The future for Rina has not become any clearer during the past 
several hours. The cyclone is more or less unchanged since the last 
advisory, with its center still generally exposed to the northwest 
of the associated deep convection. The intensity remains 35 kt based 
on recent operational SAB, TAFB, and UW-CIMSS ADT estimates.
 
During the past day or so, the guidance has flip-flopped over 
whether Rina or nearby Tropical Storm Philippe will become dominant. 
While Rina appears to be the better organized of the two at the 
moment, the latest runs of most models indicate that Philippe is 
more likely to become the dominant cyclone by early next week. Until 
the forecast becomes more consistent, it appears prudent to make 
only very small incremental changes to the official NHC forecast. 
Therefore, both the intensity and track forecasts are very similar 
to the previous advisory, but confidence in the NHC forecast is 
unusually low.
 
Rina is heading northwestward into an area of stronger expected 
vertical wind shear. A combination of the circulation of Philippe 
and a ridge centered over the eastern subtropical Atlantic should 
keep Rina generally on a west-northwest to northwest heading for at 
least a few days. After that, if Rina deepens or at least maintains 
its current strength and structure, it could begin to lift 
northward. However, if it weakens, Rina or its remnants will likely 
turn westward by early next week. The wind shear should prevent Rina 
from strengthening much, and could eventually lead to its 
dissipation in as soon as 4 or 5 days. The NHC track forecast is 
based heavily on a blend of the previous NHC forecast with the ECMWF 
and GFS ensemble means, while the intensity forecast is close to the 
IVCN consensus.
