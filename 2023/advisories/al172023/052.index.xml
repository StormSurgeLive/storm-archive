...PHILIPPE TAKING A JOG NORTH-NORTHEAST TOWARDS BERMUDA...
...TROPICAL STORM CONDITIONS BEGINNING AND EXPECTED TO CONTINUE OVER 
BERMUDA THROUGH TODAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...29.5N 65.3W
ABOUT 195 MI...315 KM S OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 15 DEGREES AT 18 MPH...30 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case through
the day today.
 
Interests in eastern New England and Atlantic Canada should monitor
the progress of Philippe.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was 
located near latitude 29.5 North, longitude 65.3 West. Philippe is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 18 mph (30 km/h). A general 
northward motion with a further increase in forward speed is 
expected through Saturday night. A turn toward the north-northwest 
is forecast by early Sunday. On the forecast track, the center of 
Philippe will pass near Bermuda later today, and then reach the 
coast of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, or eastern Maine Saturday night 
into Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is possible over the next day or so, but Philippe
is expected to become post-tropical on Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km) 
from the center. In the last hour, an elevated surface observing 
station at National Museum of Bermuda reported a sustained wind of 
46 mph (74 km/h), with gusts up to 53 mph (85 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Philippe can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda today.
 
RAINFALL:  Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches expected across Bermuda
through today. This rainfall could result in flash flooding.
 
For portions of New York and New England, rainfall amounts of 1 to 3
inches, with local amounts of 5 inches, are expected with Philippe
as it moves through the region this weekend.  Isolated to scattered
instances of urban and flash flooding are expected.
 
For portions of Southeast Canada, rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches,
with local amounts of 5 inches, are expected with Philippe as it
moves through the region this weekend.  Isolated to scattered
instances of urban and flash flooding are expected.
 
SURF:  Large swells are already affecting Bermuda from another
weather system but will increase later today as Philippe approaches
the island.  Swells are also reaching portions of the southeastern
U.S. coast and will spread northward along the east coast to
Atlantic Canada during the next couple of days.  These conditions
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Philippe Forecast Discussion Number 51</title>

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  51
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 PM AST Thu Oct 05 2023
 
Satellite imagery of Philippe shows little change in structure with 
the center still exposed to the west of a growing area of deep 
convection. Radar data from Bermuda indicate outer rain bands from 
the system are moving across Bermuda. However, the winds so far are 
below tropical storm force. The initial wind speed remains 45 kt, 
which is near the high end of the latest satellite intensity 
estimates. 
 
Philippe is moving northward at 14 kt. The storm is currently
moving between an upper-level cutoff low off the Florida coast, and
a ridge over the central Atlantic. This flow is expected to
accelerate Philippe further northward during the next few days. The
center of Philippe is expected to pass by Bermuda on Friday, and
reach the coast of Maine and Atlantic Canada Saturday night or
early Sunday. This forecast track has been shifted slightly to the
left of the previous advisory, closer to the HCCA and ECMWF models.
 
Philippe is behaving like a hybrid system. Even though the cyclone 
is facing strong wind shear and lower SSTs during the next couple 
of days, Philippe may pull most of its energy from an upper-level 
cutoff low just to its west. Due to these conditions, some 
intensification is predicted during the next day or so. Weakening 
is expected as Philippe moves inland over New England and Atlantic 
Canada this weekend. The official NHC intensity forecast is near 
the middle of the guidance envelope.
 
Based on the forecast for Philippe to become post-tropical by
Saturday, and after coordination with National Weather Service
offices in New England and the Canadian Hurricane Centre, the
current plan is for hazards in New England and Atlantic Canada to
be handled via local non-tropical statements and not issue tropical
watches or warnings.  We will continually assess this plan if the
forecast evolves and tropical watches or warnings become warranted.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
early Friday morning, and a Tropical Storm Warning remains in
effect.  Heavy rainfall is expected to affect the island into
early Friday.  This could produce flash flooding.
 
2. Philippe is expected to move over portions of Atlantic Canada and 
New England as a post-tropical cyclone this weekend.  Regardless of 
Philippe's intensity or structure, interests in those areas should 
be prepared for the possibility of strong winds and heavy rainfall 
and monitor statements from their local weather office.  The 
rainfall could produce isolated to scattered instances of urban and 
flash flooding.
