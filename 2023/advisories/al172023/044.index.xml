...HEAVY RAINS AND FLASH FLOODING CONTINUES ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE 
BRITISH AND U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.5N 65.5W
ABOUT 150 MI...240 KM NNW OF ST. THOMAS
ABOUT 815 MI...1315 KM S OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 325 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1004 MB...29.65 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Philippe, as
Tropical Storm Watches could be required later today.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was 
located near latitude 20.5 North, longitude 65.5 West. Philippe is 
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A turn toward the 
north-northwest is forecast later today, followed by a faster motion 
toward the north on Thursday and Friday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Philippe will continue to move away from Puerto Rico and 
the Virgin Islands today.  Philippe will then approach Bermuda 
Thursday night and Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next day or so, 
but some gradual intensification could occur after that time.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Philippe can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Philippe is forecast to produce the following rainfall
amounts through today:
 
The United States & British Virgin Islands: 4 to 8 inches with
maximum amounts to 12 inches.
 
Puerto Rico: 2 to 4 inches.
 
This rainfall is likely to result in scattered flash flooding.
 
WIND:  Gusty winds are likely to continue across portions of the
the Virgin Islands through early today.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands,
and Puerto Rico for another couple of days.  Swells are expected to
reach Bermuda by late Thursday.  These conditions are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip currents. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Philippe Forecast Discussion Number 43</title>

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  43
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 PM AST Tue Oct 03 2023
 
Even though the center of Philippe is more than one hundred miles 
north of the Virgin Islands, heavy rains on the system's south side 
continue to affect portions of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.  
The cyclone remains poorly organized with the low-level circulation 
appearing diffuse and convection remaining ragged and lacking 
organization.  The initial intensity is held at 40 kt, which is near 
the high end of the satellite intensity estimates.

Philippe is moving northwestward, or 310 degrees, at 10 kt.  The 
models are in good agreement in showing Philippe turning 
north-northwestward to northward on Wednesday when the storm moves 
between a mid- to upper-level high over the central Atlantic and a 
cut off low off the Florida coast.  These features should provide 
the steering currents for Philippe through the remainder of the 
week, causing a northward motion with some increase in forward 
speed.  The storm is likely to be near Bermuda on Friday.  A larger 
trough is expected to move across eastern Canada and the 
northeastern U.S. late this week and cut off over the weekend.  In 
response, Philippe could turn northwestward into northern New 
England or Atlantic Canada in 4 to 5 days.

The storm continues to feel the effects of west-northwesterly shear 
and dry air entrainment, and its poor structure suggests that 
little, if any, intensification is likely in the short term.  The 
models show some strengthening late this week and early this weekend 
when Philippe likely gets some baroclinic support from the nearby 
trough.  This interaction should also cause Philippe to gain frontal 
features and become extratropical in 3 to 4 days before it reaches 
northern New England or Atlantic Canada.  The NHC intensity forecast 
lies near the middle of the guidance envelope.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Philippe is expected to produce scattered 
flash flooding across portions of the United States & British Virgin 
Islands through Wednesday.
 
2. Gusty winds are likely to continue across portions of the
northern Leeward Islands and the Virgin Islands through Wednesday.
 
3. The risk is increasing for tropical storm conditions to occur on
Bermuda late this week.  Interests on Bermuda should monitor the
progress of Philippe.
