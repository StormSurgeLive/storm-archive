DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was 
located near latitude 28.8 North, longitude 65.7 West.  Philippe is 
moving toward the north near 16 mph (26 km/h) and this general 
motion with an increase in forward speed is expected through 
Saturday night.  A turn toward the north-northwest is forecast early 
Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Philippe will pass 
near or just west of Bermuda later today, and then reach the coast 
of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, or eastern Maine Saturday night.

Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some strengthening is possible over the next day or so, but Philippe 
is expected to become post-tropical on Saturday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km) 
from the center. In the past hour, an elevated surface observing 
station at the National Museum of Bermuda recently reported a 
sustained wind of 43 mph (69 km/h) with gusts up to 47 mph (76 
km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Philippe can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning 
shortly.

RAINFALL:  Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches expected across Bermuda
through today. This rainfall could result in flash flooding.

For portions of New York and New England, rainfall amounts of 1 to 3
inches, with local amounts of 5 inches, are expected with Philippe
as it moves through the region this weekend.  Isolated to scattered
instances of urban and flash flooding are expected.

For portions of Southeast Canada, rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches,
with local amounts of 5 inches, are expected with Philippe as it
moves through the region this weekend.  Isolated to scattered
instances of urban and flash flooding are expected.

SURF:  Large swells are already affecting Bermuda from another
weather system but will increase later today as Philippe approaches
the island.  Swells are also reaching portions of the southeastern
U.S. coast and will spread northward along the east coast to
Atlantic Canada during the next couple of days.  These conditions
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
