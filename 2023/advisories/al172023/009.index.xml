800 AM EDT Mon Sep 25 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Philippe, located over the central tropical Atlantic. <br/>
<br/>
Southeastern Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
A trough of low pressure is producing disorganized shower activity <br/>
over portions of the southeastern Gulf of Mexico.  Development, if <br/>
any, of this system is expected to be slow to occur over the next <br/>
day or two while it moves slowly westward.  The disturbance is <br/>
expected to move into unfavorable environmental conditions by the <br/>
middle of the week, ending its chances for development.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL91):<br/>
An area of low pressure located several hundred miles southwest of <br/>
the Cabo Verde Islands continues to produce disorganized showers <br/>
and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions are forecast to be <br/>
conducive for additional development, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form within the next few days as the system moves <br/>
west-northwestward across the central tropical Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 AM AST Mon Sep 25 2023
 
Visible satellite images indicate that Philippe has become less
organized this morning.  The low-level center has become fully
exposed with all of the deep convection now displaced well to the
east of the center.  The initial wind speed is held at 45 kt, in
agreement with most of the satellite intensity estimates.
 
Philippe is currently experiencing about 20-25 kt of
west-southwesterly vertical wind shear.  Both the GFS- and
ECMWF-based SHIPS models show the vertical wind shear increasing
even more during the next few days.  These hostile winds and dry air
entrainment should cause Philippe to continue to struggle throughout
the forecast period.  There is some spread in the guidance with a
couple of models showing slight strengthening and several of the
models showing slight weakening.  Based on the guidance and expected
continued shear, the new forecast is lower than the previous one and
shows no change in strength during the next several days.
 
Geostationary and microwave satellite images indicate that Philippe
has jogged to the left this morning.  Smoothing through this wobble
yields an initial motion of 280/11 kt.  A turn back to the
west-northwest is expected by tonight, followed by a northwestward
motion in a couple of days as Philippe moves toward a weakness in
the subtropical ridge.  There is a vast amount of spread in the
track models this morning with the GFS and its ensemble mean on the
far right side of the guidance envelope and the ECMWF on the left
side.  An examination of the GFS model fields suggests that the
model is showing a vortex that is likely too vertically aligned, and
not representative of the environmental conditions.  Therefore,
that model is considered an outlier for the time being.  The new
NHC track forecast is adjusted to the left toward the various
consensus models.
