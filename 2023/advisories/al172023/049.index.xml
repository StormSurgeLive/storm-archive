FRIDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...25.6N 66.3W
ABOUT 470 MI...760 KM S OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 355 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests in eastern New England and Atlantic Canada should monitor
the progress of Philippe.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products 
issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 25.6 North, longitude 66.3 West.  Philippe is
moving toward the north near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general 
motion with an increase in forward speed is expected to continue 
through late Saturday.  A turn toward the north-northwest is 
possible Saturday night or early Sunday.  On the forecast track, 
the center of Philippe will near or just west of Bermuda on Friday, 
and then reach the coast of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, or eastern 
Maine Saturday night.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast during the 
next day or two.  Some strengthening is possible Friday night or 
Saturday, but Philippe is expected to become a post-tropical 
cyclone on Saturday as it approaches Atlantic Canada and eastern 
New England.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
to the east of the center.  Saildrone SD-1041, located about 135 
miles (215 km) southeast of Philippe's center, recently measured a 
sustained wind of 38 mph (60 km/h) and a gust to 45 mph (73 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Philippe can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
early Friday morning.
 
RAINFALL:  Rainfall will begin to affect Bermuda today with rainfall
totals of 3 to 5 inches expected through Friday. These rainfall
amounts could result in scattered flash flooding.
 
SURF:  Large swells are already affecting Bermuda from another
weather system but will begin to increase further later today as 
Philippe approaches the island.  Swells are also reaching portions 
of the southeastern U.S. coast and will spread northward along the 
east coast to Atlantic Canada during the next couple of days.  These 
conditions are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
currents.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Philippe Forecast Discussion Number 49</title>

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  49
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 AM AST Thu Oct 05 2023
 
Philippe's low-level circulation remains broad this morning with 
most of the associated deep convection located within the eastern 
semicircle.  Despite the continued disorganized structure, an Air 
Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter mission this morning measured peak 
850-mb flight-level winds of 56 kt and SFMR surface winds of 40-45 
kt.  Based on these data, Philippe's initial intensity is raised to 
45 kt.

The latest fixes suggest that Philippe is moving just west of due 
north (355 degrees) at 10 kt.  This northward motion, with an 
increase in forward speed, is expected to continue through Saturday 
while Philippe moves over the western Atlantic between a deep-layer 
trough east of Florida and a mid-level high over the central 
Atlantic.  A north-northwestward turn is likely to occur as the 
cyclone is approaching Atlantic Canada or eastern New England, due 
to a larger trough approaching from the west.  Since Philippe may 
interact with a baroclinic zone and a developing non-tropical low 
to its west in another day or two, the nuances of the track 
forecast still need to be worked out, but nearly all of the track 
guidance agrees on the forecast scenario described above.  The NHC 
forecast is close to the HCCA consensus aid and brings the center 
to the coast of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, or eastern Maine 
between 60 and 72 hours.  The center should then be absorbed by a 
broad area of low pressure to its west over Quebec some time on 
Sunday.

Little change in intensity is expected during the next day or two, 
particularly since model guidance suggests that the shear over 
Philippe could strengthen further.  Despite the shear, some 
additional strengthening is possible in about 48 hours when 
Philippe could receive an injection of baroclinic energy from the 
trough located east of Florida.  That process should also 
kick-start extratropical transition, and the NHC forecast shows the 
transition complete by 60 hours (late Saturday) when Philippe is 
located offshore of Nova Scotia.  Weakening is forecast once 
Philippe moves inland, and it's likely that the strongest winds from 
the system will continue to occur on the eastern side of the 
circulation, primarily over parts of Atlantic Canada.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
early Friday morning, and a Tropical Storm Warning remains in 
effect.  Heavy rainfall will also begin to affect the island today, 
which could produce flash-flooding.
 
2. Philippe is expected to move over portions of Atlantic Canada and
eastern New England as a post-tropical cyclone this weekend.  
Regardless of Philippe's intensity or structure, interests in those 
areas should be prepared for the possibility of strong winds and 
heavy rainfall and monitor statements from their local weather 
office.
