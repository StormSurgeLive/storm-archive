DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter near latitude 17.1 
North, longitude 60.7 West. Philippe is moving toward the 
west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and a northwestward motion is 
expected to resume later today through early Tuesday. A turn toward 
the north-northwest is forecast to occur by late Tuesday, followed 
by a northward motion on Wednesday. On the forecast track, the 
center of Philippe is expected to pass near or just northeast of 
the northern Leeward Islands tonight. Note that the strongest 
winds and heavy rains will likely occur after the center passes.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast during the next day or
so, but Philippe could begin to intensify more significantly around
the middle of the week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches) 
based off dropsonde data.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Philippe can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Philippe is forecast to produce the following rainfall
amounts through Tuesday:
 
Barbuda and Antigua: 4 to 6 inches
 
Rest of Leeward Islands: 2 to 4 inches
 
This rainfall may result in isolated to scattered flash flooding.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning
area beginning this evening and are possible in the watch area
beginning this evening.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, and Puerto Rico through midweek. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  37
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 AM AST Mon Oct 02 2023
 
The center of Philippe has become exposed this morning with
convection and heavy rainfall displaced to the south and southeast
of the center as high northwesterly vertical wind shear persists.
The initial intensity is held steady at 45 kt for this advisory,
consistent with SFMR data from the Air Force Reserve reconnaissance
aircraft mission showing a large area of 40-45 surface winds.
 
Center fixes and 1-min visible imagery during the morning indicate
that Philippe is moving erratically to the west-northwest (300
degrees) at 6 kt.  The short-term part of track forecast is adjusted
westward to match recent satellite trends, which necessitates the
Tropical Storm Warning for Barbuda.  After passing close to that
island, Philippe is forecast to move northwest to north-northwest
around the southwestern portion of a mid-level ridge over the
subtropical Atlantic during the next couple of days. Around
mid-week, Philippe should turn northward between the aforementioned
ridge and a mid- to upper-level trough over the southwestern
Atlantic.  Beyond 96 hours, track uncertainty increases as to
whether the ridge or trough will dominate, which is also partially
connected to how strong Philippe becomes.  Stronger solutions take
the system on a more east-northeastward track at longer range while
weaker solutions take the system more northward. Overall, the track
forecast for this advisory was adjusted farther west than the
previous advisory, after considering the latest ECMWF and ensemble
aids.
 
Strong northwesterly vertical wind shear is expected to prevent
significant strengthening in the short term. In a couple of days,
Philippe is expected to encounter a more favorable upper-level wind
pattern as it moves northward over the Atlantic. This could allow
for steady strengthening, and much of the guidance predicts that
Philippe will become a hurricane in 3 to 4 days.  The intensity
forecast is consistent with the consensus aids, although the 
uncertainty is pretty high at long range given how Philippe has so 
far refused to intensify for days now.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected across Barbuda and
possible across Antigua beginning this evening while Philippe passes
near or just northeast of the area.  Interests elsewhere in the
northern Leeward Islands should continue to monitor this system.
 
2. Heavy rainfall from Philippe could produce isolated to scattered
flash flooding over the northern Leeward Islands, particularly
across Barbuda and Antigua, through Tuesday.
