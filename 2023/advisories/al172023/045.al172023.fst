Little change in strength is forecast during the next couple of

RAINFALL:  Philippe is forecast to produce the following additional
rainfall totals through today:

The U.S. and British Virgin Islands:  1 to 3 inches, with storm
totals of 6 to 12 inches.

Portions of northeast and southeast Puerto Rico: 1 to 2 inches, with
storm totals of 2 to 4 inches

Rainfall will begin to affect Bermuda on Thursday with rainfall
totals of 3 to 6 inches expected through Friday.

These rainfall amounts may result in scattered flash flooding.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning
Friday morning.  Gusty winds are likely to continue across portions
of the the Virgin Islands through today.

SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands,
and Puerto Rico for another day or so.  Large swells are already
affecting Bermuda from another weather system but will begin to
increase further on Thursday as Philippe approaches the island.
These conditions are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
currents. Please consult products from your local weather office.
