Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
500 PM AST Thu Sep 28 2023
 
Philippe remains poorly organized.  Visible satellite images
indicate that the circulation is elongated from east to west and
appears to have multiple centers along a trough axis.  The center
position listed in the advisory seems to be the main center and
there is some deep convection on its east and southeast sides.
Philippe barely meets the criteria needed for a tropical cyclone as
it has lost some organization today.  The initial intensity is
lowered to 40 kt, which is near the high end of the latest satellite
intensity estimates.
 
The initial motion is highly uncertain since the storm is elongated
and confidence in the initial position remains low.  The track
forecast is challenging, in part due to Philippe's close proximity
to Tropical Storm Rina.  During the next few days, Philippe will 
likely move slowly southwestward as it rotates around Rina 
currently to its east.  By late in the weekend, however, a sharp 
northward turn is expected when a mid-level ridge becomes 
established over the central subtropical Atlantic.  There remains a 
very large east-west spread in the models, and disagreements on 
where Philippe makes its northward turn.  The GFS is the right-most 
model while the ECMWF remains the model farthest west.  The NHC 
track forecast is little changed from the previous one and remains 
closest to the ECMWF model, which has been performing best so far 
for this storm.
 
The observed weakening of the system today appears to be related to 
its interaction with Rina and some environmental dry air.  Since 
these factors are expected to persist, some additional weakening is 
forecast during the next day or so, and it is possible that Philippe 
dissipates sometime during the next couple of days.  However, if the 
storm does survive, environmental conditions are expected to become 
a little more favorable when Philippe and Rina become more 
separated later in the forecast period.  There is a huge spread in 
the intensity models with HWRF, HMON, and the GFS showing Philippe 
becoming a significant hurricane while the HAFS-A and HAFS-B models 
show gradual weakening.  The NHC intensity forecast is a little 
lower than the previous one in the short term, but is otherwise 
unchanged and closer to the low end of the model guidance.

Tropical Storm Rina Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182023
500 PM AST Thu Sep 28 2023
 
Tropical Storm Rina has not changed much this afternoon. Visible 
satellite imagery indicates that the center of circulation is 
mostly exposed to the northwest of persistent deep convective 
activity. Subjective Dvorak estimates from SAB and TAFB both support 
an initial intensity of 35 kt for this advisory.
 
A combination of Rina's close proximity to Tropical Storm Philippe 
and moderate deep-layer northwesterly shear is likely to limit 
intensification in the short term. This shear is expected to 
increase this weekend and early next week, and it not forecast to 
abate during the forecast period. The NHC forecast remains in the 
middle of the guidance envelope and is slightly lower than the prior 
forecast. While Rina is expected to remain a tropical storm 
throughout the forecast period, uncertainty in the intensity 
forecast is higher than normal due to the potential interaction with 
Philippe.
 
Rina is moving northwestward, with an initial forward speed
near 12 kt. The tropical storm should begin to turn more westward
tonight and continue this general motion for the next several days.
Early next week, the system is expected to turn northward and 
eventually northeastward as a mid-level ridge builds to the west. 
The NHC forecast is a blend of the prior forecast and the HCCA and 
TVCN consensus guidance throughout the forecast period. As 
with the intensity forecast, confidence in the track forecast is 
lower than normal due to uncertainty regarding the potential 
interaction of Rina with Tropical Storm Philippe during the next 
several days.
