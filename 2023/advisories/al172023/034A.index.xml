DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 16.6 North, longitude 59.0 West.  Philippe is
moving toward the west-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h).  A track
toward the northwest is forecast through Monday followed by a
northward motion on Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center of
Philippe is forecast to pass near or just northeast of the northern
Leeward Islands on Monday and Monday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Little change in strength is forecast during the next 48 hours, but 
Philippe could begin to intensify more significantly around the 
middle of the week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km),
primarily east and southeast of the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Hurricane 
Hunter observations is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Philippe can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Philippe is forecast to produce the following rainfall
amounts through Tuesday:
 
Barbuda and Antigua: 4 to 6 inches
Rest of the Leeward Islands: 2 to 4 inches
 
This rainfall may result in isolated to scattered flash flooding.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch areas by
Monday morning.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, and Puerto Rico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  34
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
500 PM AST Sun Oct 01 2023
 
The structure of Philippe has not changed much since this morning. A 
large area of deep convection remains in the southeastern quadrant 
of the cyclone, with a small burst near the center.  The initial 
wind speed is held at 45 kt, per the latest satellite 
classifications, and an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
is scheduled to be inside the storm tonight.
 
The southward progress of Philippe has thankfully stopped today,
and recent fixes show it moving between west-northwest and
northwest at about 6 kt.  A building ridge well to the northeast
should steer the storm generally northwestward tonight and Monday,
with a turn to the north forecast on Tuesday while the system moves
around the western periphery of the ridge.  Eventually a faster 
north-northeastward motion is anticipated at long range as the storm 
enters the mid-latitudes.  While the track forecast has been 
adjusted a bit to the east, this should not be interpreted as the 
end of any threat to the Leeward Islands with still some models 
near those islands.  Notably, a very strong rain band on the 
southern side of Philippe will be very close to moving over the 
northern Leeward Islands, and it could turn out that rainfall and 
flooding would be the main hazard of the storm.
 
There's been no change to the intensity forecast reasoning from the
last cycle, with strong shear near Philippe expected to limit
intensification during the next couple of days.  There remains a
decent chance that the shear could relax by the middle of the week,
allowing Philippe to become a hurricane after it recurves into the
subtropical central Atlantic.  Guidance has been inconsistent at 
long range with the storm, so the best course of action seems to 
be to hold the forecast steady to see if any notable trends emerge.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are possible across portions of the
northern Leeward Islands Monday and Monday night while Philippe
passes near or just northeast of the area, and a Tropical Storm
Watch is in effect for Antigua and Barbuda.  Interests elsewhere
in the northern Leeward Islands should continue to monitor this
system as additional watches or warnings could be required later
today or tonight.
 
2. Heavy rainfall from Philippe could produce isolated to scattered
flash flooding, particularly across Barbuda and Antigua, through
Tuesday.

Tropical Depression Rina Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182023
500 PM AST Sun Oct 01 2023
 
Rina is barely a tropical cyclone. Its associated sheared convection 
collapsed a few hours ago, and the fully exposed low-level center 
has continued to lose definition based on recent GOES derived motion 
wind (DMW) vectors. Assuming some weakening has occurred since the 
earlier scatterometer passes, the initial intensity is lowered to 30 
kt for this advisory.

The initial motion of Rina is still northwestward (325/14 kt), but 
the shallow cyclone is expected to turn northward soon while moving 
around the western extent of a low-level ridge. The continued 
northwesterly shear and dry air in the surrounding environment are 
expected to limit convective development going forward, and Rina 
is likely to degenerate to a remnant low or open into a trough 
during the next 12-24 h. No notable changes were made to the NHC 
track or intensity forecast.
