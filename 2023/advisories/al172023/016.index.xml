Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
500 AM AST Wed Sep 27 2023

Philippe continues to be a disorganized tropical cyclone.  
Satellite imagery shows a cloud pattern consisting of bursting deep 
convection in an amorphous-looking blob just east of the estimated 
center with a few areas of convection farther to the east and 
southeast.  Although there was some evidence earlier of a 
convective band over the eastern periphery of the circulation, that 
feature has since broken up into less-organized patches of showers 
and thunderstorms.  The current intensity estimate is held at 40 kt 
based on earlier scatterometer measurements.  However, subjective 
and objective Dvorak intensity estimates suggest a weaker storm.

Philippe is expected to remain in a sheared environment, and 
ingesting drier low- to mid-level air, over the next few days.  
Wind fields from both the ECMWF and GFS models show Philippe's 
circulation weakening below tropical storm strength around 48 hours 
and beyond.  Simulated satellite imagery from those models also 
depict the system as lacking sufficient organized deep convection to 
be considered a tropical cyclone while it approaches the northern 
Leeward Islands.  The official intensity forecast, like the previous 
one, shows Philippe degenerating into a remnant low pressure area 
around 72 hours.

The cyclone continues on a mainly westward heading at around 280/10 
kt.  Philippe is currently being steered by the flow to the south 
of a weak mid-level anticyclone, and is expected to move 
west-northwestward on the southwest side of this high during the 
next couple of days.  In the latter part of the forecast period, 
the weakening and increasingly shallow system should turn toward 
the west-southwest following the low-level trade winds.  The 
official track forecast has again been shifted a little southward in 
3-5 days, following the TVCN consensus solution.
