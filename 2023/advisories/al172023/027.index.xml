Tropical Storm Philippe Advisory Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 PM AST Fri Sep 29 2023
 
...PHILIPPE MEANDERING EAST OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.6N 55.8W
ABOUT 480 MI...775 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...SW OR 220 DEGREES AT 3 MPH...6 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1002 MB...29.59 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, the U.S. and British
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of this
system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 17.6 North, longitude 55.8 West. Philippe is
moving toward the southwest near 3 mph (6 km/h), and this motion is 
expected to continue through Saturday night.  A turn toward the west 
and northwest is forecast Sunday and Sunday night, and a slightly 
faster northwest to north-northwest motion is expected by Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is forecast during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, and Puerto Rico through the weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 PM AST Fri Sep 29 2023

Deep convection continues to pulse over the southeastern portion of 
Philippe's circulation this evening.  The center is located near 
the northwestern edge of the deep convection due to moderate 
westerly shear.  The intensity is held at 45 kt, and is based on 
the earlier reconnaissance aircraft data and a T3.0 (45 kt) 
subjective Dvorak classification from TAFB.  Another Air Force 
Reserve reconnaissance mission is scheduled overnight, and this 
mission should provide a full assessment of Philippe's structure 
and intensity. 

The earlier aircraft center fixes and more recent satellite 
position estimates indicate that Philippe is moving slowly 
southwestward. This motion is being influenced by Philippe's 
interaction with Tropical Storm Rina located to Philippe's 
east-northeast.  As the two tropical cyclone's continue to 
interact, Philippe is expected to move slowly west-southwestward
to westward during the next 24 to 36 hours.  After that time, the 
distance between the tropical cyclones should increase, and 
Philippe is forecast to turn northwestward when a mid-level ridge 
builds over the central Atlantic.  After 72 hours, Philippe is 
expected to turn northward between the aforementioned ridge and a 
mid- to upper-level trough over the southwestern Atlantic.  
Although the models are in general agreement on this scenario, 
there is significant spread on the longitude of the northward turn, 
and on how fast Philippe moves later in the period.  The updated 
NHC track forecast is near the various consensus aids, and very 
close to the previous advisory. 

The moderate shear that has been affecting Philippe the past few 
days could lessen during the next day or two.  This should allow 
for some gradual strengthening over the weekend.  After that time, 
there is a bifurcation in the intensity guidance with the 
GFS-based SHIPS model, the HMON, the HWRF, and even the GFS showing 
a more favorable upper-air environment and more significant 
deepening with a track farther east.  Meanwhile, the ECMWF-based 
SHIPS guidance, and the HAFS-A and HAFS-B which show a more westward 
track keeps stronger southwesterly vertical wind shear over the 
storm and therefore less strengthening.  The NHC intensity foreast 
is near the middle of these two scenarios, but is a bit more 
conservative than the lastest intensity consensus models.

1100 PM AST Fri Sep 29 2023
 
...RINA SLIGHTLY STRONGER THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT BUT FORECAST TO
SLOWLY WEAKEN OVER THE WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.4N 48.8W
ABOUT 945 MI...1520 KM ENE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Rina was
located near latitude 20.4 North, longitude 48.8 West. Rina is
moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days.
 
Recent satellite wind data indicate that the maximum sustained 
winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. Although this 
is higher that previous estimates, Rina is still forecast to slowly 
weaken over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Tropical Storm Rina Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182023
1100 PM AST Fri Sep 29 2023
 
Rina continues to produce persistent but poorly organized shower and
thunderstorm activity well to the east of its exposed surface
center. Despite the apparent lack of organization, a pair of ASCAT 
passes near 00Z revealed that Rina's wind field was both slightly 
larger and stronger than previously estimated. Both ASCAT passes 
showed a large swath of winds of 40-45 kt east and northeast of 
Rina's center. Based on this new information, the intensity of Rina 
has been increased to 45 kt. Both ASCAT passes had slightly higher 
winds in the deep convection that were flagged as marginal for 
rain contamination, so they weren't considered as representative. 
That said, its possible 45 kt could be slightly conservative.
 
With SHIPS-analyzed 850-200 mb shear higher than 40 kt for the next 
24 h, its very unlikely Rina will become any better organized than 
it is now. Nearly all of the dynamical models forecast that Rina 
will dissipate in the next 24 to 48 h. Based on the structure 
information provided by ASCAT, it appears unlikely that the tropical 
storm will dissipate that quickly. Therefore the the NHC official 
forecast is a little more conservative, but still shows Rina slowly 
weakening, close to the intensity consensus. It is worth noting that 
the vortex tracker associated with a few models flipped to Philippe 
beyond 72 h and the tracks are therefore not representative of the 
actual model forecast.
 
Rina is heading northwestward near 10 kt. The combination of
Tropical Storm Philippe to its west-southwest and a subtropical
ridge to the northeast should keep Rina on this general heading for
a couple of days. The NHC track forecast is near the center of the
guidance envelope, between the simple and corrected consensus aids.
