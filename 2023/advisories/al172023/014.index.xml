<title>Tropical Storm Philippe Forecast Discussion Number 13</title>

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 AM AST Tue Sep 26 2023
 
Philippe continues to struggle due to strong west-southwesterly 
shear associated with a mid- to upper-level low to its northwest. 
The low-level center is completely exposed and deep convection 
remains well removed to the east of the center.  The latest 
satellite intensity estimates range from 30 to 42 kt, and based on 
that data, the initial wind speed is nudged downward to 40 kt.

The strong shear is not expected to let up over the next several 
days, which should keep the storm asymmetric and weak.  A 
combination of the shear and dry air entrainment should lead to a 
gradual decay, and simulated satellite images from the GFS and ECMWF 
models suggest that Philippe will likely degenerate into a remnant 
low in 3 or 4 days. The NHC intensity forecast lies near the middle 
of the guidance envelope and now shows the system becoming a 
remnant low by day 4.

Philippe continues to move westward, and it has not gained much 
latitude over the past 24 hours due to its sheared structure.  
Based on the previous track, the expected asymmetric structure, and 
the new model guidance, the NHC track forecast is again shifted to 
the left as Philippe is expected to continue to move in the low- to 
mid-level flow.  This forecast lies on the southern side of the 
guidance envelope, in best agreement with the ECMWF model.
