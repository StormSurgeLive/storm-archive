the progress of Philippe.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 23.1 North, longitude 66.0 West.  Philippe is
moving toward the north near 12 mph (19 km/h).  This general motion
with an increase in forward speed is expected through Saturday.  On
the forecast track, the center of Philippe will pass near Bermuda 
on Friday, and approach eastern New England and Atlantic Canada on 
Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Little change in strength is forecast during the next day or so.  
Some strengthening is possible on Friday and Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
to the east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Philippe can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Rainfall will begin to affect Bermuda on Thursday with
rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches expected through Friday.
 
These rainfall amounts may result in scattered flash flooding.
 
Rainfall across the U.S. and British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico
will continue to diminish during the next few hours.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning
Friday morning.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands,
and Puerto Rico for another day or so.  Large swells are already
affecting Bermuda from another weather system but will begin to
increase further on Thursday as Philippe approaches the island.
These conditions are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
currents. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  46
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
500 PM AST Wed Oct 04 2023
 
Philippe still has an elongated circulation with discrete clusters
of deep convection extending well to the east and south of the
center.  Aircraft and satellite-derived wind data suggest that the
maximum winds have decreased a bit, and Philippe is barely a
tropical storm.  An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft
only measured peak 850-mb flight-level winds of 39 kt, and although
SFMR winds were reported between 35-40 kt, a comparison with ASCAT
data and a visual assessment from the flight crew indicate that
these data were at least 10 kt too high.  The consensus of all
available data suggest that 35 kt is a more representative value
for the initial intensity.
 
The latest fixes indicate that Philippe has turned northward with
an initial motion of 350/10 kt.  A northward motion with an
increase in forward speed is expected through the next 3 days while
Philippe moves between a deep-layer trough just east of Florida and 
the subtropical ridge over the central Atlantic.  After day 3, a 
larger trough is forecast to move across eastern North America and 
become negatively tilted, which is expected to cause Philippe to 
bend to the north-northwest when it reaches Atlantic Canada or 
eastern New England over the weekend.  The track models (at 
least the ones that carry Philippe for the entire forecast period) 
remain in good agreement on this scenario, and the NHC track 
forecast is close to the HCCA consensus aid.

The forecast for Philippe's intensity and structure remains complex. 
The 12Z GFS still shows a separate non-tropical low developing over 
the western Atlantic, with Philippe becoming absorbed by the warm 
front to the east of the low in 2-3 days.  However, that appears to 
be an outlier scenario at this time since the ECMWF, UKMET, and 
Canadian models keep Philippe as a distinct and dominant low.  Even 
if it doesn't become absorbed, Philippe is likely to become 
frontal by day 3, and the NHC forecast now shows the system as 
extratropical by Saturday afternoon.  Little change in strength is 
likely during the next couple of days, but Philippe could strengthen 
a little due to baroclinic influences while it goes through 
extratropical transition.  The NHC intensity forecast is below the 
intensity consensus aids for the first 48 hours, but then is between 
IVCN and the ECMWF after that time.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
early Friday morning, and a Tropical Storm Warning is now in effect. 
Heavy rainfall will begin to affect the island on Thursday. 
 
2. Philippe is likely to move over portions of Atlantic Canada and
eastern New England, likely as a post-tropical cyclone, this
weekend.  Regardless of Philippe's intensity or structure, interests 
in those areas should monitor the storm's progress and be prepared 
for the possibility of strong winds and heavy rainfall.
