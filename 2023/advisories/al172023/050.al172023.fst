DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 27.0 North, longitude 66.2 West.  Philippe is
moving toward the north near 14 mph (22 km/h), and this general
motion with an increase in forward speed is expected to continue
through Saturday nigh.  A turn toward the north-northwest is
forecast early Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Philippe will pass near or just west of Bermuda on Friday, and then 
reach the coast of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, or eastern Maine 
Saturday night.

Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next day or so.  
Some strengthening is possible Friday night or Saturday, but 
Philippe is expected to become post-tropical on Saturday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
to the east of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Philippe can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
early Friday morning.

RAINFALL:  Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches are expected across
Bermuda through Friday.  This rainfall could result in flash
flooding.

For portions of New York and New England, rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 
inches, with local amounts of 5 inches, are expected with Philippe 
as it moves through the region Saturday and Saturday night.  
Isolated to scattered instances of urban and flash flooding are 
expected.

For portions of Southeast Canada, rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches, 
with local amounts of 5 inches, are expected with Philippe as it 
moves through the region this weekend.  Isolated to scattered 
instances of urban and flash flooding are expected.

SURF:  Large swells are already affecting Bermuda from another
weather system but will increase further tonight as Philippe
approaches the island.  Swells are also reaching portions of the
southeastern U.S. coast and will spread northward along the east
coast to Atlantic Canada during the next couple of days.  These
conditions are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
currents.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
