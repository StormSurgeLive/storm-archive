PUERTO RICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.1N 65.5W
ABOUT 120 MI...195 KM NNW OF ST. THOMAS
ABOUT 845 MI...1355 KM S OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1004 MB...29.65 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Philippe.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was 
located near latitude 20.1 North, longitude 65.5 West. Philippe is 
moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A turn toward 
the north-northwest is forecast on Wednesday, followed by a faster 
motion toward the north on Thursday and Friday.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Philippe will continue to move away from the 
Virgin Islands.  Philippe will then approach Bermuda Thursday night 
and Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast during the next few 
days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Philippe can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Philippe is forecast to produce the following rainfall 
amounts through Wednesday:

The United States & British Virgin Islands:  4 to 8 inches with 
maximum amounts to 12 inches.

Puerto Rico: 2 to 4 inches

This rainfall would result in scattered flash flooding.
 
WIND:  Gusty winds are likely to continue across portions of the
the Virgin Islands through early Wednesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the 
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, 
and Puerto Rico for another couple of days.  Swells are expected to 
reach Bermuda by late Thursday.  These conditions are likely to 
cause life-threatening surf and rip currents. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Philippe Forecast Discussion Number 42</title>

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  42
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
500 PM AST Tue Oct 03 2023
 
Philippe has continued to lose organization for much of the day. 
Satellite images and aircraft fixes from this morning indicate that 
the circulation has become elongated, and the remaining deep 
convection has relatively little, if any, organization relative to 
the center, which is now located just north of the Virgin Islands. 
The initial intensity remains 40 kt based on the earlier SFMR data, 
but this could be generous given the overall loss of convective 
organization.
 
The current motion is northwestward, or 310/10 kt.  Over the next 
couple of days, Philippe is expected to turn northward between a 
strong mid-level high over the subtropical Atlantic and a developing 
cut-off low east of Florida, with its forward speed increasing in 
2-3 days when it becomes positioned between these two features.  The 
northward motion is expected to continue through the end of the 
forecast period as another deep-layer trough moves eastward across 
eastern North America.  The most notable change in this NHC forecast 
is that the guidance has again shifted westward, both due to an 
adjustment caused by Philippe's recent motion and a general westward 
trend in the track guidance.   The official forecast is close to the 
TVCA consensus aid, but it's not as far to the west as the latest 
ECMWF and HCCA solutions.  The risk continues to increase for some 
form of Philippe, likely as a post-tropical cyclone, to reach 
Atlantic Canada or eastern New England in about 5 days.
 
The deep-layer trough located near the east coast of the United 
States is likely to keep moderate-to-strong westerly or 
southwesterly shear over Philippe for much of the forecast period.  
As a result, little change in strength is forecast during the next 
2-3 days.  The GFS and ECMWF are now in good agreement that a 
separate baroclinic/non-tropical low will develop just to the west 
of Philippe in about 3 days.  These two systems are likely to 
interact, with Philippe becoming attached to the warm front, and 
therefore becoming extratropical, by day 4.  It's possible that 
Philippe could strengthen slightly due to this baroclinic 
interaction, and that scenario is shown in the official forecast.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Philippe is expected to produce scattered
flash flooding across portions of the northern Leeward Islands and
the British Virgin Islands into early Wednesday.

2. Gusty winds are likely to continue across portions of the 
northern Leeward Islands and the Virgin Islands through Wednesday.
 
3. The risk is increasing for tropical storm conditions to occur on 
Bermuda later this week.  Interests on Bermuda should monitor the 
progress of Philippe.
