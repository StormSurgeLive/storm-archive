WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests in eastern New England and Atlantic Canada should monitor
the progress of Philippe.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 24.2 North, longitude 65.9 West. Philippe is
moving toward the north near 10 mph (16 km/h). This general motion
with an increase in forward speed is expected through Saturday.  On
the forecast track, the center of Philippe will pass near Bermuda on
Friday, and approach eastern New England and Atlantic Canada on
Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual strengthening is forecast during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km) 
from the center. In the last several hours, Saildrone SD-1068 
located to the southeast of Philippe's center reported a sustained 
wind of 40 mph (65 km/h) with a gust to 50 mph (81 km/h). 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Philippe can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Rainfall will begin to affect Bermuda later today with
rainfall totals of 3 to 5 inches expected through Friday.
 
These rainfall amounts could result in scattered flash flooding.
 
Rainfall across Puerto Rico and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands 
should gradually diminish early this morning.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning
by tonight.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands,
and Puerto Rico for another day or so.  Large swells are already
affecting Bermuda from another weather system but will begin to
increase further later today as Philippe approaches the island.
These conditions are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
currents. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Philippe Forecast Discussion Number 47</title>

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  47
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 PM AST Wed Oct 04 2023
 
Philippe has generally changed little during the past several hours. 
The storm still resembles an elongated trough in satellite images 
with a north-south oriented area of deep convection extending a 
couple of hundred north and several hundred miles south of the 
center.  Areas of heavy rain continue to linger near Puerto Rico and 
the Virgin Islands.  Since the system appears to be steady in 
strength, the initial intensity is held at 35 kt based on the 
earlier aicraft data.  This wind speed estimate is also in line with 
the latest satellite intensity estimates.

The storm is moving northward at 11 kt in the flow between a ridge 
over the central Atlantic and a mid- to upper-level low off the 
Florida coast.  This northward motion with an increase in forward 
speed is expected during the next few days, taking the center 
of the system across Bermuda in 36-48 hours.  Philippe will likely 
turn northwestward into Maine and Atlantic Canada this weekend when 
another trough cuts off over the northeastern U.S.  The NHC track 
forecast is similar to the previous one and near the middle of the 
guidance envelope.

Nearly all of the models show slow strengthening during the next 2 
or 3 days, which seems to be due to baroclinic influences from the 
trough/low currently east of Florida.  The mid- to upper-level 
trough/low will likely merge with Philippe in 48-60 hours, which 
should cause the system to develop frontal features and become 
extratropical after it passes Bermuda.  The post-tropical cyclone 
is expected to weaken once it moves inland over Maine and Atlantic 
Canada.  The NHC intensity forecast also lies near the middle of 
the guidance envelope.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
Thursday night, and a Tropical Storm Warning is in effect. Heavy 
rainfall will begin to affect the island on Thursday.
 
2. Philippe is likely to move over portions of Atlantic Canada and
eastern New England, likely as a post-tropical cyclone, this
weekend.  Regardless of Philippe's intensity or structure, interests
in those areas should monitor the storm's progress and be prepared
for the possibility of strong winds and heavy rainfall.
