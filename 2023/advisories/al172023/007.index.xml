Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Sun Sep 24 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Philippe, located over the central tropical Atlantic. <br/>
<br/>
Southeastern Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue over the <br/>
southeastern Gulf of Mexico in association with a surface trough of <br/>
low pressure and an upper-level trough. Further development, if any, <br/>
is expected to be slow to occur over the next few days while the <br/>
system moves slowly westward.  By the middle of the week, <br/>
upper-level winds are forecast to become less conducive for <br/>
additional development.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL91):<br/>
An area of low pressure located several hundred miles southwest of <br/>
the Cabo Verde Islands continues to produce a broad area of <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions <br/>
are forecast to be conducive for additional development, and a <br/>
tropical depression is now likely to form around mid-week as the <br/>
system moves west-northwestward across the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
500 PM AST Sun Sep 24 2023
 
Microwave and satellite data indicate that the center of Philippe 
has re-formed to the northeast of earlier estimates.  Overall, the 
storm is reasonably well organized, with convection near the center 
and a large central dense overcast.  Intensity estimates are about 
the same as the last cycle, so the initial wind speed remains 45 kt.

There aren't many changes to the intensity prediction reasoning in 
this advisory.  Increasing shear is forecast to otherwise counteract 
a conducive environment, leading to little net change with Philippe 
during the next couple of days.  Afterwards, models are in quite 
poor agreement on if the shear continues to rise to strong levels, 
which causes dissipation like the ECMWF, or if it becomes more 
manageable to allow for further intensification, similar to the 
GFS's hurricane forecast at day 5.  There are no obvious clues to 
the correct solution, and this is probably a very difficult forecast 
due to the feedback of Philippe's track affecting intensity, in 
addition to the inherent challenges of moderate shear cases. Thus, 
little change was made to the intensity forecast, which lies near 
the overall model and corrected-consensus aids.
 
The storm appears to be moving west-northwestward or 290/10 kt. The 
subtropical ridge to the north of Philippe is forecast to gradually 
weaken and slide eastward in a day or two, allowing the tropical 
storm to move more west-northwestward and northwestward by the 
middle of the week.  Uncertainty is large after that point, with the 
track very likely also dependent on the intensity and vortex depth, 
and the GFS and ECMWF models are on the opposite sides of the 
guidance envelope.  The long-range guidance has shifted a bit 
westward on this cycle, and the new forecast follows that trend.  
However, this forecast should be considered low-confidence in both 
track and intensity.
