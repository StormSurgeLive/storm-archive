WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

Storm Watch for the British Virgin Islands.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Philippe.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 19.6 North, longitude 64.9 West.  Philippe is
moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this motion 
is expected to continue through tonight.  A turn toward the 
north-northwest is forecast on Wednesday, followed by a faster 
motion toward the north on Thursday and Friday.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Philippe will move away from the Virgin 
Islands.  Philippe will then approach Bermuda Thursday night and 
Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km)
to the east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Philippe can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Philippe is forecast to produce the following rainfall
amounts into early Wednesday:
 
Anguilla southward to Montserrat, including St. Kitts and Nevis,
and the British Virgin Islands:  4 to 8 inches with maximum amounts
to 12 inches.
 
The remainder of the Leeward Islands and northern Windward Islands:
1 to 4 inches
 
The U.S. Virgin Islands and northeast Puerto Rico: 2 to 4 inches
 
This rainfall would result in scattered flash flooding.
 
WIND:  Gusty winds are likely to continue across portions of the
northern Leeward Islands and the Virgin Islands through Wednesday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, and Puerto Rico through midweek. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  42
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
500 PM AST Tue Oct 03 2023
 
Philippe has continued to lose organization for much of the day. 
Satellite images and aircraft fixes from this morning indicate that 
the circulation has become elongated, and the remaining deep 
convection has relatively little, if any, organization relative to 
the center, which is now located just north of the Virgin Islands. 
The initial intensity remains 40 kt based on the earlier SFMR data, 
but this could be generous given the overall loss of convective 
organization.
 
The current motion is northwestward, or 310/10 kt.  Over the next 
couple of days, Philippe is expected to turn northward between a 
strong mid-level high over the subtropical Atlantic and a developing 
cut-off low east of Florida, with its forward speed increasing in 
2-3 days when it becomes positioned between these two features.  The 
northward motion is expected to continue through the end of the 
forecast period as another deep-layer trough moves eastward across 
eastern North America.  The most notable change in this NHC forecast 
is that the guidance has again shifted westward, both due to an 
adjustment caused by Philippe's recent motion and a general westward 
trend in the track guidance.   The official forecast is close to the 
TVCA consensus aid, but it's not as far to the west as the latest 
ECMWF and HCCA solutions.  The risk continues to increase for some 
form of Philippe, likely as a post-tropical cyclone, to reach 
Atlantic Canada or eastern New England in about 5 days.
 
The deep-layer trough located near the east coast of the United 
States is likely to keep moderate-to-strong westerly or 
southwesterly shear over Philippe for much of the forecast period.  
As a result, little change in strength is forecast during the next 
2-3 days.  The GFS and ECMWF are now in good agreement that a 
separate baroclinic/non-tropical low will develop just to the west 
of Philippe in about 3 days.  These two systems are likely to 
interact, with Philippe becoming attached to the warm front, and 
therefore becoming extratropical, by day 4.  It's possible that 
Philippe could strengthen slightly due to this baroclinic 
interaction, and that scenario is shown in the official forecast.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Philippe is expected to produce scattered
flash flooding across portions of the northern Leeward Islands and
the British Virgin Islands into early Wednesday.

2. Gusty winds are likely to continue across portions of the 
northern Leeward Islands and the Virgin Islands through Wednesday.
 
3. The risk is increasing for tropical storm conditions to occur on 
Bermuda later this week.  Interests on Bermuda should monitor the 
progress of Philippe.
