...HEAVY RAINS AND FLOODING OCCURRING OVER PORTIONS OF THE
NORTHERN WINDWARD ISLANDS AND THE LEEWARD ISLANDS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM AST...0600 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.0N 62.4W
ABOUT 45 MI...75 KM E OF ST. MARTIN
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Antigua has issued a Tropical Storm Warning for 
Anguilla.  
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Barbuda
* Antigua
* Anguilla
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests elsewhere in the northern Leeward Islands should monitor
the progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was 
located near latitude 18.0 North, longitude 62.4 West.  Philippe is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and a 
general northwestward motion is forecast to begin later today.  On 
the forecast track, the center of Philippe is expected to continue 
passing near the northern Leeward Islands this morning, and then 
begin moving north of those islands later today.  However, the 
strongest winds and heaviest rains will likely occur in the islands 
to the south of the center.  A turn toward the north-northwest is 
forecast by tonight, followed by a northward motion on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Little change in strength is forecast during the next day or two, 
but Philippe could begin to intensify around the middle of the week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
primarily to the east and southeast of the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Hurricane
Hunter aircraft observations is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Philippe can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Philippe is forecast to produce the following rainfall
amounts into early Wednesday:
 
Barbuda southward to Dominica: 4 to 8 inches
 
Rest of Leeward Islands and northern Windward Islands: 3 to 5 inches
 
This rainfall would result in scattered flash flooding.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the 
warning area today.  Strong gusty winds are also likely elsewhere in 
the Leeward Islands through today.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, and Puerto Rico through midweek. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Philippe Forecast Discussion Number 39</title>

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  39
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 PM AST Mon Oct 02 2023

Philippe continues to be under the influence of significant 
westerly to northwesterly vertical wind shear.  The center, which 
is located on the northwestern edge of the main area of deep 
convection, recently passed over Barbuda.  Most of the stronger 
convection is over the southern and southeastern portions of the 
circulation, so the Leeward Islands should continue to experience 
strong winds and heavy rains even when the center of the storm 
begins to move north of those islands.  The current intensity is 
kept at 45 kt based on SFMR-observed surface winds from an Air Force 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft that is still investigating the system.

The cyclone has wobbled west-northwestward this evening and the 
current motion estimate is 300/6 kt.  Over the next few days, 
Philippe should move along the western periphery of a mid-level 
subtropical high pressure area.  Most of the guidance model tracks 
have shifted even farther west, with the exception of the GFS 
deterministic and ensemble mean forecasts, which appear to be 
eastern outliers at this time.   Based the new dynamical model 
consensus, the official forecast track is, again, shifted farther 
west from the previous one.  Later in the forecast period, the 
spread in the guidance models increases.  Notably,the GFS 
prediction shows that a mid-tropospheric trough over the 
northwestern Atlantic fails to capture the cyclone and take it 
northward into Atlantic Canada, but keeps Philippe moving slowly 
over the subtropical Atlantic at 5 days and even beyond.

Little change in intensity is likely for the next couple of days 
while the storm remains in an environment of strong vertical wind 
shear.  In 2 to 3 days, the global models suggest that Philippe 
could encounter a more favorable upper-tropospheric wind 
environment, with more anticyclonic and diffluent upper-level winds 
evolving over the system.  Therefore, some strengthening is 
predicted in the latter half of the forecast period.  The official 
intensity forecast is near the high end of the model guidance, 
however.


KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected across Barbuda and
Antigua tonight while Philippe passes just north of the area.  
Interests elsewhere in the northern Leeward Islands should continue 
to monitor this system.
 
2. Heavy rainfall from Philippe is expected to produce scattered 
flash flooding across portions of the Leeward and northern Windward 
Islands, particularly between Barbuda and Dominica, into early 
Wednesday.
