...PHILIPPE LIKELY TO CAUSE HEAVY RAINS AND SOME FLOODING TO
PORTIONS OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS OVERNIGHT...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.6N 61.5W
ABOUT 20 MI...30 KM E OF BARBUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H

CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Antigua has issued a Tropical Storm Warning for 
Antigua.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Barbuda
* Antigua
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within 6
hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the northern Leeward Islands should monitor
the progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 17.6 North, longitude 61.5 West. Philippe is
moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general
motion is anticipated through early Tuesday. On the forecast track, 
the center of Philippe is expected to pass near the northern 
Leeward Islands tonight and north of those islands on Tuesday. The 
strongest winds and heavy rains will likely occur in the islands 
after the center passes. A turn toward the north-northwest is 
forecast to occur by late Tuesday, followed by a northward motion 
on Wednesday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast during the next day or
so, but Philippe could begin to intensify more significantly around
the middle of the week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Philippe can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Philippe is forecast to produce the following rainfall
amounts through Tuesday:
 
Barbuda and Antigua: 4 to 6 inches 
Rest of Leeward Islands: 2 to 4 inches
 
This rainfall may result in isolated to scattered flash flooding.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning
areas beginning this evening.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, and Puerto Rico through midweek. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  38
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
500 PM AST Mon Oct 02 2023
 
The center of Philippe remains exposed this afternoon with
some convection firing closer to the center over the last few
hours. Heavy rainfall and thunderstorms remain displaced to the 
south and southeast of the center as high northwesterly vertical 
wind shear persists. The initial intensity is again held steady at 
45 kt for this advisory, consistent with SFMR data from the Air 
Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft mission showing a large area 
of 40-45 surface winds mostly on the east and southeast side of the 
system earlier this afternoon. Another Air Force Reserve mission is
scheduled for this evening.

The storm continues to move to the northwest (305 degrees) at 6 kt 
this afternoon.  Philippe refuses to gain much vertical depth as a 
tropical cyclone and has been steered more by the lower-level 
ridge.  Thus, the track forecast is again adjusted westward to 
match recent satellite trends and in line with the weaker model 
guidance.  The cyclone is forecast to pass near Barbuda tonight 
before turning north-northwest north of the Leeward Islands.  
Around mid-week, Philippe should turn northward due to flow between 
a mid-level trough in the southwest Atlantic and the subtropical 
ridge.  Uncertainty greatly increases after that point, with huge 
differences showing up between the GFS- and ECMWF-based guidance.  
The differences in model track forecasts are related to whether this 
trough captures Philippe's circulation, causing Philippe to move 
more to the north-northwest, or whether it is shunted more to the 
northeast ahead of the trough.  Consistent with model guidance, the 
track forecast has shifted farther west from the previous advisory 
and is in line with the consensus aids and mean ensemble track 
guidance. Further adjustments to the west may be necessary.
 
Strong northwesterly vertical wind shear is expected to
prevent significant strengthening in the short term. Shear is 
forecast to decrease a bit for a short period of time in the next 2 
to 3 days and could allow for some strengthening.  However, almost 
all of the guidance is showing a less conducive environment, and 
the NHC forecast reflects this trend, lying on the high end of 
model guidance but in line with HCCA.  The uncertainty is extremely 
large at the end of the forecast period as some models are now 
showing an extratropical transition due to the mid-latitude trough, 
but a lot depends on how strong Philippe eventually becomes, which 
has clearly not been very predictable during this storm's lifetime.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected across Barbuda and
Antigua beginning this evening while Philippe passes near and 
north of the area.  Interests elsewhere in the northern Leeward 
Islands should continue to monitor this system.
 
2. Heavy rainfall from Philippe could produce isolated to scattered
flash flooding over the northern Leeward Islands, particularly
across Barbuda and Antigua, through Tuesday.
