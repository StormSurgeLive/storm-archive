<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Philippe, located about 600 miles east of the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL91):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms have become a little more concentrated  <br/>
with an area of low pressure located roughly halfway between the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles. Environmental conditions <br/>
are forecast to be conducive for development, as long as this system <br/>
remains far enough removed from Tropical Storm Philippe to its west. <br/>
A tropical depression or storm is expected to form in the next day <br/>
or so while the system moves northwestward across the central <br/>
tropical Atlantic. Additional information on this system, including <br/>
gale warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the <br/>
National Weather Service. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

...INTERESTS IN THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS, VIRGIN ISLANDS, AND
PUERTO RICO SHOULD MONITOR ITS PROGRESS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.2N 54.5W
ABOUT 565 MI...910 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H

There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, the U.S and
British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico should monitor the progress
of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 18.2 North, longitude 54.5 West. Philippe is
moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A slow 
west-northwestward to northwestward motion is forecast during the 
next day or so, followed by a slower general westward motion by this 
weekend. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next day or so,
with slow weakening forecast this weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
primarily to the east of the center. Saildrone (1069) located well 
north-northeast of the center of Philippe has reported a peak 
one-minute wind of 40 mph (65 km/h) and a gust to 48 mph (78 km/h)

<title>Tropical Storm Philippe Forecast Discussion Number 19</title>

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 27 2023
 
Deep convection has persisted around the eastern portion of 
Philippe's circulation this evening, however there is not much 
evidence of curved bands.  The low-level center may have reformed or 
become slightly better defined just to the west of the main 
convective mass since the previous advisory.  There has been no 
recent microwave imagery to gain a better look at the cyclone's 
structure and scatterometer appears likely to miss the center this 
evening.  The latest subjective Dvorak intensity estimates were T3.0 
(45 kt) and T2.5 (35 kt) from TAFB and SAB, respectively.  The 
initial intensity is  held at 45 kt for this advisory, in deference 
to the earlier scatterometer data and latest TAFB estimate.
 
The track forecast for Philippe remains quite complicated, and it is 
very dependent on the future intensity and vertical depth of the 
cyclone.  The current disorganized structure of Philippe and its 
present environment of moderate southwesterly shear is likely to 
inhibit strengthening over the next couple of days. The main 
question is whether Philippe weakens and becomes more vertically 
shallow or if it maintains some vertical coherence during that time. 
If it becomes vertically shallow, Philippe is likely to move 
generally westward or west-southwestward within the low-level 
steering flow.  If it remains more vertically deep, the cyclone is 
likely to move little as it remains to the southeast of a mid-level 
ridge.  Another complicating factor is a disturbance (AL91) to 
Philippe's southeast.  The latest GFS run moves that system close 
enough to Philippe that binary interaction occurs between the two 
systems. However this run appears to have initialized Philippe 
stronger than it actually is, which may have led to the solution 
where Philippe remains the dominate system.  Meanwhile, the 
ECMWF weakens Philippe and keeps more separation between the two 
systems, taking a weaker Philippe westward or west-southwestward.  
The NHC forecast currently favors the latter scenario, but there is 
an unusually large amount of uncertainty in the track and intensity 
forecast.  In general, the guidance is a bit slower this cycle and 
the NHC forecast has been adjusted accordingly.  The new track 
forecast is not as slow as the consensus aids, but is a blend 
of the previous official forecast and the latest consensus models.  
It would not be surprising if additional adjustments to the track 
forecast are required in subsequent advisories. 
 
As mentioned above, moderate southwesterly shear and a slightly 
drier airmass ahead of Philippe are likely to inhibit significant 
convective organization of the cyclone at least during the next day 
or two.  That is likely to cause some gradual weakening, and the NHC 
intensity forecast follows that thinking and calls for the system to 
weaken during that time.  However, there is still a lot of 
uncertainty as to whether Philippe weakens and becomes a remnant low 
later in the period, or moves little and remains a tropical cyclone. 
The latest forecast maintains continuity from the previous few 
advisories and calls for Philippe to become a remnant low, but this 
is a low confidence forecast.
