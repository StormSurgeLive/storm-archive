Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 AM AST Wed Sep 27 2023
 
Visible, infrared and microwave imagery depicts that Philippe is a 
slightly better organized system this morning. A burst of deep 
convection continues near and east of the center. In addition,  
earlier AMSR and SSMI/S microwave passes show that a convective 
band has been developing on the eastern side of the circulation. 
However, visible satellite images within the past hour depict that 
the low-level center is becoming partially exposed on the western 
edge of the convection. Subjective and objective satellite 
intensity estimates have increased this cycle, with a TAFB Dvorak 
data-T number of 3.0, 45 kt. Given the developing banding feature 
and satellite intensity estimates, the initial intensity is raised 
to 45 kt for this advisory.  This is also in agreement with a 
recent ASCAT-B pass.
 
Philippe is expected to remain in a sheared environment 
over the next few days. However, the GFS SHIPS vertical wind shear 
forecast shows a slight decrease, which may allow  to the storm to
withhold convection near the low-level center a little longer than 
what was previously anticipated. Philippe is forecast to move into a 
slightly drier mid-level airmass in a few days, which may also 
inhibit the overall convective pattern. Some slight fluctuations in 
intensity may occur due to the pulsing convective nature of the 
system during the next few days, with an overall slow weakening 
trend later this weekend. The NHC intensity forecast was raised 
slightly given the initial higher intensity. There remains 
uncertainty in the intensity forecast and it is possible Philippe 
maintains its tropical cyclone status as it reaches the northern 
Leeward Islands.
 
The storm has not gained much latitude this morning and continues to 
move mainly westward at around 280/8 kt.  Philippe is currently 
being steered by the flow around a weak mid-level ridge and is 
expected to move west-northwestward over the next couple of days.  
In the latter part of the forecast period, the weakening and shallow 
system should turn toward the west-southwest. The track forecast is 
highly dependent on the intensity forecast, however.  The official 
track forecast has again been shifted southward in 3-5 days, but 
not as far south as the consensus aids.
