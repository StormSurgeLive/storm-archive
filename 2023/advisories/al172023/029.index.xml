Tropical Storm Philippe Advisory Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 AM AST Sat Sep 30 2023
 
...PHILIPPE MOVING SLOWLY SOUTHWESTWARD...
...AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTERS TO INVESTIGATE PHILIPPE LATER
TODAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.9N 56.3W
ABOUT 455 MI...735 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...SW OR 215 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, the U.S. and British
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of this
system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was 
located near latitude 16.9 North, longitude 56.3 West. Philippe is 
moving toward the southwest near 5 mph (7 km/h). A slow turn toward 
the west-southwest and west is expected through early Sunday, 
followed by a turn toward the northwest and north-northwest Sunday 
night through Tuesday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast during the next few days, and
Philippe could become a hurricane early next week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, and Puerto Rico through early next week. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 AM AST Sat Sep 30 2023
 
The satellite presentation of Philippe has not changed much this 
morning. The partially exposed low-level circulation lies on the 
western edge of a deep convective mass, as northwesterly shear 
continues to affect the storm's stucture. Recent UW-CIMSS objective 
estimates and subjective Dvorak classifications from TAFB and SAB 
have generally held steady, and so the initial intensity remains at 
45 kt for this advisory. The Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters 
are scheduled to investigate the system later today. 

The estimated initial motion of Philippe is southwestward (210/4 
kt). Philippe is not expected to move much during the next 12-24 h, 
although there is uncertainty even in the near term related to the 
extent of the interaction between Philippe and Tropical Storm Rina 
to its northeast. Most of the models show a slow and generally 
westward motion during the next day or so, which is reflected in 
the NHC forecast. Then, model spread increases regarding the timing 
of Philippe's turn toward the northwest and north early next week. 
Stronger model solutions (GFS, HAFS-A) depict an earlier turn along 
the eastern side of the guidance envelope, while weaker models 
(ECMWF, UKMET) show the storm making it west of 60W before turning. 
Given the greater-than-normal model spread, the NHC forecast remains 
near the TVCA and HCCA aids for this portion of the forecast, with 
a slight westward adjustment from the previous prediction. By days 
4-5, Philippe is forecast to move faster toward the north and 
northeast between a mid-level ridge over the central Atlantic and a 
deep-layer trough over the western Atlantic.  

Given the sheared structure of Philippe, only minor intensity 
fluctuations are expected during the next 12-24 h. Thereafter, the 
shear is generally forecast to decrease on Monday and Tuesday, 
although the magnitude remains at least somewhat dependent on how 
far west Philippe tracks. Based on our latest track forecast, it is 
assumed that the shear will relax enough to be conducive for some 
strengthening over the 29-29.5C SSTs, and this prediction shows 
Philippe becoming a hurricane by 60 h. Overall, the environment 
appears reasonably favorable for continued strengthening through 
days 4-5 as the cyclone moves into the subtropical Atlantic. The  
updated intensity forecast has been raised during this period to 
show additional strengthening, although it still lies below the 
IVCN and HCCA aids, so further adjustments could be necessary.

Tropical Storm Rina Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182023
1100 AM AST Sat Sep 30 2023

Satellite images show that Rina remains disorganized with any deep 
convection sheared off well southeast of the center.  Intensity 
estimates are dropping, and ASCAT just came in with maximum winds 
just above 35 kt, so the initial wind speed is set to 40 kt.  
Strong shear should continue near the cyclone until it dissipates 
in 2-3 days.  Model guidance is in relatively good agreement on 
this scenario, and the new intensity forecast is lower than before, 
showing remnant low status as the weekend closes.

Rina continues moving west-northwestward, now at 10 kt.  The storm 
should rotate northwestward and northward on the northern side of 
Philippe for the next couple of days.  Thereafter, a weakened Rina
is forecast to degenerate into a trough of low pressure as it moves 
into the subtropics.  The new track forecast is very similar to the 
last forecast, with no big changes to the guidance.
