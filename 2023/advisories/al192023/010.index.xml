<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Sean, located over the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
south-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands is producing limited and <br/>
disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity. However, the <br/>
environmental conditions are expected to become more conducive for <br/>
development of this system by early next week. A tropical depression <br/>
could form by the middle of next week while it moves westward or <br/>
west-northwestward at about 10 mph across the eastern and central <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Sean Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192023
500 AM AST Fri Oct 13 2023
 
Moderate westerly deep-layer shear continues over Sean this morning, 
and most of the associated deep convection is displaced to the east 
of Sean's center. Although the low-level circulation remains at 
least partially exposed in proxy-visible satellite images, new 
bursts of deep convection have recently developed closer to the 
center of Sean. It remains to be seen whether this activity will be 
persistent enough to support any additional strengthening. The 
latest objective and subjective satellite intensity estimates range 
from 30-45 kt, and a blend of these data support keeping the initial 
intensity at 40 kt.

Sean is moving west-northwestward (285 degrees) at 11 kt. The 
general track forecast reasoning has not changed. Sean should move 
west-northwestward to northwestward over the next few days while 
being steered by a weak subtropical ridge over the eastern and 
central Atlantic. There are no significant changes noted in the 
latest track guidance. The updated NHC forecast lies slightly to the 
left of the previous prediction, primarily the result of a more 
west-northwestward initial motion based on recent center fixes.
 
The various global and regional models suggest Sean is likely near 
or at its peak intensity. Although the shear could weaken some 
during the next couple of days, the convective structure of Sean is 
unlikely to improve much while the storm gains latitude and moves 
into a drier, more stable environment. The NHC forecast continues to 
show gradual weakening during the next few days, in good agreement 
with the latest multi-model consensus aids. The global models show 
an even faster rate of weakening, as the system becomes devoid of 
organized convection by early next week in both GFS and ECMWF 
model-simulated satellite imagery. Sean is still forecast to open 
into a trough and dissipate between 72-96 h.
