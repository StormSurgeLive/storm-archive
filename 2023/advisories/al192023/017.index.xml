<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Sean, located over the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure <br/>
located several hundred miles southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands <br/>
have become less organized since this morning.  However, <br/>
environmental conditions are forecast to become more conducive for <br/>
development, and a tropical depression or tropical storm is likely <br/>
to form within the next couple of days while the system moves <br/>
westward or west-northwestward across the central and western <br/>
tropical Atlantic.  Additional information on this system, including <br/>
gale warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the <br/>
National Weather Service. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Sean Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192023
1100 PM AST Sat Oct 14 2023
 
Deep convection continues to burst near Sean's center, and as a 
result, Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB remain T2.0/30 kt.  In 
addition, a recent ASCAT-B pass showed winds a little over 25 kt, 
and all these estimates support maintaining Sean as a 30-kt 
tropical depression.  With relatively low vertical shear, warm sea 
surface temperatures of 28-29 degrees Celsius, and an unstable 
atmosphere, the environment is just conducive enough for additional 
bursts of convection.  The biggest limiting factor is a lack of 
mid-level moisture, with relative humidities running about 50 
percent.  Consequently, the convection is likely to become less 
persistent and less organized, and global models indicate that 
Sean's small circulation should open up into a trough over the next 
day or two.  The NHC forecast shows Sean degenerating into a remnant 
low in 24 hours and then dissipating by 48 hours, but it's also 
possible that the system remains a tropical depression right up 
until it opens up into a trough.

Sean continues to move northwestward, or 305/7 kt.  As it becomes a 
weaker system, the depression is expected to become increasingly 
steered by lower-level ridging.  As a result, Sean is expected to 
turn west-northwestward overnight and then westward by early Monday, 
just before or as it degenerates into a trough.  The NHC track 
forecast is very close to the previous prediction and the latest 
TVCA multi-model consensus.
