Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Sun Oct 15 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Sean, located over the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located over the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic is producing some shower and thunderstorm activity.  <br/>
Although the environment may not support much development during <br/>
the next couple of days, conditions are expected to become more <br/>
conducive thereafter, and a tropical depression is still likely to <br/>
form mid to late week while moving westward or west-northwestward <br/>
across the central and western tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

Post-Tropical Cyclone Sean Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192023
1100 PM AST Sun Oct 15 2023
 
A few showers and thunderstorms continue to pulse in association 
with Sean, but the activity can no longer be considered organized 
or persistent.  Dvorak final-T numbers from TAFB and SAB have either 
been T1.0 or Too Weak to Classify for the past 18 hours, and as a 
result, Sean has degenerated into a remnant low.  Maximum winds are 
estimated to be 25 kt and are expected to gradually weaken during 
the next day or so.  The remnant low is forecast to turn westward 
overnight, and global models indicate that the circulation should 
open up into a trough by 36 hours, if not sooner.  The remnant 
trough is likely to pass near or north of the northern Leeward 
Islands around midweek.

This is the last advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center on 
this system.  Additional information on this system can be found in 
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under 
AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
