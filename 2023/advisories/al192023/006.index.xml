Tropical Depression Sean Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192023
500 AM AST Thu Oct 12 2023
 
Sean remains a sheared, poorly organized tropical cyclone. Recent 
AMSR2 passive microwave images show the surface circulation lies 
well to the west of the associated deep convection. The lackluster 
satellite presentation of Sean has resulted in decreasing subjective 
Dvorak data-T numbers from TAFB and SAB, which supports keeping the 
system a tropical depression. The initial intensity is held at 30 
kt, consistent with the ASCAT data from yesterday evening. 
 
The depression is moving west-northwestward at 300/10 kt. A weak 
low- to mid-level ridge to the north and northeast of Sean should 
steer the cyclone to the west-northwest and northwest through early 
next week. A slight rightward adjustment was made to the NHC track 
forecast to reflect the latest multi-model consensus trends. But 
otherwise, the updated forecast is similar to the previous 
prediction. 

Moderate to strong westerly shear is expected to persist over the 
depression for the next day or two. By the time the shear relents, 
simulated satellite images from the GFS and ECMWF models suggest 
that Sean could struggle to sustain organized convection near its 
center within a drier and more convergent upper-level environment. 
While small intensity fluctuations cannot be ruled out during the 
next couple of days, the NHC intensity forecast follows the HCCA and 
IVCN aids and keeps Sean a depression through 60 h. Sean is forecast 
to degenerate to a post-tropical remnant low soon thereafter and 
dissipate to a trough by day 4, although this could occur even 
sooner if the cyclone remains poorly organized.
