Tropical Depression Sean Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192023
500 PM AST Sat Oct 14 2023
 
Sean has had another deep convective burst near the center of 
circulation this afternoon. The system continues to fend off dry air 
with these convective burst from time to time. Latest subjective 
Dvorak intensity satellite estimates are T2.0 from both TAFB and 
SAB. Using these estimates and the recent burst of convection 
the initial intensity for this advisory remains 30 kt.
 
Sean is moving northwestward or 310 degrees at about 8 kt. The 
system will continue to move northwestward today and tonight around 
the southwestern periphery of a mid-level ridge. On Sunday, a turn 
toward the west-northwest is anticipated as Sean is forecast to 
weaken into a more shallow vortex, and thus will be steered by the 
low-level flow. This turn is dependent on just how quickly Sean 
weakens. The NHC forecast is an update of the previous one, with no 
real changes to the forecast track.
 
Although Sean is moving into a drier mid-level airmass, low wind 
shear and warm sea surface temperatures have allowed the system to 
maintain convective bursts the past day or so. Along the forecast 
track, the environment is forecast to become increasingly drier and 
more stable. This should cause Sean to further weaken the next 
couple of days.  Global models continue to depict that Sean will 
struggle to produce deep convection tonight and into Sunday. The 
system is forecast to be devoid of convection and become a remnant 
low in about 24 hours, and then the circulation is expected to open 
up into a trough and dissipate in about 60 hours.
