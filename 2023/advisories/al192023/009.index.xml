<title>Tropical Storm Sean Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Tropical Storm Sean Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192023
1100 PM AST Thu Oct 12 2023
 
Sean continues to be a sheared tropical cyclone.  The exposed 
low-level center is gradually becoming more displaced from the 
deepest convection in the northeast quadrant.  Surprisingly, 
satellite wind data that partially captured the center of the storm 
revealed winds of 38-39 kt.  Therefore, despite Sean's ragged 
appearance, the initial intensity is raised to 40 kt for this 
advisory.
 
The cyclone is accelerating west-northwestward at an estimated 
300/12 kt.  Sean is being steered by a weak ridge centered over the 
eastern tropical Atlantic.  This ridge is expected to build westward 
and keep Sean on a west-northwestward to northwestward track with a 
decrease in forward speed through the forecast period.  The 
guidance envelope is decently clustered, and the latest advisory 
lies close to the various consensus aids and just south of the 
previous track forecast.
 
Environmental conditions are generally not conducive for additional
strengthening.  Persistent moderate-to-strong deep-layer vertical
wind shear and an increasingly dry airmass should inhibit further
development of the storm.  The model guidance envelope shows Sean
gradually weakening for the next couple of days.  By the end of the
weekend, the storm is expected to lose its convective organization
and become a remnant low.  The latest NHC intensity prediction has
been slightly raised in the near-term forecast hours based on
Sean's initial intensity.  Dissipation is still anticipated within
4 days.
