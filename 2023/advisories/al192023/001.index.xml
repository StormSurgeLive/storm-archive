Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Tue Oct 10 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL92):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a broad area of low <br/>
pressure located several hundred miles southwest of the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands continue to show signs of organization.  Environmental  <br/>
conditions appear conducive for additional development, and a <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form within the next day or two <br/>
while the system moves west-northwestward or northwestward across <br/>
the eastern and central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern Gulf of Mexico (AL93):<br/>
An area of low pressure located over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico <br/>
is producing limited and disorganized shower and thunderstorm <br/>
activity.  This system is forecast to merge with a developing <br/>
frontal boundary over the western Gulf of Mexico early Wednesday, <br/>
and tropical cyclone formation is not expected.  Regardless of <br/>
tropical cyclone development, the system is forecast to produce <br/>
gale-force winds over portions of the northern Gulf of Mexico by <br/>
tomorrow, and potentially heavy rainfall along the Gulf Coast by the <br/>
latter portion of this week. For more information, see products from <br/>
your local National Weather Service office, and high seas forecasts <br/>
issued by the National Weather Service. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
<br/>

Tropical Depression Nineteen Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192023
1100 PM AST Tue Oct 10 2023
 
The area of disturbed weather (AL92) that NHC has been monitoring
the past several days has acquired enough organization for the
system to be designated as a tropical depression.  Although the
ASCAT instrument has missed the system during the past day or so,
geostationary satellite imagery and an earlier SSMIS microwave
overpass suggests that the circulation has become better defined.
Subjective satellite intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were T2.5
(35 kt), but given the loose nature of the banding, the initial
wind speed is set at 30 kt for this advisory.
 
Given the large and sprawling current structure of the system,
strengthening is likely to be slow to occur during the next day or
so while it remains within low to moderate shear conditions.
After that time, the cyclone is forecast to approach an upper-level
trough over the central tropical Atlantic which will likely cause an
increase in southwesterly vertical wind shear.  As a result, little
change in strength is shown during the middle portion of the
forecast period.  Late in the period, decreasing mid-level humidity
is likely to cause additional weakening.  The ECMWF and GFS models 
show the system losing convection over the weekend, whereas the 
UKMET and Canadian keep the system a tropical cyclone for longer. 
The NHC forecast shows weakening by day 4 and degeneration into a 
remnant low by day 5, but it is possible that the system loses  
tropical cyclone status sooner.
 
The depression is moving westward at a somewhat uncertain 11 kt. A 
mid-level ridge located to the northeast of the cyclone should 
steer it west-northwestward to northwestward through Friday.
Very late in the forecast period, a bend back toward the 
west-northwest could occur as the cyclone weakens and is steered by 
the low-level trade wind flow. The models do not differ much on 
the overall scenario, but the GFS takes a somewhat stronger system 
more poleward within the first few days, while the ECMWF is faster 
and farther west. This first NHC track on the depression lies 
close to the various consensus aids.
