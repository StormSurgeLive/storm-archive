NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Fri Oct 13 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Sean, located over the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
south-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands continues to produce <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Environmental conditions are <br/>
expected to become more conducive for development by the end of the <br/>
weekend while the disturbance begins to move westward across the <br/>
central tropical Atlantic. Additional development is expected after <br/>
that, and a tropical depression is likely to form during the early <br/>
to middle portion of next week as the system moves steadily westward <br/>
across the central and western tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Sean Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192023
500 PM AST Fri Oct 13 2023
 
Sean's satellite appearance continues to deteriorate this afternoon. 
Convection has waned with warming cloud tops to the east of the 
exposed low-level center. Sean is noticeably struggling with drier 
air impacting the system and the continued westerly wind shear. Any 
convection that tries to develop near the center is sheared off and 
dissipates. Satellite intensity estimates this afternoon range from 
25 to 40 kt. The initial intensity is held at 35 kt for this 
advisory, but this could be generous given the waning convection the 
last several hours.
 
As Sean moves through the drier and more stable airmass, further 
weakening is anticipated. Simulated satellite from the ECMWF and GFS 
depict that Sean may have occasional burst of convection the next 
day or so, but will continue to become less organized. This should 
cause Sean to become a post-tropical remnant low this weekend. 
However, recent trends suggest this could occur as early as 
tomorrow. The NHC intensity forecast is similar to the previous 
advisory, near the consensus intensity aids. 
 
The tropical storm has continued to move west-northwestward today, 
around 290 at 10 kt. A turn northwestward has been forecast to occur 
today, but the center has continued west-northwestward, which has 
resulted in a westward shift of the NHC forecast track. The forecast 
still calls for the northwestward motion to begin later this evening 
and continue over the next day or so. As Sean becomes a remnant low 
and further weakens, the system will turn more west-northwestward 
again and dissipate into an open trough in a few days.
