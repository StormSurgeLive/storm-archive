Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Fri Oct 13 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Sean, located over the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
south-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands continues to produce a few <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Only gradual development of <br/>
this disturbance is expected during the next couple of days. <br/>
Environmental conditions are expected to become more conducive for <br/>
development by the end of the weekend while the disturbance begins <br/>
to move westward across the central tropical Atlantic. Additional <br/>
development is expected after that, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form during the early to middle portion of next week as <br/>
the system moves steadily westward across the central and western <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

...SEAN WEAKENING...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.6N 41.7W
ABOUT 1180 MI...1905 KM W OF THE CABO VERDE ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 285 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1006 MB...29.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Sean was 
located near latitude 14.6 North, longitude 41.7 West. Sean is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). A turn 
toward the northwest at a similar forward speed is expected today. 
Sean is then expected to gradually slow down, turning back toward 
the west-northwest by Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Additional weakening is anticipated. Sean will likely 
become a post-tropical remnant low over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Tropical Storm Sean Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192023
1100 AM AST Fri Oct 13 2023
 
Sean's structure and overall satellite appearance have begun to 
degrade. Deep convection associated with the tropical storm is 
limited in both strength and coverage as a result of dry surrounding 
air and continued westerly wind shear, and has decreased noticeably 
in the last few hours. Recent intensity estimates range from about 
25 to 45 kt, but are generally lower than they were for the previous 
advisory. The initial intensity is therefore lowered to 35 kt for 
this advisory.
 
Continued gradual weakening is expected for the next several days as 
Sean moves through a stable environment. Simulated satellite output 
from several models suggests that Sean may continue to produce 
occasional bursts of convection for another day or two, but these 
should become less organized in time. This should cause Sean to 
become a post-tropical remnant low by Sunday, but recent trends 
suggest this could happen much sooner. Sean's wind's should 
gradually decrease as its convection wanes, and it is forecast to 
open into a trough by Monday.
 
The tropical storm has continued to move west-northwestward for the 
last few hours. A turn northwestward is forecasted by every 
available dynamical model and is expected to begin at any time, but 
since Sean hasn't turned yet, the NHC track forecast had to be 
adjusted westward again with this advisory. Otherwise, no 
significant changes were made to the forecast reasoning, with the 
models in good agreement on Sean's track for the next few days until 
it dissipates.
