<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Sean, located over the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands is producing disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms.  While this system has become less <br/>
organized since yesterday, the overall environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to become more conducive for development, and a tropical <br/>
depression or tropical storm is still likely to form within the <br/>
next few days while the system moves westward or west-northwestward <br/>
across the central and western tropical Atlantic.  Additional <br/>
information on this system, including gale warnings, can be found in <br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and <br/>

Tropical Depression Sean Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192023
1100 AM AST Sun Oct 15 2023
 
Satellite imagery depicts that Sean has regained convection once
again this morning. Visible imagery shows that the low-level center
is displaced on the northern side of the recent convective burst.
The latest Dvorak Current Intensity (CI) from TAFB is T2.0/30 kt,
with the trend of the data-T numbers continuing to fall. A recent
scatterometer pass indicated peak winds around 20-25 kt. Given the
satellite-derived winds and lowering Data-T Dvorak intensity
estimates, the initial intensity is lowered to 25 kt for this
advisory.
 
Sean continues to produce intermittent convective bursts as it
remains in a low vertical wind shear environment over warm
sea surface temperatures. However, dry mid-level air will
eventually cause the convection to become less persistent and lose
organization. As the system decays, Sean should become a remnant
low, which could occur tonight. The NHC official forecast is
similar to the previous, although it is also possible, that Sean
remains a depression until the circulation opens up into a trough.
 
The depression has turned west-northwest with an estimated motion of
290/9 kt. As the system weakens and becomes vertically shallow, a
turn more westward is forecast within the low-level steering flow.
The NHC track is similar to the previous advisory and is near the
corrected and simple consensus aids.
