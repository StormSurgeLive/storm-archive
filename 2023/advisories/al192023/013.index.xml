<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Sean, located over the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity has been increasing near an area <br/>
of low pressure located several hundred miles southwest of the Cabo <br/>
Verde Islands, although recent satellite images indicate that the <br/>
surface circulation remains broad.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
expected to become more conducive for development during the next <br/>
few days, and a tropical depression is likely to form during the <br/>
early to middle portion of next week as the system moves westward <br/>
or west-northwestward across the central and western tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>

...SEAN MOVING SLOWLY OVER THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.1N 42.9W
ABOUT 1260 MI...2025 KM W OF THE CABO VERDE ISLANDS
ABOUT 1355 MI...2175 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1006 MB...29.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Sean was
located near latitude 15.1 North, longitude 42.9 West. Sean is
moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A turn toward
the northwest is expected soon, and this motion should continue for
the next day or so. Sean is then expected to turn back toward the
west-northwest by Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Weakening is anticipated, and Sean will likely become a 
post-tropical remnant low over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Tropical Storm Sean Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192023
1100 PM AST Fri Oct 13 2023
 
Sean is still showing signs of life with a recent burst of
convection in the northeast quadrant obscuring the surface
circulation.  Unfortunately, no new satellite surface wind data is
available this evening. Objective and subjective Dvorak estimates
range between 25-45 kt. The initial intensity is held at a possibly
generous 35 kt, which is closest to the TAFB final T-number of T2.5.
 
The storm has noticeably slowed since the last advisory, with an
estimated motion of 290/7 kt.  The model guidance continues to
insist Sean will turn northwestward on the southwest side of a weak
ridge over the eastern Atlantic.  However, this has yet to occur.
As the cyclone weakens and becomes more shallow, it is expected to
bend back to west-northwest.  Once again, the latest NHC track
forecast was shifted south of the previous prediction, and favors
the southern side of the guidance envelope due to the recent
northward bias of the models.
 
There have been no changes to the official intensity forecast.
Sean is expected to continue to weaken in the relatively hostile
atmospheric conditions and become a remnant low later this weekend.
Most model guidance shows the storm opening into a trough early
next week, and the NHC forecast shows dissipation on Monday.
