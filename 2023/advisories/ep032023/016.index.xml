DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM HST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Calvin was located 
near latitude 14.7 North, longitude 129.0 West. Calvin is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h). A westward to

the next several days. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts. Weakening is forecast through early next week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 975 mb (28.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------

Hurricane Calvin Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032023
500 AM HST Sat Jul 15 2023
 
The ragged eye of Calvin has been apparent at times in conventional 
satellite imagery this morning, but overall it has become less 
defined. Overnight GMI and more recent SSMIS passive microwave data 
show that some deep convection has eroded within the eastern portion 
of the eyewall. The vortex also appears somewhat tilted with height, 
as the 37 GHz low-level center was displaced a bit to the south of 
the 89 GHz mid-level one. A blend of the latest objective UW-CIMSS 
satellite estimates and subjective Dvorak classifications from TAFB 
and SAB support an initial intensity of 85 kt.    

The weakening trend that began last night is expected to continue 
for the next several days due to Calvin moving over cooler waters 
and into a drier and more stable environment. Also, southwesterly 
deep-layer shear is forecast to increase from 60-120 h as the 
cyclone traverses the central Pacific. This will adversely affect 
its ability to sustain organized convection, although to what extent 
is still somewhat uncertain. Regardless of its tropical or 
post-tropical status, Calvin appears likely to maintain some 
tropical-storm-force winds in the northern portion of its 
circulation through 96 h. Overall, few changes were made to the 
updated NHC intensity forecast, which closely follows the 
multi-model HCCA and IVCN aids. The global model fields suggest the 
system could open up into a trough soon after day 5.

Calvin is moving quickly west-northwestward at 285/14 kt. With a 
well-established mid-level ridge over the eastern Pacific, this 
general motion is expected to continue through the forecast period. 
This course brings Calvin into the central Pacific basin (west of 
140W) by Monday morning and toward the Hawaiian Islands on Tuesday 
and Wednesday. The guidance is reasonably well clustered on a track 
near or over the Big Island of Hawaii, but any potential impacts 
will be dictated by the track details that are still quite 
uncertain at this time. The updated NHC track forecast is a bit 
faster and slightly south of the previous one at days 3-5, in 
agreement with the latest consensus aids and near the center of the 
guidance envelope.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Calvin is forecast to move across the central Pacific Ocean and
approach the Hawaiian Islands early next week. It is too early to
determine the exact location and magnitude of potential impacts
given uncertainties in the track, intensity, and structure of Calvin
as it approaches the islands. Interests in Hawaii should closely
monitor the latest forecast updates.
