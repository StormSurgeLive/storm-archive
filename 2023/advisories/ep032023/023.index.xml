MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Hawaii should monitor the progress of Calvin. A
Tropical Storm Watch may be required for portions of the main
Hawaiian Islands on Monday.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM HST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Calvin was
located near latitude 16.7 North, longitude 139.7 West. Calvin is
moving toward the west near 18 mph (30 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue during the next several days. On the
forecast track, the center of Calvin will move into the central
Pacific basin early Monday and approach the Hawaiian
Islands on Tuesday and early Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some additional weakening is forecast during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Calvin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP3 and WMO header WTPZ43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/miatcdep3.shtml
 
RAINFALL: From Tuesday night into Thursday, storm total rainfall
amounts of 4-7 inches are possible along windward areas of the Big
Island of Hawaii, with lower amounts (1-4 inches) expected elsewhere
in the state.  This rainfall could lead to localized flash flooding
and mudslides.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Calvin are expected to begin reaching the 
Hawaiian Islands during the next couple of days.  These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane 
Center on this system. The next Public advisory will be issued by 
the Central Pacific Hurricane Center beginning at 5 am HST Monday 
under AWIPS header HFOTCPCP1 and WMO header WTPA31 PHFO, and on the 
web at hurricanes.gov.

Tropical Storm Calvin Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032023
1100 PM HST Sun Jul 16 2023
 

Calvin continues to slowly weaken this evening, with warming cloud 
tops and an asymmetric convective pattern, mainly on the eastern 
portion of the system. Satellite imagery depicts that banding 
features have also become less defined. Based on a blend of 
subjective Dvorak estimates from SAB and TAFB, as well as ADT and 
AiDT values from CIMMS, the intensity is lowered to 45 kt for this 
advisory.

Calvin is currently moving over cool SSTs of around 24 degrees C, 
and in a dry and stable environment. In about 24 hours, the ocean 
temperatures will slightly increase as the system approaches Hawaii, 
and many models suggest that Calvin will still be producing winds 
near tropical-storm-force when it nears the Hawaiian Islands. As the 
cyclone reaches the Hawaiian Islands, southerly vertical wind shear 
will increase and GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite images show most 
of the convection displaced on the northern side of the semi-circle. 
The increased vertical wind shear and drier air will cause Calvin to 
weaken after it passes the island chain and to dissipate by 96 
hours. The intensity forecast lies near the model consensus and is 
similar to the previous official NHC forecast.
 
A mid-level ridge to the north of Calvin should maintain a generally 
westward motion for the next few days.  On this track, Calvin will 
be entering the central Pacific basin early tomorrow morning, and 
move near or over the Big Island of Hawaii early Wednesday.  It 
should then continue westward until it dissipates. The official 
forecast is near the previous NHC forecast and lies close to the 
model consensus guidance.

This is the last forecast/advisory issued by the National Hurricane 
Center on Calvin. Future information on this system can be found 
in the forecast/advisories issued by the Central Pacific Hurricane 
Center beginning at 1500 UTC. 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Calvin is forecast to approach the Hawaiian Islands during the 
next couple of days, bringing the potential for heavy rainfall and 
dangerous surf and rip currents. A Tropical Storm Watch could be 
issued for portions of the main Hawaiian Islands on Monday.
