1100 AM PDT Sun Jul 16 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
downgraded Tropical Storm Calvin, located more than 1300 miles east <br/>
of Hilo, Hawaii. <br/>
<br/>
South of Southwestern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure could form well to the south or <br/>
southwest of the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next <br/>
several days. Development of this system appears unlikely as it <br/>
moves generally west-northwestward over the central portion of the <br/>
eastern Pacific basin. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Calvin Advisory Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032023
1100 AM HST Sun Jul 16 2023
 
...CALVIN MOVING WESTWARD TOWARD THE CENTRAL PACIFIC BASIN...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM HST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.1N 136.3W
ABOUT 1260 MI...2025 KM E OF HILO HAWAII
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 280 DEGREES AT 16 MPH...26 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...996 MB...29.42 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Hawaii should monitor the progress of Calvin. A
Tropical Storm Watch may be required for portions of the main
Hawaiian Islands later today.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM HST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Calvin was 
located near latitude 16.1 North, longitude 136.3 West. Calvin is 
moving toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue during the next several days. On the 
forecast track, the center of Calvin will move into the central 
Pacific basin late tonight or early Monday and approach the Hawaiian 
Islands on Tuesday and early Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Some additional weakening is forecast during the next few 
days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Calvin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP3 and WMO header WTPZ43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/miatcdep3.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Storm total rainfall amounts of 4-6 inches are possible
along windward areas of the Big Island of Hawaii on Wednesday and
Thursday, with lower amounts (1-3 inches) expected elsewhere in the
state. This rainfall could lead to localized flash flooding and
mudslides.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Calvin are expected to begin reaching the
Hawaiian Islands during the next couple of days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM HST.

Tropical Storm Calvin Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032023
1100 AM HST Sun Jul 16 2023
 
The satellite presentation of Calvin has not changed much since the 
last advisory. Satellite images show a partially exposed low-level 
circulation with a small area of moderate to deep convection near 
the center. Satellite intensity estimates continue to fall, and a 
blend of the latest Dvorak final-T and current intensity estimates 
from TAFB and SAB support lowering the intensity to 55 kt. 

Continued weakening is expected as Calvin moves over 24C SSTs and 
into a drier, more stable environment during the next couple of 
days. The cyclone could cease producing organized convection during 
this time. Although environmental and oceanic conditions remain 
marginal on its approach to Hawaii, there is still support in GFS, 
ECMWF, and HAFS model-simulated satellite imagery for some new 
bursts of convection as Calvin moves closer to the islands. So, the 
NHC forecast keeps Calvin a tropical cyclone through 72 h, although 
post-tropical status could occur sooner than forecast. Regardless, 
the cyclone should still be producing some tropical-storm-force 
winds in its northern semicircle upon its closest approach to 
Hawaii, especially given the storm's fast forward motion. 

There has been no change to the track forecast reasoning. A 
mid-level ridge over the eastern Pacific is expected to steer Calvin 
generally westward into the central Pacific basin late tonight or 
early Monday and toward the Hawaiian Islands on Tuesday. The NHC 
forecast shows the center of Calvin passing near or over the Big 
Island of Hawaii early Wednesday, then continuing westward and 
becoming post-tropical on Thursday before dissipating. The guidance 
envelope has trended slightly southward this cycle, but little 
change was required to the NHC forecast as it still lies near the 
latest HFIP corrected consensus approach (HCCA) aid.

While the exact storm track near Hawaii is still uncertain, there is 
potential for portions of the state to experience some heavy 
rainfall, dangerous surf and rip current conditions, and minor wind 
impacts from Calvin. A Tropical Storm Watch may be required for 
portions of the main Hawaiian Islands later today.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Calvin is forecast to approach the Hawaiian Islands during the 
next couple of days or so, bringing the potential for heavy 
rainfall and dangerous surf and rip current conditions. A Tropical 
Storm Watch could be issued for portions of the main Hawaiian 
Islands later today.
