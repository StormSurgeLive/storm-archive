moving toward the west-northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h) and this
general motion is expected to continue during the next few days. On 
the forecast track, the center of Calvin will move into the central 
Pacific basin overnight Sunday into Monday morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts. Weakening is forecast to continue the next several days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles
(165 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 982 mb (29.00 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Calvin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP3 and WMO header WTPZ43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/miatcdep3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Calvin are expected to begin reaching the
Hawaiian Islands in a couple of days. These swells are likely to 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please

Hurricane Calvin Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032023
1100 PM HST Sat Jul 15 2023
 
The cloud pattern and overall organization of Calvin has been 
deteriorating this evening.  The eye and eyewall are unraveling and 
opening up on the western side. Dry air entrainment and cool water 
temperatures are also causing the convective banding to diminish 
with cloud tops warming and the inner core dissipating. Subjective 
Dvorak estimates, as well as CIMMS ADT and AiDT estimates, have come 
down with this advisory ranging from 55 kt to 78 kt. Based on these 
data, the initial intensity is lowered to 70 kt.
 
Calvin is currently moving over cooler SSTs near 25C and will 
continue to be over even cooler water temps the next 24-36 hours. 
Calvin is also moving into a drier mid-level airmass and a more 
stable environment.  Given the current satellite trends and the 
environment Calvin is beginning to encounter, weakening is forecast 
for the remainder of the period. However, the system is still likely 
to continue to have bursts of convection as it approaches the 
Hawaiian Islands in a few days.  Regardless of how much convection 
is present, it appears likely that Calvin will maintain tropical 
storm force winds as it passes near the Big Island of Hawaii.  After 
it passes Hawaii, stronger shear should cause the cyclone to 
degenerate to a remnant low pressure area or trough.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be 285/15 kt. A westward to 
west-northwestward motion will continue through the forecast period 
as the cyclone remains steered by a mid-level ridge over the eastern 
Pacific. On the forecast track, Calvin is forecast to cross 140W and 
enter the central Pacific basin Sunday night or early Monday 
morning and approach the Hawaiian Islands on Tuesday into early 
Wednesday.  There remains some cross-track spread in the models, so 
while the new forecast track calls for Calvin to pass close to the 
Big Island of Hawaii it remains unclear exactly how it will track 
relative to the island.  The new forecast track has only minor 
adjustments from the previous track.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Calvin is forecast to move across the central Pacific Ocean and 
approach the Hawaiian Islands within the next few days. Interests in 
Hawaii should closely monitor the latest forecast updates and a 
Tropical Storm Watch could be issued for portions of the main 
Hawaiian Islands late Sunday.
