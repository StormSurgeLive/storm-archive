DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK

spreading over Hawaii County starting this evening.

Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Calvin is expected to remain a tropical storm over the next 36 
hours, and then will weaken quickly afterward.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area starting this evening. Persons in Hawaii County should
complete preparations for tropical storm force wind impacts
during daylight hours prior to the onset of tropical storm
conditions.

RAINFALL: From later today into Thursday, storm total rainfall
amounts of 4-8 inches, with maximum amounts of 10 inches are
possible, mainly along the windward and southeast flank of the Big
Island of Hawaii. Storm total rainfall amounts of 3-6 inches are
expected on the windward areas of Maui, and 2-4 inches elsewhere in
the state. This rainfall could lead to localized flash flooding and
mudslides.

SURF: Swells generated by Calvin are expected to begin spreading
across the main Hawaiian Islands later today and tonight. This
will lead to a rapid increase in surf along east facing shores,
with high surf continuing into Wednesday. This elevated surf will
likely cause life-threatening conditions along exposed shorelines.
Please consult products from your local weather office for details.
