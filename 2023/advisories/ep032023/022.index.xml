<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>

<br/>
South of Southwestern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure could form well to the south or <br/>
southwest of the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next <br/>
few days. Development of this system appears unlikely as it <br/>
moves generally west-northwestward over the central portion of the <br/>
eastern Pacific basin. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...998 MB...29.47 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Hawaii should monitor the progress of Calvin. A
Tropical Storm Watch may be required for portions of the main
Hawaiian Islands tonight.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM HST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Calvin was
located near latitude 16.4 North, longitude 137.9 West.  Calvin is
moving toward the west near 17 mph (28 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue during the next several days.  On the
forecast track, the center of Calvin will move into the central
Pacific basin late tonight or early Monday and approach the Hawaiian
Islands on Tuesday and early Wednesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some additional weakening is forecast during the next few days.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Calvin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP3 and WMO header WTPZ43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/miatcdep3.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Storm total rainfall amounts of 4-7 inches are possible
along windward areas of the Big Island of Hawaii from Tuesday night 
into Thursday, with lower amounts (1-4 inches) expected elsewhere in 
the state.  This rainfall could lead to localized flash flooding 
and mudslides.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Calvin are expected to begin reaching the
Hawaiian Islands during the next couple of days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM HST.

Tropical Storm Calvin Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032023
500 PM HST Sun Jul 16 2023

Calvin is slowly weakening, with diminishing deep convection mainly 
over the eastern portion of the circulation.  Convective banding 
features have become ill-defined.  The current intensity estimate 
is reduced to 50 kt, based on a blend of subjective Dvorak 
estimates from SAB and TAFB along with objective SATCON estimates 
from UW-CIMSS.

Calvin is traversing SSTs of around 24 deg C, and although water 
temperatures should increase slightly while the cyclone approaches 
Hawaii, drier mid-level air as well as increasingly strong vertical 
shear should cause gradual weakening over the next couple of days.  
Nonetheless, the dynamical guidance, such as the HAFS and GFS 
models, suggests that Calvin will still be producing winds near 
tropical-storm-force, at least over its northern semicircle, when it 
nears the Hawaiian Islands.  The official intensity forecast is 
similar to the previous one and is close to the model consensus.

The official track forecast and its reasoning are basically 
unchanged from the previous advisory.  A mid-level ridge to the 
north of the tropical cyclone should maintain a generally westward 
motion for the next few days.  On this track, Calvin should 
enter the central Pacific basin soon, and move near or over the 
Big Island of Hawaii early Wednesday.  It should then continue 
westward, becoming post-tropical on Thursday before dissipating. 
The official forecast remains close to the latest NOAA corrected 
consensus guidance.
 
While the exact storm track near Hawaii is still uncertain, there is
potential for portions of the state to experience some heavy
rainfall, dangerous surf and rip current conditions, along with 
minor wind impacts from Calvin. A Tropical Storm Watch may be 
required for portions of the main Hawaiian Islands tonight.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Calvin is forecast to approach the Hawaiian Islands during the
next couple of days or so, bringing the potential for heavy
rainfall and dangerous surf and rip current conditions. A Tropical
Storm Watch could be issued for portions of the main Hawaiian
Islands tonight.
