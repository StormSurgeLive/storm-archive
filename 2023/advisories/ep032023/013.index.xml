DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM HST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Calvin was 
located near latitude 13.8 North, longitude 124.6 West. Calvin is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h). This general 
motion is expected to continue for the next several days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 125 mph (205 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Calvin is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Weakening is forecast to 
commence tomorrow and continue through early next week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 955 mb (28.20 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Calvin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP3 and WMO header WTPZ43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/miatcdep3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Calvin are expected to reach the Hawaiian
Islands early next week. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult

Hurricane Calvin Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032023
1100 AM HST Fri Jul 14 2023
 
The satellite appearance of Calvin remains impressive this 
afternoon. Its well-defined eye is surrounded by a ring of deep, 
cold convective cloud tops, and visible satellite imagery shows 
healthy upper-level anticyclonic outflow in all quadrants of the 
hurricane. While some drier mid-level air appears to be wrapping 
around the southern and eastern portions of the circulation, 
Calvin's inner core still appears intact at this time. The various 
objective and subjective satellite estimates range from 106-115 kt, 
and the initial intensity is raised to 110 kt for this advisory. 
Some of the initial wind radii values were adjusted based on a 
recently processed 1402 UTC RCM-3 synthetic aperture radar overpass 
over Calvin.
 
Although some small intensity fluctuations cannot be ruled out in 
the near term, Calvin is likely near its peak intensity. The 
hurricane is expected to move over cooler waters tomorrow and into a 
drier, more stable environment through early next week. Calvin 
should also encounter some increased southwesterly vertical wind 
shear later in the forecast period. Therefore, weakening is forecast 
to begin tomorrow and continue into next week. The convective 
structure of Calvin later in the forecast period is a source of 
uncertainty, with the hurricane models (HAFS-A/B) showing more of a 
TC-like structure while the global models (GFS and ECMWF) show it 
almost devoid of convection. For now, the forecast does not show 
Calvin becoming post-tropical until day 5. The latest intensity 
forecast remains on the high end of the guidance envelope through 48 
h, then closely follows the multi-model consensus aids thereafter.
 
The hurricane is moving west-northwestward at 285/14 kt. This
general motion will continue for the next several days as Calvin is
steered by a mid-level ridge that extends westward across the
eastern subtropical Pacific. Once again, the track models are in
good agreement on this scenario. The updated NHC forecast is very
similar to the previous one, but just a bit slower at days 3-5
based on the latest model consensus trends. Calvin is expected to
cross 140W and move into the central Pacific basin by early Monday
morning, then approach the Hawaiian Islands on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Calvin is forecast to move across the central Pacific Ocean and
approach the Hawaiian Islands early next week. It is too early to
determine the exact location and magnitude of potential impacts
given uncertainties in the track, intensity, and structure of Calvin
as it approaches the islands. Interests in Hawaii should closely
monitor the latest forecast updates.
