...CALVIN NOW A TROPICAL STORM...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM HST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.0N 134.8W
ABOUT 1355 MI...2185 KM E OF HILO HAWAII
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...70 MPH...110 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 285 DEGREES AT 16 MPH...26 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Hawaii should monitor the progress of Calvin. A
Tropical Storm Watch may be required for portions of the main
Hawaiian Islands late Sunday.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM HST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Calvin was 
located near latitude 16.0 North, longitude 134.8 West. Calvin is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h). A westward 
to west-northwestward motion at a similar or slightly faster forward 
speed is expected during the next few days. On the forecast track, 
the center of Calvin will move into the central Pacific basin late 
tonight or early Monday morning and approach the Hawaiian Islands on 
Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Weakening is forecast to continue during the next 
few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 993 mb (29.33 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Calvin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP3 and WMO header WTPZ43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/miatcdep3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Calvin are expected to begin reaching the
Hawaiian Islands during the next couple of days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM HST.

Tropical Storm Calvin Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032023
500 AM HST Sun Jul 16 2023
 
The cloud pattern of Calvin has further deteriorated this morning. 
The center is now exposed, and cloud tops have warmed over much of 
the circulation with only a small area of moderate to deep 
convection noted to the east of the center. The objective and 
subjective satellite intensity estimates continue to quickly 
decline, with a blend of the recent data suggesting that Calvin is 
no longer a hurricane. Based on these data and its poor satellite 
structure, the initial intensity is lowered to 60 kt.

The track forecast remains straightforward. Calvin is expected to 
keep moving generally westward for the next several days as it is 
steered by a well-established ridge over the eastern Pacific. This 
motion will bring the cyclone into the central Pacific basin (west 
of 140W) Sunday night or early Monday morning. Calvin is forecast to 
approach the Hawaiian Islands on Tuesday and pass near or over the 
Big Island of Hawaii early Wednesday. The track guidance remains in 
good agreement on this overall scenario, although the details of its 
track near Hawaii are still uncertain given the average amount of 
cross-track spread in the guidance. The latest NHC forecast is 
slightly faster and has been nudged slightly northward at 60-96 h, 
but still lies near the center of the guidance envelope and close to 
the HCCA and TVCE aids.   

Calvin will move over 24 deg C waters and into a drier, more stable 
environment during the next couple of days. Therefore, continued 
weakening is anticipated, and the system could struggle to produce 
convection on its trek into the central Pacific basin. As Calvin 
moves closer to Hawaii, model-simulated satellite imagery suggests 
it could produce some renewed bursts of convection to the north of 
its center. This forecast keeps Calvin as a tropical cyclone through 
72 h, although it could become post-tropical sooner if convection 
collapses for an extended period. Regardless, there is good support 
from both the global and hurricane models that Calvin will maintain 
some tropical-storm-force winds (mainly to the north of its center) 
as it nears Hawaii. With strong deep-layer southwesterly shear 
expected in 96-120 h, this forecast shows Calvin opening into a 
trough and dissipating by day 5.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Calvin is forecast to move across the central Pacific Ocean and
approach the Hawaiian Islands during the next few days. A Tropical 
Storm Watch could be issued for portions of the main Hawaiian 
Islands late Sunday, and interests in Hawaii should closely monitor 
the latest forecast updates.
