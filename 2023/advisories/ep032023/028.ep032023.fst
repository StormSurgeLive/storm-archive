DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM HST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Calvin was
located near latitude 17.5 North, longitude 149.5 West. Calvin is
moving toward the west near 22 mph (35 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue over the next few days. On this 
forecast track, tropical storm conditions will likely begin
spreading over Hawaii County starting this evening.

Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Deep convection has been developing near Calvin early this morning, 
which may slow the weakening trend today. Calvin is forecast to 
gradually weaken from tonight through Thursday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Calvin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header TCDCP1 and WMO header WTPA41 PHFO.
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/HFOTCDCP1.shtml

WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area starting this evening. Persons in Hawaii County should
complete preparations for tropical storm force wind impacts 
during daylight hours prior to the onset of tropical storm
conditions tonight.

RAINFALL: From later today into Thursday, storm total rainfall
amounts of 4-8 inches, with maximum amounts of 10 inches are
possible, mainly along the windward areas of the Big Island of
Hawaii. Storm total rainfall amounts of 1-4 inches are expected
elsewhere in the state. This rainfall could lead to localized
flash flooding and mudslides.

SURF: Swells generated by Calvin are expected to begin spreading
across the main Hawaiian Islands later today and tonight. This 
will lead to a rapid increase in surf along east facing shores, 
with high surf continuing into Wednesday. This elevated surf will 
likely cause life-threatening conditions along exposed shorelines. 
Please consult products from your local weather office for details.
