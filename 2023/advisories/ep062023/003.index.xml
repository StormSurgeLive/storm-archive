BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Eugene Advisory Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062023
900 PM MDT Sat Aug 05 2023
 
...EUGENE STRENGTHENS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM MDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.0N 108.8W
ABOUT 210 MI...340 KM SSE OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the southern portion of the Baja California peninsula
should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM MDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Eugene was 
located near latitude 20.0 North, longitude 108.8 West. Eugene is 
moving toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h). A gradual turn 
toward the west-northwest is forecast during the next couple of 
days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Some strengthening is expected through early Sunday, 
followed by weakening early next week. Eugene is forecast to 
degenerate to a remnant low by early Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: The outer edges of the rainfall pattern from Eugene may
produce storm total amounts of 1 to 2 inches along sections of the 
southwestern Mexican states of Sinaloa, Jalisco, Nayarit, and
the southern portion of Baja California Sur.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Eugene will affect portions of the coasts
of west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur during the next day
or two. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM MDT.

Tropical Storm Eugene Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062023
900 PM MDT Sat Aug 05 2023
 
Eugene has strengthened this evening. Deep convection has increased 
near and over the center of the system during the past several 
hours, with more pronounced convective banding over the southeastern 
portion of the circulation. Additionally, earlier AMSR2 and SSMIS 
passive microwave data showed some evidence of a formative inner 
core trying to take shape. The various 00 UTC objective and 
subjective satellite intensity estimates ranged from 35-55 kt. Given 
the overall improved convective structure of Eugene, the initial 
intensity is raised to 45 kt based on a blend of these data. 

The tropical storm has a brief window to intensity over very warm 
(29-30C) SSTs before the environment becomes increasingly hostile. 
Deep-layer shear is forecast to strengthen later on Sunday, and soon 
thereafter Eugene will encounter a drier and more stable airmass 
while moving over progressively cooler SSTs. The updated NHC 
intensity forecast shows a slightly higher peak (55 kt) in 12-24 h 
that is supported by the latest intensity consensus aids, followed 
by steady weakening through early next week. Eugene could become 
completely devoid of convection in 60 h based on simulated satellite 
imagery from the global and hurricane models. Therefore, the NHC 
forecast shows Eugene degenerating to a remnant low early Tuesday 
and dissipating by the end of the forecast period.

The initial motion remains northwestward at 310/13 kt. Eugene is 
expected to turn west-northwestward over the next day or two while 
being steered by a mid-level ridge to its north. Later in the 
forecast period, a shortwave trough approaching the U.S. West Coast 
will produce a break in the subtropical ridge. This will result in 
weaker steering currents that should cause the shallow cyclone to 
slow down before eventually turning more northward and dissipating 
over cooler waters. The updated NHC forecast shows a slightly faster 
forward speed in agreement with the latest HCCA and TVCE aids, but 
otherwise is very similar to the previous issuance. While the risk 
of tropical-storm-force winds for the southern portion of the Baja 
California peninsula remains low based on this forecast, interests 
there should continue to monitor the progress of this system.

Hurricane Dora Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052023
500 PM HST Sat Aug 05 2023
 
Dora has acquired annular traits, highlighted by a circular and 
relatively large eye (compared to the size of the hurricane itself), 
a wide band of very cold cloud tops within the CDO, and dissolving 
outer bands around the periphery of the circulation.  As a 
reflection of this, the Annular Hurricane Index (AHI) has increased 
to about 85 out of 100.  The maximum winds are now estimated to be 
125 kt, which best matches a Dvorak estimate of T6.5/127 kt from SAB 
and objective ADT and AiDT numbers of 123-125 kt.
 
There's no new news to report regarding Dora's forecast track.  A
ridge building westward to the north of the hurricane is expected
to push Dora faster toward the west while it passes well south of
Hawaii in the next 2-4 days.  The track guidance--and the NHC
official forecast--have been remarkably steady for the past few
days, and the new forecast is basically an update of the previous
prediction.
 
Fluctuations in intensity are possible during the next 6-12 hours
while Dora becomes increasingly annular.  The hurricane is forecast
to continue moving nearly parallel to the sea surface temperature
gradient, over waters of 26-27C for the next several days.
Deep-layer shear is expected to remain light, although Dora is
likely to move into a drier, more subsident environment into early
next week.  That said, annular hurricanes have a proclivity for
weakening more slowly than expected or suggested by intensity
models, and the new NHC forecast therefore lies near the upper
bound of the available guidance, showing only gradual weakening
through the 5-day forecast period.  This forecast is closest to the 
SHIPS guidance during the first couple of days, and then trends 
close to the HCCA and IVCN consensus aids thereafter.
