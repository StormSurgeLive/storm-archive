Tropical Storm Eugene Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062023
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 07 2023
 
Eugene has lacked deep convection for at least 7 hours now. Since 
the tropical storm is moving over waters of 23 deg C or cooler, 
redevelopment of convection is not expected, and it will likely be 
classified as a post-tropical cyclone this afternoon. The initial 
intensity has been lowered to 40 kt, based on the assumption that 
the winds have decreased since the last advisory with no deep 
convection to sustain the cyclone, and this could be generous. 
Additional weakening appears inevitable, and Eugene is forecast to 
dissipate by mid-week.
 
Eugene continues to move west-northwestward, steered by a strong
low- to mid-level ridge to its northeast. Eugene will likely slow
down significantly by tonight while it weakens, and turn northward
through mid-week. No changes of note were made to the NHC track
forecast.
