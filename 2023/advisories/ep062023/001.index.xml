The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Dora, located more than 1500 miles west-southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California Peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Off the coast of Southwestern Mexico (EP97):<br/>
During the past several hours, showers and thunderstorms have <br/>
increased in association with a low pressure area centered about <br/>
150 miles southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. Environmental conditions <br/>
are conducive for additional development, and a tropical depression <br/>
is likely to form later today or tonight.  The disturbance is <br/>
forecast to move northwestward at about 15 mph, parallel to but not <br/>
far offshore of the southwestern coast of Mexico.  Interests along <br/>
the southwestern coast of Mexico and the southern portion of the <br/>
Baja California peninsula should monitor the progress of this <br/>
system this weekend.  Additional information on this system, <br/>
including gale warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued <br/>
by the National Weather Service.<br/>

Some strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days. and 
the depression is expected to become a tropical storm later today 
or tonight. Afterward, weakening is expected and the cyclone should 
quickly become a remnant low in 3 days.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Tropical Depression Six-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062023
900 AM MDT Sat Aug 05 2023
 
During the past several hours, the area of low pressure the National
Hurricane Center has been monitoring offshore the southwestern coast
of Mexico has gradually become better organized on GOES-18 satellite
imagery.  Additionally, overnight microwave images indicated
improved curved banding over the south and east portions of the
cyclone.  Based on the overall improvement of the system's cloud
pattern and Dvorak intensity estimates from both TAFB and SAB
yielding an initial intensity of 30 kt, advisories are being
initiated on Tropical Depression Six-E.
 
Modest strengthening is expected during the next 36 hours or so 
while the cyclone remains over warm oceanic surface temperatures; 
however, moderate northeasterly shear is impinging on the north 
semicircle of the system.  By early next week, the depression 
should weaken rather quickly as it traverses a sharp decreasing sea 
surface temperature gradient and moves into a more stable air mass.  
The official forecast is based on a compromise of the HFIP, HCCA, 
and the IVCN intensity models. The majority of the guidance, 
including the global models, indicates the cyclone degenerating to 
a remnant low in 3 days, if not sooner.
 
The initial motion is somewhat uncertain but is estimated to be
northwestward or 310/12 kt.  The depression is located south of a
subtropical ridge extending from the Southern Plains of the United
States to the Baja California peninsula and eastern Pacific offshore
waters.  This mid-level ridge should steer the cyclone toward the
northwest during the next day or so.  Afterward, global models show
the western portion of the ridge eroding in response to a major
shortwave trough approaching the west coast of the United States.
As a result, the depression should turn toward the west-northwest
with a gradual reduction in forward speed early next week.  The NHC
track forecast lies near the HCCA and TVCE multi-model aids and
between the GFS and ECMWF global models.  Although the track
forecast is currently off the southwestern coast of Mexico, enough
uncertainty still exists that interests in the southern portion of
the Baja California peninsula should monitor the progress of this
system.

Hurricane Dora Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052023
500 AM HST Sat Aug 05 2023

The increase in Dora's organization that started just before the 
last advisory has continued during the last several hours, with a 
cloud-filled eye becoming more persistent in a central dense 
overcast with some cloud top temperatures colder than -80C.  The 
various satellite intensity estimates are now in the 95-120 kt 
range, and the initial intensity is increased to a possibly 
conservative 100 kt.
 
Dora continues moving westward or 265/16 kt along the southern side 
of a deep-layer ridge to the north.  This ridge is expected to build
westward, which should induce a somewhat faster forward speed while 
it passes well south of Hawaii early next week.  The track guidance 
is still tightly clustered and has changed little since the 
previous advisory, and the new track forecast is almost the same as 
the previous forecast.

The easterly shear that occurred yesterday seems to be decreasing, 
with that decrease probably allowing the re-intensification.  
During the next 48-72 h, the center of Dora should be in a 
light-shear environment with sea surface temperatures of 26-27C.  
While there is still some spread, the intensity guidance 
indicates that the current intensification should end in the next 
6-12 h, followed by a gradual weakening.  This part of the 
intensity forecast follows the guidance and is a little above the 
intensity consensus.  After 72 h, the hurricane is expected to move 
over increasing sea surface temperatures, but also move into a 
drier air mass.  In addition, some westerly vertical shear could 
develop by 120 h.  However, the guidance spread becomes quite 
large, with the GFS- and ECMWF-based SHIPS models showing a 
significantly higher intensity than the dynamical models.  This 
part of the intensity forecast will show a slow weakening, but will 
lean more towards the SHIPS models than the dynamical models.
