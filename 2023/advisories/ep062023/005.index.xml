TODAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM MDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.8N 111.5W
ABOUT 125 MI...205 KM SW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...70 MPH...110 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 18 MPH...30 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...992 MB...29.30 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the southern portion of the Baja California peninsula
should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Eugene was
located near latitude 21.8 North, longitude 111.5 West. Eugene is
moving toward the west-northwest near 18 mph (30 km/h), and this 
motion should continue through Tuesday. On the forecast track, 
Eugene should pass to the south of the southern portion of the Baja 
California Sur today.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Eugene could become a hurricane later today 
before weakening starts on Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: The outer edges of the rainfall from Eugene may produce
storm total amounts of 1 to 2 inches across the southern portion of
Baja California Sur.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Eugene will affect portions of the coasts
of west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur during the next day
or so. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
WIND: Gusty winds are likely across the southern portion of Baja
California Sur today.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM MDT.

Tropical Storm Eugene Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062023
900 AM MDT Sun Aug 06 2023

Eugene is on the verge of becoming a hurricane this morning.  
Scatterometer data from overnight indicated that the maximum winds 
were 55-60 kt, and a GMI microwave pass now shows the development of 
a partial eyewall.  The storm isn't as impressive on conventional 
satellite imagery, however, with the central dense overcast 
weakening during the past several hours.  Intensity estimates range 
from 45-60 kt, and 60 kt is chosen as the initial wind speed, based 
on the improved microwave structure and overnight scatterometer 
data.  

The storm has today to strengthen in marginally conducive 
conditions before it crosses over very cool waters overnight.  
Eugene should weaken steadily on Monday and Tuesday due to the lack 
of instability over the cool waters.  Most of the guidance shows 
Eugene losing deep convection in 36-48 hours over sub-23C waters, 
so post-tropical status is moved up to day 2 in this forecast.  No 
significant changes were made to the intensity forecast, which 
remains close to the intensity consensus.

Microwave data show that Eugene is moving faster to the west- 
northwest at about 16 kt.  This general motion is anticipated with 
some reduction in forward speed during the next day or two while the 
storm moves on the southern side of a mid-level ridge.  Eugene 
should reach the western periphery of the ridge on Tuesday, which 
will cause the weakening system to turn and move more slowly 
northward.  Model guidance has trended westward on this advisory, 
and the official forecast follows the trend at longer range.  The 
global models degenerate the system into a trough in 3-4 days.
 
Eugene will likely produce areas of heavy rains and gusty winds
across southern portions of the Baja California Sur today as it
passes to the south of the peninsula.  Interests there should
monitor the progress of this system.

Hurricane Dora Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052023
1100 PM HST Sat Aug 05 2023
 
Satellite images indicate Dora still has the classic structure of
a well-organized hurricane with a clear eye.  The initial intensity
is held at 125 kt, which is closest to SAB and TAFB final T-numbers
of T6.5/127 kt.
 
Dora has maintained its westward heading at a slightly faster 18
kt.  The track forecast reasoning is unchanged.  A building ridge
to the north of the hurricane will steer Dora to the west at a
similar speed for the next several days, keeping it well south of
Hawaii.  The latest track forecast is very close to the previous
prediction with only minor updates.
 
The storm is currently in an environment of light vertical wind 
shear, over relatively warm waters, and still exhibiting annular 
structural characteristics.  Global models forecast Dora to move 
into a drier environment early next week and the wind shear is 
expected to increase by the end of the forecast period.  Therefore, 
gradual weakening is predicted, though the intensity forecast is on 
the higher end of the guidance. As stated in the previous 
discussion, intensity fluctuations are possible given the storm's 
small size and structure.  The NHC intensity forecast is quite 
similar to the previous prediction.
