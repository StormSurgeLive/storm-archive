...EUGENE MOVING QUICKLY AWAY FROM BAJA CALIFORNIA SUR...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM MDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...22.7N 113.2W
ABOUT 210 MI...340 KM W OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...70 MPH...110 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 20 MPH...31 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...993 MB...29.33 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM MDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Eugene was
located near latitude 22.7 North, longitude 113.2 West. Eugene is
moving toward the west-northwest near 20 mph (31 km/h), and this 
motion should continue for the next day or so, followed by a turn 
to the north and a sharp reduction in forward speed.  Eugene should 
continue moving farther away from Baja California Sur.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast tonight, followed by 
steady weakening likely starting on Monday.  Eugene could become a 
post-tropical cyclone late on Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 993 mb (29.33 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Eugene will affect portions of the coasts
of west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur during the next day
or so. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM MDT.

Tropical Storm Eugene Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062023
300 PM MDT Sun Aug 06 2023

Eugene is sending some mixed signals this afternoon.  While earlier 
a possible eye feature was present on the visible imagery, the 
feature has weakened and become part of a ragged central dense 
overcast.  Overall, the system doesn't seem much different than the 
last advisory, so 60 kt is maintained on this cycle.  The Dvorak 
estimate ranges are quite large, with estimates of 40-65 kt, so 
the initial wind is a bit more uncertain than average.  

The storm should begin to weaken overnight as it crosses a tight 
sea-surface temperature gradient, with very cold waters along the 
forecast track within 24 h.  By early Tuesday, Eugene should 
transition to a non-convective post-tropical low, consistent with 
the stable environment and the latest global model infrared 
satellite forecasts.  The new NHC forecast is slightly lower than 
the last one, between the model consensus and the NOAA 
corrected-consensus prediction.
 
Eugene is moving along pretty quickly to the west-northwest at 
about 17 kt.  This motion should continue for about a day until it 
reaches the edge of the subtropical ridge.  Thereafter, a 
weaker cyclone should slow down and turn northward toward a 
weakness in the ridge.  However, the very hostile environment should 
cause what's left of Eugene to stall well west of Baja California 
and degenerate to a trough in about 3 days.  The latest NHC track 
is basically an update of the previous one, close to the eastern 
Pacific track consensus TVCE.
