Tropical Storm Arlene Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022023
400 PM CDT Fri Jun 02 2023

Arlene has changed little during the last few hours.  The low-level 
center is still estimated to be near the southwest side of the main 
area of deep convection.  The initial intensity remains 35 kt based 
on the earlier Hurricane Hunter data and a Dvorak 2.5 classification 
from TAFB.  The tropical-storm-force winds are confined to a 
relatively small region of about 60 n mi to the north of the center 
in the area of strongest thunderstorms.  Arlene is currently moving 
to the south-southeast at about 5 kt and is being steered by a mid- 
to upper-level trough that it is embedded within.  This overall 
motion is expected to continue during the next day or two.

Although Arlene has strengthened a little today, the models are in 
good agreement that increasing vertical wind shear and notably 
drier air are expected to affect the cyclone beginning tonight.  
These conditions should cause a weakening trend, and Arlene is 
expected to become a remnant low on Saturday and dissipate on 
Sunday.

The main hazard expected from Arlene is the potential for heavy rain 
over portions of south and central Florida through Saturday.
