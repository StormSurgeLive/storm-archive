...AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTERS INDICATE DEPRESSION HAS STRENGTHENED
INTO TROPICAL STORM ARLENE...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 100 PM CDT...1800 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...26.7N 86.2W
ABOUT 265 MI...425 KM W OF FT. MYERS FLORIDA
ABOUT 340 MI...550 KM NNW OF THE WESTERN TIP OF CUBA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...S OR 175 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1002 MB...29.59 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Arlene was
located near latitude 26.7 North, longitude 86.2 West. Arlene is 
moving toward the south near 5 mph (7 km/h) and this motion is 
expected to increase slightly through tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Arlene is expected to weaken by tonight, and it 
is forecast to degenerate into a remnant low on Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
northeast of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on data from the Air 
Force Hurricane Hunters is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches with localized higher
amounts up to 5 inches are possible through Saturday across portions
of the central and southern Florida Peninsula.  This rainfall is not
directly related to Tropical Depression Two.  Regardless, the heavy
rainfall could lead to isolated flash, urban, and small stream
flooding impacts.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Arlene Special Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022023
100 PM CDT Fri Jun 02 2023
 
Data from the Air Force Hurricane Hunters indicate that the 
depression has strengthened into a tropical storm.  On the last leg 
of the current mission, the aircraft found maximum 925 
mb flight-level winds of around 50 kt and SFMR surface winds of 
around 35 kt.  Based on these data, Tropical Depression Two has 
been upgraded to Tropical Storm Arlene with estimated peak winds of 
35 kt.  

Although the storm has strengthened slightly, we still expect 
Arlene to weaken soon due to increasing wind shear and dry air, and 
no change has been made to the forecast.  The next forecast will be 
issued at the normal time at 4 pm CDT.
