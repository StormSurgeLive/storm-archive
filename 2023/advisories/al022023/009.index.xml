Tropical Depression Arlene Advisory Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022023
1000 AM CDT Sat Jun 03 2023
 
...ARLENE WEAKENS TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1000 AM CDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.2N 85.1W
ABOUT 145 MI...230 KM WSW OF THE DRY TORTUGAS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...SSE OR 160 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Arlene
was located near latitude 24.2 North, longitude 85.1 West. The
depression is moving toward the south-southeast near 7 mph (11 
km/h). A turn to the east is expected by tonight, and that motion 
should continue until the system dissipates. 
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Continued weakening is forecast and Arlene is 
expected to become a remnant low later today.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on data from the Air 
Force Hurricane Hunters is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches with localized higher
amounts up to 5 inches are possible through tonight across portions
of the southern Florida Peninsula. The heavy rainfall could lead to
isolated flash, urban, and small stream flooding impacts.

Tropical Depression Arlene Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022023
1000 AM CDT Sat Jun 03 2023
 
Arlene has weakened to a tropical depression.  The Air Force 
Hurricane Hunters have been investigating Arlene this morning and 
found that the minimum pressure has risen to 1000 mb and maximum 
winds have decreased to 30 kt or less.  This weakening trend is due 
to strong vertical wind shear and dry air that has wrapped into the 
circulation, and continued weakening is forecast.  Deep convection 
associated with Arlene has been separating from the low-level 
center, and there are only a few patches of convection left more 
than 90 n mi northeast of the center.  If these trends continue, 
Arlene will be designated a remnant low later today.

The tropical depression is moving south-southeastward at about 6 
kt.  The system will turn to the east today as it moves within a 
deep-layer trough, which will likely increase rainfall across 
portions of southern Florida through tonight.
