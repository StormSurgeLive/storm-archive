NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022023
500 PM EDT Sat Jun 03 2023
 
...ARLENE NOW A REMNANT LOW...
...THIS IS THE LAST ADVISORY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM EDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...23.7N 84.7W
ABOUT 135 MI...215 KM WSW OF THE DRY TORTUGAS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...30 MPH...45 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...SSE OR 150 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Arlene
was located near latitude 23.7 North, longitude 84.7 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the south-southeast near 7
mph (11 km/h). A turn to the east is expected by tonight, and that 
motion should continue until the system dissipates.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Continued weakening is forecast, and Arlene is expected to dissipate 
on Sunday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches with localized higher
amounts up to 5 inches are possible into this evening across 
portions of the southern Florida Peninsula. The heavy rainfall 
could lead to isolated flash, urban, and small stream flooding 
impacts.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on Arlene.  For additional information on the remnant 
low, see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service
under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at

Post-Tropical Cyclone Arlene Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022023
500 PM EDT Sat Jun 03 2023
 
Arlene has lacked organized deep convection for quite some time now, 
since about 07Z.  There have been a few short-lived small bursts of 
convection in the northeast quadrant, but they have been getting 
quickly sheared off and lack organization.  Therefore, Arlene no 
longer meets the definition of a tropical cyclone and the system is 
now a remnant low.  The initial intensity is estimated to be 25 kt 
based on a partial ASCAT pass, surface observations, and the earlier 
reconnaissance data.  Strong vertical wind shear and dry air should 
continue to cause weakening, and this system is expected to open 
into a trough on Sunday.

The low pressure area is moving south-southeastward at 6 kt.  A turn 
to the east is expected tonight and that motion should continue 
until the system dissipates.  The remnant low will likely enhance 
rainfall over portions of southern Florida through tonight.

This is the last NHC advisory on Arlene.  For more information, 
see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service
under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
