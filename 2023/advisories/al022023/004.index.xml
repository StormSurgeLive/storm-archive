...DEPRESSION MOVING SLOWLY SOUTHWARD WITH LITTLE CHANGE IN
STRENGTH...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1000 AM CDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...26.7N 86.3W
ABOUT 270 MI...435 KM W OF FT. MYERS FLORIDA
ABOUT 345 MI...550 KM NNW OF THE WESTERN TIP OF CUBA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...S OR 175 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1002 MB...29.59 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Two was
located near latitude 26.7 North, longitude 86.3 West. The
depression is moving toward the south near 5 mph (7 km/h) and this
motion is expected to increase slightly during the day today and 
tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
The system is forecast to weaken later today and tonight, and it is 
forecast to degenerate into a remnant low on Saturday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure, based on data from the Air 
Force Hurricane Hunters, is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches with localized higher
amounts up to 5 inches are possible through Saturday across portions
of the central and southern Florida Peninsula.  This rainfall is not
directly related to Tropical Depression Two.  Regardless, the heavy
rainfall could lead to isolated flash, urban, and small stream
flooding impacts.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Tropical Depression Two Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022023
400 AM CDT Fri Jun 02 2023

The tropical cyclone has not become better organized this morning, 
and it remains in a sheared state.  The low-level center of the 
system is located to the southwest of a rather ragged-looking area 
of deep convection.  Despite its unimpressive appearance, earlier 
scatterometer data indicated that the cyclone was close to tropical 
storm strength.  A Dvorak satellite intensity estimate, using a 
shear pattern measurement, is unchanged from the previous cycle and 
the current intensity estimate is held at 30 kt for this advisory.  
An Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate 
the system later this morning.

Center fixes from satellite imagery indicate that the depression 
continues to move slowly southward with an initial motion 
estimate of 180/4 kt.  There is little change to the track forecast 
reasoning or numerical guidance from the previous advisory.  
During the next day or two, the cyclone is expected to move 
southward to southeastward at a slightly faster forward speed on 
the western side of a mid-level trough over Florida and east of a 
ridge over the western Gulf of Mexico.  The latest official track 
forecast is basically an update of the previous one and is a blend 
of the simple and corrected dynamical model consensus tracks.

It appears that the window of opportunity for the cyclone to 
strengthen is closing, or has already closed.  Vertical shear is 
likely to remain strong or become even stronger as the system moves 
farther south underneath an upper-tropospheric jet over the 
southeastern Gulf of Mexico.  This shear, combined with some drier 
air to the west of the trough over the extreme eastern Gulf, should 
cause a weakening trend to commence by this evening.  The official 
intensity forecast shows the system degenerating into a remnant low 
in 36 hours.
 
Based on the track and intensity forecast for this system, coastal 
watches and warnings are not necessary at this time.
