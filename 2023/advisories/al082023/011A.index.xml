800 AM EDT Wed Aug 23 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Franklin, located near the southern coast of the Dominican <br/>
Republic.  The Weather Prediction Center is issuing advisories on <br/>
Tropical Depression Harold, located inland over northern Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL07):<br/>
An area of low pressure centered several hundred miles east- <br/>
northeast of the Leeward Islands (the remnants of former Tropical <br/>
Storm Emily) continues to produce a large area of disorganized <br/>
showers and  thunderstorms.  Upper-level winds are forecast to <br/>
become more conducive for development in a day or so, and this <br/>
system is likely to regenerate into a tropical depression or <br/>
tropical storm late this week or this weekend when the system moves <br/>
northward over the subtropical central Atlantic. For additional <br/>
information on this system, including gale warnings, see High Seas <br/>
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL92):<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue in association with <br/>
a tropical wave located several hundred miles west of the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands.  Environmental conditions appear only marginally favorable <br/>
for some slow development through early next week while the system <br/>
moves west-northwestward to northwestward into the central <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Franklin was
located very near the southern coast of the Dominican Republic near 
latitude 17.9 North, longitude 71.2 West.  Franklin is moving toward 
the north near 10 mph (17 km/h), and a north-northeastward motion is 
expected for the next day or so, followed by a turn toward the 
northeast and east-northeast on Thursday.  On the forecast track, 
the center of Franklin is expected to cross the island of Hispaniola 
today and emerge over the southwestern Atlantic waters later today 
or tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some weakening is likely today while Franklin moves over Hispaniola, 
followed by re-strengthening beginning on Thursday after the center 
moves over the Atlantic.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.  A sustained wind of 37 mph (60 km/h) was recently 
reported at San Miguel near Santo Domingo.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Franklin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml.
 
RAINFALL:  Franklin is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to
10 inches, with higher amounts around 15 inches mainly across
central portions of Hispaniola into Thursday.  Additional rainfall
totals of 1 to 2 inches, with storm total maxima of 4 inches, are
expected across Puerto Rico through tonight.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are likely occurring within the
warning area on the south coast of Hispaniola, and are expected to
spread northward today and tonight.
 
STORM SURGE: Minor coastal flooding is possible along the coast of
Hispaniola in areas of onshore winds.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Franklin Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 AM EDT Wed Aug 23 2023
 
Franklin's cloud pattern continues to become gradually better 
organized with a large convective band evident over the eastern 
semicircle of the circulation.  There is still some westerly shear 
over the system, and most of the deep convection is confined to the 
northeast and southeast quadrants of the storm.  Franklin appears to 
be producing high-level anticyclonic outflow which is being undercut 
by westerlies just below the outflow level.  Subjective Dvorak 
intensity estimates range from 35 to 45 kt, and most of the 
objective estimates are in this range as well.  A scatterometer 
overpass from several hours ago indicated maximum winds near 40 kt.  
The current intensity is set at 45 kt.

Although the center remains difficult to locate, satellite center 
fixes from TAFB and SAB and continuity suggest a motion of about 
010/9 kt.  Franklin is moving through a weakness in the mid-level 
subtropical ridge.  During the next couple of days, the cyclone is 
forecast to turn toward the east-northeast and move along the 
northwestern side of a mid-level anticyclone, and south of a 
higher-latitude trough.  In 3 to 5 days, as the trough lifts out and 
a mid-level ridge to the west and northwest of Franklin builds 
slightly, the system is expected to turn northward and 
north-northwestward.  The official track forecast is again close to 
the HCCA consensus and very similar to the previous advisory's 
prediction.

Land interaction with the mountains of Hispaniola today are likely 
to disrupt Franklin's circulation, and the amount of weakening 
shown by the NHC short-term intensity forecast may be conservative. 
After the cyclone moves over the Atlantic, strengthening is 
anticipated.  However, the global models show significant shear 
associated with an upper-level cyclone over the southwestern 
Atlantic near 70W in 3-5 days, and this is also indicated in the 
SHIPS guidance.  Because of this, the official intensity forecast 
is near the low end of the model guidance and similar to the LGEM 
prediction.  This is just slightly higher than the previous 
official forecast.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Franklin is expected across much of 
Hispaniola into Thursday. The heavy rainfall is expected to produce 
significant and potentially life-threatening flash and urban 
flooding as well as mudslides, particularly over central Hispaniola 
today.
 
2. Franklin is bringing tropical storm conditions to portions of the 
Dominican Republic and Haiti, where Tropical Storm Warnings are in 
effect, and tropical storm conditions are expected to begin within 
the Turks and Caicos Islands later today or tonight.
