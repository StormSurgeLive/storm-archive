Tropical Depression Gert Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
500 PM AST Mon Aug 21 2023
 
Gert continues to be sustained by a very small but persistent area
of convection east of its surface wind center. ASCAT data that came
in 5 minutes after the release of the previous advisory showed peak
winds of just above 25 kt well to the north of Gert's center. South
of Gert is mostly light and variable winds. Assuming Gert has
weakened further a little since then, its intensity has been lowered
to 25 kt.
 
All models continue to suggest that Gert will struggle in the face 
of strong upper-level winds and a very dry surrounding environment. 
The small tropical depression will likely either lose organized deep 
convection and become a remnant low or dissipate at almost any time. 
There is a chance that Gert could persist as a remnant low beyond 
the 24 h shown in the NHC forecast, but it is unlikely that Gert 
will have sufficient organized deep convection to be classified as a 
tropical cyclone in that case. Gert is moving west-northwestward, 
but the depression or its remnants should turn more northwestward 
by tomorrow. No noteworthy changes were made to the NHC track or 
intensity forecasts with this advisory.

<title>Post-Tropical Cyclone Emily Forecast Discussion Number 5</title>

Post-Tropical Cyclone Emily Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072023
1100 AM AST Mon Aug 21 2023
 
Emily has been devoid of deep convection for nearly 15 hours and no 
longer meets the definition of a tropical cyclone. Although sea 
surface temperatures are sufficiently warm to support occasional 
bursts of convection, strong wind shear and a very dry environment 
should prevent it from re-organizing as a tropical cyclone for at 
least the next couple days. The initial intensity of 30 kt is based 
on ASCAT-B data valid at 1200 UTC.
 
In about 3 days, the remnant low is forecast to turn northward as it 
encounters a deep-layer trough over the central Atlantic. While it 
turns, Emily could briefly encounter a more favorable upper-level 
wind pattern, which could support the redevelopment of convection. 
However, the low-level center may also become stretched and 
ill-defined at the same time. Regeneration as a tropical cyclone 
does not appear likely enough to explicitly forecast it at this 
time. Information on the potential for regeneration will be included 
in future Tropical Weather Outlooks, if necessary. Future 
information on Emily can also be found in High Seas forecasts issued 
by the National Hurricane Center and Ocean Prediction Center.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Franklin was 
located near latitude 14.3 North, longitude 70.1 West. Franklin is 
moving slowly toward the west near 5 mph (7 km/h), and a slow 
westward motion is expected through this evening. A sharp turn to 
the north is expected on Tuesday with this general motion 
continuing into Wednesday. On the forecast track, the center of 
Franklin is forecast to reach the southern coast of Hispaniola by 
early on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Some strengthening is forecast before Franklin reaches 
Hispaniola.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Franklin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml.
 
RAINFALL:  Franklin is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 2 to
4 inches, with isolated higher amounts of 6 inches, across Puerto
Rico through the middle of the week. Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10
inches, with isolated higher amounts up to 15 inches, will be
possible across portions of Hispaniola.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin within the
warning area on Tuesday and are possible within the watch area
beginning late Tuesday into Wednesday.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast near and to
the east of where the center makes landfall in Hispaniola.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM EDT.

Tropical Storm Franklin Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 PM EDT Mon Aug 21 2023

Franklin is not an especially well-organized tropical cyclone this 
afternoon. The NOAA reconnaissance mission has been sampling the 
storm for a large part of the afternoon, and found a center 
to the south of where the position was estimated earlier today. In 
addition, the winds on the southwest side of the circulation are 
more diffuse, and overall the circulation is a bit more elongated 
than what the plane found yesterday at this time. Peak 850-mb flight 
level winds were at 48 kt just to the northwest of the circulation, 
which supports an intensity between 40-45 kt after using a standard 
reduction. The initial intensity will remain at 45 kt for this 
advisory, which is also in between the higher TAFB and lower SAB 
intensity estimates. 

The tropical storm has been meandering today, and my best guess at 
an initial motion is a drift south of due west at 265/4 kt. Given 
the current elongated nature of the surface circulation, the short- 
term track forecast is tricky, ranging from the GFS on the east side 
of the guidance envelope that has a center reformation to the 
northeast, and the CMC and ECMWF which are on the western side of 
the guidance envelope. The steering currents are also poorly defined 
currently due to a large mid-oceanic trough in the western Atlantic 
disrupting the flow pattern. Mid-level ridging eventually builds in 
to the east of Franklin, which should ultimately induce a northward 
motion by 24-36 h, and then northeastward between 48-96 h, as a 
mid-latitude trough reinforces the weakness to the north of the 
storm. The track guidance has slowed down again compared to the 
previous cycle, prolonging the time the system will remain over the 
Caribbean Sea before it moves over Hispaniola. The NHC track 
forecast is once again slower than the previous cycle and has also 
been nudged a touch westward compared to the previous one, but is 
now a bit east of the simple and corrected consensus aids. 

Given Franklin's current structure, I am somewhat skeptical there 
will be a lot of meaningful near-term intensification, especially 
while moderate vertical wind shear continues to disrupt the 
convective structure. However, both the GFS- and ECMWF-based SHIPS 
guidance indicate that the shear will briefly drop under 10 kt in 
about 24 hours, and when combined with warm 29 C sea-surface 
temperatures, it still seems prudent to show some intensification 
before Franklin moves inland over Hispaniola. Significant land 
interaction over the higher terrain will then lead to weakening, 
which could be underdone here given the current track over some of 
the most mountainous terrain. After Franklin emerges into the 
western Atlantic, another round of southwesterly shear may slow the 
rate of reintensification, and the latest NHC intensity forecast is 
a bit more subdued than the previous one, once again electing to 
follow the HCCA consensus aid. Given the complex intensity factors 
mentioned above, this is a low confidence forecast. 
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Franklin is expected across portions of 
Puerto Rico and Hispaniola through the middle of the week. The heavy 
rainfall may produce areas of flash and urban flooding as well as 
river rises and mudslides. Across Hispaniola, significant and 
potentially life-threatening flash flooding is possible Tuesday into 
Wednesday.

2. Franklin is expected to bring tropical storm conditions to 
portions of the Dominican Republic and Haiti beginning on Tuesday 
where Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect.

SUMMARY OF 400 PM CDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...25.2N 91.6W
ABOUT 375 MI...600 KM ESE OF PORT MANSFIELD TEXAS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 275 DEGREES AT 18 MPH...30 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1008 MB...29.77 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Mouth of Rio Grande to Port O'Connor, Texas
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Port O'Connor to Sargent, Texas
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within 12
to 24 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within 12 to 24 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in eastern Texas and northern Mexico should
monitor the progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Nine was
located near latitude 25.2 North, longitude 91.6 West. The
depression is moving toward the west near 18 mph (30 km/h).  A fast
motion to the west is expected to continue, and the system is
forecast to move inland over south Texas by midday Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast, and the system is expected to
become a tropical storm before it reaches the Texas coast.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for the depression can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
RAINFALL:  The depression is expected to produce rainfall amounts
of 3 to 5 inches, with isolated higher amounts of 7 inches, across
South Texas on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Areas of flash flooding will
be possible.
 
Across Mexico, rainfall amounts of 4 to 6 inches, with local amounts
of 10 inches, are expected across portions of northern Coahuila and
northern Nuevo Leon on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Areas of flash
flooding are expected.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area
and are possible in the watch area early Tuesday.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Mouth of Rio Grande to Sargent, including Baffin Bay, Corpus
Christi Bay and Matagorda Bay...1 to 3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
TORNADOES: A couple of tornadoes are possible across south Texas on
Tuesday.
 
SURF: Large swells generated by the depression will affect
portions of southern Texas tonight through Tuesday.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.

Tropical Depression Nine Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092023
400 PM CDT Mon Aug 21 2023
 
An ASCAT pass from a few hours ago and data from the Air Force
Hurricane Hunters indicate that the system now has a closed and 
fairly well-defined center of circulation.  In addition, deep 
convection has been persisting over the central and western Gulf of 
Mexico.  The system now meets the definition of a tropical 
depression, and the initial intensity is estimated to be 30 kt.  The
far outer bands of the depression are nearing the coast of Texas and
northern Mexico, and they are expected to begin moving inland
tonight.
 
The depression is moving fairly quickly to the west at 16 kt on the
south side of a strong mid-level ridge located over the central 
United States.  A continued quick west or west-northwest motion is 
expected, taking the system over southern Texas by midday Tuesday.  
The models are in fairly good agreement, and little change was made 
to the previous NHC track forecast.
 
Strengthening is expected, but the limited time over water and its
current broad structure suggest that rapid intensification is
unlikely.  The system is expected to move inland between the 12- and
24-hour points so it is possible that the system gets a little
stronger than the forecast intensity values.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from the depression is expected across South 
Texas on Tuesday and Wednesday, and may produce areas of flash and 
urban flooding. Across portions of northern Coahuila and northern 
Nuevo Leon in Mexico, flash flooding with possible landslides in 
mountainous terrain is expected Tuesday into Wednesday.
 
2. Coastal flooding is possible along the south Texas coast
tonight through Tuesday morning.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area and
are possible in the watch area beginning early Tuesday.
