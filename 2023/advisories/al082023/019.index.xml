Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Fri Aug 25 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Franklin, located a couple of hundred miles east-northeast of <br/>
the Turks and Caicos Islands. <br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Caribbean Sea and eastern Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure over the northwestern Caribbean Sea <br/>
near the northeastern coast of Honduras is producing disorganized <br/>
shower and thunderstorm activity.  Environmental conditions appear <br/>
conducive for gradual development of this system during the next <br/>
several days, and a tropical depression is likely to form late this <br/>
weekend or early next week while moving generally northward over the <br/>
northwestern Caribbean Sea and eastern Gulf of Mexico.  Interests in <br/>
the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, western Cuba, and Florida should <br/>
monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (Remnants of Emily):<br/>
A trough of low pressure located about 950 miles east of Bermuda <br/>
(the remnants of former Tropical Storm Emily) is producing an <br/>
elongated area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  <br/>
Environmental conditions are becoming less favorable for tropical <br/>
cyclone formation, and the low is expected to merge with a <br/>
frontal boundary over the north central Atlantic in the next day or <br/>
so.  For additional information on this system, including gale <br/>
warnings, see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather <br/>
Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL92):<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue in association with <br/>
an area of low pressure located midway between the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands and the northern Lesser Antilles.  Environmental conditions <br/>
could become more conducive for development in a few days, and a <br/>
tropical depression could form by early next week while the system <br/>
moves generally northwestward toward the central subtropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>

Tropical Storm Franklin Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 AM AST Fri Aug 25 2023
 
Franklin has generally changed little during the past several hours. 
 The storm remains strongly sheared with the low-level center 
partially exposed near the western edge of the main area of deep 
convection.  Cloud tops are quite cold on the system's east side, 
but the storm continues to lack convective symmetry.  The initial 
intensity remains 50 kt based on the earlier Air Force 
reconnaissance data, which is a little above the current satellite 
intensity estimates.
 
The storm is moving slowly to the east-northeast at about 5 kt in 
weak steering currents near the base of a broad mid- to upper-level 
trough.  A north to north-northwest motion is expected to commence 
tonight or early Saturday as ridging builds to the east of Franklin 
over the central Atlantic.  This motion should bring the core of the 
system to the west of Bermuda on Monday and Tuesday.  The storm is 
likely to turn northeastward and accelerate by the middle of next 
week when it should move in the faster flow between the ridge and a 
mid- to upper-level trough over eastern Canada and the northeast 
U.S.  In general, the models have shifted westward this cycle, and 
the NHC track forecast has been nudged in that direction.
 
Continued moderate to strong westerly vertical wind shear should 
limit strengthening during the next 12 to 24 hours.  However, more 
significant strengthening seems likely in a day or two when the 
shear decreases while Franklin remains over warm water and in a 
relatively moist environment.  Franklin is expected to become a 
hurricane over the weekend and should reach a peak intensity near 
major hurricane strength early next week.  The strengthening trend 
should end around day 4, at which time the storm is forecast to 
begin moving over cooler waters and into an environment of stronger 
shear. The intensity models are in fairly good agreement, and this 
forecast is quite similar to the previous one.
