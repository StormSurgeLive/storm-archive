Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Sat Aug 26 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
upgraded Hurricane Franklin, located several hundred miles south of <br/>
Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Caribbean Sea and Eastern Gulf of Mexico (AL93):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure <br/>
located near the Yucatan Channel continue to gradually become <br/>
better organized.  If this trend continues, advisories will be <br/>
initiated on this system later today.  The system is expected to <br/>
move very slowly northward into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico <br/>
during the next couple of days.  Heavy rains are likely over <br/>
portions of western Cuba and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico.<br/>
Interests in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, western Cuba, and <br/>
Florida should monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL92):<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue in association with <br/>
a broad area of low pressure located about 1000 miles <br/>
east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands.  This system has <br/>
not become better organized since yesterday, and development is <br/>
becoming less likely while it moves generally northwestward over <br/>
the central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is forecast to move off the west coast of Africa <br/>
early next week. Some slow development of this system is possible <br/>
during the latter part of next week while the system moves westward <br/>
across the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

...FRANKLIN CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN...
...FORECAST TO BECOME A MAJOR HURRICANE EARLY NEXT WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...23.8N 67.5W
ABOUT 280 MI...450 KM NE OF GRAND TURK ISLAND
ABOUT 610 MI...980 KM SSW OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...85 MPH...140 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 330 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...982 MB...29.00 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Franklin was
located near latitude 23.8 North, longitude 67.5 West. Franklin is
moving toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h), and a
north-northwestward to northward motion is expected over the western
Atlantic through early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Further strengthening is forecast, and Franklin
could become a major hurricane early next week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 982 mb (29.00 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Franklin are expected to begin affecting
Bermuda by Sunday night.  These swells are also likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions late this weekend
into early next week along portions of the east coast of the United
States.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 PM AST Sat Aug 26 2023
 

Visible and microwave satellite imagery show Franklin is becoming a 
well organized hurricane. AMSR2 microwave data showed a closed 
mid-level core that was vertically aligned with the low-level 
center. The latest visible imagery shows a dimple where an eye may 
be trying to develop. Deep convection has become more symmetrical, 
wrapping around the center throughout the day. NOAA Hurricane 
Hunters were in the system earlier this afternoon, with flight-level 
winds and SFMR winds supporting an intensity of around 70 kt. The 
UW-CIMSS ADT objective satellite estimates have been rising this 
afternoon as well. Given the improved satellite structure combined 
with the earlier data from the NOAA Hurricane Hunters, the initial 
intensity is raised to 75 kt for this advisory. NOAA and Air Force 
Hurricane Hunters will be in the system later this evening.
 
Franklin is moving north-northwestward at 7 kt.  A 
north-northwestward to northward motion is forecast during the next 
few days as the storm moves along the western periphery of a 
mid-level ridge, taking it to the west of Bermuda on Tuesday.  By 
the middle of next week, a faster northeast to east-northeast motion 
is expected between the ridge and a mid- to upper-level trough over 
eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. In the short 
range, models once again have trended westward, and the official NHC 
forecast has been nudged west as well. For the long term, models, 
including the GFS and ECMWF, have made a fairly large shift to the 
right. The NHC track was shifted in that direction in the long term, 
but remains to the left of the consensus aids. The confidence of the 
long-term forecast track is lower than usual.
 
Franklin has been steadily strengthening throughout the day. Further 
strengthening is forecast during the next few days with lower 
vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures in the western 
Atlantic. Franklin is forecast to become a major hurricane early 
next week. The strengthening trend should end in about 3 to 4 days 
with shear expected to increase over the system at that time. By day 
5, the current forecast track takes the system over much cooler 
SSTs. However, the intensity in the long range will be dependent on 
the eventual forecast track of Franklin. The current intensity 
forecast lies near the consensus aids, but still slightly lower than 
the HCCA aid.
