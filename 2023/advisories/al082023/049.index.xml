Tropical Storm Jose Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112023
500 PM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
Jose has started to become more elongated in recent geostationary 
imagery. However, a midday AMSR2 microwave pass showed that the 
system still has a small coherent mid-level circulation. The 
intensity is held at 45 kt for this advisory, in best agreement with 
recent UW-CIMSS AiDT, DMINT, and DPRINT estimates. It is noted that 
the intensity is more uncertain than usual given the compact nature 
of the system and its degraded convective structure. The storm is 
beginning to move underneath the upper-level clouds associated with 
Franklin's outflow.
 
Jose continues to accelerate towards the north-northeast at about 28 
kt. The increase in forward motion and interaction with Franklin 
could lead to a slight expansion of the tropical-storm-force winds 
on the east side of Jose. The tropical storm is still expected to 
dissipate sometime tonight as it becomes absorbed by Franklin. The 
track forecast is largely based on the global model wind fields, and 
little intensity change is anticipated through dissipation as the 
fast forward motion is likely to maintain stronger winds over the 
eastern semicircle.

Tropical Storm Gert Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
500 PM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
Gert appears to have strengthened and has become a tropical storm 
once again. Satellite intensity estimates range from 30 kt (1800 UTC 
SAB Dvorak Current Intensity) to 46 kt (1701 UTC UW-CIMSS SATCON), 
so the intensity has been raised to 35 kt in this advisory. AMSR 
microwave imagery from a few hours ago revealed Gert has a tight 
well-defined low-level inner-core, and it's possible the 35-kt 
estimate is conservative.
 
The AMSR pass was also the first clear indication that Gert is
centered a little farther south than previously estimated. It's
possible that Gert's deep convection, which is limited to the
southeast quadrant, is pulling the center slowly in that direction
in the absence of other strong steering currents right now. In a
couple days, Gert should move a little quicker toward the northeast,
steered by a combination of Idalia to its northwest and a low- to
mid-level ridge over the eastern and central Atlantic. The NHC track
forecast is very close to the multi-model consensus aids TVCN and
HCCA, but is a little slower than the previous advisory.
 
Although continued shear should prevent Gert from strengthening 
much, additional slight intensification is possible today or 
tomorrow. Most models show the cyclone becoming post-tropical in 48 
to 60 hours, and absorbed into the much larger circulation of Idalia 
soon after. The NHC intensity forecast has been adjusted slightly 
higher but is still very similar to the previous advisory. One thing 
to note, the model trackers used to help NHC make track and 
intensity forecasts appear to be following Idalia at the end of the 
forecast instead of Gert in many cases. Users should be aware that 
the tracks and intensities in the NCEP tracker or ATCF files may not 
be representative of the model depiction of Gert beyond 60-72 h.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Franklin Discussion Number  49
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 PM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
The satellite appearance of Franklin suggests the cyclone has 
undergone a warm core seclusion process. Earlier scatterometer data 
showed a cold front nearing the core of Franklin, and recent visible 
satellite images suggest the presence of a bent-back occlusion 
wrapping around the western side of the low that appears to be the 
focus for the ongoing convection. Also, the latest FSU phase space 
diagrams from the GFS and ECMWF models show a thickness asymmetry 
consistent with a warm-core frontal cyclone. Therefore, it appears 
Franklin has completed its extratropical transition and is no longer 
a tropical cyclone. Since the earlier scatterometer data, the latest 
global model fields suggest that baroclinic forcing has resulted in 
a deepening of the low, with an acceleration of northerly winds to 
the west of the bent-back front. A blend of wind speeds from the 
various global models supports an initial intensity of 70 kt.

Franklin appears likely to remain a powerful, hurricane-force 
extratropical cyclone during the next 12 h or so due to baroclinic 
forcing. Thereafter, the extratropical cyclone is forecast to weaken 
as the low moves deeper into the mid-latitudes and gradually fills. 
Franklin is still moving northeastward (50/15 kt) within the flow 
between a deep-layer trough over the northwestern Atlantic and a 
subtropical ridge over the central Atlantic. A faster northeastward 
motion is forecast during the next couple of days, followed by a 
gradual turn toward the east and east-southeast later in the 
period as the cyclone rotates around a larger cut-off low over the 
eastern Atlantic. The global models are finally in better agreement 
on this outcome, and the track forecast has been adjusted south of 
the previous one at days 3-5. 

This is the last advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center on 
Franklin. Additional information on this system can be found in High 
Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS 
header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at

Tropical Depression Twelve Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122023
800 PM CVT Fri Sep 01 2023
 
A 1458 UTC AMSR-2 microwave pass showed that the depression has a
well-defined circulation, however the associated deep convection
was rather disjointed.  Dvorak CI numbers classifications are still
T2.5 from TAFB, but the final-T number dropped to 2.0 from SAB, so
the system is still being classified as a 30-kt depression at this
time.  Some more defined convective bands are now developing within
the circulation, so the system may be on its way to becoming a
tropical storm.  ASCAT data should provide a better handle on the
maximum winds of the system this evening.
 
The initial motion is toward the north-northwest (345 degrees) at 10
kt, with the depression situated between a mid-level ridge over
western Africa and a mid- to upper-level low over the
eastern/central Atlantic.  Another ridge near the Azores is expected
to force the depression to turn northwest and then west-northwest
around the mid-level low during the next few days.  The NHC track
forecast is a little east of the previous forecast near the
multi-model consensus aids, but this is more a function of an
adjustment of the initial position.  Once the system becomes a
remnant low, the low-level flow should turn it toward the northwest
and north on days 3 and 4.
 
The depression has a small window of relatively low shear, warm
waters, and a sufficiently moist atmosphere to strengthen to a
tropical storm tonight or on Saturday, which is shown in the
official forecast.  However, the system will be moving into a much
drier atmosphere with strengthening southerly shear, which should
cause weakening to begin in about 36 hours.  Organized deep
convection could also dissipate in a couple of days, and the
cyclone is forecast to become a remnant low by 48 hours.  Global
model fields suggest the remnant low could last a little bit longer
than shown in the previous forecast, and dissipation is now shown a
day later on day 5.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia
was located near latitude 32.0 North, longitude 66.5 West.  Idalia 
is moving toward the east-southeast near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this
general trajectory at a slower forward speed is expected through 
early Saturday.  A turn toward the east and then northeast is 
forecast over the weekend.  On the forecast track, the center of
Idalia will move near or to the south of Bermuda on Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Additional weakening is forecast through early Saturday.
Little change in strength is expected during the next few days. 
Idalia could transition to a tropical or subtropical storm on 
Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda by
Saturday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 3 to 5 
inches, or 75 to 125 millimeters, across Bermuda through the 
weekend.  The heavy rainfall will likely cause areas of flash and 
urban flooding on the island.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia will affect the southeastern U.S.
coast and Bermuda during the next couple of days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
500 PM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
Idalia is still an extratropical cyclone lacking deep convection.  
ASCAT data from a few hours ago showed winds of 40-45 kt to the 
northwest of the center, so the initial intensity is set at 45 kt.

The initial motion is still toward the east-southeast (105 degrees), 
but the forward speed has slowed down to about 13 kt.  Idalia is 
becoming collocated with a developing mid-level low, and it is 
therefore expected to slow down further and turn eastward during 
the next 24 hours as it moves near Bermuda.  After 24 hours, a 
shortwave trough is forecast to move off the coast of New England 
and kick Idalia faster toward the northeast through day 3.  But 
then that shortwave trough is expected to cut off and cause Idalia 
to slow down again on days 4 and 5 while it moves generally 
northward.  The NHC track forecast is shifted a bit to the left of 
the previous forecast based on the latest track guidance, and to 
account for a slight adjustment to the initial position.

ECMWF- and GFS-based simulated satellite imagery insist that deep 
convection will redevelop with Idalia tonight or on Saturday as the 
system moves over warmer waters and while vertical shear is 
relatively low.  However, the associated frontal zone does not 
appear to completely dissipate in the global model fields, and FSU 
phase-space diagrams indicate that the cyclone is likely to have a 
symmetric but shallow warm core.  The NHC forecast continues to show 
Idalia becoming a tropical cyclone on Saturday, however it is 
possible that it could be closer to the subtropical side of the 
spectrum.  Some strengthening is possible during the 
tropical/subtropical phase, and the NHC intensity forecast lies 
close to the IVCN intensity consensus.  Idalia is then expected to 
become fully extratropical again by day 3.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected in Bermuda by Saturday.
Heavy rainfall will likely cause areas of flash and urban flooding
on the island through the weekend.
