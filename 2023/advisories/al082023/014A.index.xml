Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Wed Aug 23 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Franklin, located just north of the Dominican Republic. <br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (Remnants of Emily):<br/>
An area of low pressure located about 1000 miles east-southeast of <br/>
Bermuda (the remnants of former Tropical Storm Emily) continues to <br/>
produce a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms. <br/>
Upper-level winds are forecast to become more conducive for <br/>
development by tomorrow, and this system is likely to regenerate <br/>
into a tropical storm by Friday while the system moves northward <br/>
over the subtropical central Atlantic. For additional information <br/>
on this system, including gale warnings, see High Seas Forecasts <br/>
issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL92):<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue in association with <br/>
an area of low pressure located several hundred miles west of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands.  This system's circulation has become better <br/>
defined since yesterday, despite marginal environmental conditions, <br/>
and further slow development is possible.  The low has the potential <br/>
to become a tropical depression by the weekend while the system <br/>
moves west-northwestward to northwestward into the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Caribbean Sea:<br/>
An area of low pressure could form in a couple of days over the <br/>
northwestern Caribbean Sea.  Some slow development of this system <br/>
is possible over the weekend and early next week while it moves <br/>
slowly northward across the eastern Gulf of Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>

Tropical Storm Franklin Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
1100 PM EDT Wed Aug 23 2023
 
Franklin is showing signs of intensification on the latest satellite 
imagery with increasing deep convection near and southeast of the 
center.  This trend is confirmed by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft mission that has been flying through the storm 
during the past few hours with maximum flight-level winds of 46 kt, 
believable SFMR winds of at least 40 kt, and the central pressure 
falling to 1002 mb.  The initial wind speed is set to 40 kt as a 
blend of the data.
 
The storm continues heading north-northeastward or 015/11 kt, 
steered by a ridge over the eastern Caribbean.  Franklin should move 
around the northern periphery of the ridge, turning 
east-northeastward tomorrow and slowing down by Friday.  As the 
remnants of Emily exit the central Atlantic, mid-level ridging 
should build back northeast of Franklin, turning the cyclone 
north-northwestward and northward this weekend.  For such an unusual 
August track, the model guidance is in reasonably good agreement, 
and little change was made to the last NHC track forecast.
 
Moderate westerly shear is forecast to limit the strengthening rate 
of Franklin during the next couple of days, though very warm waters 
should allow for gradual intensification.  In 2 or 3 days, an 
upper-level trough should cutoff to the southwest of Franklin, 
creating a lower shear and very diffluent flow pattern near the 
storm.  This environmental change will likely promote significant 
strengthening by late this weekend, and Franklin is forecast to 
become a powerful hurricane southwest of Bermuda.  The new intensity 
forecast is raised from the previous one at most time periods, and 
the stronger regional hurricane models showing major hurricane 
strength at long range are certainly reasonable possibilities.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Localized heavy rainfall from the outer bands of Franklin could
cause further isolated flash flooding through Thursday in vulnerable
areas of the Dominican Republic that already received torrential
rainfall.
 
2. Franklin is expected to continue to bring tropical storm 
conditions to portions of the Dominican Republic and the Turks and 
Caicos Islands overnight.
