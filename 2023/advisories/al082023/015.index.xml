Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Thu Aug 24 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Franklin, located just east of the Turks and Caicos. <br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (Remnants of Emily):<br/>
An area of low pressure located about 1000 miles east-southeast of <br/>
Bermuda (the remnants of former Tropical Storm Emily) continues to <br/>
produce a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms. <br/>
Upper-level winds are forecast to become more conducive for <br/>
development later today, and this system is likely to regenerate <br/>
into a tropical storm by Friday while the system moves northward <br/>
over the subtropical central Atlantic. For additional information on <br/>
this system, including gale warnings, see High Seas Forecasts issued <br/>
by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL92):<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue in association with <br/>
an area of low pressure located several hundred miles west of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands.  Despite marginal environmental conditions, <br/>
slow development is possible and the low could become a tropical <br/>
depression by the weekend while the system moves west-northwestward <br/>
to northwestward into the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Caribbean Sea:<br/>
An area of low pressure could form in a couple of days over the <br/>
northwestern Caribbean Sea.  Some gradual development of this system <br/>
is possible over the weekend and early next week, and a tropical <br/>
depression could form while it moves slowly northward across the <br/>
eastern Gulf of Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>

Tropical Storm Franklin Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 AM EDT Thu Aug 24 2023
 
Franklin is pulling away from the Dominican Republic and the Turks
and Caicos, and appears to be gradually gaining strength.  Satellite
images show deep convection increasing near and to the east of the
center, and the Air Force Hurricane Hunters reported that a partial
eyewall was developing on their last pass through the storm.  The
initial intensity of 45 kt is based on the earlier reconnaissance
data and is also near the average of the various satellite intensity
estimates.
 
The tropical storm is moving northward at 11 kt and is being steered
by the western periphery of a mid-level ridge that is centered over
the central subtropical Atlantic.  The ridge is expected to weaken
soon, and that should cause Franklin to turn northeastward and slow
down during the next couple of days.  However, beyond that time, the
models show the ridge building back to the west, and the flow
between that feature and a mid- to upper-level trough over the
eastern U.S. should cause Franklin to bend back northward at a
slightly faster pace.  The models have shifted a little to the left
this cycle, and the NHC track forecast has been nudged in that
direction and takes the system to the west of Bermuda early next
week.
 
Franklin appears to be on a gradual strengthening trend, and that is
expected to continue through the weekend as the storm remains over
warm waters, in a moist environment, and in generally moderate wind
shear conditions.  All of the normally skillful intensity models
bring Franklin to hurricane strength in a few days, and the NHC
intensity forecast follows that theme.  This forecast is similar to
the previous one and near the high end of the model guidance.
