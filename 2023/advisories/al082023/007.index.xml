Tropical Depression Gert Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
500 AM AST Tue Aug 22 2023
 
Gert is a very disorganized system and may no longer have a closed 
circulation.  Consequently, we'll await further justification 
from the conventional visible imagery and this morning's 
scatterometer passes.  The current intensity estimate remains at 25 
kt in agreement with a Dvorak estimate from SAB.

The statistical-dynamical SHIPS intensity guidance suggests 
that strong shear should weaken the system further while it moves 
west-northwestward, and Gert is forecast to open up into a trough of 
low-pressure, and this is explicitly shown in the NHC forecast.  
Once again, no significant changes were made to the NHC track or 
intensity forecasts, which is also in agreement with the latest 
multi-model consensus and global model forecasts.

Tropical Storm Franklin Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 AM EDT Tue Aug 22 2023
 
Although deep convection has increased overnight in areal extent 
with frigid cloud top temperatures of -84 Celsius, Franklin remains 
a somewhat disorganized tropical cyclone.  Unfortunately, neither 
the METOP-B and C scatterometer passes (both misses) or microwave 
data were helpful in determining with confidence the center of 
circulation.  Best estimate is near the new deep convective bursts 
near the northwest edge of the convective overcast.  The initial 
intensity is held at 45 kt for this advisory and is supported by 
the TAFB and SAB satellite intensity estimates, and a blend of the 
latest UW-CIMSS objective techniques.  
 
The deep-layer flow southeast of a mid-Atlantic trough to the
northwest of Franklin is producing moderate southwesterly vertical
wind shear over the cyclone.  Statistical-dynamical ECMWF and GFS 
SHIPS guidance indicate that Franklin will remain in a harsh shear 
environment for next several days, and interaction with the higher 
mountainous elevations as it traverses Hispaniola should further 
disrupt the storm's circulation.  By the weekend, however, the 
global models are in good agreement that the upper wind pattern
will become more conducive for strengthening and the official
forecast shows Franklin become a hurricane over the southwest
Atlantic by day 4.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be an uncertain northwestward 
drift at 325/3 kt.  Intermittent deep bursts of convection due to a 
moderate deep-layer wind shear environment can induce surface 
center reformation, particularly where the coldest cloud top 
temperatures and the mid-level circulation center resides. Franklin 
should remain in a weak synoptic steering current due to the 
previously mentioned high amplitude mid-atlantic trough in the 
western Atlantic for the next 12 hours or so.  A subtropical high 
eventually builds in to the east of Franklin, which should 
induce a northward motion, and then a northeastward track after the 
48 hour period.  Toward the end of the forecast period, Franklin is 
expected to turn generally northward as a mid-latitude shortwave 
pulse moves off of the eastern seaboard on Sunday and strengthens 
the weakness over the western Atlantic.  The forecast track lies 
between the TVCA simple multi-model consensus the the HFIP corrected 
consensus aid, and is slightly faster (along-track spread) than the 
previous advisory between the 48 and 72 hour periods.
  
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Franklin is expected across portions of 
Puerto Rico and Hispaniola into Thursday. The heavy rainfall may 
produce areas of flash and urban flooding as well as river rises and 
mudslides. Across Hispaniola, significant and potentially 
life-threatening flash flooding is possible today into Wednesday.
 
2. Franklin is expected to bring tropical storm conditions to
portions of the Dominican Republic and Haiti beginning today
where Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect.

expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within 12
hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within 12 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in eastern Texas and northern Mexico should
monitor the progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Harold was
located near latitude 25.8 North, longitude 95.1 West.  Harold is
moving toward the west-northwest near 18 mph (30 km/h).  This 
general motion is expected to continue through tonight, and the 
system is forecast to move inland over south Texas by midday today.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is possible before Harold reaches the Texas
coast.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Harold can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
RAINFALL: Harold is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 3 to 5
inches, with isolated higher amounts of 7 inches, across South Texas
through early Wednesday.  Scattered instances of flash flooding will
be possible.
 
Across Mexico, rainfall amounts of 4 to 6 inches, with local amounts
of 10 inches, are expected across portions of northern Coahuila and
northern Nuevo Leon Tuesday through Wednesday.  Scattered instances
of flash flooding are expected.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area
and are possible in the watch area beginning early today.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Mouth of Rio Grande to Sargent, including Baffin Bay, Corpus
Christi Bay and Matagorda Bay...1 to 3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
TORNADOES: A couple of tornadoes are possible across south Texas
through the afternoon.
 
SURF: Large swells will affect portions of southern Texas through
Tuesday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Harold Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>

Tropical Storm Harold Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092023
400 AM CDT Tue Aug 22 2023
 
Air Force Hurricane Hunter wind observations indicate that the 
cyclone strengthened to a tropical storm earlier this morning.  
However, the circulation is not very well defined and the low-level 
center is somewhat elongated from south to north.  Imagery from the 
Brownsville WSR-88D radar shows broad cyclonic turning, with curved 
rain bands moving onshore of the south Texas coast.
 
Harold is embedded in strong deep-layer easterlies on the southern 
periphery of a large anticyclone over the east-central United 
States.  As a result, the cyclone is moving fairly briskly toward 
the west-northwest at around 285/16 kt.  This general motion should 
continue through tonight, and the official forecast is quite 
similar to the previous one.  This is also very close to the latest 
corrected consensus, HCCA prediction.

The system still has a short time to strengthen over the warm Gulf 
waters, and the latest SHIPS guidance shows slight strengthening  
within the next 12 hours.  This is reflected in the official 
forecast.  Since the cyclone does not have a well-defined inner 
core, however, rapid intensification is not likely before landfall.


KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Tropical Storm Harold is expected across
South Texas through early Wednesday, and may produce areas of flash
and urban flooding. Across portions of northern Coahuila and
northern Nuevo Leon in Mexico, flash flooding with possible
landslides in mountainous terrain is expected Tuesday through
Wednesday.
 
2. Coastal flooding is possible along the south Texas coast
today through Tuesday evening.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area,and
are possible in the watch area, within a few hours.
