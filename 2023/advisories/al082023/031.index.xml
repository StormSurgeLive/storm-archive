NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 AM EDT Mon Aug 28 2023
 
...FRANKLIN BECOMES THE FIRST MAJOR HURRICANE OF THE 2023
ATLANTIC HURRICANE SEASON...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM EDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...27.2N 70.8W
ABOUT 395 MI...635 KM N OF GRAND TURK ISLAND
ABOUT 505 MI...810 KM SW OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...115 MPH...185 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 335 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...956 MB...28.23 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of this system.
Watches will likely be required for Bermuda later today.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Franklin was
located near latitude 27.2 North, longitude 70.8 West. Franklin is
moving toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A gradual
turn toward the north and north-northeast with a slightly faster
forward speed is expected during the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 115 mph (185 km/h) 
with higher gusts. This makes Franklin a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Some additional strengthening 
is forecast today, but gradual weakening is expected to begin by 
Tuesday afternoon. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 956 mb (28.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Franklin are beginning to affect Bermuda.
These swells are expected to spread toward the east coast of the
United States during the next couple of days, likely resulting in
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  31
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 AM EDT Mon Aug 28 2023

Franklin has continued to improve in organization during the 
overnight hours. The eye noted in the previous advisory has 
occasionally cleared out on infrared satellite imagery, with the 
cold eyewall temperatures surrounding it cooling to between -65 to 
-75 C in a thick region around the center. Subjective Dvorak 
classifications were both T5.5/102 kt from TAFB and SAB, while 
UW-CIMSS ADT estimates are now as high as T5.7/107 kt. The initial 
intensity was raised to 100 kt at 06 UTC, and that will remain the 
intensity at 09 UTC. While this may be slightly conservative, 
earlier aircraft data showed that the maximum winds were lagging the 
satellite presentation and minimum pressure of the hurricane. This 
intensity still makes Franklin the first major hurricane of the 2023 
Atlantic hurricane season. Another Air Force Reconnaissance mission 
will be in the hurricane this morning to provide an updated 
assessment of the storm.

The hurricane continues to make a gradual turn northward, with the 
latest motion estimate still north-northwest at 335/7 kt. Over the 
next 48 hours the hurricane should continue to turn northward and 
then north-eastward as it rounds the western periphery of a 
subtropical ridge, and very little change was made to the NHC track 
over this time period. After 48 hours, there continues to be 
significant spread, especially in the along-track direction, related 
to how much a mid-latitude trough ejecting out of Canada is able to 
capture the hurricane. The big change this forecast cycle is that 
the ECMWF has come on board showing a trough capture, though it 
still remains slower than the majority of the guidance suite. The 
latest NHC track forecast has thus been adjusted a bit north and is 
quite a bit faster after 48 hours, but is not quite as fast as the 
TCVN and HCCA consensus aids over this period. 

Some additional intensification is anticipated today, as Franklin 
remains in a low shear environment and is over warm 29-30 C 
sea-surface temperatures. The latest intensity forecast still peaks 
Franklin as a Category 4 (115-kt) major hurricane. However, 
inner-core changes, such as eyewall replacement cycles, could occur 
at any time, making it somewhat tricky to pinpoint exactly when 
Franklin will reach peak intensity. After 24 hours, the broadening 
wind field and relatively slow storm motion could make the hurricane 
prone to some local upwelling. In addition, some northwesterly 
shear may also begin to affect the storm. Toward the end of the 
forecast period, more dramatic weakening is possible as the storm 
gets swept up in the mid-latitudes. The latest forecast shows the 
storm becoming a post-tropical extratropical cyclone in 120 h, 
though this could occur sooner than forecasted if the faster 
solutions, like the GFS, pan out.  

The current forecast shows the core of Franklin passing west and 
north of Bermuda in about 60 h, but a tropical storm watch may still 
become necessary later today as its expanding 34-kt wind field to 
the southeast does get close to the island after 48 hours.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Idalia was
located by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near 
latitude 19.7 North, longitude 85.3 West. Idalia has been moving 
erratically and is nearly stationary.  A motion toward the 
north-northeast and north is expected to begin later today,
bringing the center of Idalia over the extreme southeastern Gulf of
Mexico by tonight.  Idalia will then continue on a northward or
north-northeastward path over the eastern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday
and reach the Gulf coast of Florida on Wednesday.
 
Aircraft data indicate that the maximum sustained winds remain near 
60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.  Strengthening is forecast, and 
Idalia is expected to become a hurricane later today.  Idalia is 
likely to be near or at major hurricane intensity when it reaches 
the Gulf coast of Florida.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.  NOAA buoy 42056 recently reported a sustained wind
of 44 mph (70 km/h) and a gust to 56 mph (91 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data is 
990 mb (29.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Aucilla River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...7-11 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...6-9 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Aucilla River, FL...4-7 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...4-7 ft
Tampa Bay...4-7 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...3-5 ft
Englewood, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...2-4 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...1-3 ft
Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet above
normal tide levels along the southern coast of Pinar del Rio, Cuba.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area in western Cuba by late today.  Winds are expected to
first reach tropical storm strength by this morning, making
outside preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to
protect life and property should be rushed to completion.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
tropical storm warning area over the Yucatan Peninsula and the Isle
of Youth in Cuba through today
 
Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area by
late Tuesday or Wednesday, with tropical storm conditions possible
by Tuesday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the Dry Tortugas beginning
late today and within the tropical storm watch area along the
Florida Gulf coast on Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts:
 
Portions of the eastern Yucatan: 1 to 3 inches, with isolated higher
totals of 5 inches.
 
Western Cuba: 3 to 6 inches, with isolated higher totals of 10
inches.
 
Portions of the west coast of Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and
southern Georgia: From Tuesday into Wednesday, 3 to 6 inches, with
isolated higher totals of 10 inches.
 
Heavy rainfall is also expected across portions of the Carolinas by
Wednesday into Thursday.
 
Heavy rainfall from Tropical Storm Idalia is expected across
portions of the eastern Yucatan and western Cuba and may produce
areas of flash and urban flooding as well as landslides across
western Cuba. Scattered flash and urban flooding is expected across
portions of the west coast of Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and
southern Georgia late Tuesday night through Wednesday. Heavy
rainfall may lead to flash flooding across portions of the Carolinas
Wednesday into Thursday.

<title>Tropical Storm Idalia Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Idalia Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
1000 PM CDT Sun Aug 27 2023
 
Idalia's center has become embedded beneath a large burst of deep
convection, with overshooting cloud-top temperatures as cold as -82
degrees Celsius.  NOAA buoy 42056, located just to the east of the
center, has reported maximum 1-minute sustained winds as high as 45
kt within the past hour or two.  The anemometer height of the buoy
is 4 meters, so converting the wind to a standard 10-meter height
indicates that Idalia's intensity is now up to at least 50 kt, which
is the initial intensity for this advisory.  An Air Force Reserve
reconnaissance aircraft is scheduled to investigate Idalia in a few
hours.
 
The center has been moving erratically since earlier today, and may
have even sagged southward, pulled toward the recently developed
deep convection.  A northward motion is expected to begin on Monday
and continue through Tuesday as Idalia moves between a mid-level
trough over the central Gulf of Mexico and strengthening ridging
over the Greater Antilles.  After 48 hours, a gradual turn toward
the northeast and then east is anticipated due to a deeper trough
that is expected to swing across the Great Lakes.  No significant
changes were required for the updated NHC track forecast compared
to the previous prediction.  The spread among the track models
remains relatively low, and the official track continues to lie
closest to the ECMWF and HCCA consensus aid.
 
Idalia is sitting over very warm waters of about 30 degrees
Celsius, and when it moves northward, it will be over the even
deeper warm waters of the Loop Current in 24-36 hours.  Although
the trough over the Gulf could impart some shear over the system,
this is likely to be offset by upper-level diffluence.  Idalia has
already strengthened more than anticipated, and the environment
looks ripe for additional intensification, possibly rapid.  The NHC
intensity forecast has been increased and lies at the upper bound of
the guidance.  The new prediction now shows a 95-kt hurricane over
the eastern Gulf of Mexico at 48 hours, but it should be stressed
that additional strengthening to major hurricane strength is
becoming increasingly likely before Idalia reaches the Gulf coast
of Florida.  Interests within the storm surge and hurricane watch
areas are urged to prepare for possible significant impacts and
monitor future updates to the forecast.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Idalia is forecast to become a hurricane by the time it reaches
the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, and it could be near or at major
hurricane strength when it reaches the Gulf coast of Florida.  The
risk continues to increase for a life-threatening storm surge and
hurricane-force winds along portions of the west coast of Florida
and the Florida Panhandle beginning as early as Tuesday.  Storm
surge and hurricane watches are in effect for portions of the
west coast of Florida and the coast of the Florida Panhandle, and
residents in these areas should monitor updates to the forecast and
follow any advice given by local officials.
 
2. Scattered flash and urban flooding is expected across portions of
the west coast of Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and southern
Georgia late Tuesday night through Wednesday. Heavy rainfall may
lead to flash flooding across portions of the Carolinas Wednesday
into Thursday.
 
3. Hurricane-force winds are expected across portions of far
western Cuba late Monday.  Heavy rainfall is expected across
portions of the eastern Yucatan and western Cuba and may produce
areas of flash and urban flooding as well as landslides across
western Cuba.
