Tropical Depression Eleven Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112023
1100 AM AST Tue Aug 29 2023

Visible satellite imagery and recent scatterometer data indicate 
that the area of low pressure over the central subtropical Atlantic 
has become better defined.  Deep convection associated with the 
system has persisted since yesterday, but it is located over the 
eastern side of the circulation due to moderate westerly shear.  The 
ASCAT data revealed believable peak winds of around 30 kt, and that 
is the basis for the initial intensity for this advisory.  Guidance 
suggests that the shear could decrease slightly in the short term 
which could allow for some slight strengthening. The NHC forecast 
follows that scenario and calls for the depression to become a 
tropical storm within the next 12 to 24 hours.  After that time, the 
shear is forecast to increase markedly and no additional 
strengthening is indicated.  By 72 hours, the system is forecast to 
become post-tropical, and dissipation is indicated by 96 hours.  
Both of those events could occur sooner than indicated below. 

The depression is currently moving slowly northward or 360/2 kt.  A 
slow north-northwestward to northward motion is forecast during the 
day or so as a mid-level ridge currently to the north of the 
depression slides eastward.  After that time, a slightly faster 
northward to north-northeastward motion is expected as the cyclone 
is steered between the aforementioned ridge and Hurricane Franklin 
to its west.  The NHC forecast is between the HFIP corrected 
consensus and the various multi-model consensus aids.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Franklin was
located near latitude 31.0 North, longitude 70.2 West. Franklin is
moving toward the north-northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h). A
north-northeastward to northeastward motion with a faster forward
speed is expected during the next few days. On the forecast track,
the center of Franklin is expected to pass to the northwest of
Bermuda on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (200 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Franklin is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Steady weakening is forecast during the next
several days, but Franklin will remain a hurricane through late this
week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150
miles (240 km). NOAA Buoy 41048 west of Bermuda recently reported a 
sustained wind of 43 mph (69 km/h) and a gust of 59 mph (95 km/h). 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 947 mb (27.97 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Life-threatening surf and rip currents generated by Franklin
are already affecting Bermuda and the east coast of the United
States. These conditions are expected to continue during the next
several days.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to reach Bermuda by
Wednesday morning, making outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Hurricane Franklin Forecast Discussion Number 36</title>

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  36
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
1100 AM EDT Tue Aug 29 2023

Visible, infrared, and microwave satellite imagery indicates that 
Franklin is undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle with an outer 
concentric band becoming more dominant. The inner eyewall has become 
a little more ragged, and has started to collapse on the northern 
side. A 1137z 91GHz/37GHz SSMIS microwave pass confirmed the outer 
eyewall is becoming more dominant as well. The subjective and 
objective Dvorak estimates were in fairly good agreement this cycle, 
with a data-T of 5.5 and Final-T of 6.0 from both TAFB and UW-CIMSS 
ADT. Given the ongoing inner structural changes and the slightly 
weaker appearance on satellite, the initial intensity for this 
advisory lowered to 115 kt for this advisory. 
 
Franklin is moving north-northeastward at around 10 kt. A more 
northeastward motion is expected later today as the hurricane rounds 
the edge of the subtropical ridge and gets caught in the 
southwesterly flow ahead of a mid-latitude trough moving off the 
northeast U.S. coast and Atlantic Canada. There still remains a good 
amount of spread in the track guidance envelope with the GFS faster 
and further north, and the ECMWF slower and further south. The NHC 
track lies in the middle of the guidance, near the consensus aids 
TVCA and HCCA. Even though the center of Franklin is forecast to 
pass to the northwest of Bermuda on Wednesday, tropical-storm-force 
winds associated with the hurricane are expected to extend well to 
the southeast of the center.
 
The intensity forecast remains similar to the previous forecast. 
Franklin is expected to continue weakening, as it begins to move 
northward over cooler waters. ECMWF and GFS SHIPS guidance also 
forecast the vertical wind shear to increase over the hurricane in 
about 36 h. The current NHC forecast has Franklin becoming 
extratropical in 4 days. There is some guidance, including the GFS, 
that have this transition occurring a little faster, while the 
ECMWF is a little slower with this transition.


KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
Wednesday morning, when Franklin is forecast to make its closest
approach to the island.
 
2. Life-threatening surf and rip currents are occurring along the
east coast of the United States. These conditions are expected to 
continue during the next several days.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Idalia was located
near latitude 25.2 North, longitude 84.9 West.  Idalia is moving
toward the north near 15 mph (24 km/h).  A faster motion toward the
north and north-northeast is expected through early Wednesday while
Idalia approaches the Gulf coast of Florida.  A turn toward the
northeast and east-northeast is forecast late Wednesday and
Thursday, bringing the center of Idalia near or along the coasts of
Georgia and the Carolinas.
 
Satellite images indicate that Idalia continues to strengthen, and 
maximum sustained winds have increased to near 90 mph (150 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Rapid intensification is expected before
landfall, and Idalia is forecast to be a major hurricane when it
reaches the Gulf coast of Florida Wednesday morning.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160
miles (260 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 974 mb (28.76 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Aucilla River, FL to Yankeetown, FL...10-15 ft
Yankeetown to Chassahowitzka, FL...7-11 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Aucilla River, FL...7-11 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...6-9 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...4-7 ft
Tampa Bay...4-7 ft
Carrabelle, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...4-7 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...3-5 ft
Englewood, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Carrabelle, FL...3-5 ft
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to South Santee, SC...2-4 ft
South Santee, SC to Surf City, NC...1-3 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...1-3 ft
Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL to Mouth of St. Mary's River...1-3
ft
Indian Pass to Mexico Beach...1 to 3 ft.
Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances. For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane 
warning area in Florida by tonight or early Wednesday, with tropical 
storm conditions beginning today.
 
Tropical storm conditions are occurring in the Dry Tortugas and are 
possible within the Lower Florida Keys.  Tropical storm conditions 
will begin within the tropical storm warning area along the Florida 
Gulf coast and the Florida west coast later today.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin on Wednesday in the
warning area along the east coast of Florida, Georgia, and South
Carolina.  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area in South and North Carolina Wednesday night and Thursday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts:
 
Western Cuba: 4 to 7 inches, with isolated higher totals of 10
inches.
 
Portions of the west coast of Florida, the Florida Panhandle,
southeast Georgia and the eastern Carolinas: 4 to 8 inches from
Tuesday into Thursday. Isolated higher totals of 12 inches possible,
primarily near landfall in northern Florida.
 
This rainfall may lead to flash and urban flooding, and landslides
across western Cuba.
 
Areas of flash and urban flooding, some of which may be locally
significant, are expected across portions of the west coast of
Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and southern Georgia Tuesday into
Wednesday, spreading into portions of the eastern Carolinas
Wednesday into Thursday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia are affecting the southwestern 
coast of Florida and will spread northward and westward to the 
north-central Gulf coast through Wednesday.  Swells affecting 
portions of the southern coast of Cuba will subside tonight.  These 
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes will be possible along the west central
Florida coast through tonight.  The tornado threat will also spread
northward into the Florida Big Bend tonight, and toward southeast
Georgia and the coastal Carolinas Wednesday.

<title>Hurricane Idalia Forecast Discussion Number 12</title>

Hurricane Idalia Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
1100 AM EDT Tue Aug 29 2023
 
WSR-88D radar data from Key West shows that Idalia's eye is
becoming better defined at an elevation of 30,000 feet, although an
eye has not yet become apparent in visible satellite imagery.  A
NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported a closed eye 20-25 n mi in
diameter, SFMR winds as high as 70 kt, and a central pressure down
to 976 mb.  This pressure, and assuming some undersampling of the
SFMR, supports an initial intensity of 75 kt.
 
Idalia is moving just east of due north, or 005/12 kt, between a
mid-level trough over the Gulf of Mexico and subtropical ridging
over the Greater Antilles.  A faster motion toward the north or
north-northeast is expected while Idalia approaches the Florida
coast through Wednesday morning.  Confidence is increasing that
Idalia will reach the coast of Florida adjacent to Apalachee Bay
Wednesday morning, with all of the reliable deterministic track
models honed in on that area.  Track spread remains low during
Idalia's expected turn toward the northeast and east-northeast in
48-60 hours, bringing the storm's center near or along the coast of
the Carolinas.  On days 3 through 5, there is significant
uncertainty on whether Idalia will turn out to sea (as shown by the
COAMPS-TC and HAFS models) or turn southward (as suggested by the
global models).  For now, the official forecast shows a slow motion
at the end of the forecast period until the scenario becomes
clearer.
 
Idalia is currently over a maximum of oceanic heat content
associated with the Loop Current, and water temperatures remain
30-31 degrees Celsius along the forecast path up until landfall.
Vertical shear is also expected to be low for the next 18-24 hours,
and these conditions are expected to foster rapid intensification
before Idalia reaches the coast of Florida.  The 06 UTC runs of all
4 regional hurricane models (HAFS-A, HAFS-B, HWRF, and HMON) show
Idalia potentially reaching an intensity of 110-120 kt in 24 hours,
and as a result, the new NHC intensity forecast indicates a peak
intensity of 110 kt just before landfall.  Weakening is forecast
while the center of Idalia moves over land, but the system is
expected to be a tropical storm while it moves near or along the
coasts of Georgia and the Carolinas through Thursday.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Catastrophic impacts from storm surge inundation of 10 to 15 feet
above ground level and destructive waves are expected somewhere
between Aucilla River and Yankeetown, Florida. Life-threatening
storm surge inundation is likely elsewhere along portions of the
Florida Gulf Coast where a Storm Surge Warning is in effect.
Residents in these areas should follow any advice or evacuation
orders given by local officials.
 
2. There is the potential for destructive life-threatening winds
where the core of Idalia moves onshore in the Big Bend region of
Florida, with hurricane conditions expected elsewhere in portions of
the Hurricane Warning area along the Florida Gulf Coast. Strong
winds will also spread inland across portions of northern Florida
and southern Georgia near the track of the center of Idalia where
Hurricane Warnings are in effect. Residents in these areas should be
prepared for long-duration power outages.
 
3. Areas of flash and urban flooding, some of which may be locally
significant, are expected across portions of the west coast of
Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and southern Georgia Tuesday into
Wednesday, spreading into portions of the eastern Carolinas
Wednesday into Thursday.
 
4. Heavy rainfall from Tropical Storm Idalia is expected across
portions western Cuba and may produce areas of flash and urban
flooding as well as landslides.
