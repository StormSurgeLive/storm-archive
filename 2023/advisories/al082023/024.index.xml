Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Sat Aug 26 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Franklin, located several hundred miles south of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Caribbean Sea and Eastern Gulf of Mexico (AL93):<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity continues to show signs of <br/>
organization in association with an area of low pressure located <br/>
near the Yucatan Channel.  Environmental conditions appear conducive <br/>
for further development of this system, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form within the next day or two while it moves generally <br/>
northward over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico.  Interests in the <br/>
Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, western Cuba, and Florida should <br/>
monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL92):<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue in association with <br/>
a broad area of low pressure located about 1000 miles <br/>
east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands.  Environmental <br/>
conditions could become more conducive for development over the <br/>
next few days, and a tropical depression could form early next week <br/>
while the system moves generally northwestward over the central <br/>
subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is forecast to move off the west coast of Africa <br/>
early next week. Some slow development of this system is possible <br/>
during the latter part of next week while the system moves westward <br/>
across the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

<title>Hurricane Franklin Forecast Discussion Number 23</title>

Tropical Storm Franklin Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 AM AST Sat Aug 26 2023
 
Franklin is gradually getting better organized.  During the past 
couple of days, deep convection has been mainly confined to the east 
of the center.  However, there has been a change recently with the 
convective pattern becoming a little more symmetric, likely due to a 
decrease in vertical wind shear.  The Dvorak classifications from 
TAFB and SAB have increased to 3.5/55 kt, and the initial intensity 
is raised to that value.
 
The storm is still moving east-northeastward at 6 kt, but a sharp
northward turn is expected to occur later today as a ridge builds to
the east of the system over the central Atlantic.  A northward to
north-northwestward motion is forecast during the next few days as
the storm moves along the western periphery of the ridge, taking it
to the west of Bermuda on Tuesday.  By the middle of next week, a
faster northeastward motion is expected when Franklin moves in the
flow between the ridge and a mid- to upper-level trough over eastern
Canada and the northeastern U.S.  The track models have shifted to
the west this cycle, and the NHC track forecast follows that theme
and is a little slower than the previous one at days 4 and 5.
 
Franklin is expected to steadily strengthen during the next few days 
as the vertical wind shear becomes light while the storm remains 
over warm water and in a relatively moist environment.  Franklin 
will likely become a hurricane by tonight and possibly a major 
hurricane early next week.  The strengthening trend should end in 3 
to 4 days when the shear is expected to increase and weakening 
should commence in 4 to 5 days when Franklin is forecast to move 
over much cooler waters.  The intensity models are higher this 
cycle, and the NHC forecast has been nudged upward, close to the 
IVCN and HCCA models.
