Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Wed Aug 30 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Franklin, located north of Bermuda, on recently downgraded Tropical <br/>
Storm Idalia, located over southern South Carolina, and on Tropical <br/>
Depression Eleven, located several hundred miles east-southeast of <br/>
Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
An area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave located near <br/>
the Cabo Verde Islands is producing disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms. Environmental conditions appear conducive for gradual <br/>
development of this system, and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form later this week while the system moves west-northwestward to <br/>
northwestward across the eastern tropical Atlantic.  Interests in <br/>
the Cabo Verde Islands should monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (Remnants of Gert):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a trough of low pressure <br/>
(the remnants of Gert) are located several hundred miles north of <br/>
the northern Leeward Islands. Environmental conditions are becoming <br/>
unfavorable for additional development as the system drifts <br/>
northward or north-northeastward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Eleven Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112023
1100 PM AST Wed Aug 30 2023
 
There has been a healthy burst of convection near the estimated 
low-level center this evening.  Microwave satellite imagery shows 
some small curved bands on the eastern portion of the circulation.  
The initial intensity is held at 30 kt for this advisory, closest to 
the subjective Dvorak estimate from SAB.
 
The depression continues to meander over the open waters of
the central Atlantic.  Model guidance predicts it will begin moving
to the north soon, and gradually increase in forward speed over the
next day or so between the flow of a subtropical ridge to its east 
and the flow around Hurricane Franklin to its west.  Only minor 
adjustments have been made to latest official track forecast.
 
There have also been no changes to the intensity forecast.  
Global models indicate the depression should lose deep, 
organized convection within a day or so, and the official forecast 
shows it becoming a remnant low in 36 h and dissipating by day 2.

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  42
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
1100 PM AST Wed Aug 30 2023
 
Satellite imagery indicates the eye of Franklin is beginning to lose 
its definition and become cloud-filled.  Radar imagery from Bermuda 
shows outer rain bands have been crossing the island this evening, 
bringing sustained tropical-storm-force winds and gusty conditions.  
The initial intensity estimate for this advisory has been lowered to 
85 kt based on a blend of the CI and Final T-numbers from both TAFB 
and SAB.
 
Franklin has turned to the east-northeast at an estimated 12 kt, 
passing to the north of Bermuda.  The hurricane is moving in the 
flow between a subtropical ridge over the central Atlantic and a 
trough over the northeastern U.S.  Track guidance in the first 48 h 
remains decently-clustered, showing Franklin continuing generally 
east-northeastward with an increased forward speed.  By 60 hours 
and beyond, there is a larger spread in the guidance as Franklin 
turns northeastward while it interacts with the upper-level trough. 
The NHC track forecast is similar to the previous prediction and 
lies between the simple consensus aid, TVCN, and the corrected 
consensus aid, HCCA.

Based on the latest satellite trends, Franklin is continuing to 
weaken in an environment of significant northerly vertical wind 
shear.  Only minor adjustments have been made to the latest official 
forecast, which shows gradual weakening through 60 hours as the 
vertical wind shear is expected to increase.  By day 3, Franklin is 
expected to become a strong extratropical cyclone, though this could 
occur even sooner. 
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions, mainly in gusts, are occuring on
Bermuda this evening while Franklin passes north of the island.
 
2. Life-threatening surf and rip currents are occurring along the
east coast of the United States. These conditions are expected to
continue during the next day or two.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Idalia was
located near latitude 33.0 North, longitude 80.0 West.  Idalia is
moving toward the northeast near 21 mph (33 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue through tonight.  An eastward to 
east-southeastward motion is forecast to begin on Thursday and 
continue through Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Idalia will move near or along the coast of South Carolina through 
tonight, and then just offshore of the coast of North Carolina on 
Thursday.  Idalia will then move over the western Atlantic into the 
weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast during the 
next 48 hours, and Idalia is expected to remain a tropical storm 
when if moves off the coast.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km) 
from the center.  A sustained wind of 48 mph (78 km/h) and a gust to 
58 mph (94 km/h) were recently reported from saildrone SD-1045 which 
is located off the South Carolina coast. 

The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Beaufort Inlet, NC to Ocracoke Inlet, NC...2-4 ft
Savannah River to South Santee River, SC...2-4 ft
Neuse and Bay Rivers...2-4 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...2-4 ft
South Santee River, SC to Beaufort Inlet, NC...1-3 ft
Ocracoke Inlet, NC to Duck, NC...1-3 ft
Altamaha Sound, GA to Savannah River...1-3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring within the tropical
storm warning area along the coast of South Carolina, and will 
spread across coastal sections of North Carolina tonight through 
Thursday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce a storm total of 4 to 8 
inches of rainfall with isolated maxima up to 10 inches from eastern 
South Carolina through eastern North Carolina into Thursday.  These 
rainfall amounts will continue to lead to areas of flash, urban, and 
moderate river flooding, with considerable impacts.  The trailing 
moisture band from Idalia may produce an additional 1 to 2 inches of 
rainfall over the central Florida Peninsula into Thursday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia along the eastern and central Gulf
coast will continue to subside tonight and Thursday.  Swells will 
affect the southeastern U.S. coast during the next few days.  These 
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES:  A couple of tornadoes will be possible through daybreak 
Thursday across coastal North Carolina.

<title>Tropical Storm Idalia Forecast Discussion Number 17</title>

Tropical Storm Idalia Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
500 PM EDT Wed Aug 30 2023
 
Idalia's radar and satellite presentation has become increasingly 
asymmetric.  A coastal front appears to have developed just inland 
of the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina, with heavy rainfall 
being enhanced along and to the northwest of this boundary.  The 
highest WSR-88D velocities observed are about 60-65 kt at an 
elevation of 5000 feet, indicating that Idalia is no longer a 
hurricane.  The advisory intensity is set at 60 kt, which is 
probably a bit generous.

The initial motion is now northeastward, or 035/18 kt, with Idalia 
moving between the northwestern periphery of a mid-level ridge 
located over the Greater Antilles and a deep-layer trough moving 
across the northeastern U.S.  The storm is expected to turn toward 
the east and east-southeast during the next 48 hours, but then slow 
down considerably as the trough lifts out and leaves Idalia behind. 
There is fairly high confidence that Idalia will move slowly 
eastward over the western Atlantic, in the vicinity of Bermuda, 
during the latter part of the forecast period, although there is 
less confidence in the details of that motion due to large model 
spread.

Additional weakening is expected while Idalia's center continues 
moving over land through tonight.  However, once the center moves 
back offshore on Thursday, model fields suggest that Idalia could 
interact with the aforementioned coastal front, with an area of 
stronger winds developing along the boundary near eastern North 
Carolina during the day.  Based on this scenario, the NHC intensity 
forecast closely follows the GFS solution at 24 and 36 hours.  
After 36 hours, there is more uncertainty on Idalia's intensity and 
structure.  Some guidance suggests that Idalia will continue 
interacting with the front and possibly become post-tropical, 
particularly if it struggles to maintain organized deep convection. 
For now, the NHC forecast keeps Idalia as a tropical storm for the 
entire forecast period.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Storm surge is expected along the southeastern U.S. coast within 
the Storm Surge Warning area through tonight.  Coastal flooding is 
also expected within the Storm Surge Watch area in North Carolina on 
Thursday.  Residents in these areas should follow any advice given 
by local officials.
 
2. Tropical-storm-force winds will affect portions of the 
southeastern U.S. coast through Thursday.
 
3. Areas of flash, urban, and moderate river flooding, with 
considerable impacts, are expected from east central Georgia, 
through eastern South Carolina and eastern North Carolina into 
Thursday.
