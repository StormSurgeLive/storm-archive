Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Fri Sep 1 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Franklin, located a few hundred miles northeast of Bermuda, on <br/>
Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia, located midway between the coast of <br/>
North Carolina and Bermuda, and on Tropical Storm Jose, located <br/>
several hundred miles east of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to show signs of organization in <br/>
association with an elongated area of low-pressure located just <br/>
west of the Cabo Verde Islands. A short-lived tropical depression <br/>
or tropical storm is expected to form today while the system moves <br/>
northwestward at 10 to 15 mph across the eastern tropical Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (Remnants of Gert):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms have become better organized during the <br/>
past several hours in association with an area of low-pressure <br/>
located several hundred miles north-northeast of the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands.  If this current trend continues, a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form today before upper-level winds <br/>
become increasingly unfavorable over the weekend.  The system is <br/>
forecast to meander over the subtropical Atlantic through this <br/>
weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa <br/>
this weekend.  Environmental conditions could support some gradual <br/>
development of this system through the middle part of next week <br/>
while it moves westward to west-northwestward over the eastern and <br/>
central portions of the tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Jose Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112023
500 AM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
This morning's satellite presentation consists of a compact,
symmetric cloud pattern with intermittent deep convective bursts of
convection near the surface center.  An earlier AMSR2 microwave
image revealed evidence of a small eye-like mid-level feature.
Based on the much-improved structure, particularly in the microwave 
images, this advisory's initial intensity is raised to 50 kt, but 
it could be stronger.  The intensity philosophy remains unchanged.  
Increasing northerly shear associated with Hurricane Franklin's 
outflow should weaken the cyclone.  By early Saturday, Jose 
is forecast to become absorbed by Franklin and an intruding 
mid-latitude baroclinic system.
 
Jose's initial motion is estimated to be northward, or 005/16 kt.
The small cyclone is being steered by the mid-tropospheric flow
produced by a high pressure to the east over the central Atlantic
and larger Hurricane Franklin approaching from the northwest.  Jose
is expected to accelerate northward through dissipation while the
deep-layer southerly steering flow strengthens.  The deterministic
guidance agrees with this solution, and the NHC forecast lies
close to the HFIP corrected consensus aid.

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  47
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 AM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
Franklin has a much more asymmetric appearance this morning,
indicative of the increasingly disruptive upper-wind pattern
associated with an approaching mid-latitude baroclinic zone.  In 
fact, the remaining deep convective mass is about 100 mi southeast 
of the surface center.  The initial intensity is lowered to 70 kt 
and is based on a compromise of the available subjective and 
objective intensity estimate techniques. 
 
Franklin is showing signs of losing its tropical characteristics
while drier, more stable mid-level air and increasing northwesterly
shear impedes over the northwest portion of the cyclone. 
Consequently, the completion of an extratropical transition is
expected later tonight or early Saturday.  However, little change in
strength is forecast, and Franklin should maintain its 
hurricane-force sustained winds through the weekend.  By early next 
week, gradual weakening is expected, which agrees with a blend of
the intensity consensus guidance and the statistical-dynamic SHIPS
models.
 
Franklin's initial motion is estimated to be east-northeastward or 
060/16 kt.  An increase in forward speed toward the northeast is 
forecast.  At the same time, Franklin moves within the mid-latitude 
steering flow between high pressure to the east, over the central 
Atlantic, and an extensive baroclinic system moving out of the 
Canadian Maritimes.  Global model spread continues to increase 
beyond day 3.  Two scenarios are possible.  The European models 
take a southeastward track while interacting with a larger 
cut-off low meandering west of the Iberian peninsula.  The other 
solution involves the GFS and the regional guidance which gradually 
turns the cyclone northeastward to northward over the northeast 
Atlantic. The official forecast track indicates a blend of the two 
model clusters, lying between both, and is close to the multi-model 
consensus aid.

...IDALIA TURNS EAST-SOUTHEASTWARD...
...EXPECTED TO AFFECT BERMUDA THIS WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...32.6N 69.8W
ABOUT 290 MI...470 KM W OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ESE OR 110 DEGREES AT 16 MPH...26 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...998 MB...29.47 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia
was located near latitude 32.6 North, longitude 69.8 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east-southeast near 16
mph (26 km/h). An east-southeastward to eastward motion at a 
much slower forward speed is expected during the 24 hours.  An 
east-northeastward motion is expected to begin over the weekend.  On
the forecast track, Idalia will approach Bermuda over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual weakening is forecast through early Saturday. 
Restrengthening is possible over the weekend, and Idalia is expected
to transition back to a tropical storm on Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda by 
Saturday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 3 to 5 
inches, or 75 to 125 millimeters, across Bermuda through Sunday 
night. The heavy rainfall will likely cause areas of flash and urban 
flooding on the island.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia will affect the southeastern U.S.
coast during the next couple of days and will reach Bermuda today.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
500 AM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
Idalia remains an extratropical cyclone with a front extending to
the northeast of the center. The system also continues to be devoid 
of deep convection. An earlier ASCAT-B scatterometer overpass 
caught the western portion of the circulation and it revealed peak
winds of around 45 kt.  Based on that data, the initial intensity 
has been lowered to 50 kt for this advisory.

The cyclone appears to be turning east-southeast and slowing down 
as forecast. An even slower east-southeast to eastward motion is 
expected during the next 24 to 36 hours as a mid-latitude trough 
passes to the north of the system.  Another shortwave trough 
exiting the Mid-Atlantic coast of the United States on Sunday is 
expected to cause Idalia to begin moving faster toward the northeast 
later in the weekend.  There is tremendous spread in the track 
guidance after 72 hours. The ECMWF takes Idalia northward ahead of 
the aforementioned trough, while the GFS keeps a much weaker 
cyclone meandering over the central subtropical Atlantic.  The 
latest NHC track forecast lies between these extremes and is close 
to the multi-model consensus aids and the GFS ensemble mean. 

Additional weakening is expected during the next 12-24 hours.  
After that time, simulated satellite imagery from the GFS and ECMWF 
indicate that deep convection is likely to return, potentially 
transitioning Idalia back to a tropical cyclone when it is near 
Bermuda.  Some slight re-strengthening is predicted during that 
time.  Later in the forecast period, little change in strength is 
forecast as vertical wind shear increases and Idalia is likely to  
transition to an extratropical cyclone once again. The 
extratropical transition has been moved up to 96 hours, but the 
latest ECMWF run suggests that the transition could occur much 
sooner.  Given the differences in the global models regarding the 
structure and track of Idalia after 72 hours, there is significant 
uncertainty in the long range track and intensity forecast for 
this system.  
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are possible in Bermuda by Saturday.
Heavy rainfall will likely lead to areas of flash and urban
flooding on the island.
