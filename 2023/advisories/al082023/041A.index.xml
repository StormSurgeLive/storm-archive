Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Wed Aug 30 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Franklin, located a couple hundred miles northwest of Bermuda, on <br/>
Hurricane Idalia, located over southeastern Georgia, and on Tropical <br/>
Depression Eleven, located several hundred miles east-southeast of <br/>
Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave located <br/>
near the Cabo Verde Islands is producing disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms. Environmental conditions appear conducive for gradual <br/>
development of this system, and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form later this week while the system moves west-northwestward to <br/>
northwestward across the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (Remnants of Gert):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a trough of low pressure <br/>
(the remnants of Gert) are located several hundred miles north of <br/>
the northern Leeward Islands. Environmental conditions are becoming <br/>
unfavorable for additional development as the system drifts <br/>
northward or north- northeastward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Eleven Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112023
500 PM AST Wed Aug 30 2023
 
The depression has become a little less organized on visible 
satellite imagery this afternoon, with multiple vortices exposed on 
the western edge of the convection. Satellite intensity estimates 
from TAFB/SAB are around 30 kt, and given the current disorganized 
structure, with an exposed center, the intensity will remain at 30 
kt for this advisory.
 
The depression continues to drift over the central Atlantic.  It 
will slowly move northward later today, and then a little faster 
northward by Thursday. The NHC track forecast is close to the 
previous one, and lies near the corrected consensus aids.
 
The intensity forecast remains unchanged from the previous forecast. 
The depression still may briefly strengthen into a very short-lived 
tropical storm, but most of the intensity guidance keeps the system 
as a depression. As the system moves northward, it will encounter 
dry air and increased vertical wind shear. Therefore, the 
depression is forecast to become a post-tropical remnant low in 
about day or so, and dissipate by 48 h.

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  41
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 PM AST Wed Aug 30 2023
 
The cloud pattern of Franklin has become oblong this afternoon, 
likely due to increasing westerly shear associated with Idalia's 
upper-level outflow. A ring of cold infrared cloud tops still 
surrounds the large eye of the hurricane, which is now somewhat
elliptical in shape. The initial intensity is held at 90 kt, which 
is supported by a T5.0 Dvorak classification from TAFB and UW-CIMSS 
objective estimates between 85-90 kt. Radar images from Bermuda show 
an outer rain band is spreading over the island, which will likely 
result in gusty winds while it passes over the region.

Franklin is moving northeastward (55/11 kt) between a deep-layer 
trough over the northeastern United States and a high pressure ridge 
over the central Atlantic. The track guidance remains in good 
agreement on the hurricane moving generally east-northeastward and 
away from Bermuda during the next couple of days, and little change 
was necessary to this part of the forecast. There are still 
along-track differences in the global models regarding Franklin's 
track at days 3-5 related to its interaction with the upper trough. 
But, there is at least general agreement that the cyclone will turn 
northeastward after it merges with a frontal system over the 
northern Atlantic. The updated NHC track forecast remains relatively 
close to the HFIP corrected consensus approach (HCCA) aid during 
this period.

The satellite structure of Franklin is gradually degrading, and the 
increasing shear that is forecast should keep the hurricane on a 
weakening trend. The updated intensity forecast is fairly similar to 
the previous one, with the most notable change being that Franklin 
is now forecast to become a powerful extratropical cyclone by 72 h. 
Some of the global guidance suggests this could occur even sooner, 
so future forecast adjustments may be necessary. Although weakening 
is forecast, the wind field is likely to grow in size as Franklin 
moves deeper into the mid-latitudes. 
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions, mainly in gusts, are expected on 
Bermuda into this evening while Franklin passes north of the island.
 
2. Life-threatening surf and rip currents are occurring along the
east coast of the United States. These conditions are expected to
continue during the next day or two.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Idalia was
located near latitude 32.7 North, longitude 80.9 West.  Idalia is 
moving toward the northeast near 21 mph (33 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue through tonight.  A generally 
eastward motion is forecast to begin on Thursday and continue 
through Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of Idalia will 
move near or along the coast of South Carolina through tonight, and 
then just offshore of the coast of North Carolina on Thursday.  
Idalia will then move eastward over the western Atlantic into the 
weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Some additional weakening is forecast through 
tonight, but Idalia is expected to remain a tropical storm while it 
moves near the coasts of South Carolina and North Carolina.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
from the center.  A sustained wind of 39 mph (63 km/h) and a gust 
to 50 mph (80 km/h) were recently reported at Folly South End, 
South Carolina, near Charleston.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 985 mb (29.09 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Savannah River to South Santee River, SC...3-5 ft
Saint Catherines Sound, GA to Savannah River...2-4 ft
Beaufort Inlet, NC to Ocracoke Inlet, NC...2-4 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring within the tropical
storm warning area along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina, 
and will spread across coastal sections of North Carolina tonight 
through Thursday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce a swath of 4 to 8 inches of
rainfall with isolated maxima up to 10 inches from east-central
Georgia through central to eastern South Carolina and eastern North
Carolina into Thursday.  These rainfall amounts will lead to areas
of flash, urban, and moderate river flooding, with considerable
impacts.  The trailing moisture band from Idalia has the potential
to produce additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches across the
west coast of Florida.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia along the eastern and central Gulf
coast will subside tonight and Thursday.  Swells will affect the
southeastern U.S. coast during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes will be possible through this evening
across coastal South Carolina and through tonight across southern
coastal North Carolina.

<title>Tropical Storm Idalia Forecast Discussion Number 17</title>

Tropical Storm Idalia Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
500 PM EDT Wed Aug 30 2023
 
Idalia's radar and satellite presentation has become increasingly 
asymmetric.  A coastal front appears to have developed just inland 
of the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina, with heavy rainfall 
being enhanced along and to the northwest of this boundary.  The 
highest WSR-88D velocities observed are about 60-65 kt at an 
elevation of 5000 feet, indicating that Idalia is no longer a 
hurricane.  The advisory intensity is set at 60 kt, which is 
probably a bit generous.

The initial motion is now northeastward, or 035/18 kt, with Idalia 
moving between the northwestern periphery of a mid-level ridge 
located over the Greater Antilles and a deep-layer trough moving 
across the northeastern U.S.  The storm is expected to turn toward 
the east and east-southeast during the next 48 hours, but then slow 
down considerably as the trough lifts out and leaves Idalia behind. 
There is fairly high confidence that Idalia will move slowly 
eastward over the western Atlantic, in the vicinity of Bermuda, 
during the latter part of the forecast period, although there is 
less confidence in the details of that motion due to large model 
spread.

Additional weakening is expected while Idalia's center continues 
moving over land through tonight.  However, once the center moves 
back offshore on Thursday, model fields suggest that Idalia could 
interact with the aforementioned coastal front, with an area of 
stronger winds developing along the boundary near eastern North 
Carolina during the day.  Based on this scenario, the NHC intensity 
forecast closely follows the GFS solution at 24 and 36 hours.  
After 36 hours, there is more uncertainty on Idalia's intensity and 
structure.  Some guidance suggests that Idalia will continue 
interacting with the front and possibly become post-tropical, 
particularly if it struggles to maintain organized deep convection. 
For now, the NHC forecast keeps Idalia as a tropical storm for the 
entire forecast period.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Storm surge is expected along the southeastern U.S. coast within 
the Storm Surge Warning area through tonight.  Coastal flooding is 
also expected within the Storm Surge Watch area in North Carolina on 
Thursday.  Residents in these areas should follow any advice given 
by local officials.
 
2. Tropical-storm-force winds will affect portions of the 
southeastern U.S. coast through Thursday.
 
3. Areas of flash, urban, and moderate river flooding, with 
considerable impacts, are expected from east central Georgia, 
through eastern South Carolina and eastern North Carolina into 
Thursday.
