Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  34
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
1100 PM EDT Mon Aug 28 2023
 
Franklin remains a powerful category 4 hurricane.  Satellite images 
show a clear and circular eye with a solid and symmetric ring of 
deep convection surrounding that feature.  The Air Force Hurricane 
Hunters have investigated Franklin during the past few hours and 
found 700-mb flight-level winds as high as 140 kt and maximum 
surface SFMR winds of 128 kt.  In addition, the minimum pressure 
based on dropsonde data is estimated to be 926 mb.  Based on these 
data, the initial intensity is set at 130 kt, which is close to the 
upper bound of category 4 status.
 
The major hurricane is now moving due northward at 9 kt.  A turn to 
the northeast is expected on Tuesday, with a steady increase in 
forward speed forecast during the next few days as the hurricane 
moves in progressively faster flow between a mid-level ridge 
over the central Atlantic and a mid- to upper-level trough over the 
northeastern U.S. and eastern Canada.  The models are in relatively 
good agreement during the next 72 hours, however, they diverge 
significantly after that.  The GFS shows a continued acceleration 
to the northeast with the trough eventually capturing Franklin. 
Conversely, the ECMWF shows the trough pulling away, leaving 
Franklin behind in weaker steering currents.  The NHC track forecast 
is roughly between those very different solutions, sticking close 
to the various consensus aids.

Franklin should maintain its strength overnight, but a steady 
weakening trend should begin on Tuesday as the hurricane moves over 
progressively cooler waters and into an environment of higher shear. 
Regardless, Franklin is expected to be a significant hurricane 
during the next few days.  Franklin should complete extratropical 
transition in 3 to 4 days when it crosses the northern wall of the 
Gulf Stream Current and moves into an environment of very strong 
shear.  The NHC intensity forecast is a little lower than the 
previous one and close to the HCCA and IVCN models.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning
Wednesday morning, when Franklin is forecast to make its closest
approach to the island.
 
2. Life-threatening surf and rip currents are occurring along the
coast of the southeast United States. These conditions are
expected to spread northward along the remainder of the U.S.
east coast, Atlantic Canada, and Bermuda during the next couple of
days.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Idalia was
located near latitude 21.7 North, longitude 85.1 West.  
Idalia is moving toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A northward 
motion is expected through tonight, followed by a faster 
north-northeast motion on Tuesday and Wednesday.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Idalia is forecast to pass near or over western 
Cuba during the next few hours, over the eastern Gulf of Mexico on 
Tuesday, and reach the Gulf coast of Florida within the Hurricane 
Warning area on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Rapid strengthening is predicted during the next day or so.
Idalia could become a hurricane at any time, and is forecast to 
become a major hurricane by late Tuesday or Tuesday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center.  Casablanca, near Havana Cuba, reported a wind 
gust to 51 mph (82 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 983 mb (29.03 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Aucilla River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...8-12 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...6-9 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Aucilla River, FL...5-8 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...4-7 ft
Tampa Bay...4-7 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...3-5 ft
Englewood, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...3-5 ft
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to South Santee, SC...2-4 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...1-3 ft
Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL to Mouth of St. Mary's River...1-3
ft
Indian Pass to Mexico Beach...1 to 3 ft.
Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances. For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet above
normal tide levels along the southern coast of Pinar del Rio, Cuba.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
WIND:  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are expected within
the warning areas in western Cuba through Tuesday morning.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
tropical storm warning area over the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane warning area
in Florida by late Tuesday or Wednesday, with tropical storm
conditions beginning on Tuesday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Dry Tortugas
beginning tonight and within the tropical storm warning area
along the Florida Gulf coast on Tuesday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible along the southeast U.S.
coast within the southern portions of the watch area by early
Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts:
 
Portions of the eastern Yucatan: Additional 1 to 2 inches.
 
Western Cuba: 4 to 7 inches, with isolated higher totals of 10
inches.
 
Portions of the west coast of Florida, the Florida Panhandle,
southeast Georgia and the eastern Carolinas: 4 to 8 inches from
Tuesday into Thursday. Isolated higher totals of 12 inches possible,
primarily near landfall in northern Florida.
 
This rainfall may lead to flash and urban flooding, and landslides
across western Cuba.
 
Areas of flash and urban flooding, some of which may be locally
significant, are expected across portions of the west coast of
Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and southern Georgia Tuesday into
Wednesday, spreading into portions of the eastern Carolinas
Wednesday into Thursday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia are affecting portions of the
southern coast of Cuba and eastern Yucatan.  These swells will
spread northward along the eastern Gulf Coast during the next day
or two. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes will be possible starting Tuesday along
the west-central Florida coast and the tornado threat will spread
northward into the Florida Big Bend area by Tuesday night.

Tropical Storm Idalia Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
400 PM CDT Mon Aug 28 2023
 
The satellite presentation of Idalia has continued to improve this 
afternoon.  The center of the storm is embedded within an area of 
deep convection with cloud tops colder than -75C.  Although the 
early reconnaissance aircraft and radar data from Cuba
have not yet indicated the presence of an eyewall, the aircraft
data did indicate that the pressure had fallen to around 987 mb on
the final pass through the center earlier this afternoon.
Believable SFMR winds of 60 kt were reported to the east of the
center, and Idalia's intensity was raised to that value on the
1800 UTC intermediate advisory and it remains at that value for 
this advisory. NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
are scheduled to be in the storm environment again this evening and 
should provide additional information on the structure and 
intensity of the tropical cyclone.  Another NOAA G-IV synoptic 
surveillance mission is underway and that data should be
assimilated into the dynamical model runs this evening.
 
Idalia is moving northward or 360/7 kt.  The storm should continue
to be steered northward between a mid-level trough over the central
Gulf of Mexico and a ridge near the Greater Antilles through
tonight.  On Tuesday, a faster north-northeastward motion should
begin as a trough moves into the east-central United States.  This
motion should bring the center of Idalia to the Gulf coast of
Florida on Wednesday.   The dynamical models continue to have some
spread after 36 hours, with the GFS and HAFS guidance along the
western side of the envelope and the ECMWF along the eastern side.
The consensus aids were slightly west of the previous cycle, and
the NHC forecast has been nudged in that direction. The NHC track
forecast is in best agreement with the HFIP corrected consensus
model.  It is still worth stressing that only a small deviation in
the track could cause a significant change in Idalia's landfall
location in Florida due to the paralleling track to the west coast
of the state.  When Idalia nears the Atlantic coast of the
southeastern United States the guidance suggests the cyclone will
turn more eastward as the aforementioned trough passes to the north
of the storm.
 
The upper-level wind pattern is forecast to become more conducive
for significant strengthening when Idalia moves over the
southeastern Gulf of Mexico tonight and Tuesday.  At the same time,
the storm is forecast to move over an area of high ocean heat
content.  These conditions are likely to allow for a period of
rapid strengthening which is explicitly shown in the official 
forecast through 36 hours. Idalia is likely to become a hurricane 
this evening, and is predicted to become major hurricane over the 
eastern Gulf within 36 hours.  The NHC intensity forecast is just a 
little above the latest HFIP corrected consensus guidance. 
 
Idalia is forecast to move into an area very susceptible to storm
surge, and regardless of the cyclone's landfall intensity, there is
increasing confidence of a significant storm surge event.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation
along portions of the Florida Gulf Coast where a Storm Surge Warning
is in effect, including Tampa Bay and the Big Bend region of
Florida. Inundation of 8 to 12 feet above ground level is expected
somewhere between Chassahowitzka and Aucilla River.  Residents in
these areas should follow any advice given by local officials.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are expected within portions of the
Hurricane Warning area along the Florida Gulf Coast, with the
potential for destructive winds where the core of Idalia moves
onshore. Strong winds will also spread inland across portions of
northern Florida near the track of the center of Idalia.
 
3. Areas of flash and urban flooding, some of which may be locally 
significant, are expected across portions of the west coast of 
Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and southern Georgia Tuesday into 
Wednesday, spreading into portions of the eastern Carolinas 
Wednesday into Thursday.

4. Hurricane-force winds are expected across portions of far western
Cuba tonight.  Heavy rainfall is also expected across portions
of western Cuba and may produce areas of flash and urban
flooding as well as landslides.
