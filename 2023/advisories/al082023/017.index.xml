Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Thu Aug 24 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Franklin, located to the east of the Turks and Caicos <br/>
Islands. <br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (Remnants of Emily):<br/>
A trough of low pressure located more than 1000 miles east-southeast <br/>
of Bermuda (the remnants of former Tropical Storm Emily) is <br/>
producing an elongated area of disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms. Recently received satellite wind data suggests that <br/>
the system has lost organization from yesterday, but a tropical <br/>
depression or storm could still form as it moves northward over the <br/>
subtropical central Atlantic. By this weekend, the system is <br/>
expected to merge with a frontal boundary north of the Gulf <br/>
Stream. For additional information on this system, including gale <br/>
warnings, see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather <br/>
Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL92):<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue in association with <br/>
an area of low pressure located midway between the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands and the northern Lesser Antilles. While environmental <br/>
conditions are marginal for additional development, they could <br/>
become more conducive in a few days. A tropical depression could <br/>
form by early next week while the system moves west-northwestward to <br/>
northwestward into the central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Caribbean Sea:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure centered over Central America is <br/>
forecast to move into northwestern Caribbean Sea by this weekend. <br/>
Some gradual development of this system is possible thereafter into <br/>
early next week, and a tropical depression could form while it moves <br/>
slowly northward, entering the eastern Gulf of Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

<title>Tropical Storm Franklin Forecast Discussion Number 17</title>

Tropical Storm Franklin Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 PM AST Thu Aug 24 2023

Since the prior advisory, Franklin's appearance has not changed 
appreciably, with deep convection continuing to pulse near and to 
the east of the low-level circulation center. The last few center 
fixes from the earlier Air Force Reserve Reconnaissance mission 
showed the tropical storm has continued to turn eastward, though 
some of this motion might also be a reflection of the center being 
dragged in the general direction of the persistent convective 
bursts. The initial intensity for this advisory remains at 50 kt, 
out of respect of the earlier aircraft data, and is also close to 
the latest UW-CIMSS ADT estimate. Another reconnaissance mission 
will be in the storm tonight to provide an updated assessment of 
Franklin.

As mentioned above, Franklin is now moving east-northeastward, 
estimated at 060/6 kt. This relatively unusual motion for a tropical 
cyclone in late August at such low latitude is a byproduct of a 
large weakness still parked north of Franklin. This weakness is 
thanks in part to a longwave trough, allowing the storm's motion to 
be more influenced by a mid-level anticyclone currently located to 
its south over the Caribbean Sea. After the next 24 hours or so, the 
ridging begins to build in more to the east of the storm, resulting 
in both a slowdown and sharp turn north or north-northwestward 
between 24 to 48 hours. From there, Franklin takes a much more 
climatological motion northward and then recurves 
north-northeastward as it is steered between the subtropical ridge 
to its west and a amplifying mid-latitude trough digging into the 
Great Lakes region by the end of the forecast period. While there 
remains some cross-track spread in the track guidance solutions as 
Franklin makes its turn northward, both the latest ECMWF and GFS 
solutions have closed the gap between their tracks, and the latest 
NHC track only needed minor adjustments compared to the prior cycle.

As discussed this morning, Franklin is expected to slowly intensify 
for the next 24-36 h as moderate vertical wind shear is expected to 
be somewhat offset by warm 29-30 C sea-surface temperatures. After 
Franklin makes its turn northward, a cutoff low is expected to drop 
southwest of the storm, placing it in a more favorable upper-level 
difluent flow pattern. The guidance this cycle is showing a bit 
faster rate of intensification early on, so the intensity forecast 
was raised slightly from 48-72 h, still showing a peak intensity 
just shy of major hurricane intensity. This forecast is now in good 
agreement with the HCCA corrected consensus aid, but is lower than 
the more aggressive HAFS-A/B regional hurricane model forecasts.
