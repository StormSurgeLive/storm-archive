<title>Hurricane Franklin Forecast Discussion Number 27</title>

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 AM AST Sun Aug 27 2023
 
After becoming obscured for a time earlier tonight, the eye of 
Franklin is beginning to re-emerge on infrared satellite images 
early this morning. The last helpful microwave pass at 0246 UTC 
showed some disruption of Franklin's inner core that could have 
been due to southerly shear causing the eyewall to be open to the 
east. This structure was also observed by both NOAA and Air Force 
Reconnaissance missions earlier tonight. Intensity estimates from 
SAB and TAFB were both T4.5/77 kt this morning, but with the recent 
re-emergence of the eye, the advisory intensity is bumped up to 80 
kt for this advisory.
 
Franklin is moving to the northwest this morning with an estimated 
motion of 320/7 kt. The track forecast over the next 48 h is 
relatively straightforward as the cyclone is expected to round the 
western side of a mid-level subtropical ridge to its east. The 
track guidance over this time span is in good agreement, and the 
latest NHC track forecast is very close to or just a bit west of 
the prior one through 48 h. Afterwards, uncertainty quickly 
increases, primarily related to whether Franklin will be captured 
by a mid-latitude trough emerging off the eastern US coastline. 
While the GFS continues to show the hurricane being captured by 
this trough, the latest runs of the ECMWF, CMC, and UKMET now leave 
the cyclone behind, resulting in it turning more eastward and 
slowing down as the trough bypasses it to its north. Both the 
ECMWF and GFS ensembles show a huge amount of spread, spanning more 
than 1000 mi at the end of the forecast period. While the latest 
NHC track forecast will not shift all the way to Franklin being 
left behind by the trough, it is noticeably slower and eastward 
compared to the prior track at days 4 and 5. Future adjustments to 
the southeast may become necessary in subsequent cycles. On the 
forecast track, Franklin will be making its closest approach to 
Bermuda in 3-4 days, and is a bit closer to Bermuda than the prior 
advisory. 
 
As long as the small eyewall observed by earlier recon and microwave 
imagery is closing back off, Franklin should continue to intensify, 
likely rapidly due to favorable low shear and ample warm waters 
under the hurricane. DTOPS continues to suggest between a 59-68 
percent chance of a 30 kt intensity increase in the next 24 hours, 
and the latest intensity forecast is close to this scenario, taking 
the storm to a category 3 hurricane in 24 hours and peaking it as a 
115-kt category 4 hurricane in 36 hours. This is near the higher 
end of the intensity guidance, but is quite close to the latest 
HFIP corrected consensus forecast. Afterwards, there are a couple 
of factors that could cause Franklin to start weakening. First, the 
storm will likely undergo fluctuations related to eyewall 
replacement cycles, which would also broaden its overall wind 
field. In addition, the motion of Franklin is relatively slow, and 
the warm 29-30 C waters it will be traversing are fairly shallow, 
leaving the cyclone prone to cool upwelling along its track as the 
wind field expands. Vertical wind shear out of the northwest also 
increases after 36 hours. All of these factors are why the latest 
NHC intensity forecast shows weakening beginning after this period, 
which is also in good agreement with both the simple and corrected 
consensus aids. Given the large spread of solutions at days 4 and 5, 
it is unclear if Franklin will start to undergo extratropical 
transition during that time, or will be left behind by the trough, 
resulting in a slower motion that stays over warmer waters 
south of the Gulf Stream.

Tropical Depression Ten Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
400 AM CDT Sun Aug 27 2023

The small circulation of Tropical Depression Ten continues to be 
well-defined in Cancun radar, with the center moving across Cozumel 
during the past few hours.  Data from a Weatherflow sensor on the 
island indicated that the pressure dropped to about 1001 mb, with 
sustained winds of about 30 kt.  A small burst of convection has 
formed just south of the center recently, with scattered banding 
features in the eastern semicircle.  Most of the satellite 
estimates are just shy of tropical storm strength, so the initial 
winds speed will stay 30 kt.  Both Air Force Reserve and NOAA 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft will be in the system later this morning 
to get a better look at the structure and winds.  
 
The depression has turned southward tonight, moving at about 4 kt, 
apparently rotating around the western periphery of its larger 
parent circulation to the east.  Little net motion is expected for 
about a day as steering currents remain weak.  After that time, a 
developing trough over the Gulf of Mexico and stronger ridging over 
the western Atlantic is expected to lift the system toward the north 
and north-northeast over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. This track 
takes the system toward Florida, and then near the southeastern 
coast of the U.S.  The overnight model guidance is a bit farther 
west and slower than the last cycle, probably due to the depression 
being further south than anticipated.  Thus, the NHC forecast is 
nudged westward, and lies on the east side of the guidance envelope. 
These are small changes overall, and the track should be considered 
lower confidence until it starts moving in a more consistent manner. 
The NOAA G-IV aircraft should be in the area this afternoon to 
help smooth out the model differences along with special upper-air 
soundings scheduled across many areas of the southeastern United 
States.

The very warm and deep waters of the northwestern Caribbean Sea and 
Gulf of Mexico should support at least gradual strengthening during 
the next few days, tempered by moderate shear from a flat upper- 
level trough.  However, this trough is forecast to amplify over the 
western Gulf of Mexico around Tuesday, which causes the shear to 
decrease near the cyclone in that time frame.  There's a notable 
risk of rapid intensification while the system moves across the 
record warm eastern and northeastern Gulf of Mexico, which is 
highlighted by the recent HAFS and HWRF guidance.  The new NHC 
forecast is raised from the previous one, near or above the model 
consensus, and could be too low.  I'm reluctant to make any big 
changes to the forecast until we get more in-situ data, but the 
upward overnight model trend certainly bears watching.  Users are 
reminded to continue monitoring forecasts for any changes to the 
system's expected intensity as it approaches Florida.  
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Tropical Depression Ten is expected across
the eastern Yucatan Peninsula and western Cuba. The heavy rainfall
may produce areas of flash and urban flooding, as well as
landslides, across western Cuba.  The depression is forecast to
become a tropical storm later today, and tropical storm conditions 
are expected over portions of the Yucatan Peninsula and extreme
western Cuba where a Tropical Storm Warning is in effect.  Tropical
storm conditions are possible on the Isle of Youth, where a Tropical
Storm Watch is in effect.
 
2. The depression is forecast to strengthen during the next few days 
and could become a hurricane over the eastern Gulf of Mexico, 
bringing a potential of dangerous storm surge, heavy rainfall, and 
strong winds to portions of the west coast of Florida and the 
Florida Panhandle by the middle of this week.  Heavy rainfall is 
also likely to spread into portions of the Southeast U.S. by mid to 
late week.  Although it is too soon to specify the exact location 
and magnitude of these impacts, residents in these areas should 
monitor updates to the forecast of this system and ensure that they 
have their hurricane plan in place.
