<title>Hurricane Franklin Forecast Discussion Number 26</title>
<description>Issued at 1100 PM AST Sat Aug 26 2023  <![CDATA[<pre>

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
1100 PM AST Sat Aug 26 2023

The eye of Franklin has been obscured in conventional satellite 
imagery by deep convective bursts within its southern eyewall during 
the past several hours. At times, there has been some disruption of 
the inner core convection by drier air wrapping around the eastern 
and northern portions of the circulation. Both the Air Force and 
NOAA Hurricane Hunters investigated Franklin tonight and provided 
useful data to analyze the storm. Tail Doppler radar data from the 
NOAA aircraft reveal better vertical alignment of Franklin's vortex, 
although there is still a bit of tilt with height. Peak SFMR wind 
retrievals from both aircraft support an initial intensity of 75 kt, 
and the latest dropsonde data indicate the surface pressure has 
fallen to 975 mb. 

Conditions appear favorable for some significant strengthening of 
Franklin during the next couple of days. The deep-layer shear is 
forecast to continue decreasing over the cyclone while it traverses 
very warm SSTs greater than 29 deg C. The hurricane could be prone 
to more rapid fluctuations in intensity given its small inner core, 
and some of the rapid intensification (RI) guidance, particularly 
DTOPS, suggests there are well above average chances that Franklin 
could undergo RI during the next 48 h. Thus, the updated intensity 
forecast is raised in the near term, bringing Franklin to major 
hurricane strength in 24 h with a peak intensity of 115 kt on 
Monday. This lies near HCCA and IVCN, but below some of the regional 
hurricane models (HAFS and COAMPS-TC). Weakening is forecast at 
days 4 and 5 as Franklin encounters increased shear over cooler 
SSTs, but its wind field is expected to grow as it moves deeper into 
the mid-latitudes.

The aircraft fixes indicate Franklin has continued to deviate left 
of the forecast track, and its initial motion is northwestward at 7 
kt. The near-term track forecast has been adjusted west of the 
previous one based on Franklin's continued northwestward motion. A 
broad high pressure ridge to the east of Franklin should steer the 
hurricane more north-northwestward and northward during the next 
couple of days. Later in the period, a deep-layer trough is expected 
to move off the U.S. east coast, and most global models (except the 
ECMWF) show Franklin becoming captured within the southwesterly flow 
ahead of the trough and accelerating northeastward. The NHC forecast 
track still shows the core of Franklin passing west and north of 
Bermuda, but interests there should continue to monitor the latest 
NHC forecast updates. By day 5, interaction with the upper trough 
could bring about the start of extratropical transition.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Ten was 
located near latitude 20.7 North, longitude 86.8 West.  The 
depression is moving toward the southwest near 5 mph (7 km/h), and 
it is likely to meander near the Yucatan Channel through early 
Monday. A faster motion toward the north or north-northeast is 
expected later on Monday, bringing the system over the eastern 
Gulf of Mexico.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast during the next few
days.  The depression is expected to become a tropical storm later 
today and a hurricane by Tuesday.  

A Weatherflow station on Cozumel recently reported a sustained wind 
of 36 mph (57 km/h) and a wind gust of 48 mph (78 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches) 
based on surface observations from Cozumel and Playa del Carmen.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Ten can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO
header WTNT45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL:  Tropical Depression Ten is expected to produce rainfall
amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated higher amounts of 10 inches,
across portions of the eastern Yucatan Peninsula.  Across western
Cuba, rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches, with isolated maximum
amounts of 12 inches, are expected.  This rainfall may lead to
flash and urban flooding, and landslides across western Cuba.
 
Heavy rainfall is also likely to impact portions of the west coast
of Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and the Southeast by mid to late
week.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin over portions
of the warning area over the Yucatan Peninsula today and western 
Cuba tonight or Monday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible 
within the watch area on the Isle of Youth tonight or Monday.

Tropical Depression Ten Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
1000 PM CDT Sat Aug 26 2023
 
Images from the Mexico meteorological service's radar in Cancun show 
that the depression has a small but well-defined circulation with 
spiral banding extending no more than about 60 n mi from the center. 
 This feature is embedded within a larger circulation with scattered 
deep convection covering the northwestern Caribbean Sea, extreme 
southeastern Gulf of Mexico, and adjacent land areas.  The initial 
intensity is set to 30 kt based on the latest subjective Dvorak 
estimate from TAFB and objective numbers from UW-CIMSS.

The depression appears to be drifting toward the southwest with an 
initial motion of 230/2 kt, with low- to mid-level ridging located 
to its north and northwest.  The system is expected to continue 
meandering over the northwestern Caribbean Sea for the next 24-36 
hours.  After that time, a developing trough over the Gulf of Mexico 
and strengthening ridging over the western Atlantic is expected to 
begin lifting the system toward the north and north-northeast over 
the eastern Gulf of Mexico toward Florida, and then near the 
southeastern coast of the U.S.  The updated NHC track forecast lies 
on top of or very near the previous prediction and closely follows 
the TVCX and HCCA consensus aids.  

Assuming the depression's center does not move over the Yucatan 
Peninsula, very warm waters and low to moderate vertical shear 
should support gradual strengthening during the next few days.  The 
NHC intensity prediction is a little below the consensus aids during 
the first 36 hours of the forecast but then converges with those 
aids thereafter, showing the system reaching hurricane strength by 
60 hours.  The system is expected to remain a hurricane, and 
potentially continue strengthening, up until it reaches the Gulf 
coast of Florida on Wednesday.  Users are reminded to continue 
monitoring forecasts for any changes to the system's expected 
intensity as it approaches Florida.  Land interaction and increasing 
shear should lead to fast weakening after the system moves over 
land, but it could still produce tropical-storm-force winds near and 
offshore the southeastern coast of the U.S. even if the center is 
inland.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Tropical Depression Ten is expected across
the eastern Yucatan Peninsula and western Cuba. The heavy rainfall
may produce areas of flash and urban flooding, as well as
landslides, across western Cuba.  The depression is forecast to
become a tropical storm by Sunday, and tropical storm conditions are
expected over portions of the Yucatan Peninsula and extreme 
western Cuba where a Tropical Storm Warning is in effect.  Tropical 
storm conditions are possible on the Isle of Youth, where a Tropical 
Storm Watch is in effect.
 
2. The depression is forecast to strengthen during the next few days
and could become a hurricane over the eastern Gulf of Mexico,
bringing a potential of dangerous storm surge, heavy rainfall, and
strong winds to portions of the west coast of Florida and the
Florida Panhandle by the middle of next week.  Heavy rainfall is
also likely to spread into portions of the Southeast U.S. by mid to
late next week.  Although it is too soon to specify the exact
location and magnitude of these impacts, residents in these areas
should monitor updates to the forecast of this system and ensure
that they have their hurricane plan in place.
