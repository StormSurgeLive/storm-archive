Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Mon Aug 21 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories recently <br/>
upgraded Tropical Storm Gert, located several hundred miles east of <br/>
the northern Leeward Islands, on Tropical Storm Emily, located <br/>
a little over 1000 miles west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands, <br/>
and on Tropical Storm Franklin, located over the eastern Caribbean <br/>
Sea.<br/>
<br/>
Western Gulf of Mexico (AL91):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue in association with a trough of <br/>
low pressure located in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.  Environmental <br/>
conditions appear favorable for development of this system while it <br/>
moves westward at about 15 to 20 mph across the central Gulf of <br/>
Mexico.  A tropical depression or storm is likely to form while it <br/>
approaches the western Gulf of Mexico coastline by Tuesday. <br/>
Interests in the western Gulf of Mexico should monitor the progress <br/>
of this system.  Tropical storm watches or warnings may be <br/>
necessary on Monday for portions of the southern Texas and northern <br/>
Mexico coastlines.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL92):<br/>
A large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the <br/>
far eastern tropical Atlantic is associated with a tropical wave <br/>
located near the Cabo Verde Islands.  Environmental conditions <br/>
appear conducive for gradual development of this system, and a <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form later this week while it <br/>
moves west-northwestward across the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Gert Special Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
1200 AM AST Mon Aug 21 2023
 
Recent satellite wind-derived data indicated that winds in the
northeast quadrant were a little over 35 kt.  Conventional enhanced
infrared imagery showed cooling cloud tops of -85 Celsius in the
same region of the cyclone.  Accordingly, the depression is
upgraded to a tropical storm on this Special Advisory.
 
No changes to the forecast track and intensity philosophy are
required.  Since the environment is still expected to be
hostile with very strong westerly shear during the next day or so, 
Gert should degenerate into a remnant low later today, and 
dissipate by Tuesday.

Tropical Storm Emily Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072023
1100 PM AST Sun Aug 20 2023
 
Emily continues to be in a highly sheared environment this evening, 
with convection displaced well to the northeast of the exposed 
low-level center. A recent scatterometer (ASCAT-B) had a partial 
pass over the system that showed winds around 40 
kt. Subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB/SAB and objective 
satellite CIMMS ADT and AiDT were slightly lower with this 
advisory. Given the satellite estimates and scatterometer 
wind data, the intensity is lowered to 40 kt for this advisory.

Emily likely reached peak intensity earlier this afternoon, with a 
gradual weakening trend expected over the next day or so. The 
system is in a highly sheared environment, with shear forecast to 
increase even more over the next 24 to 36 hours. Models are in 
fairly good agreement that the system will become a remnant low in 
a couple of days. While the NHC forecast has the system remaining a 
remnant low throughout the period, there is some guidance, including 
the ECMWF, that dissipate the system earlier. The intensity 
guidance remains in fairly good agreement, and the forecast lies 
near the corrected model consensus aids.
 
The storm is moving to the west-northwest at 8 kt, and a general
west-northwest to northwest motion is expected during the next 
couple of days while the storm moves along the southwestern 
periphery of the ridge.  After that time, a turn to the north is 
forecast while the storm moves around the west side of the ridge 
and toward a weakness.  The new track forecast is similar to the 
previous, and lies near the middle of the guidance envelope closest 
to model consensus.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Franklin was
located near latitude 15.0 North, longitude 69.2 West. Franklin is
moving toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A westward to 
west-northwestward track is expected to continue today.  A sharp
turn to the north is expected tonight or early Tuesday, and a 
generally northward motion is expected on Tuesday.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Franklin is forecast to reach the southern 
coast of Hispaniola late Tuesday or Tuesday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast before Franklin reaches Hispaniola.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Franklin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml.
 
RAINFALL:  Franklin is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 2 to 
4 inches, with isolated higher amounts of 6 inches, across Puerto 
Rico through the middle of the week. Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 
inches, with isolated higher amounts up to 15 inches, will be 
possible across portions of Hispaniola. 
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin within the
warning area on Tuesday and are possible within the watch area
beginning late Tuesday.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast near and to
the east of where the center makes landfall in Hispaniola.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Tropical Storm Franklin Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
1100 PM AST Sun Aug 20 2023
 
Deep convection continues to burst near and to the east of the
center of Franklin. Earlier NOAA aircraft fixes and more recent
microwave satellite data indicate that the center of Franklin is
located near the northwestern edge of the deep convection due to
moderate westerly shear. The latest Dvorak T-number from TAFB is
T3.0 (45 kt) and SAB provided a data T-number of T2.5 (35 kt).  A 
very recently arriving ASCAT pass revealed peak winds of 40-45 kt, 
therefore the initial intensity has been raised to 45 kt. 

Franklin is moving west-northwestward at about 11 kt. A slower
westward to west-northwest motion is forecast overnight.  By late
Monday, a deepening trough over the western Atlantic is forecast to
cause Franklin to turn northwestward and then northward toward
Hispaniola.  The tropical storm is forecast to pass over that
island Tuesday night, and then move off the north coast of
Hispaniola by early Wednesday.  After that time, the amplifying
trough is forecast to turn Franklin northeastward.  There is still 
a fair amount of spread on where the northward turn will take place 
and the official forecast remains near the middle of the guidance 
envelope. 

Franklin is expected to remain in an environment of moderate 
westerly shear during the next couple of days, but it is not likely 
to prevent some modest strengthening before Franklin reaches the 
southern coast of Hispaniola. Interaction with the mountainous 
terrain of Hispaniola is expected to cause some weakening.  Once 
Franklin moves into the western Atlantic, most of the intensity 
guidance suggests additional strengthening is likely and the NHC 
forecast follows suit. The NHC intensity forecast is a blend of 
the HFIP corrected consensus model and the IVCN multi-model 
consensus aid.  

Based on the current track forecast, a tropical storm warning 
has been issued for the entire southern coastline of Haiti and the
Dominican Republic.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Franklin is expected across portions of
Puerto Rico and Hispaniola through the middle of the week. The
heavy rainfall may produce areas of flash and urban flooding as well
as river rises and mudslides. Across Hispaniola, significant and
potentially life-threatening flash flooding is possible Tuesday into
Wednesday.
 
2. Franklin is expected to bring tropical storm conditions to
portions of the Dominican Republic and Haiti beginning on Tuesday
where Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect.
