Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Tue Aug 22 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Franklin, located over the east-central Caribbean Sea,  on <br/>
Tropical Storm Harold, located inland over south Texas, and has <br/>
issued the final advisory on Post-Tropical Cyclone Gert, located a <br/>
few hundred miles east-southeast of the northern Leeward Islands.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL92):<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms located a few hundred miles <br/>
west of the Cabo Verde Islands are associated with a tropical wave. <br/>
Environmental conditions now appear only marginally conducive for <br/>
gradual development of this system, but a tropical depression could <br/>
still form later this week or over the weekend while it moves <br/>
west-northwestward to northwestward across the eastern and central <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
The remnants of former Tropical Storm Emily are located over the <br/>
central tropical Atlantic several hundred miles east-northeast of <br/>
the Leeward Islands.  Although development is unlikely in the next <br/>
day or so due to unfavorable environmental conditions, some <br/>
development is possible by Friday or Saturday when the system moves <br/>
northward over the subtropical central Atlantic. The system should <br/>
move north of the Gulf Stream on Sunday where further development is <br/>
not expected. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

Post-Tropical Cyclone Gert Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
1100 AM AST Tue Aug 22 2023

Gert has finally succumbed to the very unfavorable environmental 
conditions it has been embedded in for the last several days. First 
light visible satellite imagery shows the low-level circulation has 
become very diffuse, and is likely very close to opening up into a 
trough. In fact, the surface observations in the Lesser Antilles to 
the west of Gert have been rising this morning despite the 
circulation moving closer to them. In addition, all of the deep 
convective activity east of the center has largely dissipated. 
Based on these available data, Gert no longer meets the definition 
of a tropical cyclone, and this will be the final advisory. 

The initial motion is a slow west-northwest drift at about 4 kt. The 
remnant low is forecast to turn northward and drift very slowly 
until it completely dissipates in about 2-3 days. The guidance is 
in good agreement with this scenario. Future information on Gert 
can also be found in High Seas forecast issued by the National 
Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 
KWBC, and online at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Franklin was
located near latitude 15.8 North, longitude 71.4 West.  Franklin is
moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A turn toward
the north is expected tonight, followed by a turn toward
the northeast by Thursday.  On the forecast track, the center of
Franklin is expected to approach the southern coast of Hispaniola
tonight, cross the island on Wednesday, and then emerge over the
southwestern Atlantic waters late Wednesday.
 
Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that maximum
sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next couple of
days while Franklin moves near and across Hispaniola.  Some
strengthening is possible late Thursday into Friday as Franklin
moves farther northeast over the southwestern Atlantic waters.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
mainly to the east of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure on dropsonde data is 1002 mb 
(29.59 inches).

Tropical Storm Franklin Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 PM EDT Tue Aug 22 2023
 
Franklin is not a healthy tropical cyclone--and there is still some
question if it even is a tropical cyclone.  A NOAA Hurricane
Hunter aircraft investigating the system found a broad low-level
cyclonic wind field exposed to the west of the deep convection, but
this feature is well to the west of where we would have expected the
center to be.  At the same time, developing deep convection with
some mid-level turning is noted about 90 n mi to the east, which
would more closely follow persistence from previous forecasts.
Either way, Franklin is not well organized, and for now the initial
position is held closer to the convection in case a new center
re-forms in that area.  In fact, a dropsonde recently released by
the NOAA crew near the convection measured a surface pressure
of 1003 mb with winds of 32 kt, giving additional credence that a
new center could be forming.  The crew also reported that the SFMR
winds were running too high, and the highest 850-mb flight-level
wind was 41 kt, suggesting that Franklin's initial intensity is
probably down to about 35 kt.
 
The smoothed 12-hour motion remains northwestward (320 degrees) at
6 kt.  The track model guidance continues to insist that Franklin
will move slowly northward and then northeastward during the next 3
days or so, toward broad troughing located over the western
Atlantic.  This track should take Franklin northward across
Hispaniola during the next 12-36 hours, with the system then
turning northeastward over the western Atlantic.  By days 4 and 5,
a shortwave trough is expected to amplify near the northeastern
U.S. while a stronger mid-level ridge develops over the central
Atlantic, likely causing Franklin to turn back to the north by the
end of the forecast period.  Despite the possibility of center
re-formations, which could cause Franklin's track to jump around,
the model guidance is in good agreement on this general forecast
scenario, even if all the details are not yet ironed out.
 
The new intensity forecast probably has the biggest change from the
previous advisory, at least in the short term.  Little change in
strength is expected during the next 48 hours or so due to
Franklin's current disheveled state and its expected crossing of the
high terrain of Hispaniola on Wednesday.  Once Franklin moves over
the western Atlantic waters, a more diffluent upper-level
environment could foster some intensification, and the NHC forecast
continues to show the system becoming a hurricane by the end of the
5-day forecast period.  This forecast remains close to the HCCA and
IVCN consensus aids.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Franklin is expected across portions of
Hispaniola and Puerto Rico into Thursday. The heavy rainfall may
produce areas of flash and urban flooding as well as river rises and
mudslides. Across Hispaniola, significant and potentially
life-threatening flash flooding is possible Tuesday into Wednesday.
 
2. Franklin is expected to bring tropical storm conditions to
portions of the Dominican Republic and Haiti, where Tropical Storm
Warnings are in effect, beginning later tonight and continuing
through Wednesday.

the south side of a strong mid-level ridge.  The depression is 
expected to move farther inland across southern Texas and northern 
Mexico until it dissipates on Wednesday.
 
This is the last advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center on 
Harold. Future information on this system can be found in 
discussions issued by the Weather Prediction Center beginning at 
1000 PM CDT, under AWIPS header TCDAT4, WMO header WTNT24 KWNH, and
