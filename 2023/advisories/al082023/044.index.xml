Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Thu Aug 31 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Franklin, located a couple of hundred miles north-northeast of <br/>
Bermuda, on Tropical Storm Idalia, located near the coast of North <br/>
Carolina, and on recently upgraded Tropical Storm Jose, located <br/>
several hundred miles east-southeast of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms are gradually becoming better organized in <br/>
association with an area of low pressure located just west of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands. Environmental conditions appear conducive for <br/>
further development of this system, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form during the next couple of days while the system moves <br/>
west-northwestward to northwestward across the eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic. Interests in the Cabo Verde Islands should monitor the <br/>
progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (Remnants of Gert):<br/>
A weak but well-defined area of low pressure located several hundred <br/>
miles north-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands is producing <br/>
limited shower and thunderstorm activity. This system has a short <br/>
window for further development during the next day or so while it <br/>
drifts northeastward or eastward before upper-level winds become <br/>
increasingly unfavorable by the weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Jose Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112023
1100 AM AST Thu Aug 31 2023
 
Jose is producing bursts of deep convection near and over the 
estimated center position this morning. Overnight microwave data 
suggest the surface center was pulled slightly eastward by an 
increase in convection during the diurnal maximum period. The 
various satellite intensity estimates range from 32-45 kt this 
morning, with the subjective Dvorak classifications from SAB and 
TAFB (45 kt) higher than the objective UW-CIMSS estimates which are 
around 35 kt. A timely ASCAT-B pass over Jose shows believable wind 
vectors up to 32 kt in the eastern semicircle, which supports 
holding the initial intensity at 35 kt for this advisory.
 
The storm is moving northward at about 6 kt. An acceleration toward
the north is expected during the next day or so as the small system
gets caught in the broader cyclonic circulation associated with
Hurricane Franklin. Deep-layer shear is forecast to increase over
Jose as it accelerates northward toward Franklin, but Jose appears
likely to maintain some tropical-storm-force winds in its eastern
semicircle due to its faster northward motion. There have been no
notable changes to the NHC track or intensity forecast, and Jose is
now expected to be absorbed by Franklin in 36 h, in agreement with
the latest global models.

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  44
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
1100 AM AST Thu Aug 31 2023
 
Satellite imagery indicates that Franklin continues to battle 
strong northerly shear associated with the outflow from Idalia. 
Recent microwave data confirm its inner core has eroded, with deep 
convection confined to the southeastern portion of the circulation. 
There is a large spread in the recent intensity estimates, with 
higher objective estimates than the consensus T4.5/5.0 Dvorak 
classifications from SAB and TAFB. Given this uncertainty, the 
initial intensity is held at 85 kt for this advisory. 
 
Some gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of days 
while Franklin contends with the negative impacts of deep-layer 
shear. However, the cyclone is expected to remain at or near 
hurricane strength while increased baroclinic forcing and 
interaction with the upper trough support its extratropical 
transition. The GFS and ECMWF show fronts extending into Franklin's 
circulation by 48 h, likely signaling completion of this process. 
Therefore, the NHC forecast shows Franklin becoming a powerful 
extratropical cyclone in 48 h. Thereafter, further weakening is 
forecast while the cyclone moves deeper into the mid-latitudes, in 
agreement with the latest global guidance.
 
Franklin is moving east-northeastward (70/12 kt) within the flow 
between a deep-layer trough moving off the coast of the northeastern 
U.S. and eastern Canada and a subtropical ridge to the east. The 
latest track guidance remains in very good agreement that Franklin 
will accelerate toward the east-northeast or northeast during the 
next couple of days. The NHC track forecast in the near term is 
essentially an update of the previous one and remains close to the 
TVCN and HCCA aids. Track model solutions diverge beyond day 3 
regarding the track and speed of motion for the extratropical 
cyclone over the northern Atlantic, and in general the latest NHC 
forecast lies between the consensus aids and ensemble means.

Tropical Storm Idalia Intermediate Advisory Number 19A
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
800 AM EDT Thu Aug 31 2023
 
...HEAVY RAINFALL AND LIFE-THREATENING FLASH FLOODING CONTINUES IN
PORTIONS OF EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA...
...WINDS INCREASING OVER THE OUTER BANKS AND PAMLICO SOUND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM EDT...1200 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...33.7N 77.0W
ABOUT 65 MI...105 KM SE OF WILMINGTON NORTH CAROLINA
ABOUT 135 MI...215 KM SW OF CAPE HATTERAS NORTH CAROLINA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 75 DEGREES AT 20 MPH...31 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...990 MB...29.23 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* South Santee River northward to the North Carolina/Virginia border
* Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds
 
A Storm Surge Watch is in effect for...
* Beaufort Inlet to Ocracoke Inlet North Carolina
* Neuse and Pamlico Rivers North Carolina
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline in the indicated locations. For a depiction of areas at
risk, please see the National Weather Service Storm Surge
Watch/Warning Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Idalia.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Idalia was
located near latitude 33.7 North, longitude 77.0 West. Idalia is
moving toward the east-northeast near 20 mph (31 km/h), and this
general motion is expected to continue this morning.  An eastward to
east-southeastward motion is forecast to begin later today and
continue through Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of
Idalia will move just offshore of the coast of North Carolina today.
Idalia will then move eastward over the western Atlantic into the 
weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is expected today, but some gradual
weakening could occur Friday and Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
from the center.  An elevated station in Pamlico Sound (43 feet 
above the water) recently measured a sustained wind of 56 mph (91 
km/h) and a gust to 67 mph (107 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Beaufort Inlet, NC to Ocracoke Inlet, NC...2-4 ft
Neuse and Bay Rivers...2-4 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...2-4 ft
Ocracoke Inlet, NC to Duck, NC...1-3 ft
Cape Fear, NC to Beaufort Inlet, NC...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring within the tropical
storm warning area along the coast of northeastern South Carolina,
and will continue to spread across coastal sections of North
Carolina today.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce additional rainfall amounts
of 2 to 4 inches with isolated maxima up to 6 inches across coastal
North Carolina through this afternoon. This rainfall will lead to
areas of flash, urban, and moderate river flooding, with
considerable impacts.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia along the eastern Gulf coast will
continue to subside today.  Swells will affect the southeastern U.S.
coast during the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES:  A couple tornadoes will be possible through this morning 
across coastal North Carolina.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Tropical Storm Idalia Forecast Discussion Number 19</title>

Tropical Storm Idalia Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
500 AM EDT Thu Aug 31 2023
 
Surface observations from around 0600 UTC showed that the center of
Idalia moved offshore of the coast of northeastern South Carolina.
Strong southwesterly vertical wind shear has displaced the deep
convective bands and heavy rainfall well north and northeast of the
center over eastern North Carolina and the adjacent Atlantic. A
partial ASCAT-B overpass over the southeastern portion of the
circulation revealed winds of 40-45 kt and given that instrument's
typical undersampling, the initial wind speed is maintained at
50 kt for this advisory.
 
Idalia has turned east-northeastward between a mid-level
anticyclone over the Bahamas and a mid-tropospheric trough moving
eastward over the northeastern United States.  The anticyclone is
forecast to retrograde over Florida during the next couple of days,
causing Idalia to turn east-southeastward tonight and Friday.
After that time, steering currents are predicted to weaken and the
cyclone is expected to move very slowly to the southwest of
Bermuda during the weekend.  By early next week, another 
mid-latitude trough moving off the northeast U.S. coast should 
cause Idalia to begin moving northeastward, however there is still 
significant uncertainty in the details of the track forecast 
later in the period.
 
Little change in strength is predicted today, but strong
upper-level winds and drier mid-level air are likely to cause some
gradual weakening by the weekend.  Simulated satellite imagery from
the GFS and ECMWF models suggest that the system could lose
organized deep convection as soon as tonight, and Idalia could
degenerate into a post-tropical cyclone in a day or so.  However,
the ECMWF does show a return of deep convection over the weekend so
the official forecast continues to retain the system as a tropical
storm throughout the foreast period.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Areas of flash, urban, and moderate river flooding, with
considerable impacts, will continue across coastal North Carolina
through today.
 
2. Coastal flooding is expected within the Storm Surge Watch
area in North Carolina today.  Residents in these areas should
follow any advice given by local officials.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected in northeastern South
Carolina and portions of eastern North Carolina today.
