Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Fri Aug 25 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Franklin, located a couple of hundred miles east of the Turks <br/>
and Caicos Islands. <br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Caribbean Sea and eastern Gulf of Mexico (AL93):<br/>
Satellite images indicate that the area of low pressure over the <br/>
northwestern Caribbean Sea is gradually becoming better organized, <br/>
with increasing thunderstorm activity and a better-defined <br/>
low-level circulation.  Environmental conditions appear conducive <br/>
for further development during the next several days, and a <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form late this weekend or early <br/>
next week while it moves generally northward over the eastern Gulf <br/>
of Mexico.  Interests in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, western <br/>
Cuba, and Florida should monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (Remnants of Emily):<br/>
A trough of low pressure located roughly 1000 miles east-northeast <br/>
of Bermuda (the remnants of former Tropical Storm Emily) is <br/>
producing an elongated area of disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions are becoming unfavorable <br/>
for tropical cyclone formation, and the low is expected to merge <br/>
with a frontal boundary over the north central Atlantic in the next <br/>
day or so.  For additional information on this system, including <br/>
gale warnings, see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National <br/>
Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL92):<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue in association with <br/>
an area of low pressure located about midway between the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands and the northern Leeward Islands.  Environmental conditions <br/>
could become more conducive for development over the weekend, and a <br/>
tropical depression could form by early next week while the system <br/>
moves generally northwestward toward the central subtropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is forecast to move off the west coast of Africa <br/>
early next week. Some slow development of this system is then<br/>
possible late next week while the system moves westward across the <br/>
Tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>

Tropical Storm Franklin Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 PM AST Fri Aug 25 2023
 
Franklin's low-level center remains exposed this afternoon on 
visible satellite imagery. Strong vertical wind shear continues to 
affect the asymmetric system, with the deep convection displaced on 
the eastern side of the storm. The Air Force and NOAA Hurricane 
Hunters have been in the system much of the day and show that the 
flight-level winds and pressure have remained steady. Subjective 
Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB also remain unchanged from the 
previous advisory. Given the data from the Hurricane Hunters and 
these satellite estimates, the initial intensity for this advisory 
remains at 45 kt.
 
The storm is moving slowly to the east-northeast at about 5 kt, 
around the base of a broad mid- to upper-level trough. This 
east-northeast to northeast motion is expected to continue through 
tonight as ridging builds to the east of Franklin over the central 
Atlantic and the trough drops southwestward.   Franklin will then 
turn more northward late this weekend into early next week, with the 
core of the system probably moving to the west of Bermuda on Monday 
and Tuesday.  By the middle of next week, Franklin is forecast to 
turn to the northeast and accelerate between the ridge and a 
mid-latitude trough over eastern Canada and the northeast U.S.  The 
NHC track forecast has shifted slightly eastward in the short term 
given the recent motion. At long range, the guidance envelope and 
consensus aids this cycle were to the right of the previous forecast 
track. The official NHC forecast was adjusted slightly to the east, 
but lies west of the consensus aids for this cycle.
 
Strong westerly vertical wind shear should remain over Franklin for 
the next 24 hours or so, which will probably limit much 
strengthening.  In a day or two, strengthening is forecast as the 
wind shear decreases and Franklin remains over very warm sea surface 
temperatures.  Franklin is expected to become a hurricane early next 
week and should reach a peak intensity near major hurricane strength 
by day 4. By the end of the forecast period, a gradual weakening 
trend is forecast as Franklin moves over cooler waters and into a 
stronger vertical wind shear environment. The intensity guidance was 
slightly weaker in the short term, and the official intensity 
forecast followed these trends. In the long term, the peak intensity 
forecast remains unchanged and near the consensus aids.
