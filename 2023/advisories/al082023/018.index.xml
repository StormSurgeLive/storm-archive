Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Thu Aug 24 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Franklin, located a couple of hundred miles east-northeast of <br/>
the Turks and Caicos Islands. <br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Caribbean Sea and eastern Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure has developed over the northwestern <br/>
Caribbean Sea just off the northeastern coast of Honduras, producing <br/>
disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity.  Environmental <br/>
conditions appear conducive for gradual development of this system <br/>
during the next several days, and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form late this weekend or early next week while moving generally <br/>
northward over the northwestern Caribbean Sea and eastern Gulf of <br/>
Mexico.  Interests in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, western Cuba, <br/>
and Florida should monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (Remnants of Emily):<br/>
A trough of low pressure located about 950 miles east of Bermuda <br/>
(the remnants of former Tropical Storm Emily) is producing an <br/>
elongated area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  This <br/>
system could still become a short-lived tropical depression or storm <br/>
during the next day or so before it reaches colder waters and merges <br/>
with a frontal boundary.  For additional information on this system, <br/>
including gale warnings, see High Seas Forecasts issued by the <br/>
National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL92):<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue in association with <br/>
an area of low pressure located midway between the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands and the northern Lesser Antilles.  Environmental conditions <br/>
could become more conducive for development in a few days, and a <br/>
tropical depression could form by early next week while the system <br/>
moves generally northwestward toward the central subtropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>

Tropical Storm Franklin Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
1100 PM AST Thu Aug 24 2023
 
Franklin is still a strongly sheared tropical storm, with deep 
convection displaced to the east and southeast of the surface 
center.  An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter mission flying at 
700 mb this evening fixed a center within the strong thunderstorm 
activity, but because of the cyclone's tilted structure, the 
surface center is estimated to be a few tenths of a degree farther 
west.  SFMR and flight-level winds suggest that the maximum winds 
could be between 50-55 kt, but the central pressure has risen a few 
millibars since this morning's flight.  Therefore, the initial 
intensity is held at 50 kt.

Franklin is embedded in the base of a deep-layer trough located 
over the western Atlantic, which is steering the storm toward the 
east-northeast (70 degrees) at 7 kt.  The parent trough is forecast 
to lift northeastward and allow mid-level ridging to build over the 
central Atlantic during the next couple of days, and Franklin is 
expected to respond by making a sharp but slow northward turn by 36 
hours.  The ridge could even be strong enough to push Franklin 
toward the north-northwest for a time while the storm moves across 
the western Atlantic, and the HAFS regional models in particular 
favor that scenario, being the westernmost of the guidance suite.  
Those models have tugged the consensus aids a bit west too, and as 
a result the new NHC forecast track is nudged in that direction 
compared to the previous forecast.
 
Moderate to strong deep-layer shear is likely to continue over 
Franklin for the next 36-48 hours, until the storm makes its 
northward turn.  That said, warm ocean waters and a favorably 
diffluent upper-level pattern should still allow for gradual 
strengthening during the next couple of days, and Franklin is 
expected to become a hurricane by 48 hours, about the time the shear 
abates.  More significant strengthening is likely after 48 hours 
while Franklin moves over the western Atlantic, and the NHC 
intensity forecast remains close to the HCCA and IVCN consensus 
aids.  The HAFS regional models continue to show stronger solutions, 
so trends in the other models will have to be monitored for 
potential upward adjustments to the official forecast in the coming 
days.
