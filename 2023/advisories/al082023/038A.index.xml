Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Wed Aug 30 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Franklin, located a few hundred miles west of Bermuda, on Hurricane <br/>
Idalia, located over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, and on <br/>
Tropical Depression Eleven, located several hundred miles <br/>
east-southeast of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave located <br/>
near the Cabo Verde Islands is producing an area of disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms. Environmental conditions appear <br/>
conducive for gradual development of this system, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form later this week while the system <br/>
initially moves west-northwestward and then turns northwestward <br/>
across the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (Remnants of Gert):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a trough of low pressure <br/>
(the remnants of Gert) are located several hundred miles to the <br/>
north of the northern Leeward Islands. Environmental conditions do <br/>
not appear to be that favorable for additional development over the <br/>
next couple of days as the system drifts slowly northward or north- <br/>
northeastward.  Upper-level winds are forecast to become unfavorable <br/>
for development by the weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Eleven Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112023
1100 PM AST Tue Aug 29 2023
 
The depression has lost some organization since this morning. Only a 
few disorganized showers are present to the east of the depression's 
slightly elongated surface wind field. The initial intensity remains 
30 kt, but this is higher than 00Z Dvorak estimates from TAFB or 
SAB. An ASCAT-B pass just missed the center of the depression, but 
did not show any indication of winds higher than about 25 kt in the 
eastern portion of the depression's wind field, so its possible the 
NHC intensity analysis is generous.
 
The depression has moved erratically since it formed, with its 
recent movement estimated near 285/2 kt. Continued meandering is 
likely tonight, but the cyclone should begin to lift slowly 
northward by tomorrow, moving in low-level steering currents between 
Hurricane Franklin and a ridge over the central Atlantic. The latest 
NHC forecast is a little slower than the previous, remaining close 
to the multi-model track consensus.
 
It's still possible that the depression could briefly organize 
enough deep convection to become a tropical storm. However, this 
does not appear to be the most likely scenario anymore and it is 
not supported by any dynamical models. Upper-level outflow from 
Franklin should cause the depression to become a post-tropical 
remnant low within about 2 days, if not sooner, and most models 
forecast it will dissipate within the next 2-3 days.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Franklin was 
located near latitude 32.6 North, longitude 68.7 West. Franklin is 
moving toward the northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this motion 
with a faster forward speed is expected through today. On Thursday, 
Franklin is forecast to turn toward the east-northeast at a faster

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  38
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
1100 PM AST Tue Aug 29 2023
 
Cloud tops are beginning to warm around Franklin's rather large eye. 
A GMI microwave pass at 0136 UTC showed that the southern edge of 
the eyewall was beginning to erode.  The hurricane passed over NOAA 
buoy 41048 around 00 UTC and measured a central pressure of 955 mb 
with 20 kt of wind.  The initial intensity has been lowered to 100 
kt for this advisory and is closest to the TAFB estimate.

Franklin is moving to the northeast at 10 kt.  This motion is 
expected to continue for the next day or so as the hurricane moves 
around the northwest periphery of a subtropical ridge.  Beyond 24 h, 
Franklin is expected to begin interacting with a trough moving off 
the northeast coast of the US and turn to the east-northeast with an 
increase in forward speed.  However, global model guidance has 
significantly decreased the forward motion of the storm and the 
along-track position uncertainty remains higher than normal.  The 
new official track forecast has shifted slightly south of the 
previous prediction and has slowed noticeably. Even though the 
center of Franklin is forecast to pass to the northwest of Bermuda 
on Wednesday, tropical-storm-force winds associated with the 
hurricane are expected to extend well to the southeast of the 
center.

Franklin appears to be starting a gradual weakening trend.  In a 
day so, model guidance suggests the vertical wind shear should 
increase as it gets caught in the upper-level trough.  Franklin is 
still expected to complete its extratropical transition around day 
3 and dissipate by the end of the forecast period.  The NHC 
intensity forecast has been lowered slightly from the previous 
cycle and remains close the various consensus aids.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
Wednesday morning, when Franklin is forecast to make its closest
approach to the island.
 
2. Life-threatening surf and rip currents are occurring along the
east coast of the United States. These conditions are expected to
continue during the next several days.

Idalia's center forecast to reach the Big Bend coast of Florida on
Wednesday morning. After landfall, the center of Idalia is forecast
to turn toward the northeast and east-northeast, moving near or
along the coasts of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina late
Wednesday and Thursday.
 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft data indicate that maximum sustained 
winds are near 110 mph (175 km/h) with higher gusts. Additional 
strengthening is forecast, and Idalia is expected to become a 
major hurricane during the next few hours before it reaches the Big 
Bend coast of Florida. Idalia is likely to still be a hurricane 
while moving across southern Georgia, and possibly when it reaches 
the coast of Georgia or southern South Carolina on Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles
(260 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft observations is 958 mb (28.29 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Wakulla/Jefferson County line, FL to Yankeetown, FL...12-16 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Wakulla/Jefferson County line, FL...8-12 ft
Yankeetown to Chassahowitzka, FL...7-11 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...6-9 ft
Carrabelle, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...5-8 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...4-6 ft
Tampa Bay...4-6 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...3-5 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Carrabelle, FL...3-5 ft
Englewood, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to South Santee, SC...2-4 ft
Beaufort Inlet to Drum Inlet, NC...2-4 ft
Pamlico and Neuse Rivers...2-4 ft
South of Bonita Beach to Chokoloskee, FL...1-3 ft
South Santee, SC to Beaufort Inlet, NC...1-3 ft
Drum Inlet to Duck, NC...1-3 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...1-3 ft
Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL to Mouth of St. Mary's River...1-3
ft
Indian Pass to Mexico Beach...1 to 3 ft
Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances. For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area in Florida early Wednesday morning, with tropical
storm conditions beginning within the next few hours.
 
Tropical storm conditions will begin within the tropical storm 
warning area along the Florida Gulf coast and the Florida west coast 
soon.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area
along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina Wednesday and
Wednesday night.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin on Wednesday in the
warning area along the east coast of Florida, Georgia, and South
Carolina, and spread into North Carolina Wednesday night and
Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area in North Carolina by Thursday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce a swath of 4 to 8 inches of 
rainfall with isolated maxima up to 12 inches from the Florida Big 
Bend through central Georgia and South Carolina, and through eastern 
North Carolina into Thursday. These rainfall amounts will lead to 
areas of flash, urban, and moderate river flooding, with locally 
considerable impacts.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia are affecting the southwestern
coast of Florida and will spread northward and westward to the
north-central Gulf coast through Wednesday.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible tonight from the coast of 
west-central Florida northward into the Florida Big Bend region.  
The tornado risk will shift into southeast Georgia and the coastal 
Carolinas on Wednesday.

<title>Hurricane Idalia Forecast Discussion Number 14</title>

Hurricane Idalia Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
1100 PM EDT Tue Aug 29 2023

Satellite and NWS radar imagery show that Idalia is becoming 
increasingly more organized.  The eye on the Tampa WSR-88D is 
becoming better defined and the cloud pattern on GOES 16 imagery 
consists of a growing Central Dense Overcast with a strong 
convective band over the eastern semicircle of the circulation.  
Reconnaissance aircraft measurements show that the central pressure 
is steadily falling and is now around 958 mb.  Flight-level and 
SFMR-observed winds along with Doppler velocity data from the 
aircraft support an intensity of 95 kt for this advisory.

Idalia is now moving faster toward the north or slightly east of 
north with a motion estimate of 010/16 kt. The hurricane is moving 
between a mid-level trough over the northwestern Gulf of Mexico and 
ridge over the Bahamas and Greater Antilles.  The system is expected 
to turn north-northeastward within the next 12 hours, make landfall 
along the northeastern Gulf coast, and then move northeastward to 
eastward on the southern side of a mid-level trough moving off the 
northeast U.S. coast.  The 12-hour track forecast point for this 
advisory has been nudged a bit westward, a little west of the model 
consensus, but close to the latest GFS and ECMWF solutions.  It 
should be noted that some credible models, i.e. the HAFS-A and 
HAFS-B predictions, are even a little father west.

After landfall, Idalia is expected to move near or along the coast 
of Georgia and the Carolinas in 24-36 hours.  Uncertainty in the 
track forecast beyond 48 hours remains quite large, with some of 
the global models turning Idalia southward, while some of the 
regional hurricane models show the storm moving out to sea.  Given 
the uncertainties, the official track forecast shows a slow 
southeastward motion in 4 to 5 days.

Based on the current strengthening trend and the favorable 
thermodynamic and oceanic conditions, significant strengthening 
seems likely up to landfall.  The new official intensity forecast 
calls for Idalia to reach category 4 strength at landfall.  This is 
fairly close to the HAFS And HWRF regional hurricane model 
simulations.  After the center moves back over the Atlantic, 
significant restrengthening is not anticipated at this time due to 
the expectation of strong vertical west-southwesterly vertical wind 
shear.

Dangerous winds are likely to spread well inland near the path of 
Idalia due to its relatively fast forward motion.


KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Catastrophic impacts from storm surge inundation of 12 to 16 feet 
above ground level and destructive waves are expected somewhere 
between the Wakulla/Jefferson County line and Yankeetown, Florida. 
Life-threatening storm surge inundation is likely elsewhere along 
portions of the Florida Gulf Coast where a Storm Surge Warning is in 
effect. Residents in these areas should follow any advice given by 
local officials.
 
2. There is the potential for destructive life-threatening winds
where the core of Idalia moves onshore in the Big Bend region of
Florida, with hurricane conditions expected elsewhere in portions of
the Hurricane Warning area along the Florida Gulf Coast. Strong
winds will also spread inland across portions of northern Florida
and southern Georgia near the track of the center of Idalia where
Hurricane Warnings are in effect. Residents in these areas should be
prepared for long-duration power outages. Damaging hurricane-force
winds are possible in portions of eastern Georgia and southeastern
South Carolina where Hurricane Watches are in effect.
 
3. Areas of flash, urban, and moderate river flooding, with locally
considerable impacts, are expected across the Florida Big Bend,
central Georgia and South Carolina, through eastern North Carolina
into Thursday.
