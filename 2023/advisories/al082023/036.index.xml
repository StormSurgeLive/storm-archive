Special Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1010 AM EDT Tue Aug 29 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Special outlook issued to update discussion on the system over the <br/>
central subtropical Atlantic<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Franklin, located several hundred miles west-southwest of Bermuda, <br/>
and on Hurricane Idalia, located over the southeastern Gulf of <br/>
Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (AL92):<br/>
Updated: Recent satellite-derived wind data indicate an area of low <br/>
pressure located several hundred miles east-southeast of Bermuda has <br/>
become better defined and is producing winds of 30 to 35 mph over <br/>
the eastern portion of its circulation. The associated shower and <br/>
thunderstorm activity continues to show signs of organization, and a <br/>
short-lived tropical depression is likely to form today while the <br/>
system moves slowly northward over the central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located just off the west coast of Africa is <br/>
producing an area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear marginally conducive for gradual <br/>
development of this system, and a tropical depression could form <br/>
later in the week while the system moves west-northwestward to <br/>
northwestward across the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  35
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 AM EDT Tue Aug 29 2023
 
Near the time of the prior advisory, we received a GPM microwave 
pass at 0231 UTC, strongly suggesting the initial stages of an 
eyewall replacement cycle (ERC) were underway. This observation is 
also supported by the recent trends on infrared satellite imagery, 
which show the coldest cloud tops relative to Franklin's warm eye 
becoming more focused towards outer concentric bands seen earlier on 
microwave imagery. Finally, a recently received 0635 UTC AMSR2 
microwave pass confirms the ERC is ongoing, with the outer eyewall 
already starting to become dominant on the 89-GHz channel. All this 
data means is that the hurricane is likely past its peak intensity, 
but may be broadening its inner-core wind field as it undergoes this 
structural change. Subjective final T-number intensity estimates 
were 6.0/115 kt from both TAFB and SAB, with UW-CIMSS ADT also at 
T6.0/115 kt. However since the earlier aircraft data showed that 
Franklin was stronger than the satellite signature would suggest, 
the initial intensity is only being lowered to 120 kt for this 
advisory.
 
Franklin is now beginning to lose longitude again, with the latest 
estimated motion at 015/8 kt. A further turn to the northeast is 
expected later today as the hurricane becomes caught in the flow 
between a subtropical ridge positioned to its southeast and an 
approaching mid-latitude trough ejecting out of Canada from the 
northwest. Ultimately, this trough is still forecast to capture 
Franklin, though the along-track spread remains high beyond the next 
48 h. Once again the GFS and ECMWF are book-ending the track 
guidance this cycle, with the GFS the fastest and furthest north, 
and the ECMWF the slowest and furthest south, missing the trough 
connection. The ensemble guidance also continues to exhibit large 
spread between these scnerios after the next 48 h. The NHC track 
forecast continues to favor a solution closest to the the consensus 
aids TVCA and HCCA, which trended a bit slower this cycle. On the 
forecast track, Franklin should bypass Bermuda well to the northwest 
on Wednesday, but tropical-storm-force winds associated with 
Franklin will come much closer to the island due to the hurricane's 
large and expanding wind field.
 
With the ongoing eyewall replacement cycle, Franklin is likely past
its peak intensity. It is forecast to continue weakening, especially
as the hurricane also begins to move over cooler waters. In
addition, shear out of the northwest increases markedly in both the
GFS and ECMWF forecasts after 48 hours, which should hasten the
weakening process. The latest NHC intensity forecast is again a bit
lower than the previous cycle, but remains somewhat higher than the
consensus aids which show a slightly faster rate of weakening. There
are still timing differences in the guidance regarding exactly when
Franklin will become extratropical. The day 4 extratropical
transition time frame in the NHC official forecast is a compromise
between the faster GFS and slower ECMWF solutions.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning
Wednesday morning, when Franklin is forecast to make its closest
approach to the island.
 
2. Life-threatening surf and rip currents are occurring along the
coast of the southeast United States. These conditions are
expected to spread northward along the remainder of the U.S.
east coast, Atlantic Canada, and Bermuda later today into Wednesday.

A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area. Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening
inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline,
during the next 36 hours in the indicated locations. For a
depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.  This is a life-threatening situation.  Persons
located within these areas should take all necessary actions to
protect life and property from rising water and the potential for
other dangerous conditions.  Promptly follow evacuation and other
instructions from local officials.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the southeastern U.S. coast should 
monitor the progress of this system.  Additional watches and 
warnings along the southeast United States coast will likely be 
required later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area
outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by
your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Idalia was located
near latitude 23.8 North, longitude 84.8 West.  Idalia is moving 
toward the north near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A northward motion is 
expected today, followed by a faster north-northeast motion later 
today and Wednesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Idalia is 
forecast to move over the eastern Gulf of Mexico today, reach the 
Gulf coast of Florida within the Hurricane Warning area on 
Wednesday, and move close to the Carolina coastline on Thursday.
 
Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that maximum 
sustained winds have increased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Rapid intensification is likely through landfall, and Idalia 
is forecast to become an extremely dangerous major hurricane before 
landfall on Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160
miles (260 km).
 
The minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data is 977 mb 
(28.85 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances. For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
Elevated water levels along the southern coast of Pinar del Rio,
Cuba will gradually subside today.
 
WIND:  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are expected within
the warning areas in western Cuba through this morning.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane warning area
in Florida by late today or Wednesday, with tropical storm
conditions beginning today.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Dry Tortugas soon and
within the tropical storm warning area along the Florida Gulf coast
and the Florida west coast later today.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin on Wednesday in the
warning area along the east coast of Florida and South Carolina
Tropical storm conditions are possible along the southeast U.S.
coast within the southern portions of the watch area by early
Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts:
 
Western Cuba: 4 to 7 inches, with isolated higher totals of 10
inches.
 
Portions of the west coast of Florida, the Florida Panhandle,
southeast Georgia and the eastern Carolinas: 4 to 8 inches from
today into Thursday. Isolated higher totals of 12 inches possible,
primarily near landfall in northern Florida.
 
This rainfall may lead to flash and urban flooding, and landslides
across western Cuba.
 
Areas of flash and urban flooding, some of which may be locally
significant, are expected across portions of the west coast of
Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and southern Georgia today into
Wednesday, spreading into portions of the eastern Carolinas
Wednesday into Thursday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia are affecting portions of the
southern coast of Cuba and eastern Yucatan.  These swells will
spread northward along the eastern United States Gulf Coast during
the next day or two. These swells are likely to cause life-
threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes will be possible later day along the
west central Florida coast.  The tornado threat will spread
northward into the Florida Big Bend by tonight.

<title>Hurricane Idalia Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Hurricane Idalia Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
400 AM CDT Tue Aug 29 2023

Radar data from western Cuba indicates that Idalia is becoming 
better organized.  Most of an eyewall has formed, with much more 
curvature in the banding features and overall radar pattern.  
Satellite imagery also shows the center of Idalia firmly within the 
central dense overcast.  Thus, the initial wind speed is raised to 
65 kt, in accordance with the latest TAFB satellite classification.

The hurricane is accelerating northward this morning, now moving at 
about 9 kt.  Idalia should move faster to the north or 
north-northeast through landfall on Wednesday between mid-level 
ridging over Florida and a trough dropping into the western Gulf of 
Mexico.  There has been a westward shift in the model guidance 
overnight, perhaps due to the trough tugging Idalia more 
northward before taking a north-northeast turn.  It should be 
noted that the ECMWF ensemble shows many of its strongest members 
on the eastern side of its guidance envelope, which is a 
reasonable place to be given the synoptic pattern.  The new NHC 
forecast is adjusted a little to the west but is now east of the 
model consensus on the eastern side of the reliable model guidance. 
After Idalia leaves the eastern United States coastline, the track 
forecast becomes highly uncertain and little change was made to the 
previous forecast.  

With an inner core now present, the stage is set for Idalia to 
rapidly intensify before landfall. Shear should continue to lower 
over the cyclone as an upper-level trough departs the northeastern 
Gulf of Mexico and ridging builds closer to the cyclone.  These 
changes, combined with extremely warm and deep waters the hurricane 
will be traversing, all strongly point to rapid intensification.  
The new forecast is similar to the previous one, and confidence is 
increasing in an extremely dangerous major hurricane making landfall 
Wednesday along the west coast or Big Bend region of Florida.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation
along portions of the Florida Gulf Coast where a Storm Surge Warning
is in effect, including Tampa Bay and the Big Bend region of
Florida. Inundation of 8 to 12 feet above ground level is expected
somewhere between Chassahowitzka and Aucilla River.  Residents in
these areas should follow any advice given by local officials.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are expected within portions of the
Hurricane Warning area along the Florida Gulf Coast, with the
potential for destructive winds where the core of Idalia moves
onshore. Strong winds will also spread inland across portions of
northern Florida near the track of the center of Idalia.
 
3. Heavy rainfall is expected across portions of western Cuba and 
may produce areas of flash and urban flooding as well as landslides. 
Areas of flash and urban flooding, some of which may be locally 
significant, are expected across portions of the west coast of 
Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and southern Georgia beginning today 
into Wednesday, spreading into portions of the eastern Carolinas 
Wednesday into Thursday.
