Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Wed Aug 23 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Franklin, located just north of the Dominican Republic. <br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (Remnants of Emily):<br/>
An area of low pressure located about 1000 miles east-southeast of <br/>
Bermuda (the remnants of former Tropical Storm Emily) continues to <br/>
produce a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms. <br/>
Upper-level winds are forecast to become more conducive for <br/>
development by tomorrow, and this system is likely to regenerate <br/>
into a tropical storm by Friday while the system moves northward <br/>
over the subtropical central Atlantic. For additional information <br/>
on this system, including gale warnings, see High Seas Forecasts <br/>
issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL92):<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue in association with <br/>
an area of low pressure located several hundred miles west of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands.  This system's circulation has become better <br/>
defined since yesterday, despite marginal environmental conditions, <br/>
and further slow development is possible.  The low has the potential <br/>
to become a tropical depression by the weekend while the system <br/>
moves west-northwestward to northwestward into the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Caribbean Sea:<br/>
An area of low pressure could form in a couple of days over the <br/>
northwestern Caribbean Sea.  Some slow development of this system <br/>
is possible over the weekend and early next week while it moves <br/>
slowly northward across the eastern Gulf of Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Franklin Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 PM EDT Wed Aug 23 2023

Franklin is in the process of emerging off the northern coast of the 
Dominican Republic, where surface observations recently showed a 
subtle wind shift in the past couple of hours. Earlier, a NOAA 
reconnaissance mission flew a counterclockwise route around the 
eastern portion of Hispaniola, finding a peak 700-mb wind of 51 kt 
at about the time of the prior advisory. An ASCAT-B pass at around 
the same time also showed a decent swath of tropical-storm-force 
winds along the southern coast of the Dominican Republic. While 
Franklin has been inland for some time now, given the lack of much 
other data, its winds will remain 35 kt for this advisory. An 
Air Force Reserve Reconnaissance mission is soon set to take off 
and should provide more data this evening. 

Franklin's motion is now estimated to be north-northeastward at 
015/11 kt. A large weakness in the flow north of Franklin should 
allow the storm to be steered by mid-level ridging nosing back into 
the eastern Caribbean in the short-term, leading to a rather 
unusual east-northeastward motion over the next 24-48 hours. Then, 
after the remnants of Emily move out of the way, additional ridging 
should build back east of Franklin, blocking it from an immediate 
track out to sea. The track guidance all show the cyclone bending 
back northward for the remainder of the forecast period. While the 
track guidance generally agree on this evolution, the details on 
when and how sharply this turn is remain to be ironed out. 
Ultimately, the consensus aids have changed little this afternoon, 
even if the spread in the ensemble guidance is larger than normal, 
and the NHC track is very similar to the prior one throughout the 
forecast period. 

The biggest hindrance limiting Franklin's initial prospects for 
reintensification is continued moderate westerly vertical wind shear 
between 15-25 kt for the next 24-48 hours. However, sea-surface 
temperatures will be very warm along the forecast track, so this 
shear should not be enough to preclude slow intensification during 
that time span. Afterwards, an upper-level trough is expected to 
cutoff to the southwest of Franklin as the cyclone begins to pivot 
northward, and the storm should find itself in a more favorable 
upper-level environment. Thus, a faster intensification rate is 
anticipated between 72-96 h and Franklin is still expected to become 
a significant hurricane by the end of the forecast period. The 
intensity forecast is in good agreement with the consensus aids, but 
remains lower than some of the more aggressive hurricane-regional 
models (HWRF, HAFS-A/B).
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Franklin is expected across much of 
Hispaniola into Thursday, which is expected to produce significant 
and potentially life-threatening flash and urban flooding as well 
as mudslides, particularly over the central Dominican Republic.
 
2. Franklin is bringing tropical storm conditions to portions of the 
Dominican Republic, where Tropical Storm Warnings remain in effect, 
and tropical storm conditions are expected to begin within the Turks 
and Caicos Islands tonight.
