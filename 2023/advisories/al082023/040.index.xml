Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Wed Aug 30 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Franklin, located a couple of hundred miles west-northwest of <br/>
Bermuda, on Hurricane Idalia, near the coast of the Florida Big <br/>
Bend, and on Tropical Depression Eleven, located several hundred <br/>
miles east-southeast of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave located <br/>
near the Cabo Verde Islands is producing an area of disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms. Environmental conditions appear <br/>
conducive for gradual development of this system, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form later this week while the system <br/>
initially moves west-northwestward and then turns northwestward <br/>
across the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (Remnants of Gert):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a trough of low pressure <br/>
(the remnants of Gert) are located several hundred miles to the <br/>
north of the northern Leeward Islands. Environmental conditions do <br/>
not appear to be that favorable for additional development over the <br/>
next couple of days as the system drifts slowly northward or north- <br/>
northeastward.  Upper-level winds are forecast to become unfavorable <br/>
for development by the weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Eleven Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112023
1100 AM AST Wed Aug 30 2023
 
The depression had a large burst of convection this morning. 
Scatterometer missed the system this morning, so we did 
not get any data of the wind field with this convective burst. A 
blend of subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates are 
still around 30 kt, and the intensity is held at 30 kt for this 
advisory cycle.
 
The depression continues to meander over the central Atlantic.  It 
is expected to slowly move northward later today, and then a little 
faster northward by Thursday. The NHC track forecast is slower in 
short-term than the previous forecast, given the initial slow 
motion, and lies near the corrected consensus aids.
 
The intensity forecast remains unchanged from the previous forecast. 
The depression still may briefly strengthen into a very short-lived 
tropical storm, but most of the guidance keep the system as a 
depression. As the system moves northward it will encounter an 
environment of dry air and increased shear. The depression is 
forecast to become a post-tropical remnant low in about day or so.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Franklin was 
located near latitude 33.6 North, longitude 67.1 West. Franklin is 
moving toward the northeast near 13 mph (20 km/h). A gradual turn 
toward the east-northeast is expected later today or tonight, with a 
slightly faster east-northeastward motion through Friday. On the 
forecast track, the center of Franklin is expected to pass to the 
northwest of Bermuda today.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast over the next several days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles 
(260 km). An elevated weather station at the National Museum of 
Bermuda recently reported a sustained wind of 45 mph (72 km/h) and a

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  40
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
1100 AM AST Wed Aug 30 2023
 
The large eye of Franklin has become a bit ragged in recent
satellite images. Upper-level outflow from Hurricane Idalia
continues to impinge on the western side of Franklin's circulation,
and recent SSMIS microwave data show a thinner ring of inner core
convection on the western side of the eye, though the eyewall
remains closed. The overall satellite presentation has degraded some
since yesterday, and this is reflected in the latest objective and
subjective satellite estimates. The initial intensity is lowered
slightly to 90 kt, based on consensus T5.0/90 kt Dvorak estimates
from SAB and TAFB and UW-CIMSS ADT and AiDT estimates around 85-90
kt. Radar data from Bermuda reveal an outer band of the hurricane is
passing near the island, and tropical storm conditions are expected
to spread over the area within the next few hours.
 
The flow between a deep-layer trough over the eastern United States
and Canada and a high pressure ridge over the central Atlantic is
steering Franklin northeastward (50/11 kt). The aforementioned
trough is forecast to move eastward during the next couple of days,
and the flow ahead of this feature should cause Franklin to move
slightly faster toward the east-northeast. Little change was made to
this portion of the forecast. It is still unclear whether or not
Franklin will become completely captured by the trough, which
introduces greater uncertainty in the days 3-5 track forecast. The
GFS favors a faster northeastward motion with greater trough
interaction, while the ECMWF and UKMET keep Franklin on a slower
eastward track before it is steered deeper into the mid-latitudes.
The updated NHC forecast follows the consensus trends and is again
slower than the previous prediction beyond 72 h. Franklin is
forecast to become extratropical by 96 h, although this timing
largely depends on the extent of trough interaction.
 
Increasing northwesterly shear is expected over Franklin during the
next couple of days. This should induce at least gradual weakening
in the near term, though the tropical-storm-force wind field is
likely to expand as the system accelerates and gains latitude. The
updated track forecast brings Franklin over sub-26C waters in
about 72 h, with extratropical transition forecast to occur by 96
h. Note that this timing largely depends on the extent of trough
interaction that occurs in the coming days, so future adjustments
could be necessary.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda today while
Franklin makes its closest approach to the island.
 
2. Life-threatening surf and rip currents are occurring along the
east coast of the United States. These conditions are expected to
continue during the next couple of days.

km/h).  A turn toward the northeast is expected later today,
followed by an east-northeastward to eastward motion on Thursday.
On the forecast track, the center of Idalia will move across
southeastern Georgia today, near the coast of South Carolina
tonight, and just offshore the coast of southern North Carolina on
Thursday.  Idalia is then expected to move east-southeastward over
the western Atlantic on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 90 mph (150 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Although Idalia will weaken further while the
center is inland, it is still expected to be a hurricane through
this afternoon or evening while moving across southeastern Georgia 
and southern South Carolina.  Idalia is forecast to be a tropical 
storm while moving near the coasts of northeastern South Carolina 
and North Carolina tonight and on Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles
(370 km). Sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) with a gust to 52 mph 
(84 km/h) was recently reported at Moody Air Force Base near 
Valdosta, Georgia.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 971 mb (28.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Keaton Beach, FL to Yankeetown, FL...7-11 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Anclote River, FL...5-8 ft
Aucilla River, FL to Keaton Beach, FL...3-5 ft
Anclote River, FL to Englewood, FL...3-5 ft
Tampa Bay...3-5 ft
Saint Catherines Sound, GA to South Santee River, SC...3-5 ft
Englewood, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to Saint Catherines Sound, GA...2-4 ft
Beaufort Inlet, NC to Ocracoke Inlet, NC...2-4 ft
Neuse River and Pamlico River...2-4 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...1-3 ft
South Santee River, SC to Beaufort Inlet, NC...1-3 ft
Ocracoke Inlet, NC to Duck, NC...1-3 ft
Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL to Mouth of the St. Mary's 
River...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are occurring within the hurricane
warning area in Florida and southern Georgia and will spread to the
coasts of Georgia and southern South Carolina within the
hurricane warning area later today.  Tropical storm conditions
will continue through today within the tropical storm warning area
along the Florida west coast.  Hurricane conditions are possible
within the hurricane watch area along the Georgia and South
Carolina coasts later today and tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are occurring within the tropical storm
warning area along the northeastern coast of Florida and Georgia
and will spread into South Carolina and North Carolina through the
day and into Thursday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce a swath of 4 to 8 inches of
rainfall with isolated maxima up to 12 inches from portions of North
Florida through central Georgia and South Carolina, and through
eastern North Carolina into Thursday. These rainfall amounts will
lead to areas of flash, urban, and moderate river flooding, with
considerable impacts.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia are affecting the eastern and
central Gulf coast from Florida to Louisiana, and will increase
along the southeastern U.S. coast today.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES:  A couple of tornadoes are possible today across central
and northeast Florida into southeast Georgia.  The tornado threat
will increase through this afternoon across coastal South Carolina
and continue into tonight for coastal North Carolina.

<title>Hurricane Idalia Forecast Discussion Number 15</title>

Hurricane Idalia Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
500 AM EDT Wed Aug 30 2023
 
Idalia continues to undergo rapid intensification.  Maximum
flight-level winds were 123 kt, with believable SFMR values of 115
kt.  Satellite images show a small eye surrounded by very cold
clouds tops, especially in the western quadrant.  The initial wind
speed is set to 115 kt, making Idalia an extremely dangerous
category 4 hurricane.
 
The hurricane still has a few hours left to intensify before it
makes landfall. The biggest change to the intensity forecast is to
increase the wind speeds over southeastern Georgia and South
Carolina as the rapid motion and track close to the coast is
expected to keep the system near hurricane strength for longer.
Thus a Hurricane Warning has been issued for a portion of those
coasts, and the Hurricane Watch is extended northeastward.  After
the hurricane moves offshore, the wind field on the northwestern
side near eastern North Carolina is expected to be enhanced by a
cold front, and the Tropical Storm Watch has been upgraded to a
Tropical Storm Warning in that area.  The long-range intensity
forecast is quite uncertain with Idalia taking on some hybrid
characteristics due to a baroclinc trough. No changes were made at
this time, and the forecast remains close to the consensus.
 
Idalia is moving faster toward the north-northeast or 025/16 kt.
After landfall, Idalia is expected to move near or along the coast
of Georgia and the Carolinas in 24-36 hours.  Uncertainty in the
track forecast beyond 48 hours remains quite large, and the latest
guidance is significantly faster.  The new forecast is adjusted
toward the consensus, but could be too slow at long range.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Catastrophic impacts from storm surge inundation of 12 to 16 feet
above ground level and destructive waves are expected somewhere
between the Wakulla/Jefferson County line and Yankeetown, Florida.
Life-threatening storm surge inundation is likely elsewhere along
portions of the Florida Gulf Coast where a Storm Surge Warning is in
effect. Residents in these areas should follow any advice given by
local officials.
 
2. Destructive life-threatening winds will occur where the core of
Idalia moves onshore in the Big Bend region of Florida, with
hurricane conditions expected elsewhere in portions of the Hurricane
Warning area along the Florida Gulf Coast. Strong winds will also
spread inland across portions of northern Florida and southern
Georgia near the track of the center of Idalia where Hurricane
Warnings are in effect. Residents in these areas should be prepared
for long-duration power outages. Damaging hurricane-force winds are
likely in portions of eastern Georgia and southeastern South
Carolina where Hurricane Warnings are now in effect.
 
3. Areas of flash, urban, and moderate river flooding, with
considerable impacts, are expected from the Florida Big Ben through,
central Georgia and South Carolina, through eastern North Carolina
into Thursday.
