Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Tue Aug 22 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Franklin, located over the east-central Caribbean Sea, on <br/>
Tropical Depression Gert, located a few hundred miles east-southeast <br/>
of the northern Leeward Islands, and on Tropical Storm Harold, <br/>
located just offshore of south Texas.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL92):<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms located a few hundred miles <br/>
west of the Cabo Verde Islands are associated with a tropical wave. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear generally conducive for gradual <br/>
development of this system, and a tropical depression could form <br/>
later this week or over the weekend while it moves <br/>
west-northwestward to northwestward across the eastern and central <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
The remnants of former Tropical Storm Emily are located over the <br/>
central tropical Atlantic several hundred miles east-northeast of <br/>
the Leeward Islands.  Although development is unlikely in the next <br/>
day or so due to unfavorable environmental conditions, some <br/>
development is possible late this week or this weekend when the <br/>
system moves northward over the subtropical central Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
<br/>
Public Advisories on Tropical Storm Harold are issued under WMO <br/>
header WTNT34 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCPAT4.<br/>

Post-Tropical Cyclone Gert Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
1100 AM AST Tue Aug 22 2023

Gert has finally succumbed to the very unfavorable environmental 
conditions it has been embedded in for the last several days. First 
light visible satellite imagery shows the low-level circulation has 
become very diffuse, and is likely very close to opening up into a 
trough. In fact, the surface observations in the Lesser Antilles to 
the west of Gert have been rising this morning despite the 
circulation moving closer to them. In addition, all of the deep 
convective activity east of the center has largely dissipated. 
Based on these available data, Gert no longer meets the definition 
of a tropical cyclone, and this will be the final advisory. 

The initial motion is a slow west-northwest drift at about 4 kt. The 
remnant low is forecast to turn northward and drift very slowly 
until it completely dissipates in about 2-3 days. The guidance is 
in good agreement with this scenario. Future information on Gert 
can also be found in High Seas forecast issued by the National 
Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 
KWBC, and online at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Franklin was
located near latitude 15.5 North, longitude 71.1 West.  Franklin is
moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A turn toward
the north is expected later today, followed by a turn toward the
northeast by Thursday.  On the forecast track, the center of
Franklin is expected to approach the southern coast of Hispaniola
today, cross the island on Wednesday, and then emerge over the
southwestern Atlantic waters late Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast before Franklin reaches
Hispaniola.  Some weakening is likely while the storm moves across
Hispaniola.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).

Tropical Storm Franklin Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
1100 AM EDT Tue Aug 22 2023
 
It is unclear this morning if Franklin still has a well-defined
center of circulation.  Visible satellite images suggest that broad
low-level turning is occurring well to the west of the bulk of
Franklin's deep convection, and there is no clear evidence that a
center exists near, or that a new center if re-forming beneath, the
convection.  It appears that scatterometer will miss Franklin and
be of no help in assessing the wind field, but a NOAA Hurricane
Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate the system later this
afternoon.  For now, the initial intensity is held at 45 kt, which
is right in the middle of the various subjective and objective
satellite estimates.
 
If Franklin does still have a center, it is assumed to have jumped
or re-formed a bit to the west where there is new convection.  This
position gives the storm an overall motion over the past 12 hours
toward the northwest (325 degrees) at 6 kt.  Franklin is positioned
within the southern extent of a large mid-level trough, which
includes a mid-/upper-level low centered south of Bermuda.  While
the steering flow is weak, this should cause Franklin to move slowly
northward and then northeastward for the next 4 days or so.  By day
5, a new shortwave trough is likely to develop over New England,
with ridging strengthening over the central Atlantic, and Franklin
is forecast to turn back toward the north at that time.  Largely
because of the adjustment in the initial position, all of the track
guidance has shifted westward on this cycle.  The NHC track
forecast has also been moved westward, although it is on the
eastern side of the guidance envelope and fairly close to the
typically-reliable HCCA consensus aid.  That said, there is
greater-than-usual uncertainty in Franklin's forecast track given
potential re-formations of the center.
 
Moderate-to-strong westerly shear is expected to continue over
Franklin for the next 4 days or so.  In addition, the system is
forecast to move over the rugged terrain of Hispaniola within the
next 24-36 hours.  As a result, little change in strength is
anticipated before Franklin reaches Hispaniola, and some weakening
is likely while it is crossing the island.  Some intensification
is then noted in the 3-5 day period when environmental conditions
begin to become a little more conducive for strengthening.  The NHC
intensity forecast is near the HCCA and IVCN consensus aids for
much of the 5-day forecast period.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Franklin is expected across portions of
Puerto Rico and Hispaniola into Thursday. The heavy rainfall may
produce areas of flash and urban flooding as well as river rises and
mudslides. Across Hispaniola, significant and potentially
life-threatening flash flooding is possible Tuesday into Wednesday.
 
2. Franklin is expected to bring tropical storm conditions to
portions of the Dominican Republic and Haiti, where Tropical Storm
Warnings are in effect, beginning later today and continuing through
Wednesday.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Harold was
located near latitude 26.2 North, longitude 96.4 West.  Harold is
moving toward the west-northwest near 18 mph (30 km/h).  This
general motion is expected to continue through tonight, and the
system is forecast to move inland over south Texas later this 
morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some strengthening is possible before Harold reaches the
Texas coast.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Harold can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.
 
RAINFALL: Harold is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 3 to 5
inches, with isolated higher amounts of 7 inches, across South Texas
through early Wednesday.  Scattered instances of flash flooding will
be possible.
 
Across Mexico, rainfall amounts of 4 to 6 inches, with local amounts
of 10 inches, are expected across portions of northern Coahuila and
northern Nuevo Leon Tuesday through Wednesday.  Scattered instances
of flash flooding are expected.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area 
today.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Mouth of Rio Grande to Sargent, including Baffin Bay, Corpus
Christi Bay and Matagorda Bay...1 to 3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
TORNADOES: A couple of tornadoes are possible across south Texas
through the afternoon.
 
SURF: Large swells will affect portions of southern Texas through
Tuesday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.

Tropical Storm Harold Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092023
400 AM CDT Tue Aug 22 2023
 
Air Force Hurricane Hunter wind observations indicate that the 
cyclone strengthened to a tropical storm earlier this morning.  
However, the circulation is not very well defined and the low-level 
center is somewhat elongated from south to north.  Imagery from the 
Brownsville WSR-88D radar shows broad cyclonic turning, with curved 
rain bands moving onshore of the south Texas coast.
 
Harold is embedded in strong deep-layer easterlies on the southern 
periphery of a large anticyclone over the east-central United 
States.  As a result, the cyclone is moving fairly briskly toward 
the west-northwest at around 285/16 kt.  This general motion should 
continue through tonight, and the official forecast is quite 
similar to the previous one.  This is also very close to the latest 
corrected consensus, HCCA prediction.

The system still has a short time to strengthen over the warm Gulf 
waters, and the latest SHIPS guidance shows slight strengthening  
within the next 12 hours.  This is reflected in the official 
forecast.  Since the cyclone does not have a well-defined inner 
core, however, rapid intensification is not likely before landfall.


KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Tropical Storm Harold is expected across
South Texas through early Wednesday, and may produce areas of flash
and urban flooding. Across portions of northern Coahuila and
northern Nuevo Leon in Mexico, flash flooding with possible
landslides in mountainous terrain is expected Tuesday through
Wednesday.
 
2. Coastal flooding is possible along the south Texas coast
today through Tuesday evening.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area,and
are possible in the watch area, within a few hours.
