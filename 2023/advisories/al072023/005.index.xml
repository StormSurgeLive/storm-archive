Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Mon Aug 21 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Franklin, located over the eastern Caribbean Sea, on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gert, located several hundred miles east-southeast of the <br/>
northern Leeward Islands, and on Tropical Storm Emily, located a <br/>
little over 1100 miles west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands.<br/>
<br/>
Western Gulf of Mexico (AL91):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms are showing signs of organization <br/>
in association with a broad area of low pressure located over the <br/>
central Gulf of Mexico.  Environmental conditions appear conducive <br/>
for development of this system, and a tropical depression or <br/>
tropical storm is likely to form before it reaches the western Gulf <br/>
of Mexico coastline on Tuesday. Interests in southern Texas and <br/>
northern Mexico should monitor the progress of this system as <br/>
tropical storm watches or warnings are likely to be issued later <br/>
today.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL92):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms over the Cabo Verde Islands and portions <br/>
of the tropical eastern Atlantic are associated with a tropical <br/>
wave. Environmental conditions appear generally conducive for <br/>
gradual development of this system, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form later this week while it moves west-northwestward <br/>
across the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Gert Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
500 AM AST Mon Aug 21 2023
 
After a brief intensification period overnight, Gert is quickly
unraveling this morning.  The surface circulation is becoming
ill-defined while the associated sheared mass of convection is
shrinking.  Although the cloud pattern has certainly become less
organized during the past few hours, the initial intensity is
generously held at 35 kt for this advisory and is supported by the
Dvorak satellite intensity estimates.  Despite a rather diffluent
upper-wind pattern, strong, persistent westerly shear and a
statically stable and dry mid-tropospheric surrounding air mass
should force Gert's surface center to separate farther from the
diminishing convective mass later today and degenerate to a remnant
low by this evening.  The morning's global model simulated infrared
imagery also shows the cyclone opening to a trough of low pressure
in less than 36 hours, and the NHC official forecast reflects this
prediction.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be westward, or 280/8 kt.  A
gradual turn toward the west-northwest is expected by tonight, and
this general motion should continue until dissipation occurs on
Tuesday.  The official forecast has been adjusted slightly to the
right of the previous one and is based on the simple and NOAA HFIP
Corrected Consensus forecasts.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Emily Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072023
1100 AM AST Mon Aug 21 2023
 
Emily has been devoid of deep convection for nearly 15 hours and no 
longer meets the definition of a tropical cyclone. Although sea 
surface temperatures are sufficiently warm to support occasional 
bursts of convection, strong wind shear and a very dry environment 
should prevent it from re-organizing as a tropical cyclone for at 
least the next couple days. The initial intensity of 30 kt is based 
on ASCAT-B data valid at 1200 UTC.
 
In about 3 days, the remnant low is forecast to turn northward as it 
encounters a deep-layer trough over the central Atlantic. While it 
turns, Emily could briefly encounter a more favorable upper-level 
wind pattern, which could support the redevelopment of convection. 
However, the low-level center may also become stretched and 
ill-defined at the same time. Regeneration as a tropical cyclone 
does not appear likely enough to explicitly forecast it at this 
time. Information on the potential for regeneration will be included 
in future Tropical Weather Outlooks, if necessary. Future 
information on Emily can also be found in High Seas forecasts issued 
by the National Hurricane Center and Ocean Prediction Center.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Franklin was
located near latitude 15.1 North, longitude 69.6 West. Franklin is
moving toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A westward to
west-northwestward track is expected to continue today.  A sharp
turn to the north is expected tonight or early Tuesday, and a
generally northward motion is expected on Tuesday.  On the forecast
track, the center of Franklin is forecast to reach the southern
coast of Hispaniola late Tuesday or Tuesday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some strengthening is forecast before Franklin reaches
Hispaniola.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Franklin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml.
 
RAINFALL:  Franklin is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 2 to
4 inches, with isolated higher amounts of 6 inches, across Puerto
Rico through the middle of the week. Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10
inches, with isolated higher amounts up to 15 inches, will be
possible across portions of Hispaniola.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin within the
warning area on Tuesday and are possible within the watch area
beginning late Tuesday into Wednesday. 
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast near and to
the east of where the center makes landfall in Hispaniola.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Franklin Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 AM AST Mon Aug 21 2023
 
Franklin's cloud pattern has not become significantly better 
organized overnight.  The system is producing several clusters of 
bursting very deep convection, but convective banding features are 
not well defined at this time.  Based on microwave imagery, the 
cyclone center is apparently located near the western edge of the 
overall convective mass.  The current intensity is held at 45 kt in 
agreement with a subjective Dvorak satellite classification from 
TAFB.  This value is also supported by objective intensity estimates 
from UW-CIMSS.

The storm continues moving generally westward, with a motion 
estimate of 270/10 kt.  Franklin's forecast track is somewhat 
problematic.  A weakness in the subtropical ridge is expected to 
cause the tropical cyclone to turn northward in 24 hours or so.  
This should result in Franklin crossing Hispaniola in the 48 hour 
time frame.  After moving into the Atlantic, Franklin should turn 
northeastward while interacting with a mid-level cyclonic 
circulation.  By late in the forecast period, the mid-level cyclone 
lifts out which could allow Franklin to turn more to the left.  
However there is more than the usual amount of uncertainty in the 
3-5 day track prediction, with lots of spread in the model guidance. 
The official forecast, like the previous one, is near the middle of 
the guidance envelope and close to the model consensus.
 
The flow on the south side of a broad upper-level trough to the 
northwest of Franklin is causing moderate southwesterly vertical 
wind shear over the storm.  Dynamical guidance such as the SHIPS 
model indicate that Franklin will remain in an environment of 
moderate shear for the next several days, and the interaction with 
the mountainous land mass of Hispaniola should temporarily disrupt 
Franklin's circulation.  The current thinking is that the shear will 
not be strong enough to prevent the system from eventually becoming 
a hurricane over the southwest Atlantic.  The official intensity 
forecast follows the model consensus.  

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Franklin is expected across portions of 
Puerto Rico and Hispaniola through the middle of the week.  The 
heavy rainfall may produce areas of flash and urban flooding as well 
as river rises and mudslides.  Across Hispaniola, significant and 
potentially life-threatening flash flooding is possible Tuesday into 
Wednesday.
 
2. Franklin is expected to bring tropical storm conditions to
portions of the Dominican Republic and Haiti beginning on Tuesday
where Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect.
