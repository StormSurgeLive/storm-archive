Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Sun Aug 20 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Six, located several hundred miles east of the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL98):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to show signs of organization in <br/>
association with an area of low pressure located several hundred <br/>
miles west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands. Earlier satellite <br/>
wind data indicated the system was producing winds up to 40 mph on <br/>
its north side. In addition, first light visible satellite suggests <br/>
the center may be becoming better defined. If these current trends <br/>
continue, a short-lived tropical depression or tropical storm is <br/>
likely to form later today or tonight while it moves <br/>
west-northwestward at about 10 mph over the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic. By Monday, upper-level winds are forecast to strengthen <br/>
over the system, and further development is not expected. For <br/>
additional information on this system, including gale warnings, see <br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Caribbean (AL90):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to show signs of organization in <br/>
association with an area of low pressure over the far eastern <br/>
Caribbean Sea. Additional development of this system is expected, <br/>
and a tropical depression is likely to form during the next couple <br/>
of days as it moves westward to west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph <br/>
over the eastern and central Caribbean, before turning northward and <br/>
moving into the southwestern Atlantic Ocean by midweek. Regardless <br/>
of development, heavy rainfall is possible over portions of the <br/>
Lesser Antilles during the next couple of days. Interests in the <br/>
eastern and central Caribbean should monitor the progress of this <br/>
system. A NOAA Hurricane Reconnaissance mission is scheduled to <br/>
investigate the system later today. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
An area of disturbed weather located in the far eastern Gulf of <br/>
Mexico is expected to lead to the formation of a broad area of low <br/>
pressure early this week. Some slow development of this system could <br/>
occur thereafter as it moves westward at about 15 to 20 mph, and a <br/>
tropical depression could form as it approaches the western Gulf of <br/>
Mexico coastline by Tuesday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the far <br/>
eastern tropical Atlantic is associated with a tropical wave. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear conducive for gradual development of <br/>
this system, and a tropical depression could form later this week <br/>
while it moves west-northwestward across the eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Six Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
1100 AM AST Sun Aug 20 2023
 
Visible satellite imagery this morning continues to show a 
partially exposed center, with persistent deep convection displaced 
slightly to the north and east of the depression.  Based on a blend 
of objective and subjective satellite estimates, the initial 
intensity estimate for this advisory remains 30 kt. 

Although deep convection has persisted this morning, deep-layer 
westerly shear is expected to increase to near 40 kt today and 
remain steady during the next 24 hours. Further, dry mid-level air 
to the north of the system will likely inhibit well-organized and 
sustained deep convection. Global models and ensemble systems are in 
agreement that intensification of the depression is unlikely, and 
thus the official forecast has the depression as a remnant low in 
24 h and dissipated in 36 h.
 
The depression has continued moving slightly south of due west this 
morning, and it is expected to turn slightly north of due west 
today, with this general motion expected to continue until 
dissipation occurs. Given the continued motion toward the
west-southwest, the official track forecast lies slightly to the 
south of the previous forecast.

located near latitude 19.5 North, longitude 38.8 West. Emily is
moving toward the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h) and this
motion is expected to continue for the next several days. 
 
Satellite wind data indicates that maximum sustained winds are near 
50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. Little change in strength 
forecast today followed by gradual weakening. Emily is likely to 
become a post-tropical remnant low by Tuesday. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Tropical Storm Emily Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072023
1100 AM AST Sun Aug 20 2023

The large area of low pressure we have been monitoring 
over the last several days to the west of the Cabo Verde Islands 
has finally developed a well-defined circulation per recently 
received satellite wind data. In addition, the scatterometer wind 
data also suggest the system has developed a robust wind field on 
its northern semicircle, with ASCAT-B/C both showing believable 
wind retrievals in the 40-45 kt range. Therefore, advisories are 
being initiated on Tropical Storm Emily this morning with maximum 
sustained winds of 45 kt, which is in good agreement with the latest 
1200 UTC TAFB Dvorak fix. 

The estimated motion of the tropical storm is slowly off to the 
west-northwest, at 300/9 kt. Over the next several days, Emily 
should maintain a general west-northwestward motion as it remains 
steered by a low-level ridge centered to its north. A gradual turn 
to the north is anticipated after Emily becomes a remnant low, 
rounding the southern periphery of this subtropical ridge. The track 
guidance is in fairly good agreement on this scenario, and the 
initial track forecast lies in between the simple and corrected 
consensus aids.

Emily might already be near its peak intensity, as vertical wind 
shear is expected to substantially increase over the cyclone in the 
next 24-36 hours as it remains embedded in a fairly dry mid-level 
environment. While it is possible a bit more intensification occurs 
today, it seems more likely the system will soon succumb to the 
increasingly hostile environment over the next several days. Both 
the GFS and ECMWF suggest Emily will cease to produce organized 
convection in about 48 hours, and the official intensity forecast 
shows it becoming a post-tropical remnant low at that time. There is 
some chance the environment becomes more favorable again in 4-5 
days, but a regeneration scenario will not be shown in the official 
forecast for now.
