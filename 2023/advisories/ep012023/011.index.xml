Hurricane Adrian Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012023
900 PM MDT Thu Jun 29 2023
 
After a brief hiatus, Adrian appears to once again be strengthening 
this evening.  An SSMI/S satellite pass at 2239 UTC showed an 
apparent dry air intrusion reaching the hurricane's core with a 
weakness in the convection to the north.  However, recent 
geostationary infrared imagery suggests the storm has recovered and 
an eye has emerged.  Subjective Dvorak estimates from SAB and TAFB 
were T5.0/90 kt and T4.5/77 kt, respectively.  Therefore, the 
initial intensity has been increased to 80 kt to represent a blend 
of these estimates.
 
Adrian has a short window of conducive environmental and oceanic 
conditions that could lead to some additional intensification.  
Beginning in about 12 h or so, easterly deep-layer wind shear is 
expected to increase while sea-surface temperatures along the 
forecast track cool.  These conditions should induce a weakening 
trend.  The NHC intensity prediction is above the all of the model 
guidance in the short-term forecast, but follows the consensus aids 
beyond 24 h.  Adrian is still expected to become a post-tropical 
remnant low by day 3.

The initial motion of the hurricane is estimated to be northwestward 
or 305/7 kt.  The storm is still expected to move generally 
west-northwestward during the next few days around a ridge to its 
northeast.  The weaker, shallower vortex is then forecast to turn 
westward in the low-level trade winds.  As mentioned in previous 
advisories, the track forecast for Adrian has been shifting to the 
right and it has done so again for this cycle.  The latest official 
forecast is closest to the simple consensus aid, TVCE.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beatriz was
located near latitude 16.3 North, longitude 101.3 West. Beatriz is
moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A continued 
northwestward motion is expected for the next few days, with a 
gradual decrease in forward speed occurring over the weekend.  On 
the forecast track, the center of Beatriz is expected to approach 
the coast of western Mexico today, then move near or over portions 
of the coast of western Mexico tonight and on Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are now near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Rapid strengthening is forecast, and Beatriz is likely to 
become a hurricane later today.  Beatriz is forecast to be a 
hurricane while the center moves near or over the coast of Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
mainly to the northeast of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beatriz can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/miatcdep2.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected somewhere within the
hurricane warning area later today and tonight.  Hurricane
conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area on Saturday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area starting later today, and are possible within the tropical
storm watch area on Saturday.
 
RAINFALL: Through Sunday, storm total rainfall of 3 to 5 inches,
with maximum amounts of 8 inches, is expected across southern Mexico
from Guerrero west-northwest to Nayarit from Tropical Storm Beatriz.
This rainfall could lead to localized flash flooding and mudslides.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds.  Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Beatriz are forecast to build and spread
northward along the southwestern coast of Mexico during the next
couple of days.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.

Tropical Storm Beatriz Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022023
400 AM CDT Fri Jun 30 2023

The convective pattern associated with Beatriz has become more 
concentrated since the last advisory, with stronger convection near 
the center and more convective banding.  Two ASCAT overpasses back 
around 04Z showed winds of 45-50 kt located about 20 n mi to the 
northeast of the center.  Based on this data and the increase in 
organization since that time, the initial intensity is increased to 
a possibly conservative 50 kt.

The initial motion is now 305/11 kt.  During the next several days, 
a combination of a mid-level ridge to the north-northeast and 
Hurricane Adrian to the west should steer Beatriz generally 
northwestward.  While the models generally agree with this scenario, 
there are important differences among them on how close Beatriz will 
get to the coast of Mexico.  The GFS and the HWRF are on the left 
side of the guidance envelope and keep the center a significant 
distance offshore.  On the other hand, the ECMWF, the UKMET, and the 
Canadian models all bring the center onshore in western Mexico in 
24-36 h.  The early part of the new track forecast keeps the center 
just offshore of the coast through 36 h as a blend of the previous 
forecast and the HFIP Corrected Consensus model.  However, any 
motion to the right of the track would result in Beatriz making 
landfall in Mexico.  The remainder of the forecast track shows 
Beatriz slowing its forward motion and turning more toward the west 
in response to mid-level ridging to the north, with the center 
passing south or near the southern end of the Baja California 
peninsula.

Beatriz is in an area of light- to moderate northeasterly shear and 
over very warm sea surface temperatures.  Based on these conditions, 
and on the inner core convective structure seen earlier in 37-GHz 
microwave imagery, steady to rapid intensification is expected 
during the next 24 h as long as the center stays offshore.  Beatriz 
is expected to become a hurricane later today and maintain hurricane 
strength through 48 h.  After that time, decreasing sea surface 
temperatures along the forecast track should lead to weakening, with 
the system currently forecast to decay to a remnant low by 120 h.  
If the center moves inland over Mexico, the mountainous terrain 
should cause rapid weakening, and Beatriz, if it survives, would be 
much weaker than currently forecast.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Beatriz is forecast to rapidly intensify and become a hurricane
later today, bringing a risk of hurricane-force winds and a
dangerous storm surge to portions of the southwestern coast of
Mexico during the next couple of days.  A Hurricane Warning is now
in effect for portions of the coasts of Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima,
and Jalisco, and hurricane conditions are expected somewhere in
those areas later today and on Saturday.
 
2. Locally heavy rainfall is expected across southern Mexico from
the state of Oaxaca westward to the state of Nayarit.  These rains
could lead to life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides.
