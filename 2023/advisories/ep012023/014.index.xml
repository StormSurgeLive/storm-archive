DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM MDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Adrian was located 
near latitude 18.1 North, longitude 113.5 West. Adrian is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h) and this general 
motion is expected to continue during the next couple of days, 
followed by a turn toward the west on Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 90 mph (150 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast during the next 
couple of days, and Adrian is forecast to become post-tropical on 
Sunday. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the

(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 977 mb (28.85 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Adrian are affecting portions of the
west-central coast of Mexico and the southern Baja California

and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.

Hurricane Adrian Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012023
900 PM MDT Fri Jun 30 2023
 
Adrian appears to have begun its anticipated weakening trend.  The 
eye is no long apparent on geostationary satellite imagery and 
cloud top temperatures have warmed overall.  Microwave satellite 
imagery from 2037 UTC showed deep convection only to the west of 
center, implying the easterly shear has increased.  Subjective 
satellite intensity estimates have also decreased and the final 
T-numbers are at T4.5 from both TAFB and SAB.  Therefore, the 
initial intensity for this advisory has been lowered to 80 kt.

The hurricane has crossed the 26 degree C sea surface temperature 
isotherm this evening and SSTs along the track forecast are 
projected to decrease steadily.  Adrian is also moving into an dry 
and stable airmass.  Model guidance all predict steady to rapid 
weakening in the next couple of days.  The NHC intensity forecast is 
on the higher end of the model guidance and shows steady weakening.  
Adrian is expected to be a tropical storm in the next day or so and 
a post-tropical cyclone in 48 h.

Adrian is moving west-northwestward at about 7 kt.  A general 
west-northwestward motion is expected over the next couple of days 
as the storm is steered by a ridge to the northeast.  A gradual turn 
to the west is forecast as the decaying vortex is caught in the 
low-level flow.  The latest track prediction is similar to the 
previous advisory and close to the corrected consensus track 
guidance.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has discontinued the Hurricane Warning
east of Lazaro Cardenas.

A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area, in this case within the next 24 to 36 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the west-central coast of Mexico and in 
the southern portion of the Baja California peninsula should monitor 
the progress of this system.  Additional watches or warnings may be 
required on Saturday.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beatriz was
located near latitude 18.4 North, longitude 103.9 West. Beatriz is
moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h) and this general
motion with a gradual decrease in forward speed is expected through
Saturday night.  On the forecast track, the center of Beatriz is
expected to move near or over portions of the coast of southwestern
Mexico through early Saturday.  Beatriz is then expected to turn
west-northwestward and move away from the west-central coast of
Mexico late Saturday into Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Beatriz is expected to remain a hurricane into early 
Saturday if its center remains just offshore the coast of 
southwestern Mexico.  Weakening is expected later Saturday through 
Monday once Beatriz begins to move away from west-central Mexico.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beatriz can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/miatcdep2.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area through early Saturday.  Hurricane conditions are 
possible within the hurricane watch area on Saturday.  Tropical 
storm conditions are expected within the tropical storm warning 
area on Saturday, and are possible within the tropical storm watch 
areas Saturday or Saturday night.
 
RAINFALL:  Through Monday, storm total rainfall of 3 to 5 inches, 
with maximum amounts of 8 inches, is expected across portions of 
southern and western Mexico from Michoacan northwest to Sinaloa and 
Durango in association with Hurricane Beatriz.  This rainfall could 
lead to localized flash flooding and mudslides. 
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds.  Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Beatriz are forecast to spread northward
along the southwestern coast of Mexico during the next day or so.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.

Hurricane Beatriz Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022023
1000 PM CDT Fri Jun 30 2023
 
Beatriz continues to move along the coast of southwestern Mexico 
with the core of the hurricane now approaching Manzanillo. Although 
the center remains just offshore, numerous rainbands are inland and 
likely producing hurricane and tropical storm conditions along the 
immediate coast.  The hurricane is quite compact with its outer 
tropical-storm-force wind field estimated to extent only up to 80 n 
mi from the center.  The initial initial intensity is held at 75 kt, 
but this could be a little generous and is above the subjective 
Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB.
 
The future intensity of Beatriz is quite dependent on how much the 
hurricane interacts with land.  Most of the global models show the 
system weakening significantly or dissipating entirely as soon as in 
24 hours due to the interaction with land.  However, if the storm 
manages to stay offshore, it will likely weaken at a much more 
gradual pace.  The NHC intensity forecast is lower than the previous 
one and shows dissipation occurring a little sooner, trending toward 
the latest global model solutions.
 
The hurricane continues to move northwestward at 10 kt on the 
southwestern periphery of a mid-level ridge.  This general motion 
should continue during the next 12 to 24 hours, taking the core of 
Beatriz along or just offshore of the coast of southwestern and 
west-central Mexico.  After that time, assuming the storm survives, 
a slower westward to west-northwestward motion is expected.  The NHC 
track forecast is quite similar to the previous one and a little to 
the south of the consensus aids.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Beatriz is forecast to remain a hurricane through early 
Saturday, bringing a risk of hurricane-force winds and a dangerous 
storm surge to portions of the southwestern coast of Mexico.  A 
Hurricane Warning remains in effect for portions of the coasts of 
Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima, and Jalisco.
 
2. Locally heavy rainfall is expected across southern and western
Mexico from the state of Guerrero northwestward to the states of
Sinaloa and Durango.  These rains could lead to life-threatening
flash flooding and mudslides.
