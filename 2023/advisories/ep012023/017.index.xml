WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM PDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Adrian was
located near latitude 18.7 North, longitude 115.0 West. Adrian is
moving toward the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h). This general
motion is expected to continue with a gradual turn toward the west
during the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Continued weakening is expected during the next 
couple of days, and Adrian is forecast to become a remnant low on 
Sunday and dissipate early next week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center. A Mexican Navy automated weather station on Clarion
Island recently reported a sustained wind of 41 mph (66 km/h) and a
gust of 55 mph (89 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).

Tropical Storm Adrian Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012023
200 PM PDT Sat Jul 01 2023
 
Adrian continues to weaken. The low-level center is decoupled from
a limited area of active convection over the western portion of
the circulation. Adrian is passing just to the north of Clarion
Island, and a Mexican Navy automated weather station has recently
reported sustained tropical-storm-force winds with a gust of 48 kt.
The objective and subjective satellite estimates have continued to
fall this afternoon, with T3.0 Dvorak data-T numbers from TAFB and
SAB along with ADT, AiDT, and SATCON objective estimates between
47-53 kt. Based on these data, the initial intensity is lowered to
50 kt for this advisory.
 
The storm is still moving west-northwestward at around 300/6 kt. A
gradual turn toward the west is expected over the next couple of
days as the vortex spins down and becomes increasingly steered by
the low-level trade wind flow. Further weakening is expected due to
continued easterly shear, decreasing SSTs, and a drier and more
stable air mass along the forecast track. The official NHC forecast
now shows Adrian degenerating to a remnant low in 24 h, with
dissipation early next week. This updated forecast is very similar
to the previous one with no other notable changes.

surface circulation and has dissipated.  At 1200 PM MDT (1800 UTC),
the remnants of Beatriz were located near latitude 20.7 North,
longitude 106.2 West. The remnants are moving toward the northwest
near 12 mph (19 km/h), but are expected to slow down and meander
over the mouth of the Gulf of California during the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 30 mph (45 km/h) with
higher gusts.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Through Monday, storm total rainfall of 3 to 5 inches,
with maximum amounts of 8 inches, is expected across portions of
southern and western Mexico from Colima northwest to Sinaloa and
Durango in association with the remnants of Beatriz.  This rainfall
could lead to localized flash flooding and mudslides.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Beatriz are expected to diminish along
the southwestern coast of Mexico during the next day or so.  These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system.  For additional information on the remnants 
of Beatriz please see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National 
Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 
KWBC, and on the web at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php

Remnants Of Beatriz Special Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022023
1200 PM MDT Sat Jul 01 2023
 
A just-received ASCAT pass indicates that Beatriz has dissipated.  
There is no longer a surface circulation, and the maximum winds are 
around 25 kt, associated with a squall line that recently moved 
northward across Las Islas Marias.  As a result, this special 
advisory will be the last advisory on this system.

The government of Mexico has discontinued all watches and warnings 
along the coast of west-central Mexico and Las Islas Marias.

For additional information on the remnants, please see High Seas 
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS 
header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php
