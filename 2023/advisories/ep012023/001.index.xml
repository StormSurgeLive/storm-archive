Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 AM PDT Tue Jun 27 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Off the Southwestern Coast of Mexico (EP91):<br/>
Satellite wind data received within the past hour indicate that the <br/>
low pressure system located a few hundred miles south-southwest of <br/>
Manzanillo, Mexico, has become much better organized, and it <br/>
appears that a tropical storm is forming.  Advisories will be <br/>
initiated on this system at 2 PM PDT.  This system is expected to <br/>
move westward at 5 to 10 mph during the next few days, away from the <br/>
southwestern coast of Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...near 100 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...near 100 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico and Central America:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located a few hundred miles south of <br/>
the coast of Guatemala is producing disorganized shower and <br/>
thunderstorm activity.  Gradual development of this system is <br/>
expected during the next several days, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form by the latter part of this week while it moves <br/>
west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph, roughly parallel to the southern <br/>
and southwestern coasts of Mexico.  Interests along the southwestern <br/>
coast of Mexico should monitor the progress of this system during <br/>
the next several days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
