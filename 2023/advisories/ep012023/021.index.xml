<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Adrian, located several hundred miles west-southwest of <br/>
the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southern Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure could form several hundred miles off <br/>
the coast of southern Mexico during the middle to latter part of <br/>
this week. Thereafter, environmental conditions are forecast to be <br/>
conducive for gradual development of this system and a tropical <br/>
depression could form while it moves generally west-northwestward, <br/>
roughly parallel to the southern and southwestern coasts of Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>

200 PM PDT Sun Jul 02 2023
 
...ADRIAN DEGENERATES INTO A REMNANT LOW...
...THIS IS THE LAST NHC ADVISORY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM PDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.9N 117.5W
ABOUT 530 MI...855 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...30 MPH...45 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1006 MB...29.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM PDT (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Adrian 
was located near latitude 19.9 North, longitude 117.5 West. The 
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the west-northwest near 7 mph 
(11 km/h) and this motion is expected to continue with a gradual 
turn to the west over the next day or two.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 30 mph (45 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is anticipated and the 
remnant low will likely dissipate in the next few days.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane 
Center on this system.  For additional information on the remnant 
low please see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather

Post-Tropical Cyclone Adrian Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012023
200 PM PDT Sun Jul 02 2023
 
This has been no deep convection associated with Adrian for over 12 
hours, and it is doubtful that any organized convection will return. 
Therefore, Adrian is now a post-tropical remnant low and this will 
be the final NHC advisory on this system.  The initial intensity is 
lowered to 25 kt, based on satellite-estimated surface winds.  The 
remnant low should continue to gradually spin down over the cooler 
sea surface temperatures and open into a trough of low pressure 
during the next couple of days.  The NHC intensity forecast is 
similar to the previous one and close to the intensity model 
consensus.  Adrian is moving west-northwestward at about 6 kt.  The 
remnant low should make a gradual turn to the west over the next 
couple of days in the low-level flow and model guidance suggests it 
will likely open into a trough of low pressure beyond day 2.
 
This is the final NHC advisory of Adrian.  For additional
information on the remnant low, please see High Seas Forecasts
issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header
NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php.
