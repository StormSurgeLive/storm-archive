<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Adrian, located a few hundred miles off the coast of southwestern <br/>
Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico (EP92):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms are showing signs of organization in <br/>
association with a broad area of low pressure located a few hundred <br/>
miles south of the coast of southern Mexico. Environmental <br/>
conditions appear conducive for development of this system, and a <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form during the next couple of days <br/>
while it moves generally west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph, roughly <br/>
parallel to the southern and southwestern coasts of Mexico. <br/>
Interests along the southwestern coast of Mexico should monitor the <br/>
progress of this system during the next several days.  Additional <br/>
information on this system, including gale warnings, can be found in <br/>
High Seas Forecast issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

<title>Hurricane Adrian Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Hurricane Adrian Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012023
900 PM MDT Wed Jun 28 2023

Adrian's satellite presentation has shown little change in 
organization since earlier today.  Central convection has been 
waxing and waning, and the eye is not very well defined.  Some 
banding features are evident and the upper-level outflow is still a 
bit impeded to the north of the system.  Dvorak satellite intensity 
estimates from both SAB and TAFB have not changed since the last 
advisory cycle, so the intensity estimate remains 70 kt. 

Dynamical guidance indicates that the vertical shear over Adrian 
should remain fairly low for the next day or so.  Therefore some 
additional strengthening is forecast in the short term.  By 48 
hours, increasing easterly shear, associated with an 
upper-tropospheric high building to the north of Adrian, is 
anticipated.  This, coupled with cooler ocean waters, should cause 
weakening.  The official intensity forecast is a blend of the 
statistical-dynamical guidance and the dynamical model consensus.

Adrian continues to plod slowly westward, or at about 280/5 kt.  A 
weak mid-level ridge to the north of the tropical cyclone 
should maintain a westward to west-northwestward motion until late 
in the forecast period.  In 4 to 5 days, the ridge weakens and 
Adrian's motion should slow even further.  Another factor in the 
track late in the period is the possible interaction of Adrian 
or its remnant low with another system to the east.  The details of 
this interaction are quite uncertain at this time, and the official 
track forecast remains close to the dynamical model consensus.
