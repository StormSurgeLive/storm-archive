Hurricane Adrian Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012023
300 PM MDT Fri Jun 30 2023
 
The satellite structure of Adrian looked its best shortly after the
time of the previous advisory. Since then, the eye has become
obscured by clouds in visible satellite imagery. Although deep
convection still surrounds the ragged eye, infrared cloud top
temperatures have been gradually warming, and the central dense
overcast has become more asymmetric over the past few hours. It
appears that vertical wind shear is finally taking a toll on the
hurricane, and the objective satellite estimates have leveled off or
begun to decrease this afternoon. The initial intensity is held at
90 kt, in best agreement with a blend of recent UW-CIMSS SATCON, 
ADT, and AiDT estimates.
 
Adrian is forecast to cross the 26 deg C SST isotherm tonight and
move over 23 deg C SSTs within the next couple of days. In addition,
the cyclone is expected to encounter moderate easterly shear that
should continue to disrupt its vertical organization. Therefore,
weakening is anticipated during the next several days. The global
and regional models indicate that the cyclone will struggle to
produce organized convection by Sunday. Therefore, the official NHC
forecast shows remnant low status at 48 h and dissipation by day 4.
 
The hurricane continues to move northwestward, or 310/6 kt. A
general west-northwestward to northwestward motion is expected over
the next couple of days as Adrian is steered by a mid-level ridge
centered over the southern United States. As the cyclone weakens
and spins down, it should turn westward within the low-level trade
wind flow until it dissipates. Based on the latest track guidance
and consensus aids, the updated NHC forecast has once again been
nudged to the right of the previous one.

tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area, in this case within the next 24 to 36 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the west-central coast of Mexico and in
the southern portion of the Baja California peninsula should
monitor the progress of this system.  Additional watches or
warnings may be required later today or on Saturday.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beatriz was
located near latitude 17.8 North, longitude 103.1 West.  Beatriz is
moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this 
general motion with a gradual decrease in forward speed is expected 
through Saturday night.  On the forecast track, the center of
Beatriz is expected to move near or over portions of the coast of
southwestern Mexico through Saturday.  Beatriz is then expected to 
turn west-northwestward and move away from the west-central coast 
of Mexico Sunday and Monday.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Beatriz is expected to remain a hurricane during the next 
day if its center remains just offshore the coast of southwestern 
Mexico.  Weakening is expected Saturday through Monday once Beatriz 
begins to move away from west-central Mexico.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beatriz can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/miatcdep2.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane 
warning area through Saturday.  Hurricane conditions are possible 
within the hurricane watch area on Saturday.  Tropical storm 
conditions are expected within the tropical storm warning area on 
Saturday, and are possible within the tropical storm watch areas 
Saturday or Saturday night.
 
RAINFALL:  Through Monday, storm total rainfall of 3 to 5 inches,
with maximum amounts of 8 inches, is expected across portions of
southern and western Mexico from Guerrero northwest to Sinaloa and
Durango within, and around the periphery of, Hurricane Beatriz.
This rainfall could lead to localized flash flooding and mudslides.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds.  Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Beatriz are forecast to spread northward
along the southwestern coast of Mexico during the next day or so.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.

Hurricane Beatriz Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022023
400 PM CDT Fri Jun 30 2023
 
An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated Beatriz 
a couple of hours ago and measured peak 700-mb flight-level winds 
of 84 kt and SFMR surface winds around 70 kt, and based on that 
data, Beatriz's initial intensity is 75 kt.  Since that time, the 
eye which had become apparent in satellite imagery has become 
obscured, and it's possible that the hurricane's structure is 
beginning to be affected by the nearby mountainous terrain of 
Mexico.

Beatriz continues to move northwestward, or 305/11 kt, and that 
general motion should continue for the next 36 hours or so while 
the hurricane moves along the southwestern periphery of a mid-level 
ridge located over northern Mexico and the western Gulf of Mexico.  
On this trajectory, Beatriz will continue to graze the coast of 
southwestern Mexico during the next 24 hours, but any wobble to the 
right of the forecast track could bring the center inland during 
that time.  If Beatriz survives the next 36 hours, another 
mid-tropospheric ridge is expected to build over the southwestern 
United States, causing the cyclone to turn west-northwestward and 
then westward and slow down on days 2 and 3.  There is a fair 
amount of model spread during that period, and the updated NHC 
track forecast is closest to the GFS, TVCE, and HCCA aids, nudged a 
bit to the right of the previous forecast.

Beatriz is expected to remain a hurricane during the next 24 hours 
if its center remains over water, but the mountainous terrain could 
cause some slow weakening regardless.  After 36 hours, increasing 
shear, cooler sea surface temperatures, and a drier, more subsident 
atmosphere are expected to contribute to faster weakening as 
Beatriz moves away from west-central Mexico.  Most of the global 
models, with the exception of the GFS, dissipate the circulation by 
day 3, so the new NHC forecast now shows Beatriz degenerating into 
a remnant low by day 3, with dissipation occurring by day 4.


KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Beatriz is forecast to remain a hurricane for the next day or 
so, bringing a risk of hurricane-force winds and a dangerous storm 
surge to portions of the southwestern coast of Mexico through 
Saturday afternoon.  A Hurricane Warning remains in effect for 
portions of the coasts of Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima, and Jalisco.
 
2. Locally heavy rainfall is expected across southern and western 
Mexico from the state of Guerrero northwestward to the states of 
Sinaloa and Durango.  These rains could lead to life-threatening 
flash flooding and mudslides.
