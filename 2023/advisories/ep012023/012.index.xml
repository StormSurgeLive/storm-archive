WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Adrian was located
near latitude 17.3 North, longitude 112.2 West. Adrian is moving
toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h). A west-northwestward
motion at a similar forward speed is expected during the next
couple of days, followed by a turn toward the west on Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual weakening is expected to begin by tonight, followed
by more rapid weakening this weekend and into early next week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 970 mb (28.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Adrian are affecting portions of the
southwestern and west-central coasts of Mexico and the southern Baja
California peninsula. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM MDT.

Hurricane Adrian Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012023
900 AM MDT Fri Jun 30 2023
 
The overall satellite presentation of Adrian has improved this
morning. The eye is embedded deeper within a more symmetric central
dense overcast and surrounded by a ring of deep convection with
infrared cloud top temperatures colder than -60 deg C. Recent SSMIS
microwave images reveal a well-defined mid-level eyewall, although
some vertical tilt is noted between the 91 GHz and 37 GHz channels,
which suggests Adrian may be experiencing some easterly shear. The
initial intensity is a bit more uncertain than normal given the
large spread in the satellite intensity estimates, which range from
77-102 kt. Based on the improved satellite structure, the initial
intensity is raised to 90 kt for this advisory. This lies in between
the subjective SAB and TAFB Dvorak estimates, and is in best
agreement with recent UW-CIMSS ADT and AiDT estimates.
 
The hurricane is forecast to cross the 26 deg C SST isotherm and
encounter increased easterly shear during the next 12 to 24 h.
Therefore, the official NHC forecast shows gradual weakening in the
near term, followed by more rapid weakening as the cyclone becomes
increasingly sheared and moves over even cooler waters. Adrian will
likely struggle to produce organized convection beyond 48 h given
these hostile conditions, and it is forecast to degenerate to a
remnant low shortly thereafter and dissipate by early Wednesday.
 
Adrian has recently been moving more northwestward, and its initial
motion is 305/6 kt. The cyclone is forecast to move generally
west-northwestward during the next couple of days, around the
southwestern periphery of mid-tropospheric high pressure centered
over the southern United States. As Adrian loses deep convection and
becomes more vertically shallow, the remnant low is expected to turn
more westward on Monday within the low-level trade wind flow. Once
again, the center of Adrian and the latest track guidance has
trended to the right of the previous forecast, and so the updated
NHC forecast has been adjusted in that direction.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beatriz was
located near latitude 16.7 North, longitude 101.9 West.  Beatriz is
moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A continued
northwestward motion is expected for the next few days, with a
gradual decrease in forward speed occurring over the weekend.  On
the forecast track, the center of Beatriz is expected to approach
the coast of southwestern Mexico today, then move near or over 
portions of the coast of southwestern Mexico tonight and on 
Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are now near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Rapid strengthening is forecast, and Beatriz is likely to
become a hurricane later today.  Beatriz is forecast to be a
hurricane while the center moves near or over the coast of Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
mainly to the northeast of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beatriz can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/miatcdep2.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected somewhere within the
hurricane warning area later today and tonight.  Hurricane
conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area on Saturday.
Tropical storm conditions are likely occurring in the tropical 
storm warning area, and are possible within the tropical storm watch 
area on Saturday.
 
RAINFALL: Through Sunday, storm total rainfall of 3 to 5 inches,
with maximum amounts of 8 inches, is expected across southern Mexico
from Guerrero west-northwest to Nayarit from Tropical Storm Beatriz.
This rainfall could lead to localized flash flooding and mudslides.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds.  Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Beatriz are forecast to spread northward 
along the southwestern coast of Mexico during the next couple of 
days.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and 
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local 
weather office.

Tropical Storm Beatriz Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022023
400 AM CDT Fri Jun 30 2023

The convective pattern associated with Beatriz has become more 
concentrated since the last advisory, with stronger convection near 
the center and more convective banding.  Two ASCAT overpasses back 
around 04Z showed winds of 45-50 kt located about 20 n mi to the 
northeast of the center.  Based on this data and the increase in 
organization since that time, the initial intensity is increased to 
a possibly conservative 50 kt.

The initial motion is now 305/11 kt.  During the next several days, 
a combination of a mid-level ridge to the north-northeast and 
Hurricane Adrian to the west should steer Beatriz generally 
northwestward.  While the models generally agree with this scenario, 
there are important differences among them on how close Beatriz will 
get to the coast of Mexico.  The GFS and the HWRF are on the left 
side of the guidance envelope and keep the center a significant 
distance offshore.  On the other hand, the ECMWF, the UKMET, and the 
Canadian models all bring the center onshore in western Mexico in 
24-36 h.  The early part of the new track forecast keeps the center 
just offshore of the coast through 36 h as a blend of the previous 
forecast and the HFIP Corrected Consensus model.  However, any 
motion to the right of the track would result in Beatriz making 
landfall in Mexico.  The remainder of the forecast track shows 
Beatriz slowing its forward motion and turning more toward the west 
in response to mid-level ridging to the north, with the center 
passing south or near the southern end of the Baja California 
peninsula.

Beatriz is in an area of light- to moderate northeasterly shear and 
over very warm sea surface temperatures.  Based on these conditions, 
and on the inner core convective structure seen earlier in 37-GHz 
microwave imagery, steady to rapid intensification is expected 
during the next 24 h as long as the center stays offshore.  Beatriz 
is expected to become a hurricane later today and maintain hurricane 
strength through 48 h.  After that time, decreasing sea surface 
temperatures along the forecast track should lead to weakening, with 
the system currently forecast to decay to a remnant low by 120 h.  
If the center moves inland over Mexico, the mountainous terrain 
should cause rapid weakening, and Beatriz, if it survives, would be 
much weaker than currently forecast.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Beatriz is forecast to rapidly intensify and become a hurricane
later today, bringing a risk of hurricane-force winds and a
dangerous storm surge to portions of the southwestern coast of
Mexico during the next couple of days.  A Hurricane Warning is now
in effect for portions of the coasts of Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima,
and Jalisco, and hurricane conditions are expected somewhere in
those areas later today and on Saturday.
 
2. Locally heavy rainfall is expected across southern Mexico from
the state of Oaxaca westward to the state of Nayarit.  These rains
could lead to life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides.
