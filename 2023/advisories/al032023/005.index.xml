DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bret was
located near latitude 11.9 North, longitude 47.0 West.  Bret is
moving toward the west near 21 mph (33 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue for the next several days.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Bret could move across portions of the 
Lesser Antilles Thursday afternoon through Thursday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and 
Bret is expected to be a tropical storm when it reaches the Lesser 
Antilles Thursday and Thursday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Bret can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3, WMO header

RAINFALL:  Rainfall amounts of 4 to 6 inches with maximum amounts of
10 inches are possible across portions of the Lesser Antilles from
Guadeloupe southward to St. Lucia.  Rainfall amounts of 2 to 4
inches are possible across Barbados and St. Vincent and the

<title>Tropical Storm Bret Forecast Discussion Number 5</title>

Tropical Storm Bret Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032023
1100 AM AST Tue Jun 20 2023
 
Bret's low-level center has become exposed this morning, surrounded 
by bands of deep convection in nearly all quadrants.  Upper-level 
outflow still appears established over the system, but the exposed 
center may suggest that some moderate westerly shear is affecting 
Bret below the cirrus level.  Bret's initial intensity remains 35 
kt based on T2.5 Dvorak classifications from TAFB and SAB.  
Scatterometer passes continue to miss Bret, keeping us from getting 
a better handle on the system's intensity and size.

Global model forecast fields suggest that the mid-level westerly 
shear affecting Bret is unlikely to abate during the next few days, 
and it's likely that deeper-layer shear will also increase in about 
2 to 3 days.  This forecast scenario has led to some changes in 
Bret's intensity forecast.  Aside from the HWRF, which is an 
outlier scenario, none of the other reliable intensity models bring 
Bret to hurricane intensity.  In addition, all of the global models 
show Bret opening up into a trough in 2 to 4 days as it's passing 
the Lesser Antilles or after it moves into the eastern Caribbean 
Sea.  As a result, Bret's forecast intensity in the NHC prediction 
has been decreased, still allowing for the possibility of some 
strengthening, but keeping the system below hurricane strength.  In 
addition, the new forecast now shows dissipation by day 5, but if 
the global models are correct, that could occur even sooner.

Bret is moving a little faster toward the west, or 275/18 kt.  
Low- to mid-level ridging over the Atlantic is expected to keep 
Bret on a westward trajectory through the forecast period, with 
only some slight fluctuations in forward speed.  The track guidance 
has shifted southward on this cycle, under the assumption that 
low-level ridging will have a greater impact on preventing a 
weaker Bret from gaining much latitude.  One important note is that 
the weaker Bret remains, it could also move faster than what is 
shown in the NHC forecast (and what is suggested by the ECWMF 
model).

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Bret is forecast to approach the Lesser Antilles through 
early Thursday and then move across the islands Thursday and 
Thursday night as a tropical storm, bringing a risk of flooding 
from heavy rainfall, strong winds, and dangerous waves along the 
coast.
 
2. Given the larger-than-usual uncertainty in the track and 
intensity forecasts, it is too early to specify the location and 
magnitude of where Bret's associated hazards could occur.  However, 
everyone in the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands 
should closely monitor updates to the forecast for Bret.  Tropical 
storm watches may be required for portions of the Lesser Antilles 
later today or tonight.
