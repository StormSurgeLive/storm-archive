DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bret was
located near latitude 13.4 North, longitude 60.3 West. Bret is
moving toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h) and this general motion
with an increase in forward speed is expected during the next few
days.  On the forecast track, the center of Bret is expected to move
across the Windward Islands during the next several hours, and then 
move westward across the eastern and central Caribbean Sea Friday 
and Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is anticipated over the next couple of
days, and the system is likely to dissipate over the central
Caribbean Sea on Sunday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.  Several automated stations on Martinique have 
recently reported sustained winds of 40-45 mph (65-70 km/h) and 
wind gusts of 50-60 mph (85-95 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
