* St. Vincent and the Grenadines
 
In this case, a Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm
conditions are occurring within the warning area.
 
Interests adjacent to the southeastern Caribbean Sea should monitor
the progress of Bret.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bret was
located near latitude 13.4 North, longitude 63.6 West.  Bret is
moving toward the west near 18 mph (30 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue through the weekend.  On the forecast
track, the center of Bret will continue moving westward away from
the Windward Islands and across the eastern and central Caribbean
Sea during the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts. Weakening is forecast during the next couple of days, and
Bret is expected to dissipate over the central Caribbean Sea by
Saturday night or Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
mainly to the north of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Bret can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3, WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and
on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to diminish within
the tropical storm warning areas later this morning.
 
RAINFALL:  Storm total rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches with
maximum amounts of 10 inches are possible across portions of the
Lesser Antilles from Guadeloupe south through St. Vincent and the
Grenadines, including Barbados. The heavy rainfall could lead to
flash flooding, especially across areas of higher terrain. Urban
flooding is also possible.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Bret are expected to begin subsiding
along the Lesser Antilles through the day.  Swells are likely
to increase in areas adjacent to the central Caribbean Sea
later today and on Sunday.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Tropical Storm Bret Discussion Number  16...Updated
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032023
500 AM AST Fri Jun 23 2023
 
Updated to include discontinuation of the Tropical Storm Warning 
for Dominica.
 
Bret's center is now over the southeastern Caribbean Sea, but
convective activity extends more than 300 n mi to the east across
the Windward Islands and adjacent Atlantic waters.  An Air Force
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft measured peak 850-mb flight-level
winds of 60 kt and SFMR winds of 49 kt to the north of the center
on its last pass before heading back to base, and the initial
intensity is therefore maintained at 50 kt.  The plane had found
that Bret's central pressure had dropped again, back down to 1001
mb.
 
Bret continues to move quickly westward, or 270/16 kt, to the south
of an area of high pressure located over the western Atlantic.  The
subtropical ridge is expected to continue steering Bret quickly
westward across the eastern and central Caribbean Sea during the
next couple of days.  There are no changes to the track model
guidance, or the track forecast reasoning, and the official NHC
forecast is a little faster than the model consensus aids, hedging
toward the GFS and ECMWF solutions.
 
Bret is approaching an upper-level trough located over the eastern
Caribbean Sea, and the resulting deep-layer shear over the storm is
analyzed to be about 25 kt out of the west-southwest.  Even stronger
shear and a dry mid-level environment are expected to cause Bret to
gradually weaken during the next couple of days, with global model
fields showing the system degenerating into a trough over the
central Caribbean Sea some time over the weekend.  The NHC forecast
shows dissipation by Sunday, but some model fields suggest it could
happen earlier than that.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Bret is moving westward over the southeastern Caribbean Sea, but
trailing rainbands with embedded gusty winds continue to affect
portions of the Windward Islands.  These conditions should gradually
subside through the day.
 
2. A Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect for St. Vincent and
the Grenadines, St. Lucia, and Martinique.

Tropical Storm Cindy Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042023
500 AM AST Fri Jun 23 2023
 
Cindy is continuing to show signs of improvement based on satellite
imagery.  Deep convection with cold cloud tops of less than -80
degrees C are near the estimated low-level center, an indication the
vertical wind shear is likely weakening.  The initial intensity has
been increased to 40 kt based on a blend of the 3.0 and 2.5
subjective Dvorak satellite intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB,
respectively.
 
The reasoning behind the intensity forecast is unchanged.  SHIPS 
model guidance indicates that Cindy will remain embedded within an 
area of weak vertical wind shear for the next day or so, shielding 
it from the surrounding drier mid-level airmass.  Given the 
relatively conducive environmental and oceanic conditions,  gradual 
strengthening is expected.  Beyond 48 h, the deep-layer shear is 
forecast to increased which, in combination with the dry air, will 
likely weaken Cindy early next week.  The official intensity 
forecast is very similar to the previous prediction.

Cindy is moving west-northwestward at 13 kt.  This motion is 
expected to continue during the next several days as Cindy moves 
around the southwest periphery of a subtropical ridge.  The track 
guidance for the cyclone has shifted northward in the 3-5 day range, 
and the NHC track forecast has been nudged northward as a result.  
This track still keeps Cindy well to the northeast of the northern 
Leeward Islands.
