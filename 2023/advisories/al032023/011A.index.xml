DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bret was
located near latitude 13.5 North, longitude 55.8 West.  Bret is
moving toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h), and this general
motion with an increase in forward speed is expected over the next
few days.  On the forecast track, the center of Bret is expected to
approach the Lesser Antilles today, move across the Lesser Antilles 
late today and tonight, and then move westward across the eastern 
and central Caribbean Sea Friday and Saturday.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 
km/h) with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast 
today while Bret approaches the Lesser Antilles.  Weakening is 
anticipated to begin tonight or Friday after Bret passes the Lesser 
Antilles, and the system is likely to dissipate over the central 
Caribbean Sea by Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The latest minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft data is 996 mb (29.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Bret can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3, WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and
on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area 
this evening or tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are expected 
within the tropical storm warning areas and possible within the 
watch areas late today and tonight.
 
RAINFALL:  Through Saturday, storm total rainfall amounts of 3 to 6
inches with maximum amounts of 10 inches are possible across
portions of the Lesser Antilles from Guadeloupe south to St. Vincent
and the Grenadines, including Barbados. The heavy rainfall could
lead to flash flooding, especially across areas of higher terrain.
Urban flooding is also possible.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Bret are expected to begin affecting
portions of the Lesser Antilles today.  These swells are likely to 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please 
consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Bret Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Tropical Storm Bret Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032023
1100 PM AST Wed Jun 21 2023
 
Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that Bret has changed little in intensity during the past few hours. 
The aircraft reported a central pressure near 999-1000 mb with 
maximum 850 mb flight-level winds of 65 kt to the northeast of the 
center, along with a maximum surface wind estimate of 56 kt from the 
Stepped Frequency Microwave radiometer.  Based on these, the initial 
intensity remains 55 kt.  Satellite imagery shows that Bret 
continues to generate strong convection near and northeast of the 
center.  However, it continues to be affected by northwesterly shear 
that is undercutting the storm's outflow pattern.
 
Little change in strength is likely during the next 24 hours as
Bret approaches the Lesser Antilles.  After that time, the cyclone
will encounter increasing vertical wind shear due to an upper-level
trough over the eastern Caribbean.  This should cause steady to
rapid weakening, and Bret is now expected to degenerate into an
open trough between 60-72 hr in agreement with the global model
guidance.  The new intensity forecast follows the overall trend of
the intensity guidance.
 
Bret continues to move westward, or 280/14 kt, under the influence
of low- to mid-level ridging to its north.  Some increase in
forward speed may occur over the Caribbean as Bret weakens.  There
has been little change in the track guidance since the last
advisory, and the new forecast track is an update of the previous
track with the center passing through the Lesser Antilles in about
24 hours.  Users are reminded that NHC's track forecasts have
average errors of about 40 n mi at 24 hours, and there is risk of
strong winds and heavy rainfall for several islands within the
Lesser Antilles regardless of exactly where the center crosses the
island chain.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Bret is forecast to approach the Lesser Antilles through
Thursday and then move across those islands late Thursday and
Thursday night as a strong tropical storm.
 
2. A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for St. Lucia, Martinique, 
and Dominica, and there is a risk of flooding from heavy rainfall, 
strong winds, and dangerous waves along the coast within the warning 
area. A Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect for Barbados and St 
Vincent and the Grenadines. Additional warnings are possible for 
some islands in the Lesser Antilles on Thursday.
