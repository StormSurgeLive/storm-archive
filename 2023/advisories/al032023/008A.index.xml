<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Bret, located several hundred miles east of the Windward <br/>
Islands.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL93):<br/>
Satellite images indicate that the broad area of low pressure <br/>
located about midway between the west coast of Africa and the <br/>
Lesser Antilles has become better organized overnight. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear conducive for further development <br/>
of this system, and a tropical depression will likely form during <br/>
the next couple of days.  This system is expected to move westward <br/>
to west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph across the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic through the early part of the weekend. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the Lesser Antilles should monitor the
progress of Bret.  Additional watches or warnings will likely be
required for these islands today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bret was
located near latitude 12.9 North, longitude 52.0 West.  Bret is
moving toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue for the next several days.  On the
forecast track, the center of Bret is expected to move across
portions of the Lesser Antilles Thursday afternoon and Thursday
night, and then move across the eastern Caribbean Sea on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some increase in strength is possible before Bret reaches the 
Caribbean Sea.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Bret can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3, WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and
on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area by Thursday.
 
RAINFALL:  Through Saturday, storm total rainfall amounts of 3 to 6
inches with maximum amounts of 10 inches are possible across
portions of the Lesser Antilles from Guadeloupe south to Grenada,
including Barbados.  The heavy rainfall could lead to flash
flooding, especially across areas of higher terrain.  Isolated urban
flooding is also possible.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Tropical Storm Bret Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032023
500 AM AST Wed Jun 21 2023
 
The storm's cloud pattern consists of a ragged-looking CDO with a 
few very cold cloud tops, along with some banding features over the 
eastern semicircle.  The current intensity estimate is set at 50 kt, 
which is the average of subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and 
SAB.  Although the overall upper-tropospheric outflow pattern 
remains fairly well defined, the outflow is beginning to become 
slightly impeded over the western portion of the circulation.  An 
Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate Bret 
this afternoon, and should provide a better estimate of the storm's 
intensity and structure.

Some additional strengthening is possible during the next day or so, 
but when the cyclone moves into the eastern Caribbean Sea, the 
atmospheric environment is expected to become increasingly 
unfavorable for intensification.  Dynamical guidance indicates that 
the flow associated with an upper-level trough over the eastern 
Caribbean, and a stronger trough farther west, should create a 
significant increase in vertical shear over Bret.  As a result, the 
tropical cyclone is likely to begin weakening in a couple of days, 
and global models are in good agreement that the system will 
degenerate into a wave as it approaches the western Caribbean Sea.  
The official intensity forecast is similar to the previous one and 
near or a little above the model consensus.

Bret continues its mainly westward track with an initial motion of 
280/14 kt.  A mid-level ridge should be maintained to the north of 
the tropical cyclone for the next few days.  This steering pattern 
will maintain a slightly north of due westward movement until the 
system dissipates.  Users are reminded that NHC's track forecasts 
have average errors of about 60 n mi at 48 hours, and it is too soon 
to know exactly where Bret's center will move across the Lesser 
Antilles island chain.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Bret is forecast to approach the Lesser Antilles through
Thursday morning and then move across those islands Thursday
afternoon and Thursday night as a strong tropical storm, bringing a 
risk of flooding from heavy rainfall, strong winds, and dangerous 
waves along the coast.
 
2. Given the uncertainty in the track and intensity forecasts, it
is too early to specify the location and magnitude of where Bret's
associated hazards could occur.  A Tropical Storm Watch is in 
effect for Barbados, Dominica, Martinique, and St. Lucia, and
additional watches and warnings are likely for these and other
islands in the Lesser Antilles today.
