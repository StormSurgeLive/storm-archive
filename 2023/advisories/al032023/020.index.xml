DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bret was
located near latitude 13.1 North, longitude 69.8 West.  Bret is
moving toward the west near 18 mph (30 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue through tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h)

Tropical Storm Bret Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032023
500 AM AST Sat Jun 24 2023
 
Bret is passing just to the north of Aruba, while producing a 
healthy burst of deep convection that has obscured the center in 
infrared satellite imagery.  Radar data from Curacao indicates that 
the strongest activity is to the north of the ABC Islands, although 
a band of showers and thunderstorms is currently moving over Aruba. 
Scatterometer data showed peak winds of 35-40 kt to the north of 
Bret's center, and along with overnight reconnaissance data, the 
storm's intensity is lowered to 40 kt on this advisory.

Over 30 kt of northwesterly shear is affecting Bret, which is 
expected to continue through the weekend.  Therefore, Bret is still 
forecast to degenerate into a trough by 36 hours, although global 
model fields suggest this could happen as early as tonight.

Bret continues to move quickly toward the west, or 270/16 kt, 
steered by subtropical ridging over the western Atlantic.  Bret is 
forecast to remain on this general trajectory during the next 
several days, with its remnants reaching Central America on Monday.

<title>Tropical Storm Cindy Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Tropical Storm Cindy Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042023
1100 PM AST Fri Jun 23 2023
 
After a lull in convective activity earlier today, deep convection 
associated with Cindy has increased tonight. A cold dense overcast 
with cloud top temperatures colder than -70C has expanded over the 
center of the cyclone, and a curved band of convection has developed 
over the northern portion of the circulation. Unfortunately, no 
recent microwave or scatterometer data are available to assess the 
structure and intensity of Cindy. The initial intensity of 45 kt is 
supported by objective UW-CIMSS ADT and SATCON estimates, and a T3.0 
subjective Dvorak estimate from SAB.

Cindy has a brief window to strengthen during the next 12 h or so. 
Then, deep-layer shear is forecast to increase over the storm by 
Sunday in association with an upper-level trough over the central 
Atlantic. This, along with potential bouts of dry air entrainment, 
should cause Cindy to weaken through early next week despite warm 
SSTs along its track. The latest NHC forecast shows Cindy reaching 
its peak intensity in 12-24 h, followed by gradual weakening 
thereafter. While most the global models agree that Cindy will open 
into a trough by the middle of next week, the 18 UTC GFS and HAFS 
runs show the cyclone remaining intact and deepening near and beyond 
the end of the forecast period. While this does not seem like the 
most likely outcome, it cannot be completely ruled out at this time. 
For now, the official NHC forecast continues to follow most of the 
non-GFS guidance and shows dissipation by day 5, but note that 
future forecast changes may be necessary.

The tropical storm is moving west-northwestward at 295/13 kt. A 
general west-northwestward to northwestward motion is expected over 
the next few days as Cindy is steered by a subtropical ridge to its 
northeast. The track model spread increases early next week, with 
the stronger GFS showing a sharper recurvature and a track on the 
far right of the guidance envelope. The NHC track forecast is 
slightly to the right of the previous one, but still falls to the 
left of the multi-model consensus aids given the weaker NHC 
intensity forecast. Cindy is expected to remain well to the east and 
northeast of the northern Leeward Islands.
