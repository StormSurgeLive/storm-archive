SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Barbados
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the Lesser Antilles should monitor the
progress of Bret.  Tropical storm watches will likely be required
for other islands later tonight.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bret was
located near latitude 12.2 North, longitude 48.6 West.  Bret is
moving toward the west near 18 mph (30 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue for the next several days.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Bret is expected move across portions 
of the Lesser Antilles Thursday afternoon and Thursday night, and 
then move across the eastern Caribbean Sea on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast during the 
next day or so, and Bret is expected to be a tropical storm when it 
reaches the Lesser Antilles Thursday and Thursday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Bret can be found in the Tropical Cyclone 
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3, WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and 
on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area by Thursday.
 
RAINFALL:  Through Saturday morning, storm total rainfall amounts of 
4 to 6 inches with maximum amounts of 10 inches are possible across 
portions of the Lesser Antilles from Guadeloupe southward to St. 
Lucia.  Rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches are possible across 
Barbados and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  The heavy rainfall 
could lead to flash flooding, especially across areas of higher 
terrain.  Isolated urban flooding is also possible.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Bret Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Bret Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032023
500 PM AST Tue Jun 20 2023
 
A burst of deep convection developed over Bret's center during the 
past several hours, although a 1641 UTC AMSR2 microwave pass showed 
that most of the convective activity is located within a band 
wrapping around the east side of the circulation.  Based on the 
slightly improved convective structure, the initial intensity is 
raised to 40 kt, which is a blend of T2.5/35 kt and T3.0/45 kt 
Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB, respectively.

Despite upper-level cirrus clouds radiating away from the storm in 
all quadrants, it still appears that there is some westerly shear 
affecting the system below the cirrus level.  Global model 
forecasts suggest that this setup will continue for the next couple 
of days, but it shouldn't be strong enough to prevent some 
additional strengthening while Bret approaches the Lesser Antilles. 
The NHC intensity forecast is very close to the HCCA and IVCN 
consensus aids through 60 hours, and continues to show Bret 
crossing the islands as a 55-kt tropical storm.  Just after 
that time, Bret will be approaching an upper-level trough located 
over the eastern Caribbean Sea, and that feature is likely to cause 
more significant deep-layer shear over the storm by Friday.  
Because of the increase in shear, all of the global models show 
Bret opening up into a trough by day 4.  For continuity purposes, 
the official forecast continues to show a day 4 point, but it's 
likely that Bret will have dissipated by then.

The initial motion remains westward, or 280/17 kt.  There is very 
little change to the forecast track reasoning, with low- to 
mid-level ridging expected to steer Bret toward the west until it 
dissipates by day 4.  The track guidance has not shifted any 
farther south on this cycle, so the new NHC track forecast is very 
similar to the previous one.  Users are reminded that NHC's track 
forecasts have average errors of 60 to 75 n mi from 48 to 60 hours, 
and it is too soon to know exactly where Bret's center will move 
across the Lesser Antilles chain.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Bret is forecast to approach the Lesser Antilles through 
Thursday morning and then move across the islands Thursday 
afternoon and Thursday night as a tropical storm, bringing a risk of 
flooding from heavy rainfall, strong winds, and dangerous waves 
along the coast.
 
2. Given the uncertainty in the track and intensity forecasts, it 
is too early to specify the location and magnitude of where Bret's 
associated hazards could occur.  A Tropical Storm Watch has been 
issued for Barbados, and additional watches are likely for other 
islands within the Lesser Antilles later tonight.
