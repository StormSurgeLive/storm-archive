DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bret was
located near latitude 13.4 North, longitude 60.3 West. Bret is
moving toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h) and this general motion
with an increase in forward speed is expected during the next few
days.  On the forecast track, the center of Bret is expected to move
across the Windward Islands during the next several hours, and then 
move westward across the eastern and central Caribbean Sea Friday 
and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is anticipated over the next couple of
days, and the system is likely to dissipate over the central
Caribbean Sea on Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.  Several automated stations on Martinique have 
recently reported sustained winds of 40-45 mph (65-70 km/h) and 
wind gusts of 50-60 mph (85-95 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Bret can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3, WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and
on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area
this evening or tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are expected
within the tropical storm warning areas through tonight.
 
RAINFALL:  Storm total rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches with
maximum amounts of 10 inches are possible across portions of the
Lesser Antilles from Guadeloupe south to St Vincent and the
Grenadines, including Barbados.  The heavy rainfall could lead to
flash flooding, especially across areas of higher terrain. Urban
flooding is also possible.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Bret are expected to affect portions of
the Lesser Antilles through Friday.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Tropical Storm Bret Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032023
500 PM AST Thu Jun 22 2023
 
 
The center of Bret is very near Barbados.  Surface observations from
the island have recorded wind gusts of tropical storm force during
the past few hours.  Sustained tropical-storm-force winds have
recently been reported in St. Lucia. Based on data from the Air
Force Hurricane Hunters and an ASCAT-C pass from earlier today, the
initial intensity has been nudged downward to 55 kt, and the
strongest winds are north of the center.  Radar data from Barbados
and satellite images indicate that Bret is strongly sheared with
deep convection mostly confined to the northeast part of the
circulation.
 
Bret has begun to accelerate and is now moving just south of due
west on the southeast side of a subtropical ridge.  Since the ridge
is expected to remain in place, Bret should continue westward at a
quick pace.  There continues to be some forward speed differences
among the model solutions, but given recent trends and the overall
steering pattern, the NHC track forecast remains on the faster side
of the guidance envelope. This should take the storm across the
Lesser Antilles this evening and overnight and then across the
eastern and central Caribbean Sea Friday and Saturday.
 
Bret will likely maintain its strength while it moves across the
Lesser Antilles tonight. However, progressively stronger shear and
dry air should cause the storm to gradually lose strength on Friday
and Saturday.  The NHC intensity forecast is a little lower than
the previous one and near the middle of the guidance envelope.
Dissipation is expected to occur on Sunday, following the global
model guidance.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Bret is forecast to move across the Lesser Antilles this evening
and tonight as a strong tropical storm.
 
2. A Hurricane Watch and a Tropical Storm Warning are in effect
for St. Lucia, and a Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for
Barbados, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Martinique, and Dominica.
There is a risk of flooding from heavy rainfall, strong winds, and
dangerous waves along the coast within the warning area.

Tropical Depression Four Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042023
500 PM AST Thu Jun 22 2023
 
The tropical cyclone continues to exhibit a shear pattern on 
satellite imagery with the center located to the east of the main 
area of deep convection.  Banding features are not very well 
defined at this time.  Although the low-level center is perhaps a 
little better defined than it was earlier today, there has been 
little change to the overall convective organization.  The current 
intensity is held at 30 kt for this advisory, which is the average 
of subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB.

The cyclone will remain over warm waters and within a marginally 
moist atmosphere for the next several days.  This should allow at 
least gradual strengthening during the next couple of days.  The 
main factor for the longer-term future intensity of the system is 
likely to be a large upper-level trough that extends from the 
northeastern Caribbean Sea northeastward into the Atlantic for 
several hundred miles.  This feature is predicted by the global 
models to persist through the 72 hour time frame.  Since the 
tropical cyclone is expected to interact with this trough in 2-3 
days, the associated increase in vertical shear will likely cause 
some weakening.  By the end of the forecast period, when the system 
nears subtropical latitudes, the shear may decrease.  However, it is 
not yet clear that the cyclone will be able to make a comeback by 
that time.

The depression continues on a west-northwesterly track with an 
estimated motion of 285/12 kt.  There is not much change to the 
track forecast reasoning.  For the next several days, the system 
should continue on a generally west-northwestward, to nearly 
northwestward, path along the periphery of a subtropical high 
pressure area.  The official track forecast is very close to the 
dynamical model consensus and is slightly to the west of the 
previous NHC track.
