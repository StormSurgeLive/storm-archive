DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bret was
located near latitude 12.9 North, longitude 68.1 West. Bret is
moving toward the west near 18 mph (30 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue through the weekend.  On the forecast
track, the center of Bret will continue to move across the eastern
and central Caribbean Sea north of the ABC Islands tonight and
Saturday.

Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Weakening is forecast, and Bret is expected to 
dissipate over the central Caribbean Sea on Saturday night.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
to the north of the center.

The minimum central pressure estimated from the Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft data is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Rainfall associated with Bret is expected to continue to
diminish across the Lesser Antilles tonight.

SURF:  Swells are likely to increase in areas adjacent to the 
central Caribbean Sea through Saturday.  These swells are likely to 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
