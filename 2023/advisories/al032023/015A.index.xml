--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning in in effect for...
* Dominica
* St. Lucia
* Martinique
* Barbados
* St. Vincent and the Grenadines
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within 24
hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in the Lesser Antilles and the southeastern
Caribbean Sea should monitor the progress of Bret.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bret was
located over the eastern Caribbean Sea near latitude 13.4 North, 
longitude 61.9 West.  Bret is moving toward the west near 17 mph 
(28 km/h), and this general motion is expected during the next 
couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of Bret is 
expected to move westward across the eastern and central Caribbean 
Sea today and Saturday.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that maximum sustained winds remain near 60 mph (95 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Gradual weakening is anticipated over the next 
couple of days, and the system is likely to dissipate over the 
central Caribbean Sea Saturday night or Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.  Grantly Adams International Airport on Barbados 
recently reported a sustained wind of 44 mph (70 km/h) and a gust 
to 56 mph (91 km/h) in thunderstorm activity well to the east of 
Bret's center.  Tropical storm conditions are also still being 
reported on St. Lucia and Martinique.
 
The minimum central pressure measured from the reconnaissance 
aircraft is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Bret can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3, WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and
on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical
storm warning areas through this morning.
 
RAINFALL:  Storm total rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches with
maximum amounts of 10 inches are possible across portions of the
Lesser Antilles from Guadeloupe south through St. Vincent and the
Grenadines, including Barbados. The heavy rainfall could lead to
flash flooding, especially across areas of higher terrain. Urban
flooding is also possible.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Bret are expected to affect portions of
the Lesser Antilles through today.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Bret Forecast Discussion Number 15</title>

Tropical Storm Bret Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032023
1100 PM AST Thu Jun 22 2023
 
The center of Bret is currently near St. Vincent in the Windward 
Islands.  Satellite imagery and radar data from Barbados indicate 
that the cyclone is losing organization due to increasing vertical 
wind shear, with only minimal convection currently near the center.  
The remainder of the convection is in bands and clusters well 
removed from the center in the eastern semicircle.  Data from an Air 
Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft shows that the maximum 
surface winds are now near 50 kt, and that will be the initial 
intensity.

The initial motion is now 270/16 kt.  Bret is on the south side of 
a low- to mid-level subtropical ridge, and this feature should 
steer the cyclone or its remnants almost due west for the next 
several days.  The forecast track calls for Bret to move away from 
the Lesser Antilles during the next several hours and then move 
across the eastern and central Caribbean Sea Friday and Saturday.  
There are no significant changes to either the track forecast 
guidance or the forecast track since the previous advisory. 

Bret is moving into an area of moderate to strong southwesterly 
shear associated with an amplifying upper-level trough over the 
eastern Caribbean Sea.  This, combined with some dry air 
entrainment, should cause steady weakening starting on Friday 
morning and continuing for the next several days.  The NHC 
intensity forecast continues to trend downward and now calls for 
Bret to degenerate to a trough or tropical wave Saturday night or 
Sunday in agreement with the global model guidance.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Bret is moving across the Lesser Antilles at this time as a 
strong tropical storm. Conditions in the area should improve later 
tonight as the storm moves away.
 
2. A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Barbados, St. Vincent 
and the Grenadines, St. Lucia, Martinique, and Dominica. There is a 
risk of flooding from heavy rainfall, strong winds, and dangerous 
waves along the coast within the warning area.

Tropical Storm Cindy Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042023
1100 PM AST Thu Jun 22 2023
 
The satellite presentation of the tropical cyclone has improved this 
evening. Deep convection has become more persistent during the past 
several hours over the western portion of the circulation. GOES 
proxy-visible satellite imagery and recent scatterometer data 
indicate the center has moved farther underneath the expanding cold 
dense overcast tonight. An ASCAT-B pass at 00 UTC showed an area of 
30 to 35-kt winds in the northern semicircle of the cyclone, which 
supports upgrading the depression to Tropical Storm Cindy with this 
advisory.

Despite some drier mid-level air in the surrounding environment, 
modest strengthening is forecast in the near term as the cyclone 
moves over 27-28C waters with generally weak vertical wind shear 
during the next couple of days. By Sunday, Cindy is forecast to move 
under the influence of an upper-level trough extending from the 
central Atlantic to the northeastern Caribbean Sea. The increasing 
deep-layer shear associated with this feature is likely to cause the 
small cyclone to weaken early next week, and the official NHC 
forecast shows Cindy degenerating to a 30-kt remnant low by day 5.

Cindy is moving west-northwestward at 285/12 kt. The cyclone is 
expected to continue on a west-northwestward heading during the next 
several days as it is steered by a subtropical ridge to its 
northeast. This track keeps Cindy well to the northeast of the 
northern Leeward Islands. The guidance is in fairly good agreement, 
and the latest NHC track forecast remains close to the multi-model 
consensus aids and is very similar to the previous forecast.
