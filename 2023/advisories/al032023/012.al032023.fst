DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bret was
located near latitude 13.7 North, longitude 56.6 West.  Bret is
moving toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this general 
motion with an increase in forward speed is expected during the next 
few days.  On the forecast track, the center of Bret is expected to
approach the Lesser Antilles today, move across the Lesser Antilles
this evening and tonight, and then move westward across the eastern
and central Caribbean Sea Friday and Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast today while Bret 
approaches the Lesser Antilles.  Weakening is anticipated to begin 
tonight or Friday after Bret passes the Lesser Antilles, and the 
system is likely to dissipate over the central Caribbean Sea by 
Saturday night.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center, especially to the north.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).

watch areas later today and tonight.

RAINFALL:  Storm total rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches with
maximum amounts of 10 inches are possible across portions of the
Lesser Antilles from Guadeloupe south to St. Vincent and the
Grenadines, including Barbados.  The heavy rainfall could lead to
flash flooding, especially across areas of higher terrain.  Urban
flooding is also possible.

SURF:  Swells generated by Bret are expected to begin affecting
portions of the Lesser Antilles today.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
