DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bret was
located near latitude 13.8 North, longitude 57.7 West.  Bret is
moving toward the west near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this general
motion with an increase in forward speed is expected during the next
few days.  On the forecast track, the center of Bret is expected to
move across the Lesser Antilles this evening and tonight, and then 
move westward across the eastern and central Caribbean Sea Friday 
and Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast today while Bret
approaches the Lesser Antilles.  Weakening is anticipated to begin
tonight or Friday after Bret passes the Lesser Antilles, and the
system is likely to dissipate over the central Caribbean Sea by
Saturday night or early Sunday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
