Tropical Storm Bret Advisory Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032023
1100 PM AST Fri Jun 23 2023
 
...BRET ABOUT TO PASS NORTH OF ARUBA, BONAIRE, AND CURACAO...
...EXPECTED TO DISSIPATE ON SATURDAY NIGHT...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...12.9N 68.1W
ABOUT 75 MI...120 KM NE OF CURACAO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 270 DEGREES AT 18 MPH...30 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1005 MB...29.68 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the ABC Islands should monitor the progress of Bret.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bret was
located near latitude 12.9 North, longitude 68.1 West. Bret is
moving toward the west near 18 mph (30 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue through the weekend.  On the forecast
track, the center of Bret will continue to move across the eastern
and central Caribbean Sea north of the ABC Islands tonight and
Saturday.
 
Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Weakening is forecast, and Bret is expected to 
dissipate over the central Caribbean Sea on Saturday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
to the north of the center.
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from the Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft data is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Rainfall associated with Bret is expected to continue to
diminish across the Lesser Antilles tonight.
 
SURF:  Swells are likely to increase in areas adjacent to the 
central Caribbean Sea through Saturday.  These swells are likely to 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Bret Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032023
1100 PM AST Fri Jun 23 2023
 
Bret is currently comprised of an exposed swirl of low- to
mid-level clouds with occasional puffs of convection to the
northeast and east of the center.  More widespread cloudiness and
convection associated with the storm are occuring well to the east
of the center over the southeastern Caribbean Sea.  This poorly-
organized structure is due to the effects of 25 kt of westerly
vertical wind shear.  Just-received reports from an Air Force 
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft show a central pressure near 1005 
mb, along with SFMR and flight-level winds supporting an initial 
intensity of 45 kt.
 
Continued moderate to strong shear should cause Bret to weaken, and
the global models forecast the system to degenerate into a trough
or tropical wave between 24-36 h.  The intensity forecast follows
this guidance and shows the system dissipating after 24 h.
 
The initial motion is 270/16 on the south side of a low- to
mid-level ridge, and this general motion should continue until the
system dissipates.  The new NHC forecast track is similar to, but a
little south of, the previous track.  After dissipation, the
remnants of Bret should move quickly westward and reach Central
America sometime on Monday.

Tropical Storm Cindy Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042023
1100 PM AST Fri Jun 23 2023
 
After a lull in convective activity earlier today, deep convection 
associated with Cindy has increased tonight. A cold dense overcast 
with cloud top temperatures colder than -70C has expanded over the 
center of the cyclone, and a curved band of convection has developed 
over the northern portion of the circulation. Unfortunately, no 
recent microwave or scatterometer data are available to assess the 
structure and intensity of Cindy. The initial intensity of 45 kt is 
supported by objective UW-CIMSS ADT and SATCON estimates, and a T3.0 
subjective Dvorak estimate from SAB.

Cindy has a brief window to strengthen during the next 12 h or so. 
Then, deep-layer shear is forecast to increase over the storm by 
Sunday in association with an upper-level trough over the central 
Atlantic. This, along with potential bouts of dry air entrainment, 
should cause Cindy to weaken through early next week despite warm 
SSTs along its track. The latest NHC forecast shows Cindy reaching 
its peak intensity in 12-24 h, followed by gradual weakening 
thereafter. While most the global models agree that Cindy will open 
into a trough by the middle of next week, the 18 UTC GFS and HAFS 
runs show the cyclone remaining intact and deepening near and beyond 
the end of the forecast period. While this does not seem like the 
most likely outcome, it cannot be completely ruled out at this time. 
For now, the official NHC forecast continues to follow most of the 
non-GFS guidance and shows dissipation by day 5, but note that 
future forecast changes may be necessary.

The tropical storm is moving west-northwestward at 295/13 kt. A 
general west-northwestward to northwestward motion is expected over 
the next few days as Cindy is steered by a subtropical ridge to its 
northeast. The track model spread increases early next week, with 
the stronger GFS showing a sharper recurvature and a track on the 
far right of the guidance envelope. The NHC track forecast is 
slightly to the right of the previous one, but still falls to the 
left of the multi-model consensus aids given the weaker NHC 
intensity forecast. Cindy is expected to remain well to the east and 
northeast of the northern Leeward Islands.
