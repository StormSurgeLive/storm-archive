DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bret was
located near latitude 12.5 North, longitude 50.2 West. Bret is
moving toward the west near 17 mph (28 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue for the next several days.  On the
forecast track, the center of Bret is expected move across portions
of the Lesser Antilles Thursday afternoon and Thursday night, and
then move across the eastern Caribbean Sea on Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is forecast during 
the next day or so, and Bret is expected to be a tropical storm 
when it reaches the Lesser Antilles Thursday and Thursday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Bret can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3, WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and

Tropical Storm Bret Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032023
1100 PM AST Tue Jun 20 2023

Bret has become a little better organized this evening, with 
increased convection near and north of the center and some outer 
bands developing in the eastern semicircle.  This development has 
lead to satellite intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB increasing 
to 45 kt, and that will be the initial intensity for this advisory. 
Unfortunately, the ASCAT overpasses this evening again managed to 
miss Bret.

Satellite imagery continues to suggest some vertical wind shear is 
undercutting Bret's otherwise favorable looking outflow pattern and 
slowing the rate of intensification.  This shear is expected to 
continue for the next 36 h or so, and the storm is forecast to 
continue to slowly strengthen during this time. The new intensity 
forecast calls for Bret to have a 55-kt intensity when it passes 
near or over the Lesser Antilles around the 48-h point.   After 
that, stronger shear associated with an upper-level trough over the 
eastern Caribbean should stop intensification and cause Bret to 
weaken.  Indeed, the global models continue to forecast the system 
to degenerate to a tropical wave by 96 h.  The new intensity 
forecast will continue to have a 96 h point followed by dissipation 
before 120 h.  However, it will show a faster weakening from 72-96 h 
than the previous forecast.
 
The initial motion is westward or 280/15 kt.  There is again little 
change to either the track forecast guidance or the track forecast 
since the last advisory, with low- to mid-level ridging north of 
Bret expected to steer the cyclone westward through dissipation. 
Users are reminded that NHC's track forecasts have average errors 
of about 60 n mi at 48 hours, and it is too soon to know exactly 
where Bret's center will move across the Lesser Antilles chain.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Bret is forecast to approach the Lesser Antilles through
Thursday morning and then move across the islands Thursday
afternoon and Thursday night as a tropical storm, bringing a risk of
flooding from heavy rainfall, strong winds, and dangerous waves
along the coast.
 
2. Given the uncertainty in the track and intensity forecasts, it
is too early to specify the location and magnitude of where Bret's
associated hazards could occur.  A Tropical Storm Watch has been
issued for Barbados, Dominica, Martinique, and St. Lucia, and 
additional watches and warnings are likely for these and other 
islands in the Lesser Antilles on Wednesday.
