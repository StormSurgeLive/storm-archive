...BRET BARELY A TROPICAL CYCLONE...
...AREAS OF RAIN AND GUSTY WINDS AFFECTING PORTIONS OF THE ABC
ISLANDS AND NORTHEASTERN COLOMBIA...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM EDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...13.1N 71.9W
ABOUT 55 MI...90 KM NNW OF NTHRN TIP OF GUAJIRA PNSULA COLOMBIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 270 DEGREES AT 21 MPH...33 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1007 MB...29.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the ABC Islands and along the coast of the Guajira
Peninsula of Colombia should monitor the progress of Bret.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bret was
located near latitude 13.1 North, longitude 71.9 West. Bret is
moving toward the west near 21 mph (33 km/h) and this general
motion is expected to continue through tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Additional weakening is forecast, and Bret is expected to 
dissipate over the central Caribbean Sea by tonight.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on data from the Air 
Force Hurricane Hunters is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Bret will affect coastal areas adjacent
to the central Caribbean Sea today.  These swells could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Bret Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032023
1100 AM EDT Sat Jun 24 2023
 
The Air Force Hurricane Hunters have been investigating Bret again 
this morning and found that the circulation is barely closed with 
very light winds on the system's south side.  However, winds 
up to 40 kt are still occurring north of the center and are 
strongest in the deep convection just north of the ABC Islands.  
Therefore, Bret is being maintained as a 40-kt tropical storm for 
now.  However, continued northwesterly vertical wind shear of about 
30 kt should cause the storm to weaken and the circulation to open 
up soon, possibly even later today.  

Bret continues to move swiftly to the west at about 18 kt.  This 
motion should continue until the storm dissipates.  The main impact 
from the system is expected to be gusty winds and areas of heavy 
rain across portions of the ABC Islands and the northeastern 
portion of Colombia during the next several hours.

<title>Tropical Storm Cindy Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Tropical Storm Cindy Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042023
500 AM AST Sat Jun 24 2023
 
Deep bursts of convection over Cindy's center, with cloud top 
temperature less than -90C, have been forming since the last 
advisory.  A microwave pass at 0526 UTC showed a curved band 
wrapping around the southern semicircle of the estimated low-level 
center and a relatively aligned vortex.  However, weak-to-moderate 
northwesterly shear may still be affecting the storm and could 
explain the most recent warming trends in the cloud top 
temperatures.  A blend of the subjective satellite estimates from 
TAFB and SAB support a slight increase in the initial intensity to 
50 kt.
 
The window for Cindy to strengthen further is coming to end. 
Vertical wind shear is expected to increase within a day as the 
storm nears an upper-level trough over the central Atlantic and 
forces surrounding drier mid-level air into the circulation. These 
unfavorable environmental conditions are expected to weaken the 
storm after a day or so.  The GFS (and the regional models dependent 
on its boundary conditions) still forecasts Cindy to maintain a 
coherent low-level vortex and re-strengthen beyond the forecast 
period.  This scenario does not seem as likely given the small size 
of the cyclone, and the NHC forecast favors the weaker intensity 
guidance that shows dissipation by day 5.  However, changes may be 
necessary to future forecasts.

The tropical storm is moving west-northwestward at 13 kt.  A general 
west-northwestward to northwestward motion is expected over the next 
few days as Cindy moves along the periphery of a subtropical ridge 
to its northeast. The spread in track model guidance increases early 
next week, with the stronger GFS showing a sharper recurvature and a 
track to the right of the other models. The NHC track forecast is 
slightly to the right of the previous one, but still falls to the 
left of the multi-model consensus aids given the weaker NHC 
intensity forecast. On the current forecast track, Cindy is expected 
to remain well to the east and northeast of the northern Leeward 
Islands.
