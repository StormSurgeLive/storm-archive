...RAIN AND GUSTY WINDS LINGER IN PORTIONS OF THE LESSER ANTILLES...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...13.3N 64.7W
ABOUT 235 MI...380 KM W OF ST. VINCENT
ABOUT 300 MI...480 KM ENE OF CURACAO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 270 DEGREES AT 21 MPH...33 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1002 MB...29.59 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Barbados has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warning for St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests adjacent to the southeastern Caribbean Sea should monitor
the progress of Bret.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bret was
located near latitude 13.3 North, longitude 64.7 West. Bret is
moving toward the west near 21 mph (33 km/h) and this general
motion is expected to continue through the weekend.  On the forecast
track, the center of Bret will continue moving westward away from
the Windward Islands and across the eastern and central Caribbean
Sea during the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts. Weakening is forecast during the next couple of days, and
Bret is expected to dissipate over the central Caribbean Sea
by Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on data from the Air 
Force Hurricane Hunters is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Bret can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3, WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and
on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Gusty winds should continue to subside across the Windward 
Islands over the next few hours.
 
RAINFALL:  Rainfall associated with Bret is expected to diminish
across the Lesser Antilles later today as the storm continues to
move westward across the Caribbean.  Additional rainfall amounts of
1 to 2 inches are possible across portions of the Lesser Antilles
from Guadeloupe south through St Vincent and the Grenadines,
including Barbados. The heavy rainfall could lead to flash
flooding, especially across areas of higher terrain. Urban flooding
is also possible.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Bret are expected to gradually subside
along the Lesser Antilles through the day.  Swells are likely
to increase in areas adjacent to the central Caribbean Sea
later today and on Saturday.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Tropical Storm Bret Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032023
1100 AM AST Fri Jun 23 2023
 
Bret is maintaining its intensity for now.  Deep convection has 
increased over the center during the past few hours and there 
remains a larger area of disorganized thunderstorms on the system's 
east side.  The Air Force Hurricane Hunters have been investigating 
the storm this morning and on their last pass they found maximum 
flight-level winds of 60 kt and peak SFMR winds around 45 kt.  These 
data support holding the intensity steady at 50 kt.  Bret is pulling 
away from the Lesser Antilles, but showers and thunderstorms along 
with gusty winds will likely continue across portions of that island 
chain for much of the day.
 
Bret is moving beneath an upper-level trough axis currently, but by
tonight it should be located on the west side of the trough, which
should result in a notable increase in northerly vertical wind shear
and intrusions of dry air.  Therefore, steady weakening is expected
and the NHC intensity forecast follows the theme of the model
guidance.  Bret will likely open into a trough on Sunday.
 
The tropical storm continues to move quickly westward at 17 kt on
the south side of a low- to mid-level ridge.  This motion should
continue during the next couple of days taking Bret across the
eastern and central Caribbean Sea.  The NHC track forecast is a
touch to the south of the previous one, primarily due to the initial
position, and remains on the fast side of the model guidance.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Bret is moving westward over the southeastern Caribbean Sea, but
trailing rainbands with embedded gusty winds continue to affect
portions of the Windward Islands.  These conditions should gradually
subside through the day.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Cindy was

moving toward the west-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h) and this
general motion is expected to continue over the next few days. On
the forecast track, the system is expected to remain well east and
northeast of the northern Leeward Islands through early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Some additional strengthening is forecast over 
the next day or so followed by gradual weakening afterwards.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).

Tropical Storm Cindy Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042023
500 AM AST Fri Jun 23 2023
 
Cindy is continuing to show signs of improvement based on satellite
imagery.  Deep convection with cold cloud tops of less than -80
degrees C are near the estimated low-level center, an indication the
vertical wind shear is likely weakening.  The initial intensity has
been increased to 40 kt based on a blend of the 3.0 and 2.5
subjective Dvorak satellite intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB,
respectively.
 
The reasoning behind the intensity forecast is unchanged.  SHIPS 
model guidance indicates that Cindy will remain embedded within an 
area of weak vertical wind shear for the next day or so, shielding 
it from the surrounding drier mid-level airmass.  Given the 
relatively conducive environmental and oceanic conditions,  gradual 
strengthening is expected.  Beyond 48 h, the deep-layer shear is 
forecast to increased which, in combination with the dry air, will 
likely weaken Cindy early next week.  The official intensity 
forecast is very similar to the previous prediction.

Cindy is moving west-northwestward at 13 kt.  This motion is 
expected to continue during the next several days as Cindy moves 
around the southwest periphery of a subtropical ridge.  The track 
guidance for the cyclone has shifted northward in the 3-5 day range, 
and the NHC track forecast has been nudged northward as a result.  
This track still keeps Cindy well to the northeast of the northern 
Leeward Islands.
