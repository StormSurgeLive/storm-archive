forecast office. For storm information specific to your area
outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by
your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located 
near latitude 36.0 North, longitude 66.9 West. Lee is moving toward 
the north-northeast near 18 mph (30 km/h) and a northward motion at 
a faster forward speed is expected through Saturday.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Lee will continue to move farther away 
from Bermuda and approach the coast of New England and Atlantic 
Canada through Saturday.  Lee is then expected to turn toward the 
north-northeast and northeast and move across Atlantic Canada 
Saturday night and Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Lee is expected to be a large and dangerous storm 
when it reaches eastern New England and Atlantic Canada.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 320
miles (520 km).
 
The minimum central pressure is 962 mb (28.41 inches) based on data 
from the NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircrafts.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue on Bermuda during
the next few hours.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch areas in
Atlantic Canada on Saturday.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected to begin in southern New England late this afternoon and
spread northward across the rest of New England within the Tropical 
Storm Warning area through Saturday.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected to spread across the Tropical Storm Warning area in
Atlantic Canada tonight and Saturday.  These conditions are likely
to lead to downed trees and potential power outages.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the
east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Tonight through Saturday night, Lee is expected to
produce rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches, 50 to 100 millimeters,
in eastern Maine, western Nova Scotia, and portions of New
Brunswick. This could produce localized urban and small stream
flooding.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Flushing, NY to U.S./Canada border...1-3 ft
Long Island Sound...1-3 ft
Cape Cod...1-3 ft
Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket...1-3 ft
Boston Harbor...1-3 ft
Rockaway Inlet, NY to Montauk Point, NY...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
A dangerous storm surge will produce coastal flooding within the
wind warning areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of onshore winds.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  41
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
1100 AM AST Fri Sep 15 2023
 
Lee remains a very large hurricane over the western Atlantic.  The 
strongest winds extend out to roughly 70 miles from the center, 
hurricane-force winds around 100 miles and tropical-storm-force 
winds more than 300 miles.  Data from both the NOAA and Air Force 
Hurricane Hunters indicate that the core winds have decreased 
slightly, and a blend of the latest flight-level and SFMR winds 
support an intensity of 70 kt. Satellite images indicate that the 
hurricane is asymmetric with most of the convection on the north 
side.
 
The hurricane has been wobbling around, but it has generally been
moving north-northeastward at 16 kt during the past 12-18 hours on
the western side of a subtropical ridge.  A northward to
north-northeastward motion at about the same forward speed is
expected until Lee makes landfall in Atlantic Canada in 24 to 36
hours.  After landfall, Lee is forecast to accelerate to the
northeast when it moves in the flow on the east side of an
approaching trough.  The models are tightly clustered, and no
significant changes were made to the previous NHC track forecast.
 
Southerly vertical wind shear and dry air are eroding deep
convection on the hurricane's south side.  These environmental
conditions are expected to persist while Lee moves over sharply
cooler waters during the next day or so.  Therefore, steady
weakening is forecast and Lee will likely become extratropical
around the time it makes landfall.  The NHC intensity forecast is a
little lower than the previous one, and fairly close to the GFS
model prediction.  Lee is expected to remain a large and dangerous
system over the next couple of days.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Hurricane conditions are possible across portions southern New 
Brunswick, and much of Nova Scotia on Saturday within the Hurricane 
Watch area.  Tropical storm conditions and coastal flooding are 
expected to begin in southern New England within the Tropical Storm 
Warning area this afternoon, and spread northward along the coast of 
New England and over portions of Atlantic Canada through Saturday.  
These conditions are likely to lead to downed trees and potential 
power outages.
 
2. Heavy rainfall from Lee could produce localized urban and small
stream flooding in eastern Maine into portions of New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia from tonight into Saturday night.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions and high surf will continue to impact
Bermuda during the next few hours.

Tropical Storm Margot Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
300 PM GMT Fri Sep 15 2023
 
Margot continues to produce small bursts of convection near the 
estimated low-level center location.  Microwave imagery from 0923 
UTC showed some fragmented curved bands in the northeastern quadrant 
of the storm.  Around 1200 UTC, satellite-derived surface winds 
measured the eastern portion of the circulation and revealed peak 
winds of 44 kt and a significant expansion of tropical-storm-force 
winds to the north.  Based on these data, and subjective and 
objective satellite estimates, the intensity is lowered to a 
possibly generous 55 kt.

The tropical storm is drifting southeastward (135/4 kt) around a 
building mid-level ridge over the northern Atlantic.  Margot is 
expected to move in a clockwise loop around the ridge during the 
next couple of days or so.  The latest NHC forecast shows a slightly 
broader loop that lies between the previous forecast and the various 
multi-model consensus aids.  By Monday, Margot should turn northward 
and then eastward as it moves around the periphery of the ridge.  
The model guidance at days 4 and 5 has a large spread in the 
along-track position (the forward speed) of Margot and therefore, 
the track forecast has greater-than-average uncertainty.  The 
official prediction lies between the previous forecast and the 
simple consensus aids at those times.

Margot is expected to continue to gradually weaken during the next 
couple of days as the vertical wind shear increases and the cyclone 
moves into an increasingly dry and stable airmass.  Simulated 
satellite imagery from global models shows periodic bursts of 
convection through day 4, and the storm is expected to become 
extratropical by the end of the forecast period.  While the official 
forecast shows Margot's intensity holding steady between 48-96 h, 
some minor fluctuations are possible during this time.

Tropical Depression Fifteen Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
1100 AM AST Fri Sep 15 2023

1-min GOES-East visible imagery indicates improved organization of 
Invest 97, with a well-defined surface center forming since 
sunrise, along with large curved banding features.  Thus the system 
is designated as a tropical depression, and the initial intensity 
is set to 30 kt, in closest agreement with the TAFB Dvorak 
classification.  

Our estimate of initial motion is northwestward at 10 kt, though 
this is uncertain due to the recent center formation.  A
subtropical ridge over the central Atlantic should be the dominant 
steering mechanism during the next several days, sending the system 
on a steady northwestward track.  For a first forecast, guidance is 
in remarkably good agreement, and the official forecast lies near 
or west of the model consensus.  Despite the good model agreement, 
there is still some long-range uncertainty in how far west this 
system moves, which partially depends on the strength of the 
subtropical ridge in the wake of Tropical Storm Margot. 

The depression is forecast to gradually intensify over the next 
couple of days as moderate northeasterly shear and the initial broad
cyclone structure could provide a check on the intensification 
rate.  By early next week, this system is forecast to move over 
near record warm sea-surface temperatures for the region in light 
shear conditions. It probably sounds like a broken record at this 
point in the season, but rapid intensification is a significant 
possibility, and the official forecast could be conservative below. 
The intensity forecast is near or above the intensity consensus, 
only leveling off at 120 hours due to gradual SST cooling and the 
possibility of eyewall replacement cycles, as suggested by the HAFS 
model suite.
