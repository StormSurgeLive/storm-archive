Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Tue Sep 19 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Nigel, located over the central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa by <br/>
Wednesday.  Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive <br/>
for gradual development of the wave thereafter, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form late this week or this weekend while <br/>
the system moves generally westward across the eastern and central <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Atlantic:<br/>
A non-tropical area of low pressure is forecast to form east of the <br/>
Florida peninsula late this week.  This system could acquire some <br/>
subtropical characteristics this weekend while it moves generally <br/>
northward.  Regardless of subtropical development, this low could <br/>
bring gusty winds, heavy rain, and high surf conditions to portions <br/>
of the coastal Carolinas into the coastal Mid-Atlantic states this <br/>
weekend.  Please see products from your local National Weather <br/>
Service office for more details.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...975 MB...28.80 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Nigel was located
near latitude 30.5 North, longitude 54.3 West.  Nigel is moving
toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  The hurricane is
forecast to turn northward late today, and then accelerate rapidly
northeastward through the rest of the week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 90 mph (150 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Nigel could strengthen some more through early
Wednesday, but weakening is likely on Thursday and Friday.  Nigel
is forecast to become a strong post-tropical cyclone on Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 975 mb (28.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Nigel are expected to reach Bermuda
later today.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.

<title>Hurricane Nigel Forecast Discussion Number 17</title>

Hurricane Nigel Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
1100 AM AST Tue Sep 19 2023
 
Nigel continues to exhibit a large eye about 50 n mi across on
satellite images this morning.  The surrounding deep convection has
intensified somewhat over the southern and western portions of the
circulation, and the overall cloud pattern is fairly symmetrical.
The current intensity estimate is increased to 80 kt in agreement
with the latest objective estimates from UW-CIMSS.  A NOAA
Hurricane Hunter aircraft will investigate the hurricane shortly
and should provide a more accurate estimate of Nigel's intensity.
 
There is still about one more day for the hurricane to intensify
while it remains over SSTs near 28 deg C with weak vertical wind
shear.  Therefore, the official forecast shows some short-term
strengthening and this is generally above the model guidance.  In
48 to 72 hours, the dynamical model guidance shows a large increase
in shear which, along with cooler waters, should result in
weakening.  By 72 hours, the global model forecast indicates that
Nigel will become a frontal low over the northern Atlantic and this
is shown in the official forecast.
 
As noted earlier, the track forecast for Nigel appears to be
straightforward.  The system is currently moving northwestward
along the western periphery of a mid-level anticyclone.  In 12
to 24 hours, Nigel should turn northward while it moves around
the high.  Afterwards, the system is likely to accelerate
northeastward to the southeast and south of a strong mid-level
trough.  In 3-5 days, Nigel is expected to rotate around the eastern
side of a large extratropical low over the North Atlantic. The NHC
track forecast is close to the model consensus.
