Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Wed Sep 20 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Nigel, located over the central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is currently located a couple of hundred miles <br/>
south-southeast of the Cabo Verde Islands.  This system is expected <br/>
to merge with another disturbance located a few hundred miles to its <br/>
west in a few days.  Environmental conditions are forecast to <br/>
be conducive for gradual development, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form late this week or this weekend while the system moves <br/>
generally westward at 10 to 15 mph across the eastern and central <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Atlantic:<br/>
A non-tropical low pressure system is expected to form within a <br/>
large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms to the east <br/>
of the Florida peninsula within the next day or two.  This system <br/>
could acquire some subtropical characteristics on Friday while it <br/>
moves generally northward.  Regardless of development, this low is <br/>
likely to bring gusty winds to gale force, heavy rain, and high surf <br/>
to portions of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic United States late <br/>
this week and into this weekend.  Additional information on this <br/>
system can be found in High Seas Forecasts and products from your <br/>
local National Weather Service office.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Nigel was located
near latitude 39.0 North, longitude 50.4 West. Nigel is moving
toward the northeast near 25 mph (41 km/h) and is expected to
accelerate northeastward over the next day or two.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Weakening is forecast during the next couple of days, and
Nigel is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone by Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the

Hurricane Nigel Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 20 2023
 
Geostationary satellite imagery shows Nigel's outflow being
impinged upon by an upstream trough.  Still, the hurricane has
maintained its large, ragged eye surrounded by deep convection
with cloud top temperatures ranging from -60 to -70 degrees C.
Subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB were both T4.5/77 kt,
and the initial intensity is held at 80 kt for this advisory.
 
The hurricane has begun to accelerate northeastward at an estimated
045/22 kt.  Nigel's forward speed is expected to increase through
Friday in the flow ahead of the mid-latitude trough exiting the
northeast US coast.  By the weekend, global models show Nigel
interacting with a large extratropical system over the North
Atlantic.  Little changes have been made to the latest NHC forecast,
which is largely an update of the previous prediction.
 
Nigel is nearing the 26 degree isotherm and should cross over it
in a few hours.  Deep-layer vertical wind shear is also expected to
increase significantly over the next 24 hours.  Nigel should begin
to transition into an extratropical cyclone soon, and this process
is expected to be complete in about 48 hours.  The official
intensity prediction shows gradual weakening through day 2, and
Nigel is forecast to become a powerful extratropical cyclone on
Friday.  By the end of the forecast period, Nigel should be absorbed
by the larger mid-latitude cyclone mentioned previously.
