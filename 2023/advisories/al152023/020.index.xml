Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Wed Sep 20 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Nigel, located over the central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is currently located just off the west coast of <br/>
Africa. Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive for <br/>
gradual development, and a tropical depression is likely to form <br/>
late this week or this weekend while the system moves generally <br/>
westward at 10 to 15 mph across the eastern and central tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Atlantic:<br/>
A non-tropical area of low pressure is expected to form east of the <br/>
Florida peninsula late this week.  This system could acquire some <br/>
subtropical characteristics by this weekend while it moves generally <br/>
northward.  Regardless of development, this low is likely to bring <br/>
gusty winds, heavy rain, and high surf to portions of the Southeast <br/>
and Mid-Atlantic United States late this week and into this weekend. <br/>
Please see products from your local National Weather Service office <br/>
for more details.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Nigel was located
near latitude 34.4 North, longitude 54.9 West. Nigel is moving
toward the north near 16 mph (26 km/h). A turn toward the northeast
with an increase in forward speed is expected later today.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Nigel has likely reached its peak intensity, with gradual 
weakening expected later today, followed by faster rate of weakening 
on Friday. Nigel is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone by 
Friday.

<title>Hurricane Nigel Forecast Discussion Number 19</title>

Hurricane Nigel Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
1100 PM AST Tue Sep 19 2023
 
Nigel appears to be succumbing to the effects of southerly wind 
shear this evening.  Deep convection in the eastern portion of the 
circulation has eroded, and the eyewall has opened to the northeast. 
Still, subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates range 
between 102 to 77 kt.  The initial intensity is held at a possibly 
generous 85 kt, to represent a blend of these estimates. 

Global model guidance suggests oceanic and environmental conditions 
could be marginally conducive for strengthening for only a short 
while longer.  In a day or so, Nigel is expected to move over 
waters cooler than 26 degrees Celsius, and the deep-layer vertical 
wind shear is forecast to significantly increase.  As a result, the 
latest NHC intensity forecast shows a slightly lower peak intensity 
of 90 kt in the short-term forecast, followed by steady weakening 
through the remainder of the forecast period.  Nigel should become 
a powerful extratropical cyclone in about 60 h.

The hurricane is moving toward the north at 13 kt on the western 
edge of a mid-level ridge over the central subtropical Atlantic.  By 
Wednesday, Nigel is expected to turn northeastward and accelerate 
in the flow of a deep-layer trough located over the northeastern 
United States and Atlantic Canada.  In the first few days, there is 
little spread in the track guidance envelope, and only minor 
adjustments have been made to the latest official forecast.  As 
Nigel moves poleward, the extratropical low is forecast to interact 
with a broader cyclonic circulation over the north Atlantic on days 
4 and 5, which introduces increased track uncertainty late in the 
period.
