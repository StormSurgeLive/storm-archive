<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Nigel, located over the central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa by <br/>
Wednesday.  Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive <br/>
for gradual development of the wave thereafter, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form late this week or this weekend while <br/>
the system moves westward across the eastern and central tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Atlantic:<br/>
A non-tropical area of low pressure is forecast to form near the <br/>
southeastern coast of the United States late this week.  This system <br/>
could acquire some subtropical characteristics this weekend if it <br/>
remains offshore while it moves slowly northward or northwestward.  <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

<title>Hurricane Nigel Forecast Discussion Number 13</title>

Hurricane Nigel Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
1100 AM AST Mon Sep 18 2023
 
Nigel is exhibiting a somewhat ragged-looking eye on satellite 
imagery, surrounded by bands of very deep convection with cloud 
tops to -80 deg C.  High-level outflow has become a bit restricted 
over the northeastern quadrant of the circulation, but overall the 
system continues to become better organized.  The current intensity 
estimate of 70 kt is a blend of subjective and objective 
satellite-derived estimates.

During the next day or so, the hurricane should remain in an 
environment that is quite conducive for strengthening.  Vertical 
shear is forecast to remain very low and SSTs are near 28 deg C.  
The SHIPS Rapid Intensification (RI) Index continues to show above 
normal probabilities of RI.  Accordingly, the official forecast 
calls for a 30-kt increase in intensity during the ensuing 24 
hours. In a couple of days, increasing shear and cooler waters are 
likely to result in the beginning of a gradual weakening trend.  In 
4-5 days, global forecast models depict Nigel becoming involved with 
a frontal zone over the North Atlantic.  Therefore, the official 
forecast shows the system as extratropical in 5 days, although this 
transition could occur a little sooner than that.

Nigel's motion continues toward the northwest, or at about 325/10
kt.  The hurricane is currently situated on the southwestern edge
of a mid-level high pressure area.  Over the next day or two, the
system should move around the western periphery of the high.
On this track, Nigel will turn northward in about 36 hours.
Thereafter,  the cyclone should accelerate in the flow to the
southeast and south of a strong mid-latitude trough, and head into
the higher latitudes of the Atlantic.  The track guidance is
fairly tightly clustered, and the new official forecast is
very similar to the previous one.  This is also in close agreement
with the dynamical model consensus aids, HCCA and TVCA.
