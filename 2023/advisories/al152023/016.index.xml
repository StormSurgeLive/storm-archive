Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Tue Sep 19 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Nigel, located over the central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa by <br/>
Wednesday.  Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive <br/>
for gradual development of the wave thereafter, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form late this week or this weekend while <br/>
the system moves westward across the eastern and central tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Atlantic:<br/>
A non-tropical area of low pressure is forecast to form east of <br/>
the Florida peninsula late this week.  This system could acquire <br/>
some subtropical characteristics this weekend while it moves <br/>
generally northward.  Regardless of subtropical development, this <br/>
low could bring gusty winds, heavy rain, and high surf conditions to <br/>
portions of the coastal Carolinas into the coastal Mid-Atlantic <br/>
states this weekend.  Please see products from your local National <br/>
Weather Service office for more details.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

rapidly northeastward through the rest of the week.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts. Nigel is forecast to strengthen some through early 
Wednesday, with weakening likely on Thursday and Friday. Nigel is 
forecast to become a strong post-tropical cyclone on Friday.

<title>Hurricane Nigel Forecast Discussion Number 15</title>

Hurricane Nigel Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
1100 PM AST Mon Sep 18 2023
 
Nigel has become a little better organized this evening, with a 
ragged eye becoming more apparent in infrared satellite imagery. An 
earlier SSMIS microwave overpass revealed a fairly well-defined 
low-level inner-core structure, but the eye was open to the 
northwest. Subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB 
were a consensus T4.5 (77 kt), and the various objective estimates 
were in the 70-80 kt range at 0000 UTC.  Based on a blend of these 
intensity estimates, the initial wind speed is set at 75 kt for 
this advisory. 

Although Nigel's strengthening appears to have been disrupted by 
dry air entrainment today, the hurricane has about another 24-36
hours within low shear conditions and over warm SSTs in which 
to strengthen. The NHC intensity forecast calls for additional 
strengthening during that time, but the peak intensity has been 
lowered slightly.  After 36-48 hours, increasing southwesterly 
vertical wind shear and cooler SSTS along the track of Nigel are 
expected to cause gradual weakening.  The NHC wind speed forecast 
is in best agreement with the HFIP corrected-consensus aid, which 
is at the higher end of the guidance in the short term.  The global 
models indicate that extratropical transition is likely to begin by 
72 hours, and that process should be complete by day 4.  

Nigel continues to move northwestward (310 degrees) at about 10 kt. 
The hurricane should continue on that general heading and speed 
through midday Tuesday, but as it nears the western extent of the 
ridge, Nigel is predicted to turn northwestward and northward 
shortly thereafter.  By 48 hours, an approaching mid- to upper-level 
trough is forecast to cause Nigel to accelerate northeastward over 
the central and northeastern Atlantic through the remainder of the 
forecast period.  The track guidance remains tightly clustered, with 
the primary differences being how much Nigel accelerates 
northeastward later in the period.  The NHC track forecast is a 
blend of the typically reliable GFS and ECMWF models, nd is close 
to the various consensus aids.
