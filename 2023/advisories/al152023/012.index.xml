<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Nigel, located over the central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is forecast to move off the west coast of Africa by <br/>
Wednesday.  Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive <br/>
for gradual development of the wave thereafter, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form late this week or this weekend while <br/>
the system moves westward across the eastern and central tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>

<br/>
Western Atlantic:<br/>
A non-tropical area of low pressure is forecast to form near the <br/>
southeastern coast of the United States late this week.  This system <br/>
could acquire some subtropical characteristics this weekend if it <br/>
remains offshore while it moves slowly northward or northwestward.  <br/>

<title>Hurricane Nigel Forecast Discussion Number 12</title>

Hurricane Nigel Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
500 AM AST Mon Sep 18 2023
 
Infrared satellite imagery indicates that Nigel is getting better 
organized in a hurry.  Deep convective towers have been quickly 
rotating around a developing eyewall, and an AMSR2 microwave pass 
indicated that a low-level eye feature had developed.  Intensity 
estimates at 06 UTC ranged from 60-70 kt, and given the increasing 
organization on satellite and microwave data, the initial wind speed 
is raised to 70 kt.

It seems like the long-awaited rapid intensification phase of Nigel 
is underway.  Very deep convective cloud tops are in the central 
dense overcast, with warm waters and light shear for at least a day 
or two along the path of the hurricane.  These conditions should 
promote significant strengthening, and it makes sense to forecast a 
period of rapid intensification, only moderated by somewhat cooler 
waters after 36 hours, along with possible eyewall replacement 
cycles.  It is interesting to note that most of the regional 
hurricane guidance has come down this cycle, with the hurricane 
models showing a very deep, but larger system with lower maximum 
winds.  The new forecast is closer to the previous NHC interpolated 
forecast, the statistical aids, and the COAMPS-TC ensemble.  Nigel 
should undergo a quick extratropical transition between days 4 and 
5, consistent with all of the global model predictions.

Nigel is moving northwestward with an estimated motion of 325/10 kt. 
This general northwestward to north-northwestward heading should 
continue for the next couple of days as a mid-level ridge builds to 
the northeast of the system. In a couple of days, Nigel will reach 
the western edge of the ridge and turn more northward. By the end of 
the forecast period, a strong trough will pick up the system, and 
Nigel should accelerate quite rapidly towards the northeast. There 
are no significant changes to report with the latest NHC track 
forecast, as at last the rightward shift of the guidance seems to 
have ended.
