Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Thu Sep 21 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Nigel, located over the central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is currently located near the Cabo Verde Islands.  <br/>
This system is expected to merge with another disturbance located a <br/>
few hundred miles to its west in a few days.  Environmental <br/>
conditions are forecast to be conducive for gradual development, and <br/>
a tropical depression is likely to form late this week or this <br/>
weekend while the system moves generally westward at 10 to 15 mph <br/>
across the eastern and central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Atlantic:<br/>
A non-tropical low pressure system is expected to form within a <br/>
large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms to the east <br/>
of the Florida peninsula within the next day or so.  This system <br/>
could acquire some subtropical characteristics on Friday while it <br/>
moves generally northward.  Regardless of development, this low is <br/>
likely to bring gusty winds to gale force, heavy rain, and high surf <br/>
to portions of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic United States late <br/>
this week and into this weekend.  Additional information on this <br/>
system can be found in High Seas Forecasts and products from your <br/>
local National Weather Service office.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>

High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Nigel was located

Hurricane Nigel Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
500 AM AST Thu Sep 21 2023
 
Nigel is starting to feel the effects of increased vertical wind
shear this morning. Proxy-vis and infrared satellite imagery show
that the large, ragged eye from the past few days has become
obscured. An AMSR microwave pass at 0513 UTC confirmed that the
eyewall structure has collapsed, and a thick curved band on the
northern side is all that remains.  Vertical wind shear has the deep
convection displaced to the northern side of the system, within the
main banding feature, with cold cloud tops in the northwest
semicircle near -70 Celsius. Subjective satellite current intensity
(CI) values were 4.5 from both TAFB and SAB. Given the degradation
in the satellite appearance and these estimates, the initial
intensity is set to 75 kt for this advisory.
 
Nigel is moving swiftly to the northeast at an estimated motion of
50/ 26 kt. The system is currently moving within the flow ahead of a
mid-latitude trough off the northeast US Coast and Atlantic
Canada, with this quick northeast motion expected to continue
during the next day or two. Late Friday and into the weekend,
models show Nigel interacting with a larger polar low over the
North Atlantic. The NHC track forecast is very similar to the
previous advisory and remains near the consensus aids.
 
The hurricane is moving into a more hostile environment with
vertical deep layer shear forecast to further increase, and sea
surface temperatures along the forecast track continue to cool over
the northern Atlantic. Nigel is also entering a drier mid-level air
mass with relative humidities below 40 percent. Nigel should begin
to transition into an extratropical cyclone very soon, and this
process is expected to be complete in about 24 hours. The ECMWF and
GFS SHIPS guidance show extratropical transition occuring even
sooner than what is forecast. The official intensity forecast shows
gradual weakening, with Nigel becoming a powerful extratropical
cyclone on Friday.  By the end of the forecast period, Nigel will
become absorbed in the aforementioned larger polar low.
