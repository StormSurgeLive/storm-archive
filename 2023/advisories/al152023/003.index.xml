DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 39.5 North, longitude 65.8 West. Lee has been moving 
toward the north-northeast near 20 mph (31 km/h) over the past few 
hours. A north to north-northwest motion is forecast to resume 
later tonight, and this motion at a faster forward speed is expected
through Saturday. On the forecast track, the center of Lee will
continue to approach the coast of New England and Atlantic Canada
through Saturday. Lee is then expected to turn toward the
north-northeast and northeast and move across Atlantic Canada
Saturday night and Sunday.
 
Lee is a very large and dangerous storm. Maximum sustained winds,
based on Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft data, are near 80 mph
(130 km/h) with higher gusts. Some gradual weakening is forecast,
with Lee expected to become extra-tropical on Saturday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 345
miles (555 km). NOAA Buoy 44011 located about 205 miles (180 km)
north of the center has recently reported a peak one-minute
sustained wind of 47 mph (76 km/hr) and a gust of 67 mph (107
km/hr).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 965 mb (28.50 inches)
based on data from the Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch areas
in Atlantic Canada on Saturday.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected to begin in southern New England very soon and then spread 
northward across the rest of New England within the Tropical Storm 
Warning area through Saturday.  Tropical storm conditions are 
expected to spread across the Tropical Storm Warning area in 
Atlantic Canada tonight and Saturday.  These conditions are likely 
to lead to downed trees and potential power outages.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting the U.S. Virgin
Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the
Bahamas, Bermuda, the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic
Canada.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Late tonight into Saturday night, Lee is expected to
produce rainfall amounts of 2 to 5 inches, or 50 to 125 millimeters
over portions of eastern Maine, western Nova Scotia, and New
Brunswick. This may produce localized urban and small stream
flooding.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
East of Montauk Point, NY to U.S./Canada border...1-3 ft
Cape Cod...1-3 ft
Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket...1-3 ft
Boston Harbor...1-3 ft
Rockaway Inlet, NY to Montauk Point, NY...1-2 ft
Long Island Sound...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
A dangerous storm surge will produce coastal flooding within the
wind warning areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of onshore winds.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  42
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
500 PM AST Fri Sep 15 2023
 
Lee remains a very large hurricane over the western Atlantic. ASCAT 
data from this morning showed the wind field expanding, with the 
hurricane-force winds around 100 miles and tropical-storm-force 
winds more than 300 miles outward from the center. New data from 
the Air Force Hurricane Hunters indicate that the core winds remain 
steady with an intensity of 70 kt. Lee continues to be an 
asymmetric hurricane with most of the convection on the north side 
of the system.
 
The hurricane continues to wobble around, but it is generally moving
northward at 17 kt during the last 12-18 hours on the western side
of a subtropical ridge. Lee will continue to move northward around
the same speed until it makes landfall in Atlantic Canada in
approximately 24 to 30 hours. Once Lee makes landfall, it is still
expected to accelerate to the northeast as it moves in the flow on
the east side of an approaching trough. The models remain in quite
good agreement, and the NHC track forecast was only slightly
shifted to the left to follow the new guidance through landfall.
Otherwise, no significant changes were made.
 
Southerly vertical wind shear and dry air continue eroding deep 
convection on Lee's south side. These environmental conditions will 
persist while Lee moves over sharply cooler waters when it crosses 
the north wall of the Gulf Stream during the next day or so. 
Therefore, gradual weakening is forecast and Lee will likely become 
a strong extratropical cyclone around the time it makes landfall. 
The NHC intensity forecast is slightly lower than the previous one 
and continues to be fairly close to the GFS model. However, Lee is 
expected to remain a very large and dangerous system over the next 
couple of days.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Hurricane conditions are possible across portions southern New
Brunswick, and much of Nova Scotia on Saturday within the Hurricane
Watch area.  Tropical storm conditions and coastal flooding are
expected to begin in southern New England within the Tropical Storm
Warning area this evening, and spread northward along the coast of
New England and over portions of Atlantic Canada through Saturday.
These conditions are likely to lead to downed trees and potential
power outages.
 
2. Heavy rainfall from Lee could produce localized urban and small
stream flooding in portions of eastern Maine, New Brunswick and
western Nova Scotia Saturday.

Tropical Storm Margot Discussion Number  35
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
300 AM GMT Sat Sep 16 2023
 
Margot's satellite presentation has changed little since the 
previous advisory. A timely ASCAT-B overpass revealed peak winds of 
around 50 kt, and a rather expansive wind field over the northern 
semicircle of the storm.  Since there is typically some 
undersampling from the ASCAT instrument, the initial intensity 
remains 55 kt for this advisory.  This intensity is also in line 
with the latest TAFB Dvorak intensity estimate of T3.5 or 55 kt. 

Margot is moving south-southwestward at about 4 kt. The tropical 
storm should turn southwestward to westward during the next day or 
so as it completes a clockwise loop to the south of a mid-level 
ridge.  By early next week, the ridge should continue to slide 
eastward allowing Margot to turn northward, and then east- 
northeastward later in the period.  The track guidance has again 
trended toward a more southern and slower solution near the end of 
the period, and the official forecast has been adjusted 
accordingly. 

Northerly vertical wind shear, marginal sea surface temperatures, 
and dry air entrainment are expected to cause gradual weakening 
during the next couple of days.  Margot may struggle to produce 
organized deep convection in a couple of days, but an approaching 
mid-latitude trough may aid in at least a continuation of convective 
bursts keeping Margot a tropical cyclone.  By day 4, Margot is 
forecast to be post-tropical as simulated satellite imagery from the 
global models suggest the system will become devoid of convection 
after that time.

Tropical Depression Fifteen Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
1100 PM AST Fri Sep 15 2023
 
Deep convection has increased over the northern portion of the 
depression's broad circulation this evening, however it is still 
not particularly well organized. A recent ASCAT passed indicated 
that the circulation is still broad and that the center may be 
trying to reform farther north closer to the convection.  The 
scatterometer data revealed peak winds of 25-30 kt, and the initial 
wind speed is maintained at 30 kt for this advisory. 
 
The initial motion is a still somewhat uncertain 320/12 kt. A 
deep-layer ridge over the central Atlantic should steer the 
depression northwestward through early next week. By late 
Tuesday, a mid-latitude trough moving westward over the western 
Atlantic is expected to cause the cyclone to turn north- 
northwestward and northward near the end of the forecast period. 
The track guidance is in relatively good agreement on this 
scenario, and the latest NHC track forecast lies near the middle of 
the guidance envelope. 
 
Given the current structure of the system, only gradual 
strengthening is likely overnight. Once an inner core become 
established a faster rate of strengthening seems likely as the 
system traverses warm waters and remains in a low vertical wind 
shear conditions.  Steady to potentially rapid strengthening is 
predicted later this weekend, and the system is forecast to become 
a hurricane by late Sunday or Monday. The NHC intensity forecast is 
near the higher-end of the guidance, close to the HCCA model 
through 72 hours, and is then near the higher dynamical guidance at 
96 h. By late in the period, increasing southwesterly vertical wind 
shear is likely to cause some gradual weakening.
