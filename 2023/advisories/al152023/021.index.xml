Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Wed Sep 20 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Nigel, located over the central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is currently located just off the west coast of <br/>
Africa. Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive for <br/>
gradual development, and a tropical depression is likely to form <br/>
late this week or this weekend while the system moves generally <br/>
westward at 10 to 15 mph across the eastern and central tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Atlantic:<br/>
A non-tropical area of low pressure is expected to form east of the <br/>
Florida peninsula late this week.  This system could acquire some <br/>
subtropical characteristics by this weekend while it moves generally <br/>
northward.  Regardless of development, this low is likely to bring <br/>
gusty winds to gale force, heavy rain, and high surf to portions of <br/>
the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic United States late this week and into <br/>
this weekend.  Additional information on this system can be found <br/>
in High Seas Forecasts and products from your local National <br/>
Weather Service office.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>

High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service<br/>

...NIGEL HEADED NORTH...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...36.1N 54.4W
ABOUT 650 MI...1045 KM ENE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 10 DEGREES AT 18 MPH...30 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...975 MB...28.80 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Nigel was located
near latitude 36.1 North, longitude 54.4 West.  Nigel is moving
toward the north near 18 mph (30 km/h).  A turn toward the northeast
with an increase in forward speed is expected later today, followed 
by a faster northeastward motion over the next day or two.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Weakening is forecast during the next couple of days, 
and Nigel is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone by 
Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles
(260 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 975 mb (28.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Nigel will affect Bermuda during the next
couple of days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Nigel Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
1100 AM AST Wed Sep 20 2023

Nigel is maintaining a ragged-appearing eye on visible and 
infrared satellite imagery.  Bands of deep convection with tops to 
around -70C continue to rotate around the center, and the system's 
cloud pattern remains fairly symmetrical.  Although microwave 
imagery from around 0900 UTC showed a closed eyewall, recent 
geostationary images suggest breaks in the eyewall over the 
eastern portion of the circulation.  Dvorak CI numbers from TAFB and 
SAB are 4.5, corresponding to a 77-kt intensity, and an objective 
ADT estimate from UW-CIMSS was 79 kt.  Based on these values, the 
advisory intensity estimate was reduced only slightly, to 80 kt.  
NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft are scheduled to investigate Nigel 
soon.

The hurricane is moving northward, or perhaps slightly east of 
north, with an initial motion of 010/16 kt.  The system has been 
moving around the western periphery of a mid-level high pressure 
area.  A mid-latitude trough to the northwest of Nigel should cause 
the cyclone to turn toward the northeast and the cyclone 
should continue to move northeastward at a faster forward speed over 
the next couple of days.  In 48 to 72 hours, Nigel is expected to 
rotate counter-clockwise around the eastern side of a large 
extratropical cyclone over the north Atlantic.  Although the 
official forecast shows track points at 4 and 5 days, there is a 
good chance that Nigel will merge with,  or become absorbed by, the 
other cyclone around that time.  The official forecast is very 
similar to the previous NHC track prediction.

Nigel has only about 12 hours remaining before moving over cooler 
waters, and southwesterly vertical shear is forecast to increase 
tonight.  Gradual weakening is expected over the next 2-3 days, in 
general agreement with the consensus intensity forecast guidance.  
The intensity forecast in the latter part of the forecast period is 
uncertain, given the distinct possibility that Nigel could merge 
with the other extratropical cyclone.
