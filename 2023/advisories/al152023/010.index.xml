Post-Tropical Cyclone Lee Advisory Number  49

1100 AM AST Sun Sep 17 2023
 
...ALL TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS FOR CANADA ARE DISCONTINUED...
...THIS IS THE LAST ADVISORY ON LEE...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...48.0N 62.0W
ABOUT 135 MI...215 KM WNW OF PORT AUX BASQUES NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 50 DEGREES AT 22 MPH...35 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...989 MB...29.21 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
Environment Canada has discontinued all Tropical Storm Warnings for
Canada.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warning in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Lee
was located near latitude 48.0 North, longitude 62.0 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the northeast near 22 mph (35
km/h), and a faster northeastward to east-northeastward motion is
expected over the next couple of days, taking Lee over Newfoundland
later today and over the Atlantic waters by early Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Continued gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of
days, and Lee could dissipate on Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 290 miles (465 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 989 mb (29.21 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND: Wind gusts to near gale force are still possible over
portions of Atlantic Canada today.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Lee continue to affect Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the
east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada. These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane 
Center on this system. Additional information on this system can be 
found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, 
under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at

...MARGOT NO LONGER A TROPICAL CYCLONE...
...THIS IS THE LAST NHC ADVISORY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM GMT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...34.6N 42.4W
ABOUT 885 MI...1430 KM W OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Margot
was located near latitude 34.6 North, longitude 42.4 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the west-northwest near 9 mph
(15 km/h). A clockwise turn resulting in a motion toward the east 
is expected over the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Small fluctuations in intensity are expected during the next few 
days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Margot will continue to affect the Azores
for the next several days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane 
Center on this system. Additional information on this system can be 
found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service,

Post-Tropical Cyclone Margot Discussion Number  41
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
300 PM GMT Sun Sep 17 2023
 
Margot has lacked organized deep convection since around 00 UTC and
is no longer a tropical cyclone. Therefore, this is the last NHC
advisory.
 
The latest Dvorak current intensity estimate from TAFB is the basis 
for the 35 kt initial intensity. Regeneration in the short term is 
not expected due to high wind shear and dry surrounding air. With no 
deep convection, the cyclone's winds should gradually decrease over 
the next day or so. The post-tropical cyclone is forecast to turn 
slowly northward today and tonight, and then turn eastward by 
Tuesday in the wake of Post-Tropical Lee, which will be passing well 
to the north. While Margot's maximum winds could fluctuate slightly 
during this time, it could also open into a trough as early as 
Tuesday. After that, the cyclone or its remnants should meander west 
of the Azores for a day or two until it ultimately dissipates 
southeast of Nigel late this week.

Additional information on this system can be found in High Seas
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nigel was

moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h) and this general
motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days.  Nigel
is then forecast to turn northward by late Tuesday and accelerate
northeastward after that.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Rapid strengthening is forecast during the next
48 hours.  Nigel will likely become a hurricane tonight, and is
forecast to approach major hurricane intensity in a couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).

Tropical Storm Nigel Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
500 PM AST Sun Sep 17 2023
 
Nigel's organization continues to increase, with several convective
bands noted over the northern portion of the circulation.
Although microwave imagery shows that an eyewall structure has not
yet formed, it seems likely that an inner core will develop fairly
soon.  The current intensity is set at 55 kt based on a subjective
Dvorak satellite intensity estimate from TAFB although objective
estimates are a little lower.
 
Nigel continues northwestward with an estimated motion of 325/11 kt.
The system should continue on a generally northwestward track over
the next couple of days while a mid-level high builds to its
east-northeast.  By Wednesday, Nigel should turn northward and move
along the western side of the high.  Later in the forecast period,
the system is expected to accelerate northeastward in the flow on
the southeast side of a strong mid-latitude trough.  The NHC
forecast is roughly in the middle of the track guidance envelope and
lies between the simple and corrected dynamical model consensus
solutions.
 
The system's environment appears to be very conducive for
strengthening.  The vertical wind shear is quite weak and there is
well-defined upper-level anticyclonic outflow over the area.  The
various rapid intensification (RI) indices are in agreement on a
significantly higher-than-normal likelihood of RI.  This is also
reflected in the official intensity forecast, which shows Nigel
becoming a major hurricane within the next couple of days.  By the
end of the forecast period, the system will likely become embedded
within a frontal zone and transition into a strong extratropical
cyclone.
