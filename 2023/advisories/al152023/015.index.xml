<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Nigel, located over the central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa by <br/>
Wednesday.  Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive <br/>
for gradual development of the wave thereafter, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form late this week or this weekend while <br/>
the system moves westward across the eastern and central tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Atlantic:<br/>
A non-tropical area of low pressure is forecast to form near the <br/>
southeastern coast of the United States late this week.  This system <br/>
could acquire some subtropical characteristics this weekend if it <br/>
remains offshore while it moves generally northward.  <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

...NIGEL A LITTLE STRONGER...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...28.6N 52.7W
ABOUT 765 MI...1230 KM ESE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...85 MPH...140 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 320 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Nigel was located
near latitude 28.6 North, longitude 52.7 West. Nigel is moving
toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general motion
is expected to continue through Tuesday. Nigel is forecast to turn
northward late Tuesday, and then accelerate northeastward through
the rest of the week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast during the 
next day or so. Gradual weakening is expected to begin by late
Wednesday. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles
(260 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Nigel are expected to reach Bermuda on
Tuesday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.

<title>Hurricane Nigel Forecast Discussion Number 15</title>

Hurricane Nigel Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
1100 PM AST Mon Sep 18 2023
 
Nigel has become a little better organized this evening, with a 
ragged eye becoming more apparent in infrared satellite imagery. An 
earlier SSMIS microwave overpass revealed a fairly well-defined 
low-level inner-core structure, but the eye was open to the 
northwest. Subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB 
were a consensus T4.5 (77 kt), and the various objective estimates 
were in the 70-80 kt range at 0000 UTC.  Based on a blend of these 
intensity estimates, the initial wind speed is set at 75 kt for 
this advisory. 

Although Nigel's strengthening appears to have been disrupted by 
dry air entrainment today, the hurricane has about another 24-36
hours within low shear conditions and over warm SSTs in which 
to strengthen. The NHC intensity forecast calls for additional 
strengthening during that time, but the peak intensity has been 
lowered slightly.  After 36-48 hours, increasing southwesterly 
vertical wind shear and cooler SSTS along the track of Nigel are 
expected to cause gradual weakening.  The NHC wind speed forecast 
is in best agreement with the HFIP corrected-consensus aid, which 
is at the higher end of the guidance in the short term.  The global 
models indicate that extratropical transition is likely to begin by 
72 hours, and that process should be complete by day 4.  

Nigel continues to move northwestward (310 degrees) at about 10 kt. 
The hurricane should continue on that general heading and speed 
through midday Tuesday, but as it nears the western extent of the 
ridge, Nigel is predicted to turn northwestward and northward 
shortly thereafter.  By 48 hours, an approaching mid- to upper-level 
trough is forecast to cause Nigel to accelerate northeastward over 
the central and northeastern Atlantic through the remainder of the 
forecast period.  The track guidance remains tightly clustered, with 
the primary differences being how much Nigel accelerates 
northeastward later in the period.  The NHC track forecast is a 
blend of the typically reliable GFS and ECMWF models, nd is close 
to the various consensus aids.
