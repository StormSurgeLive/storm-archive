Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Tue Sep 19 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Nigel, located over the central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa by <br/>
Wednesday.  Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive <br/>
for gradual development of the wave thereafter, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form late this week or this weekend while <br/>
the system moves generally westward at 10 to 15 mph across the <br/>
eastern and central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Atlantic:<br/>
A non-tropical area of low pressure is expected to form east of the <br/>
Florida peninsula late this week.  This system could acquire some <br/>
subtropical characteristics this weekend while it moves generally <br/>
northward.  Regardless of development, this low is likely to bring <br/>
gusty winds, heavy rain, and high surf to portions of the Southeast <br/>
and Mid-Atlantic United States late this week and into this weekend. <br/>
Please see products from your local National Weather Service office <br/>
for more details.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Nigel Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
500 PM AST Tue Sep 19 2023
 
The satellite structure of Nigel has improved this afternoon. 
Satellite images indicate a solid ring of deep convection surrounds 
the large, 45 to 50-n-mi wide eye of the hurricane. The NOAA 
Hurricane Hunters have conducted research missions into Nigel today 
and provided helpful data to better assess the hurricane's structure 
and intensity. The aircraft recorded peak 700-mb flight-level winds 
of around 100 kt, which reduces to a surface intensity of 90 kt 
using a standard reduction factor. However, peak SFMR winds from 
both planes were around 75 kt, and dropsonde data indicate only 
modest pressure falls to around 974 mb. Based on a blend of these 
data, the initial intensity is set at 85 kt for this advisory. The 
wind radii were adjusted slightly outward based on the aircraft data 
and scatterometer data received just after the previous advisory.

Given its improved structure, additional near-term strengthening is 
forecast as Nigel moves over 28C SSTs in a weak vertical shear 
environment. By late Wednesday, the guidance indicates deep-layer 
shear will increase while the hurricane quickly moves into a drier 
environment over much cooler waters. So, the NHC forecast shows 
steady weakening through late week that closely follows the latest 
multi-model consensus aids. The global model fields indicate that 
Nigel will complete its extratropical transition by 60 h, which is 
reflected in this advisory. 

It appears that Nigel has begun to turn more northward, and its 
initial motion is now north-northwestward (330/12 kt). The steering 
ridge to the northeast of Nigel will continue to slide eastward 
through tonight. As a result, the hurricane is expected to turn 
northward around the western periphery of this ridge. Then, Nigel 
should turn northeastward and accelerate within the flow ahead of a 
deep-layer trough moving across the northeastern United States and 
Atlantic Canada. The track guidance remains well clustered around 
this scenario, and the latest NHC track forecast was only nudged 
slightly west based on the latest TVCA and HCCA aids. As Nigel moves 
deeper into the mid-latitudes, the extratropical low is forecast to 
become captured within a broader cyclonic circulation over the north 
Atlantic on days 4 and 5, which introduces increased track 
uncertainty late in the period.
