Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Wed Sep 20 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Nigel, located over the central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is currently located a couple of hundred miles <br/>
southeast of the Cabo Verde Islands.  This system is expected <br/>
to merge with another disturbance located a few hundred miles to its <br/>
west in a few days.  Environmental conditions are forecast to <br/>
be conducive for gradual development, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form late this week or this weekend while the system moves <br/>
generally westward at 10 to 15 mph across the eastern and central <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Atlantic:<br/>
A non-tropical low pressure system is expected to form within a <br/>
large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms to the east <br/>
of the Florida peninsula within the next day or two.  This system <br/>
could acquire some subtropical characteristics on Friday while it <br/>
moves generally northward.  Regardless of development, this low is <br/>
likely to bring gusty winds to gale force, heavy rain, and high surf <br/>
to portions of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic United States late <br/>
this week and into this weekend.  Additional information on this <br/>
system can be found in High Seas Forecasts and products from your <br/>
local National Weather Service office.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>

...NIGEL MOVING NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...37.4N 53.0W
ABOUT 755 MI...1215 KM ENE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 30 DEGREES AT 18 MPH...30 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Nigel was located
near latitude 37.4 North, longitude 53.0 West.  Nigel is moving
toward the north-northeast near 18 mph (30 km/h).  A turn toward 
the northeast with an increase in forward speed is expected 
tonight, followed by a faster northeastward motion over the next day 
or two.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Weakening is forecast during the next couple of days,
and Nigel is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone by
Friday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles
(260 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 973 mb (28.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Hurricane Nigel Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
500 PM AST Wed Sep 20 2023

Nigel has changed little in organization on satellite images since 
earlier today.  The ragged-looking eye remains quite large, reported 
to be 60 n mi in diameter by the NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft.  
There are still bands of deep convection with cloud tops to near -70 
deg C, primarily over the northwestern and western portions of the 
circulation, and the overall cloud pattern continues to have a 
symmetrical appearance.  The central pressure measured by the 
aircraft has not changed much since earlier today and wind data from 
the plane suggest that the intensity remains near 80 kt.

Center fixes from the Hurricane Hunters and satellite images show 
that the hurricane's motion is beginning to bend to the right and is 
now north-northeastward, or around 030/16 kt.  Nigel should move 
along the northwestern periphery of a subtropical high pressure cell 
tonight.  In 12 to about 60 hours,  the flow on the southeastern 
side of a strong mid-latitude 500 mb trough should carry the system 
northeastward at a fast pace toward, and over, the northern 
Atlantic.  According to the global models, in 72 to 96 hours, Nigel 
should undergo a binary interaction with a large extratropical low 
over the North Atlantic.  By 120 hours or sooner, the system is 
forecast to merge with this low.

Over the next few days, Nigel will be moving over progressively 
cooler ocean waters and into an environment of stronger 
southwesterly vertical wind shear.  Gradual weakening is forecast, 
and the system is expected to become embedded in a baroclinic zone 
on Friday.  Therefore, extratropical transition is indicated in the 
48 hour forecast.   Since Nigel is expected to merge with the 
aforementioned North Atlantic low in about 5 days, dissipation is 
shown at the end of the forecast period.
