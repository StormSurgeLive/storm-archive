Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Tue Sep 19 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Nigel, located over the central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa by <br/>
Wednesday.  Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive <br/>
for gradual development of the wave thereafter, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form late this week or this weekend while <br/>
the system moves generally westward across the eastern and central <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Atlantic:<br/>
A non-tropical area of low pressure is expected to form east of the <br/>
Florida peninsula late this week.  This system could acquire some <br/>
subtropical characteristics this weekend while it moves <br/>
generally northward.  Regardless of subtropical development, this <br/>
low is likely to bring gusty winds, heavy rain, and high surf <br/>
conditions to portions of the coastal Carolinas into the coastal <br/>
Mid-Atlantic states late this week into this weekend.  Please see <br/>
products from your local National Weather Service office for more <br/>
details.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

...NOAA HURRICANE HUNTERS FIND NIGEL HAS STRENGTHENED...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...31.8N 54.7W
ABOUT 590 MI...955 KM E OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...100 MPH...155 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 335 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...974 MB...28.77 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Nigel was located 
near latitude 31.8 North, longitude 54.7 West. Nigel is moving 
toward the north-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). A turn toward the 
north is expected tonight, followed by an acceleration toward the 
northeast through the rest of the week.
 
Data from the NOAA Hurricane Hunters indicate that maximum sustained 
winds have increased to near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some additional strengthening is possible through early Wednesday. 
Weakening is expected on Thursday and Friday. Nigel is forecast to 
become a strong post-tropical cyclone by Friday.  
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data is 
974 mb (28.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Nigel will affect Bermuda during the next
couple of days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Nigel Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
500 PM AST Tue Sep 19 2023
 
The satellite structure of Nigel has improved this afternoon. 
Satellite images indicate a solid ring of deep convection surrounds 
the large, 45 to 50-n-mi wide eye of the hurricane. The NOAA 
Hurricane Hunters have conducted research missions into Nigel today 
and provided helpful data to better assess the hurricane's structure 
and intensity. The aircraft recorded peak 700-mb flight-level winds 
of around 100 kt, which reduces to a surface intensity of 90 kt 
using a standard reduction factor. However, peak SFMR winds from 
both planes were around 75 kt, and dropsonde data indicate only 
modest pressure falls to around 974 mb. Based on a blend of these 
data, the initial intensity is set at 85 kt for this advisory. The 
wind radii were adjusted slightly outward based on the aircraft data 
and scatterometer data received just after the previous advisory.

Given its improved structure, additional near-term strengthening is 
forecast as Nigel moves over 28C SSTs in a weak vertical shear 
environment. By late Wednesday, the guidance indicates deep-layer 
shear will increase while the hurricane quickly moves into a drier 
environment over much cooler waters. So, the NHC forecast shows 
steady weakening through late week that closely follows the latest 
multi-model consensus aids. The global model fields indicate that 
Nigel will complete its extratropical transition by 60 h, which is 
reflected in this advisory. 

It appears that Nigel has begun to turn more northward, and its 
initial motion is now north-northwestward (330/12 kt). The steering 
ridge to the northeast of Nigel will continue to slide eastward 
through tonight. As a result, the hurricane is expected to turn 
northward around the western periphery of this ridge. Then, Nigel 
should turn northeastward and accelerate within the flow ahead of a 
deep-layer trough moving across the northeastern United States and 
Atlantic Canada. The track guidance remains well clustered around 
this scenario, and the latest NHC track forecast was only nudged 
slightly west based on the latest TVCA and HCCA aids. As Nigel moves 
deeper into the mid-latitudes, the extratropical low is forecast to 
become captured within a broader cyclonic circulation over the north 
Atlantic on days 4 and 5, which introduces increased track 
uncertainty late in the period.
