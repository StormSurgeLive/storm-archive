DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Idalia was
located near latitude 33.7 North, longitude 77.0 West. Idalia is
moving toward the east-northeast near 20 mph (31 km/h), and this
general motion is expected to continue this morning.  An eastward to
east-southeastward motion is forecast to begin later today and
continue through Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of
Idalia will move just offshore of the coast of North Carolina today.
Idalia will then move eastward over the western Atlantic into the 
weekend.

Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is expected today, but some gradual
weakening could occur Friday and Saturday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
from the center.  An elevated station in Pamlico Sound (43 feet 
above the water) recently measured a sustained wind of 56 mph (91 
km/h) and a gust to 67 mph (107 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.23 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml

STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Beaufort Inlet, NC to Ocracoke Inlet, NC...2-4 ft
Neuse and Bay Rivers...2-4 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...2-4 ft
Ocracoke Inlet, NC to Duck, NC...1-3 ft
Cape Fear, NC to Beaufort Inlet, NC...1-3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring within the tropical
storm warning area along the coast of northeastern South Carolina,
and will continue to spread across coastal sections of North
Carolina today.

RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce additional rainfall amounts
of 2 to 4 inches with isolated maxima up to 6 inches across coastal
North Carolina through this afternoon. This rainfall will lead to
areas of flash, urban, and moderate river flooding, with
considerable impacts.

SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia along the eastern Gulf coast will
continue to subside today.  Swells will affect the southeastern U.S.
coast during the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

TORNADOES:  A couple tornadoes will be possible through this morning 
across coastal North Carolina.
