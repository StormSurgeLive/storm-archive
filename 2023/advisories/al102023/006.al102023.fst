hours.  Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed
to completion.

A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.

A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Idalia was
located near latitude 19.8 North, longitude 85.3 West. Idalia has
been moving erratically and is nearly stationary.  A motion toward
the north-northeast and north is expected to begin on Monday,
bringing the center of Idalia over the extreme southeastern Gulf of
Mexico by Monday night.  Idalia will then continue on a northward
or north-northeastward path over the eastern Gulf of Mexico on
Tuesday and reach the Gulf coast of Florida on Wednesday.

Buoy observations indicate that maximum sustained winds have
increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.  Additional
strengthening is forecast, and Idalia is expected to become a
hurricane on Monday.  Idalia is likely to be near or at major
hurricane intensity when it reaches the Gulf coast of Florida.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.  NOAA buoy 42056 recently reported a sustained
wind of 52 mph (83 km/h) and a gust to 60 mph (97 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Aucilla River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...7-11 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...6-9 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Aucilla River, FL...4-7 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...4-7 ft
Tampa Bay...4-7 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...3-5 ft
Englewood, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...2-4 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...1-3 ft
Florida Keys...1-2 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.

Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above
normal tide levels along the southern coast of Pinar del Rio, Cuba.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large waves.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area in western Cuba by late Monday.  Winds are expected to
first reach tropical storm strength by Monday morning, making
outside preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to
protect life and property should be rushed to completion.

Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
tropical storm warning area over the Yucatan Peninsula and the Isle
of Youth in Cuba through Monday.

Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area by
late Tuesday or Wednesday, with tropical storm conditions possible
by Tuesday.

Tropical storm conditions are possible in the Dry Tortugas beginning
late Monday and within the tropical storm watch area along the
Florida Gulf coast on Tuesday.

RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts:

Portions of the eastern Yucatan: 1 to 3 inches, with isolated higher
totals of 5 inches.

Western Cuba: 3 to 6 inches, with isolated higher totals of 10
inches.

Portions of the west coast of Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and
southern Georgia: From Tuesday into Wednesday, 3 to 6 inches, with
isolated higher totals of 10 inches.

Heavy rainfall is also expected across portions of the Carolinas by
Wednesday into Thursday.

Heavy rainfall from Tropical Storm Idalia is expected across
portions of the eastern Yucatan and western Cuba and may produce
areas of flash and urban flooding as well as landslides across
western Cuba. Scattered flash and urban flooding is expected across
portions of the west coast of Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and
southern Georgia late Tuesday night through Wednesday. Heavy
rainfall may lead to flash flooding across portions of the Carolinas
Wednesday into Thursday.
