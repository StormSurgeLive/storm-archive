...AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTERS FIND FRANKLIN A LITTLE STRONGER...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...25.1N 69.3W
ABOUT 275 MI...445 KM NNE OF GRAND TURK ISLAND
ABOUT 565 MI...905 KM SSW OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...100 MPH...155 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 330 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...971 MB...28.68 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Franklin was
located near latitude 25.1 North, longitude 69.3 West. Franklin is
moving toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). This 
motion will continue through today, followed by a northward
and north-northeastward motion into the early part of the week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 100 mph (155 
km/h) with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast, 
and Franklin could become a major hurricane later today or tonight.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 971 mb based on data from 
aircraft reconnaissance (28.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Franklin are expected to begin affecting
Bermuda by tonight. These swells are also likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions beginning late
today through the beginning of this week along portions of the east
coast of the United States. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
1100 AM AST Sun Aug 27 2023
 
Air Force Hurricane Hunters have been investigating Franklin this 
morning and found Franklin a little stronger, with the pressure down 
a few millibars to 971mb. Latest visible and infrared satellite 
imagery show an eye developing with a cold core of deep convection 
wrapping around the center. The aircraft reconnaissance reported 
that the eye was closed in the most recent vortex fix. They also 
reported a concentric band forming around the eyewall, which may be 
the stages of an eyewall replacement cycle. Satellite estimates from 
TAFB and SAB, remained steady this advisory. However, given the 
improved satellite depiction in the last few hours and data from 
the hurricane hunters, the initial intensity is raised to 85kt. 
 
Environmental conditions are fairly favorable during the next few 
days, with very warm sea surface temperature and decreasing 
deep-layer wind shear. Steady strengthening is forecast and 
Franklin could become a major hurricane later tonight or tomorrow. 
The intensity forecast remains similar to the previous one and 
lies near the consensus aids, HCCA and IVCN. Weakening is forecast 
in about 3 to 4 days, as Franklin encounters increased shear and 
moves over cooler SSTs. The wind field of Franklin is forecast to 
increase in size as it moves into the mid-latitudes.

Franklin has continued to move northwestward at 7kt this morning. 
The near-term forecast has been nudged slightly west of the 
previous advisory. A broad high-pressure ridge to the east of 
Franklin will steer the system more north-northwestward and 
northward the next couple of days. In the longer range of the 
forecast period, a deep trough is expected to move off the U.S. 
east coast and most of the guidance has Franklin becoming 
captured in the southwesterly flow, with an increase in forward 
motion to the northeast. The main exception is the ECMWF, which is 
the furthest right once again this forecast cycle. The official 
forecast track lies near the model consensus aids, in the middle of 
the guidance suite. The NHC forecast track still has the core of 
Franklin passing west and north of Bermuda, but interest there 
should continue to monitor the latest NHC forecast. By Day 5 or 
just beyond the forecast period, Franklin may begin to interact 
with the upper trough and begin an extratropical transition.

located near latitude 19.9 North, longitude 85.8 West. The
depression is moving toward the east near 2 mph (4 km/h), and
it is likely to meander near the Yucatan Channel through tonight.  
A faster motion toward the north is expected on Monday, bringing the 
system over the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
The depression is expected to become a tropical storm today, and 
strengthen into a hurricane by Tuesday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
  
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for this system can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.

Tropical Depression Ten Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
1000 AM CDT Sun Aug 27 2023
 
So far this morning, the overall cloud pattern of the tropical
cyclone has not become significantly better organized.  The small
center is partially exposed on GOES-16 visible imagery, and
convective banding features are still not very well defined.  The 
current intensity is held at 30 kt for this advisory which is in 
line with the latest Dvorak Satellite estimates.  A NOAA Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft, flying at around 12000 ft, is near the center of 
the system taking Doppler radar wind velocity measurements.  These 
data should provide valuable information on the structure of the 
cyclone for initializing the numerical weather prediction models.
  
The center of the cyclone appears to have been moving in a small
clockwise loop overnight and into this morning, and it will
probably complete this loop today.  The initial motion estimate is
now around 090/2 kt.  Steering currents should remain weak through
today and tonight.  Beginning on Monday, a mid-level ridge starts to
build near southern Florida and eastward.  This evolution should
cause a generally northward motion during the next couple of days.
In 48 to 72 hours, a mid-level trough dropping into the eastern U.S.
will likely induce a turn toward the north-northeast and take the
system across the northeast Gulf of Mexico coast on Wednesday.  The
official forecast track has been nudged to the right of the
previous one, but is not quite as far east as the latest corrected
consensus, HCCA, prediction.  Users are reminded not to focus on
the exact forecast track, since strong winds, heavy rains and
dangerous storm surges extend well away from the center.

The cyclone will be moving over waters of high oceanic heat content 
over the eastern Gulf of Mexico and within a moist mid- to 
low-level air mass for the next few days.  An upper-tropospheric 
trough is predicted to develop over the western Gulf of Mexico in 48 
to 72 hours.  Although this feature could produce some moderate 
southwesterly vertical wind shear over the system,  positive 
vorticity advection and diffluent upper-level flow to the east of 
the trough will likely be conducive for strengthening.  The 
official forecast, like the previous one, calls for the cyclone to 
reach hurricane status over the eastern Gulf of Mexico in 48 to 72 
hours.  This is at the high end of the latest intensity model 
guidance.
  
 
KEY MESSAGES:

1. The depression is forecast to become a hurricane over the eastern 
Gulf of Mexico, and there is an increasing risk of life-threatening 
storm surge, flooding from heavy rainfall, and hurricane-force winds 
along portions of the west coast of Florida and the Florida 
Panhandle beginning as early as  Tuesday.  Although it is too soon 
to specify the exact location and magnitude of these impacts, 
residents in these areas should monitor updates to the forecast, 
have their hurricane plan in place, and follow any advice given by 
local officials.  Storm surge and hurricane watches may be required 
for portions of the Gulf coast of Florida later today.

2. Heavy rainfall is expected across the eastern Yucatan Peninsula 
and western Cuba and may produce areas of flash and urban flooding 
and landslides across western Cuba.  The depression is forecast to 
become a tropical storm later today, and tropical storm conditions 
are expected over portions of the Yucatan Peninsula and extreme 
western Cuba with tropical storm conditions possible on the Isle of 
Youth. 

3. Scattered flooding from heavy rainfall is likely over in 
portions of the southeast U.S. by mid to late week.
