Tropical Storm Gert Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
500 AM AST Sat Sep 02 2023
 
This morning's conventional satellite imagery and a recent AMSR2
microwave overpass indicate some improvement in the cloud pattern
overnight, although Gert's surface center remains near the 
northern edge of the convective canopy where the colder cloud top 
temperatures are evident.  The subjective and objective satellite 
intensity estimates have increased a bit during the past 6 hours, 
and the initial intensity is bumped up to 40 kt for this advisory.
 
Gert's intensity shouldn't change much during the next few days 
while the cyclone continues moving in a harsh northerly wind shear 
environment. Gert is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone 
during the next couple of days as indicated in the global 
models fields and their simulated infrared imagery forecasts.  
Afterwards, Gert is expected to become absorbed by Post-Tropical 
Idalia.  The official intensity forecast follows the IVCN intensity 
consensus aid through the period and indicates dissipation in 60 
hours.
 
Gert should commence a northward track later today while the
southerly peripheral steering flow of larger Idalia captures the
cyclone and a subtropical ridge builds westward over the central
tropical Atlantic.  There is quite a bit of along-track spread of 
the models, however, so the best solution for the NHC forecast 
track is to side with the consensus models, HCCA and TVCA through 
dissipation early this week.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM CVT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Katia was
located near latitude 22.7 North, longitude 29.4 West. Katia is
moving toward the north-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A turn
to the northwest is expected today and this general motion with a
decrease in forward speed is expected through Monday. 

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Weakening is expected to begin by early Sunday, 
and the system could degenerate into a remnant low by Sunday 
evening.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).

Tropical Storm Katia Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122023
800 AM CVT Sat Sep 02 2023
 
The depression has become better organized overnight.  Cloud tops
temperatures have decreased to -76 Celsius over the surface center
and curved banding has improved, mainly over the northern
semi-circle.  UW-CIMSS AiDT and DPRINT objective satellite 
intensity estimates, as well as the Dvorak estimated from TAFB 
support upgrading the system to a tropical storm.
 
Katia is expected to be a short-lived storm as deep-layer 
southerly shear should increase soon while Katia moves into an 
inhibiting, dry and stable surrounding environment.  As a result, a 
weakening trend is forecast through the period and is in agreement 
with the deterministic models and the statistical-dynamic SHIPS 
intensity guidance.
 
Katia is estimated to be moving north-northwestward, or 330/11 kt, 
and is situated midway between a subtropical ridge extending toward 
the west from western Africa, and a large cut-off low centered over 
the central subtropical Atlantic.  A turn toward the northwest is 
expected today followed by a a gradual turn toward the north at a 
slower forward pace around mid-period while Katia degenerates to a 
vertically shallow low-pressure system.

----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...31.6N 64.4W
ABOUT 55 MI...85 KM SSE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ESE OR 105 DEGREES AT 6 MPH...9 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia
was located near latitude 31.6 North, longitude 64.4 West.  Idalia 
is moving toward the east-southeast near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected through today.  A faster northeastward 
motion is forecast to begin on Sunday, and this motion should
continue into Monday.  On the forecast track, Idalia will remain
near Bermuda today, and then begin to move away from the island
tonight and Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast during the next few
days. Idalia could transition to a subtropical storm later today.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles (350 km)
from the center.  A sustained wind of 46 mph (74 km/h) and a gust 
to 56 mph (91 km/h) were reported at St. George's Pier on Bermuda.  
An elevated observing site at the National Museum of Bermuda 
recently reported sustained winds of 64 mph (104 km/h) with a gust 
to 79 mph (128 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda through
early Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 1 to 3
inches, or 25 to 75 millimeters, across Bermuda through the weekend.
The heavy rainfall may cause areas of flash and urban flooding on
the island.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia will affect the southeastern U.S.
coast and Bermuda during the next couple of days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
500 AM AST Sat Sep 02 2023
 
Although there has been an increase in convective activity 
associated with Idalia overnight, the cyclone remains attached to
a frontal boundary, and is therefore still analyzed as an
extratropical low.  The cyclone appears to have deepened slightly 
with the minimum pressure estimated to be around 999 mb, based on 
surface observations from Bermuda.  With the slight deepening, 
the initial wind speed has been increased to 50 kt.   Winds across 
Bermuda have increased overnight with the official observing site 
at the LF Wade International Airport reporting wind gusts as high 
as 43 kt.  Some of the elevated weather stations on the island 
have reported sustained tropical-storm-force winds.  

The global models indicate that little change in strength will 
occur during the next day or so.  The guidance also suggests that 
Idalia may not completely shed its frontal structure despite the 
presence of deep convection to the northeast of its center today. 
As a result, the official forecast now shows Idalia potentially 
becoming a subtropical cyclone for a fairly short period of time 
this weekend, but confidence in that is low.  Regardless of 
Idalia's status, tropical-storm-force winds will continue over 
Bermuda through tonight.  Later in the period, the cyclone should 
gradually weaken while it moves northward over the central 
Atlantic. 

The forward speed of Idalia has slowed considerably overnight, with 
the initial motion estimate of eastward or 090/5 kt.  A slow 
eastward motion is expected today, but a shortwave trough moving 
off the coast of the northeastern United States tonight should 
cause Idalia to begin moving northeastward on Sunday.  By late 
Monday the cyclone is expected to turn northward around the eastern 
side of a developing cut-off low south of Nova Scotia. The track 
guidance is in somewhat better agreement than it was a day ago, and 
the latest NHC track prediction is near the center of the model 
envelope. 

KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions will continue in Bermuda into tonight. 
Heavy rainfall may cause areas of flash and urban flooding on the 
island.
