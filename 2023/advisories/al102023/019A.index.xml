Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Thu Aug 31 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Franklin, located a couple of hundred miles north-northeast of <br/>
Bermuda, on Tropical Storm Idalia, located near the coast of North <br/>
Carolina, and on recently upgraded Tropical Storm Jose, located <br/>
several hundred miles east-southeast of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms are gradually becoming better organized in <br/>
association with an area of low pressure located just west of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands. Environmental conditions appear conducive for <br/>
further development of this system, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form during the next couple of days while the system moves <br/>
west-northwestward to northwestward across the eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic. Interests in the Cabo Verde Islands should monitor the <br/>
progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (Remnants of Gert):<br/>
A weak but well-defined area of low pressure located several hundred <br/>
miles north-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands is producing <br/>
limited shower and thunderstorm activity. This system has a short <br/>
window for further development during the next day or so while it <br/>
drifts northeastward or eastward before upper-level winds become <br/>
increasingly unfavorable by the weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Jose Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112023
500 AM AST Thu Aug 31 2023
 
Convection since the prior advisory has become markedly better 
organized on infrared and shortwave-IR imagery. Instead of the 
bursting pattern exhibited the prior two nights, there is more 
evidence of curved banding, which was noted on the GMI microwave 
pass last evening and a more recent AMSR2 pass at 0458 UTC. 
Subjective estimates form TAFB and SAB were both T2.5/35 kt, and the 
latest SATCON estimate was up to 37 kt. All these data suggest the 
depression has become tropical storm Jose, and 35 kt is the initial 
intensity this advisory.
 
Jose has certainly been in no hurry to move anywhere the last couple 
of days, but may finally be starting a more northward motion, now 
estimated at 350/5 kt. Part of the storm's previous lack of motion 
was related to competing steering influences from mid-level ridging 
both to its north and south, keeping the small cycle parked in 
place. However, The large circulation of Hurricane Franklin 
approaching from the west should break this steering stalemate. Jose 
is forecast to soon accelerate northward as it becomes swept up in 
the larger hurricane's circulation. The track guidance is in good 
agreement with this solution, and the track forecast was largely an 
update of the previous advisory. 

Despite Jose becoming a tropical storm, it does not appear likely 
to intensify very much more. While vertical wind shear is currently 
low, it should rapidly increase as Jose accelerates north and 
Franklin's outflow increases the upper-level flow from the opposite 
direction. Most of the guidance shows Jose getting absorbed by 
Franklin by the weekend, and the latest NHC intensity forecast 
shows this solution occuring in 48 hours.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Meteorological Service of Bermuda has discontinued the Tropical
Storm Warning for Bermuda.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Franklin was
located near latitude 34.9 North, longitude 63.2 West. Franklin is
moving toward the east-northeast near 15 mph (24 km/h) and a 
general east-northeastward to northeastward motion should continue 
over the next several days. On the forecast track, the center of
Franklin should continue moving away from Bermuda. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  43
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 AM AST Thu Aug 31 2023

Franklin continues to slowly succumb to the increasingly 
unfavorable conditions the large hurricane is embedded in. The large 
eye that had been evident over the last day or so is no longer 
observed on infrared satellite imagery, likely due to 25-30 kt of 
northerly shear affecting the convective structure which now favors 
the southern side of the storm. This observation is also consistent 
with the radar reflectivity returns from the Bermuda radar. With 
that said, both the subjective and objective intensity estimates 
this morning still support an intensity in the 85-90 kt range. Thus 
Franklin's intensity will remain 85 kt this advisory, though this 
may be generous. 

Franklin continues to move to the east-northeast this morning at an 
estimated 070/12 kt. As previously discussed, the hurricane is being 
steered by the flow between a subtropical ridge to its southeast and 
a trough now ejecting eastward out of the northeastern U.S. After 
days of large track spread, the guidance this cycle is in better 
agreement this morning, showing a continued east-northeast or 
northeastward motion with gradual acceleration. The latest NHC 
track forecast is not that much changed from the prior one, though 
with a bit more acceleration towards the end of the forecast 
period, trending towards the TVCN and HCCA consensus aids. 

With continued northerly shear expected to persist another 24 hours, 
Franklin should continue to weaken in the short-term. There may be a 
brief period between 24-48 h where the shear temporarily decreases 
as the hurricane becomes positioned in the right entrance region of 
a jet streak as it interacts with a mid-latitude trough. This is why 
the intensity forecast shows the weakening trend briefly pausing in 
36-48 h. However, this baroclinic forcing will also likely hasten 
its transition into an extratropical cyclone, with the latest 
forecast now showing this being completed by 60 h, consistent with 
simulated-IR imagery from the GFS and ECMWF at that time.

Now that Franklin is moving further away from Bermuda, the 
Meteorological Service of Bermuda has discontinued the Tropical 
Storm Warning for the island. 
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Life-threatening surf and rip currents are occurring along the 
east coast of the United States and Bermuda. These conditions are 
expected to continue during the next day or two.

...HEAVY RAINFALL AND LIFE-THREATENING FLASH FLOODING CONTINUES IN
PORTIONS OF EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA...
...WINDS INCREASING OVER THE OUTER BANKS AND PAMLICO SOUND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM EDT...1200 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...33.7N 77.0W
ABOUT 65 MI...105 KM SE OF WILMINGTON NORTH CAROLINA
ABOUT 135 MI...215 KM SW OF CAPE HATTERAS NORTH CAROLINA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 75 DEGREES AT 20 MPH...31 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...990 MB...29.23 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* South Santee River northward to the North Carolina/Virginia border
* Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds
 
A Storm Surge Watch is in effect for...
* Beaufort Inlet to Ocracoke Inlet North Carolina
* Neuse and Pamlico Rivers North Carolina
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline in the indicated locations. For a depiction of areas at
risk, please see the National Weather Service Storm Surge
Watch/Warning Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Idalia.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Idalia was
located near latitude 33.7 North, longitude 77.0 West. Idalia is
moving toward the east-northeast near 20 mph (31 km/h), and this
general motion is expected to continue this morning.  An eastward to
east-southeastward motion is forecast to begin later today and
continue through Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of
Idalia will move just offshore of the coast of North Carolina today.
Idalia will then move eastward over the western Atlantic into the 
weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is expected today, but some gradual
weakening could occur Friday and Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
from the center.  An elevated station in Pamlico Sound (43 feet 
above the water) recently measured a sustained wind of 56 mph (91 
km/h) and a gust to 67 mph (107 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Beaufort Inlet, NC to Ocracoke Inlet, NC...2-4 ft
Neuse and Bay Rivers...2-4 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...2-4 ft
Ocracoke Inlet, NC to Duck, NC...1-3 ft
Cape Fear, NC to Beaufort Inlet, NC...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring within the tropical
storm warning area along the coast of northeastern South Carolina,
and will continue to spread across coastal sections of North
Carolina today.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce additional rainfall amounts
of 2 to 4 inches with isolated maxima up to 6 inches across coastal
North Carolina through this afternoon. This rainfall will lead to
areas of flash, urban, and moderate river flooding, with
considerable impacts.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia along the eastern Gulf coast will
continue to subside today.  Swells will affect the southeastern U.S.
coast during the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES:  A couple tornadoes will be possible through this morning 
across coastal North Carolina.

<title>Tropical Storm Idalia Forecast Discussion Number 19</title>

Tropical Storm Idalia Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
500 AM EDT Thu Aug 31 2023
 
Surface observations from around 0600 UTC showed that the center of
Idalia moved offshore of the coast of northeastern South Carolina.
Strong southwesterly vertical wind shear has displaced the deep
convective bands and heavy rainfall well north and northeast of the
center over eastern North Carolina and the adjacent Atlantic. A
partial ASCAT-B overpass over the southeastern portion of the
circulation revealed winds of 40-45 kt and given that instrument's
typical undersampling, the initial wind speed is maintained at
50 kt for this advisory.
 
Idalia has turned east-northeastward between a mid-level
anticyclone over the Bahamas and a mid-tropospheric trough moving
eastward over the northeastern United States.  The anticyclone is
forecast to retrograde over Florida during the next couple of days,
causing Idalia to turn east-southeastward tonight and Friday.
After that time, steering currents are predicted to weaken and the
cyclone is expected to move very slowly to the southwest of
Bermuda during the weekend.  By early next week, another 
mid-latitude trough moving off the northeast U.S. coast should 
cause Idalia to begin moving northeastward, however there is still 
significant uncertainty in the details of the track forecast 
later in the period.
 
Little change in strength is predicted today, but strong
upper-level winds and drier mid-level air are likely to cause some
gradual weakening by the weekend.  Simulated satellite imagery from
the GFS and ECMWF models suggest that the system could lose
organized deep convection as soon as tonight, and Idalia could
degenerate into a post-tropical cyclone in a day or so.  However,
the ECMWF does show a return of deep convection over the weekend so
the official forecast continues to retain the system as a tropical
storm throughout the foreast period.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Areas of flash, urban, and moderate river flooding, with
considerable impacts, will continue across coastal North Carolina
through today.
 
2. Coastal flooding is expected within the Storm Surge Watch
area in North Carolina today.  Residents in these areas should
follow any advice given by local officials.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected in northeastern South
Carolina and portions of eastern North Carolina today.
