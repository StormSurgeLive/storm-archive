Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Thu Aug 31 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Franklin, located a couple of hundred miles north-northeast of <br/>
Bermuda, on Tropical Storm Idalia, located near the coast of North <br/>
Carolina, and on recently upgraded Tropical Storm Jose, located <br/>
several hundred miles east-southeast of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms are gradually becoming better organized in <br/>
association with an area of low pressure located just west of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands. Environmental conditions appear conducive for <br/>
further development of this system, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form during the next couple of days while the system moves <br/>
west-northwestward to northwestward across the eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic. Interests in the Cabo Verde Islands should monitor the <br/>
progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (Remnants of Gert):<br/>
A weak but well-defined area of low pressure located several hundred <br/>
miles north-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands is producing <br/>
limited shower and thunderstorm activity. This system has a short <br/>
window for further development during the next day or so while it <br/>
drifts northeastward or eastward before upper-level winds become <br/>
increasingly unfavorable by the weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Jose Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112023
1100 AM AST Thu Aug 31 2023
 
Jose is producing bursts of deep convection near and over the 
estimated center position this morning. Overnight microwave data 
suggest the surface center was pulled slightly eastward by an 
increase in convection during the diurnal maximum period. The 
various satellite intensity estimates range from 32-45 kt this 
morning, with the subjective Dvorak classifications from SAB and 
TAFB (45 kt) higher than the objective UW-CIMSS estimates which are 
around 35 kt. A timely ASCAT-B pass over Jose shows believable wind 
vectors up to 32 kt in the eastern semicircle, which supports 
holding the initial intensity at 35 kt for this advisory.
 
The storm is moving northward at about 6 kt. An acceleration toward
the north is expected during the next day or so as the small system
gets caught in the broader cyclonic circulation associated with
Hurricane Franklin. Deep-layer shear is forecast to increase over
Jose as it accelerates northward toward Franklin, but Jose appears
likely to maintain some tropical-storm-force winds in its eastern
semicircle due to its faster northward motion. There have been no
notable changes to the NHC track or intensity forecast, and Jose is
now expected to be absorbed by Franklin in 36 h, in agreement with
the latest global models.

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  44
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
1100 AM AST Thu Aug 31 2023
 
Satellite imagery indicates that Franklin continues to battle 
strong northerly shear associated with the outflow from Idalia. 
Recent microwave data confirm its inner core has eroded, with deep 
convection confined to the southeastern portion of the circulation. 
There is a large spread in the recent intensity estimates, with 
higher objective estimates than the consensus T4.5/5.0 Dvorak 
classifications from SAB and TAFB. Given this uncertainty, the 
initial intensity is held at 85 kt for this advisory. 
 
Some gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of days 
while Franklin contends with the negative impacts of deep-layer 
shear. However, the cyclone is expected to remain at or near 
hurricane strength while increased baroclinic forcing and 
interaction with the upper trough support its extratropical 
transition. The GFS and ECMWF show fronts extending into Franklin's 
circulation by 48 h, likely signaling completion of this process. 
Therefore, the NHC forecast shows Franklin becoming a powerful 
extratropical cyclone in 48 h. Thereafter, further weakening is 
forecast while the cyclone moves deeper into the mid-latitudes, in 
agreement with the latest global guidance.
 
Franklin is moving east-northeastward (70/12 kt) within the flow 
between a deep-layer trough moving off the coast of the northeastern 
U.S. and eastern Canada and a subtropical ridge to the east. The 
latest track guidance remains in very good agreement that Franklin 
will accelerate toward the east-northeast or northeast during the 
next couple of days. The NHC track forecast in the near term is 
essentially an update of the previous one and remains close to the 
TVCN and HCCA aids. Track model solutions diverge beyond day 3 
regarding the track and speed of motion for the extratropical 
cyclone over the northern Atlantic, and in general the latest NHC 
forecast lies between the consensus aids and ensemble means.

1100 AM EDT Thu Aug 31 2023
 
...CENTER OF IDALIA MOVING EASTWARD OFF THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST...
...STRONG WINDS AND STORM SURGE OCCURRING IN EASTERN NORTH
CAROLINA...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM EDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...33.6N 75.8W
ABOUT 85 MI...135 KM SE OF CAPE LOOKOUT NORTH CAROLINA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...E OR 90 DEGREES AT 20 MPH...31 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...992 MB...29.30 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Tropical Storm Warning has been discontinued west of Cape Fear,
North Carolina.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Cape Fear North Carolina to the North Carolina/Virginia border
* Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds
 
A Storm Surge Watch is in effect for...
* Beaufort Inlet to Ocracoke Inlet North Carolina
* Neuse and Pamlico Rivers North Carolina
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline in the indicated locations. For a depiction of areas at
risk, please see the National Weather Service Storm Surge
Watch/Warning Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Idalia.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Idalia was
located near latitude 33.6 North, longitude 75.8 West.  Idalia is
moving toward the east near 20 mph (31 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue today.  A turn toward the
east-southeast and southeast with a reduction in forward speed is
expected on Friday, followed by a turn toward the east and
northeast over the weekend.  On the forecast track, Idalia will
move away from the coast of North Carolina later today and tonight,
and approach Bermuda over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is expected today.  Some slight weakening
is forecast tonight and on Friday.
 
Idalia is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone later today,
but it is expected to make a transition back to a tropical storm
over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
from the center.  A station at Cape Lookout, North Carolina,
recently measured a sustained wind of 51 mph (81 km/h) and a gust
to 61 mph (98 km/h).  A sustained wind of 50 mph (80 km/h) and a 
gust to 64 mph (104 km/h) were reported at Frisco Woods on the 
Outer Banks.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Beaufort Inlet, NC to Ocracoke Inlet, NC...2-4 ft
Neuse and Bay Rivers...2-4 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...2-4 ft
Ocracoke Inlet, NC to Duck, NC...1-3 ft
Cape Fear, NC to Beaufort Inlet, NC...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue within the tropical
storm warning area along the coast of North Carolina through this
evening.
 
RAINFALL:  Rainfall will be diminishing by early afternoon across
eastern North Carolina into southeast Virginia.  Additional rainfall
totals of .50 to 1.5 inches are possible across these areas.   This
rainfall may compound any ongoing flooding concerns.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia along the eastern Gulf coast will
continue to subside today.  Swells will affect the southeastern U.S.
coast during the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 500 PM EDT.

Tropical Storm Idalia Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
1100 AM EDT Thu Aug 31 2023
 
Satellite imagery, surface observations, and Air Force Reserve
Hurricane Hunter data all indicate that Idalia continues to tangle
with a frontal boundary that extends northward offshore the Outer
Banks.  In addition, organized deep convection has mostly dissipated
near the center, and it appears that Idalia is on its way to
becoming extratropical.  The initial intensity remains 50 kt based
on coastal wind reports and the reconnaissance data.
 
Global model fields show winds increasing on the northwestern side
of the frontal boundary during the day as Idalia is pulling away
from the coast of North Carolina, and as a result, the NHC intensity
forecast shows some strengthening in the short term.  Idalia is
expected to become fully extratropical by this evening, which is
now shown in the official forecast.  Winds should begin decreasing
tonight, and simulated satellite imagery from the GFS and ECMWF
models suggests that the circulation will continue to be devoid of
deep convection, and attached to a front, through at least 36
hours.  By 48 hours, the low will reach warmer waters, the
front is likely to weaken, and the ECMWF shows deep convection
redeveloping.  As a result, the official forecast shows Idalia
becoming a tropical storm again on Saturday.  Intensity-wise, the
guidance indicates that the peak winds are likely to fluctuate
between 40-45 kt from days 2 through 5.
 
Idalia is now moving eastward, or 090/17 kt, between a deep-layer
trough over the northeastern U.S. and a subtropical anticyclone
near the Bahamas.  The trough is likely to bypass Idalia in a few
days, which will cause its eastward motion to slow down to about 5
kt on days 2 and 3 as it approaches Bermuda.  On days 4 and 5, a
second trough is expected to turn Idalia to the northeast, but still
at a relatively slow forward speed.  The track guidance is in a bit
more agreement than the past few days, and the NHC forecast lies
between the TVCX and HCCA consensus aids.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Rainfall will be diminishing by early afternoon from coastal
North Carolina into far southeast Virginia.  Moderate river
flooding, with considerable impacts, will continue across coastal
North Carolina through today.
 
2. Coastal flooding is expected within the Storm Surge Watch
area in North Carolina today.  Residents in these areas should
follow any advice given by local officials.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions will continue across eastern North
Carolina within the Tropical Storm Warning area through this
evening.
