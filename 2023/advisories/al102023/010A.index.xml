Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Tue Aug 29 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Franklin, located several hundred miles west-southwest of Bermuda, <br/>
and on Tropical Storm Idalia, located over the extreme southeastern <br/>
Gulf of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located just off the west coast of Africa is <br/>
producing an area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear marginally conducive for gradual <br/>
development of this system, and a tropical depression could form <br/>
later in the week while the system moves west-northwestward to <br/>
northwestward across the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (AL92):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms have recently become more concentrated <br/>
with an area of low pressure located about 1000 miles northeast of <br/>
the northern Leeward Islands. Recent satellite wind data also <br/>
indicates that its circulation has become better defined. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear favorable for additional development <br/>
over the next couple of days before becoming more unfavorable by the <br/>
latter part of this week as the system drifts slowly over the <br/>
central subtropical Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

<title>Hurricane Franklin Forecast Discussion Number 34</title>

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  34
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
1100 PM EDT Mon Aug 28 2023
 
Franklin remains a powerful category 4 hurricane.  Satellite images 
show a clear and circular eye with a solid and symmetric ring of 
deep convection surrounding that feature.  The Air Force Hurricane 
Hunters have investigated Franklin during the past few hours and 
found 700-mb flight-level winds as high as 140 kt and maximum 
surface SFMR winds of 128 kt.  In addition, the minimum pressure 
based on dropsonde data is estimated to be 926 mb.  Based on these 
data, the initial intensity is set at 130 kt, which is close to the 
upper bound of category 4 status.
 
The major hurricane is now moving due northward at 9 kt.  A turn to 
the northeast is expected on Tuesday, with a steady increase in 
forward speed forecast during the next few days as the hurricane 
moves in progressively faster flow between a mid-level ridge 
over the central Atlantic and a mid- to upper-level trough over the 
northeastern U.S. and eastern Canada.  The models are in relatively 
good agreement during the next 72 hours, however, they diverge 
significantly after that.  The GFS shows a continued acceleration 
to the northeast with the trough eventually capturing Franklin. 
Conversely, the ECMWF shows the trough pulling away, leaving 
Franklin behind in weaker steering currents.  The NHC track forecast 
is roughly between those very different solutions, sticking close 
to the various consensus aids.

Franklin should maintain its strength overnight, but a steady 
weakening trend should begin on Tuesday as the hurricane moves over 
progressively cooler waters and into an environment of higher shear. 
Regardless, Franklin is expected to be a significant hurricane 
during the next few days.  Franklin should complete extratropical 
transition in 3 to 4 days when it crosses the northern wall of the 
Gulf Stream Current and moves into an environment of very strong 
shear.  The NHC intensity forecast is a little lower than the 
previous one and close to the HCCA and IVCN models.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning
Wednesday morning, when Franklin is forecast to make its closest
approach to the island.
 
2. Life-threatening surf and rip currents are occurring along the
coast of the southeast United States. These conditions are
expected to spread northward along the remainder of the U.S.
east coast, Atlantic Canada, and Bermuda during the next couple of
days.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Idalia was
located near latitude 22.6 North, longitude 85.0 West. Idalia is
moving toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A northward motion is
expected today, followed by a faster north-northeast motion later 
today and Wednesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Idalia 
is forecast to move over the eastern Gulf of Mexico later today and 
reach the Gulf coast of Florida within the Hurricane Warning area 
on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Rapid strengthening is predicted during the next day or so. 
Idalia could become a hurricane later this morning, and is forecast 
to become a major hurricane by early Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center.  
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 983 mb (29.03 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Aucilla River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...8-12 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...6-9 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Aucilla River, FL...5-8 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...4-7 ft
Tampa Bay...4-7 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...3-5 ft
Englewood, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...3-5 ft
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to South Santee, SC...2-4 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...1-3 ft
Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL to Mouth of St. Mary's River...1-3
ft
Indian Pass to Mexico Beach...1 to 3 ft.
Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances. For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet above
normal tide levels along the southern coast of Pinar del Rio, Cuba.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
WIND:  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are expected within
the warning areas in western Cuba through this morning.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
tropical storm warning area across the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane warning area
in Florida by late today or Wednesday, with tropical storm
conditions beginning today.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Dry Tortugas
beginning early today and within the tropical storm warning area
along the Florida Gulf coast and the Florida east coast later today.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible along the southeast U.S.
coast within the southern portions of the watch area by early
Wednesday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts:
 
Western Cuba: 4 to 7 inches, with isolated higher totals of 10
inches.
 
Portions of the west coast of Florida, the Florida Panhandle,
southeast Georgia and the eastern Carolinas: 4 to 8 inches from
today into Thursday. Isolated higher totals of 12 inches possible,
primarily near landfall in northern Florida.
 
This rainfall may lead to flash and urban flooding, and landslides
across western Cuba.
 
Areas of flash and urban flooding, some of which may be locally
significant, are expected across portions of the west coast of
Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and southern Georgia today into
Wednesday, spreading into portions of the eastern Carolinas
Wednesday into Thursday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia are affecting portions of the
southern coast of Cuba and eastern Yucatan.  These swells will
spread northward along the eastern Gulf Coast during the next day
or two. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes will be possible later day along the
west central Florida coast.  The tornado threat will spread
northward into the Florida Big Bend by tonight.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Idalia Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
1000 PM CDT Mon Aug 28 2023
 
Idalia is producing intense bursts of convection near the center,  
with an overall comma-shaped cloud pattern along with a dry slot 
over the western part of the circulation.  Upper-level outflow is 
restricted over the northwestern quadrant.  Radar images from 
the Meteorological Service of Cuba show a partial eyewall forming.  
Flight-level and dropwindsonde data from NOAA and Air Force aircraft 
indicate that Idalia is very near hurricane strength.  The maximum 
winds are set again to 60 kt for this advisory.

The system has moved a bit slower than earlier today with an 
initial motion estimate of just slightly east of due north at 
around 7 kt.  Idalia should be steered northward along the western 
side of a mid-level ridge and then turn north-northeastward due to 
a trough to its northwest.  This track will take the center across 
the northeastern Gulf coast on Wednesday morning, and over 
northern Florida and southeastern Georgia thereafter.  In 2 to 3 
days, a mid-tropospheric trough moving off the eastern U.S. coast 
will likely cause the tropical cyclone to turn northeastward to 
eastward off the coast of the Carolinas.  The official track 
forecast for this advisory is essentially the same as the previous 
one.  This is near the middle of the track guidance, which are 
fairly tightly clustered, with the GFS on the left side and the 
ECMWF on the right side.

Although Idalia is currently experiencing some moderate 
northwesterly vertical wind shear, the dynamical guidance indicates 
that the shear will lessen while the system is over the eastern 
Gulf of Mexico.  This, along with a conducive thermodynamic 
atmospheric environment and high oceanic heat content, should cause 
Idalia to strengthen rapidly in the 12- to 36-hour time frame.  The 
official intensity forecast, like the previous one, shows the system 
becoming a major hurricane before landfall along the Florida Gulf 
coast.  This is in general agreement with the regional hurricane 
hurricane models, HAFS and HWRF, but above much of the other
intensity guidance.

Idalia is forecast to move into an area that is highly susceptible 
to storm surge, and regardless of the cyclone's specific landfall 
intensity, there is increasing confidence that a significant storm 
surge event will occur.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation
along portions of the Florida Gulf Coast where a Storm Surge Warning
is in effect, including Tampa Bay and the Big Bend region of
Florida. Inundation of 8 to 12 feet above ground level is expected
somewhere between Chassahowitzka and Aucilla River.  Residents in
these areas should follow any advice given by local officials.
 
2. Hurricane conditions are expected within portions of the
Hurricane Warning area along the Florida Gulf Coast, with the
potential for destructive winds where the core of Idalia moves
onshore. Strong winds will also spread inland across portions of
northern Florida near the track of the center of Idalia.
 
3. Heavy rainfall from Tropical Storm Idalia is expected across 
portions of western Cuba and may produce areas of flash and urban 
flooding as well as landslides.  Areas of flash and urban flooding, 
some of which may be locally significant, are expected across 
portions of the west coast of Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and 
southern Georgia Tuesday into Wednesday, spreading into portions of 
the eastern Carolinas Wednesday into Thursday.
