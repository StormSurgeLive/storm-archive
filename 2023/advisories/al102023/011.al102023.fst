DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Idalia was located
by Cuban radar near latitude 23.1 North, longitude 85.0 West. 
Idalia is moving toward the north near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A 
northward motion is expected today, followed by a faster 
north-northeast motion later today and Wednesday.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Idalia is forecast to move over the eastern 
Gulf of Mexico today, reach the Gulf coast of Florida within the 
Hurricane Warning area on Wednesday, and move close to the Carolina 
coastline on Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Rapid intensification is likely through 
landfall, and Idalia is forecast to become an extremely dangerous 
major hurricane before landfall on Wednesday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles
(260 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 981 mb (28.97 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Aucilla River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...8-12 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...6-9 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Aucilla River, FL...5-8 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...4-7 ft
Tampa Bay...4-7 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...3-5 ft
Englewood, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...3-5 ft
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to South Santee, SC...2-4 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...1-3 ft
Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL to Mouth of St. Mary's River...1-3
ft
Indian Pass to Mexico Beach...1 to 3 ft.
Florida Keys...1-2 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances. For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.

Elevated water levels along the southern coast of Pinar del Rio, 
Cuba will gradually subside today.

WIND:  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are expected within
the warning areas in western Cuba through this morning.

Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane warning area
in Florida by late today or Wednesday, with tropical storm
conditions beginning today.

Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Dry Tortugas soon and 
within the tropical storm warning area along the Florida Gulf coast 
and the Florida west coast later today.

Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin on Wednesday in the 
warning area along the east coast of Florida and South Carolina
Tropical storm conditions are possible along the southeast U.S.
coast within the southern portions of the watch area by early
Wednesday.

RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts:

Western Cuba: 4 to 7 inches, with isolated higher totals of 10
inches.

Portions of the west coast of Florida, the Florida Panhandle,
southeast Georgia and the eastern Carolinas: 4 to 8 inches from
today into Thursday. Isolated higher totals of 12 inches possible,
primarily near landfall in northern Florida.

This rainfall may lead to flash and urban flooding, and landslides
across western Cuba.

Areas of flash and urban flooding, some of which may be locally
significant, are expected across portions of the west coast of
Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and southern Georgia today into
Wednesday, spreading into portions of the eastern Carolinas
Wednesday into Thursday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia are affecting portions of the
southern coast of Cuba and eastern Yucatan.  These swells will
spread northward along the eastern United States Gulf Coast during 
the next day or two. These swells are likely to cause life- 
threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office.

TORNADOES: A few tornadoes will be possible later day along the
west central Florida coast.  The tornado threat will spread
northward into the Florida Big Bend by tonight.
