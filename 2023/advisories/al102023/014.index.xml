WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Eleven
was located near latitude 28.2 North, longitude 52.4 West. The
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 2 mph (4 km/h). 
A meandering northward motion is expected for the next day or so. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
While it is possible the depression could briefly become a tropical 
storm, only small fluctuations in intensity are expected. The 
system is forecast to become a remnant low in a couple of days, but 
it could happen sooner.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1014 mb (29.95 inches).

Tropical Depression Eleven Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112023
1100 PM AST Tue Aug 29 2023
 
The depression has lost some organization since this morning. Only a 
few disorganized showers are present to the east of the depression's 
slightly elongated surface wind field. The initial intensity remains 
30 kt, but this is higher than 00Z Dvorak estimates from TAFB or 
SAB. An ASCAT-B pass just missed the center of the depression, but 
did not show any indication of winds higher than about 25 kt in the 
eastern portion of the depression's wind field, so its possible the 
NHC intensity analysis is generous.
 
The depression has moved erratically since it formed, with its 
recent movement estimated near 285/2 kt. Continued meandering is 
likely tonight, but the cyclone should begin to lift slowly 
northward by tomorrow, moving in low-level steering currents between 
Hurricane Franklin and a ridge over the central Atlantic. The latest 
NHC forecast is a little slower than the previous, remaining close 
to the multi-model track consensus.
 
It's still possible that the depression could briefly organize 
enough deep convection to become a tropical storm. However, this 
does not appear to be the most likely scenario anymore and it is 
not supported by any dynamical models. Upper-level outflow from 
Franklin should cause the depression to become a post-tropical 
remnant low within about 2 days, if not sooner, and most models 
forecast it will dissipate within the next 2-3 days.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within 12
hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Franklin was 
located near latitude 32.3 North, longitude 69.0 West. Franklin is 
moving toward the northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this motion 
with a faster forward speed is expected through Wednesday. On 
Thursday, Franklin is expected to turn to the east-northeast and 
continue to increase in forward speed.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Franklin is expected to pass to the northwest of Bermuda 
on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 115 mph (185 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Franklin is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Steady weakening is forecast 
during the next several days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 953 mb (28.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Franklin can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  37
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 PM AST Tue Aug 29 2023
 
Franklin has completed an eyewall replacement cycle this afternoon. 
This was confirmed by an AMSR microwave pass at 1748Z, showing that 
the outer eyewall has now become the dominant feature and the inner 
eyewall has completely collapsed. In the last few hours, infrared 
imagery has depicted cold cloud tops in the deep convection within 
the new eyewall. The subjective and objective satellite estimates 
have decreased slightly throughout the day, but still remain around 
a T5.5 from TAFB and CIMSS ADT. Given these satellite estimates and 
the structure depicted from microwave imagery, the initial intensity 
for this advisory will remain 110 kt.
  
Franklin is moving northeastward at around 10 kt. This northeastward 
motion is expected to continue for the next few days with an 
increase in forward speed as Franklin rounds the edge of the 
subtropical ridge and gets caught in the southwesterly flow ahead of 
a mid-latitude trough moving off the northeast U.S. coast and 
Atlantic Canada. There still remains a good amount of spread in the 
track guidance with both along- and cross-track differences beyond 
48 h. The NHC track is near the previous advisory and lies in the 
middle of the guidance envelope, close to the consensus aids. Even 
though the center of Franklin is forecast to pass to the northwest 
of Bermuda on Wednesday, tropical-storm-force winds associated with 
the hurricane are expected to extend well to the southeast of the 
center.
 
Franklin could fluctuate in intensity now that it has completed the 
eyewall replacement cycle. But, it should gradually weaken in the 
near term, as it begins to move northward over cooler waters, with 
some increase in northwesterly wind shear. Vertical wind shear is 
forecast to increase further in about 36 h, with further weakening 
anticipated. The guidance this cycle has come into better agreement 
with the timing of extratropical transition in about 72 h, and this 
is now reflected in the latest NHC forecast.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
Wednesday morning, when Franklin is forecast to make its closest
approach to the island.
 
2. Life-threatening surf and rip currents are occurring along the
east coast of the United States. These conditions are expected to
continue during the next several days.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Idalia was
located near latitude 27.7 North, longitude 84.5 West. Idalia is
moving toward the north near 18 mph (30 km/h). A northward to
north-northeastward motion is expected through tonight, with
Idalia's center forecast to reach the Big Bend coast of Florida on
Wednesday morning. After landfall, the center of Idalia is forecast
to turn toward the northeast and east-northeast, moving near or
along the coasts of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina late
Wednesday and Thursday.
 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft data indicate that maximum sustained 
winds are near 110 mph (175 km/h) with higher gusts. Additional 
strengthening is forecast, and Idalia is expected to become a 
major hurricane during the next few hours before it reaches the Big 
Bend coast of Florida. Idalia is likely to still be a hurricane 
while moving across southern Georgia, and possibly when it reaches 
the coast of Georgia or southern South Carolina on Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles
(260 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft observations is 958 mb (28.29 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Wakulla/Jefferson County line, FL to Yankeetown, FL...12-16 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Wakulla/Jefferson County line, FL...8-12 ft
Yankeetown to Chassahowitzka, FL...7-11 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...6-9 ft
Carrabelle, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...5-8 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...4-6 ft
Tampa Bay...4-6 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...3-5 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Carrabelle, FL...3-5 ft
Englewood, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to South Santee, SC...2-4 ft
Beaufort Inlet to Drum Inlet, NC...2-4 ft
Pamlico and Neuse Rivers...2-4 ft
South of Bonita Beach to Chokoloskee, FL...1-3 ft
South Santee, SC to Beaufort Inlet, NC...1-3 ft
Drum Inlet to Duck, NC...1-3 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...1-3 ft
Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL to Mouth of St. Mary's River...1-3
ft
Indian Pass to Mexico Beach...1 to 3 ft
Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances. For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area in Florida early Wednesday morning, with tropical
storm conditions beginning within the next few hours.
 
Tropical storm conditions will begin within the tropical storm 
warning area along the Florida Gulf coast and the Florida west coast 
soon.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area
along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina Wednesday and
Wednesday night.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin on Wednesday in the
warning area along the east coast of Florida, Georgia, and South
Carolina, and spread into North Carolina Wednesday night and
Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area in North Carolina by Thursday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce a swath of 4 to 8 inches of 
rainfall with isolated maxima up to 12 inches from the Florida Big 
Bend through central Georgia and South Carolina, and through eastern 
North Carolina into Thursday. These rainfall amounts will lead to 
areas of flash, urban, and moderate river flooding, with locally 
considerable impacts.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia are affecting the southwestern
coast of Florida and will spread northward and westward to the
north-central Gulf coast through Wednesday.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible tonight from the coast of 
west-central Florida northward into the Florida Big Bend region.  
The tornado risk will shift into southeast Georgia and the coastal 
Carolinas on Wednesday.

<title>Hurricane Idalia Forecast Discussion Number 13</title>

Hurricane Idalia Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
500 PM EDT Tue Aug 29 2023
 
The first stages of an eye have been taking shape in visible
satellite imagery.  The hurricane has a relatively small Central
Dense Overcast and a prominent band of deep convection extending
over the eastern semicircle, reaching across the Florida peninsula
southward across western Cuba.  An Air Force Reserve Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft just measured a peak 700-mb flight-level wind of 91 
kt with the pressure falling to 972 mb.  The initial intensity is 
therefore set at 85 kt.
 
Idalia is moving faster toward the north, or 360/14 kt, between a
mid-level trough over the northwestern Gulf of Mexico and a
subtropical ridge over the Greater Antilles.  Idalia is expected to
continue moving northward and turn north-northeastward as it
approaches the Big Bend region of Florida during the next 12-24
hours.  There is very little spread among the track guidance, and
the NHC official forecast has been placed very close to the HCCA
and TVCX consensus aids during the first 24 hours.  This has
resulted in a westward shift of about 20-25 n mi compared to the
previous forecast, although it should be stressed that additional
shifts to the track will be possible until the center reaches land.
 
After landfall, Idalia is expected to turn toward the northeast and
then east, moving near or along the coast of Georgia and the
Carolinas in 36-48 hours.  Uncertainty in the track forecast is
still quite large after 48 hours, with many of the global models
turning Idalia southward, while some of the regional hurricane
models still show the storm moving out to sea.  As a result, the
official track forecast continues to show slow motion on days 4 and
5.
 
The 12-hour intensity forecast shows a 100-kt major hurricane.  It
is imperative to realize that Idalia is expected to continue
strengthening beyond that time, possibly close to the 110 kt shown
in the previous forecast, before the center reaches land.
Weakening is expected after landfall, but due to the system's
expected fast motion, it is possible that Idalia could maintain
hurricane intensity as it moves across southern Georgia and 
approaches the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina.  After 
Idalia's center moves offshore over the western Atlantic, strong 
shear is likely to limit re-intensification, and the official 
forecast essentially flatlines the intensity on days 2-5.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Catastrophic impacts from storm surge inundation of 10 to 15 feet 
above ground level and destructive waves are expected somewhere 
between Aucilla River and Yankeetown, Florida. Life-threatening 
storm surge inundation is likely elsewhere along portions of the 
Florida Gulf Coast where a Storm Surge Warning is in effect.  
Residents in these areas should follow any advice given by local 
officials.

2. There is the potential for destructive life-threatening winds 
where the core of Idalia moves onshore in the Big Bend region of 
Florida, with hurricane conditions expected elsewhere in portions of 
the Hurricane Warning area along the Florida Gulf Coast. Strong 
winds will also spread inland across portions of northern Florida 
and southern Georgia near the track of the center of Idalia where 
Hurricane Warnings are in effect. Residents in these areas should be 
prepared for long-duration power outages. Damaging hurricane-force 
winds are possible in portions of eastern Georgia and southeastern 
South Carolina where Hurricane Watches are in effect. 

3. Areas of flash, urban, and moderate river flooding, with locally 
considerable impacts, are expected across the Florida Big Bend, 
central Georgia and South Carolina, through eastern North Carolina 
later tonight into Thursday.
