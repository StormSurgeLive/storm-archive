Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Fri Sep 1 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Franklin, located a few hundred miles northeast of Bermuda, on <br/>
Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia, located midway between the coast of <br/>
North Carolina and Bermuda, and on Tropical Storm Jose, located <br/>
several hundred miles east of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to show signs of organization in <br/>
association with an elongated area of low-pressure located just <br/>
west of the Cabo Verde Islands. A short-lived tropical depression <br/>
or tropical storm is expected to form today while the system moves <br/>
northwestward at 10 to 15 mph across the eastern tropical Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (Remnants of Gert):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms have become better organized during the <br/>
past several hours in association with an area of low-pressure <br/>
located several hundred miles north-northeast of the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands.  If this current trend continues, a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form today before upper-level winds <br/>
become increasingly unfavorable over the weekend.  The system is <br/>
forecast to meander over the subtropical Atlantic through this <br/>
weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa <br/>
this weekend.  Environmental conditions could support some gradual <br/>
development of this system through the middle part of next week <br/>
while it moves westward to west-northwestward over the eastern and <br/>
central portions of the tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Jose Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112023
1100 PM AST Thu Aug 31 2023
 
Jose is a tiny tropical cyclone with the convective cloud tops only
extending 50 to 60 n mi across.  However, geostationary satellite
and microwave images indicate that the storm has a tight
circulation with evidence of a mid-level eye feature. A recent
ASCAT pass showed peak winds in the 40-45 kt range, but since the
system is so small that instrument likely can not resolve the peak
winds.  The initial intensity is increased to 50 kt, which is above
the Dvorak estimates.
 
Jose is likely near its peak intensity.  There is no way Jose will 
escape the outflow associated with Hurricane Franklin, that is 
expected to begin affecting the small storm by midday Friday.  
Therefore, the forecast shows a steady weakening trend until it 
becomes absorbed by Franklin in about 36 hours.

The storm is moving northward at 11 kt and is moving in the flow 
between Franklin and a mid-level ridge over the central Atlantic.  A 
faster motion to the north is expected until the system dissipates 
on Saturday.  The NHC track forecast is slightly to the west of the 
previous one.

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  46
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
1100 PM AST Thu Aug 31 2023
 
Convection is separating from the low-level circulation of Franklin
this evening.  Infrared satellite imagery show the coldest cloud
tops limited to the southeast quadrant, confirming the cyclone is
experiencing significant vertical wind shear.  Subjective and
objective satellite intensity estimates have continued to decrease
and range from 70-77 kt.  The initial intensity has been lowered to
75 kt for this advisory.
 
Franklin is forecast to complete its extratropical transition during
the next day or so.  However, global models indicate it will remain
a powerful system despite losing its tropical characteristics.
Therefore, the official intensity forecast shows Franklin gradually
weakening before becoming a hurricane-force extratropical cyclone.
A faster weakening trend is predicted later in the forecast period,
similar to the previous prediction and lies on the higher end of
the guidance envelope.
 
The hurricane is moving to the east-northeast at 13 kt. The track 
reasoning remains unchanged.  An acceleration generally 
northeastward is expected during the next couple of days as the 
hurricane is steered by the flow between a subtropical ridge over 
the central Atlantic and a deep-layer trough over the coast of 
Atlantic Canada.  The track guidance is in good agreement and little 
changes have been made to the official forecast.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia
was located near latitude 32.7 North, longitude 70.6 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east near 21 mph (31
km/h).  A turn toward the east-southeast is expected today, 
accompanied by a considerable decrease in forward speed.  A slower 
east or east-northeastward motion is expected over the weekend.  On 
the forecast track, Idalia will approach Bermuda over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast through early Saturday.
Restrengthening is possible over the weekend, and Idalia is expected
to transition back to a tropical storm on Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  Water levels in the Outer Banks of North Carolina are 
expected to recede this morning.  For information specific to 
your area, please see products issued by your local National 
Weather Service forecast office.
 
WIND:  Gusts to tropical storm force are expected to continue along
the coast of North Carolina through early this morning.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda by Saturday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 4 to 6
inches, or 100 to 150 millimeters, across Bermuda through Sunday
night. The heavy rainfall may cause areas of flash and urban
flooding on the island.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia will affect the southeastern U.S.
coast during the next couple of days and will reach Bermuda today. 
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
1100 PM EDT Thu Aug 31 2023

Satellite images indicate that Idalia continues to exhibit the 
appearance of an extratropical cyclone with a frontal boundary 
extending from the center northeastward.  There is almost no deep 
convection associated with the system, but there continues to be 
areas of heavy rain along the front extending to near the coast of 
North Carolina.  The initial intensity remains 55 kt.

The cyclone is moving eastward at about 20 kt.  A slightly slower 
motion to the east-southeast is expected during the next day or two 
as the system continues to move near the base of a mid- to 
upper-level trough.  However, the steering currents are expected to 
weaken over the weekend as the storm approaches Bermuda, which 
should cause a significant slow down.  A turn to the northeast is 
forecast late in the weekend when another shortwave trough 
approaches the system.  The guidance is slower this cycle, and the 
NHC track forecast has been adjusted accordingly.

Gradual weakening is expected through early Saturday as the system 
separates from the mid- to upper-level trough.  However, as Idalia 
transitions back to a tropical cyclone near Bermuda, slow 
strengthening seems likely.  Based on the GFS and ECMWF models, 
Idalia will likely transition back to an extratropical cyclone in 
about 5 days.  The intensity forecast is similar to the previous 
one and fairly close to the GFS model.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are possible in Bermuda by Saturday.
Heavy rainfall will likely lead to areas of flash and urban
flooding on the island.
 
2. Water levels are expected to subside and winds are expected to
diminish along the coast of North Carolina through early Friday.
