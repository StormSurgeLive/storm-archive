Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Sat Aug 26 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
upgraded Hurricane Franklin, located several hundred miles south of <br/>
Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Northwestern Caribbean Sea and Eastern Gulf of Mexico (AL93):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure <br/>
located near the Yucatan Channel continue to gradually become <br/>
better organized.  If this trend continues, advisories will be <br/>
initiated on this system later today.  The system is expected to <br/>
move very slowly northward into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico <br/>
during the next couple of days.  Heavy rains are likely over <br/>
portions of western Cuba and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico.<br/>
Interests in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, western Cuba, and <br/>
Florida should monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL92):<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue in association with <br/>
a broad area of low pressure located about 1000 miles <br/>
east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands.  This system has <br/>
not become better organized since yesterday, and development is <br/>
becoming less likely while it moves generally northwestward over <br/>
the central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is forecast to move off the west coast of Africa <br/>
early next week. Some slow development of this system is possible <br/>
during the latter part of next week while the system moves westward <br/>
across the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 PM AST Sat Aug 26 2023
 

Visible and microwave satellite imagery show Franklin is becoming a 
well organized hurricane. AMSR2 microwave data showed a closed 
mid-level core that was vertically aligned with the low-level 
center. The latest visible imagery shows a dimple where an eye may 
be trying to develop. Deep convection has become more symmetrical, 
wrapping around the center throughout the day. NOAA Hurricane 
Hunters were in the system earlier this afternoon, with flight-level 
winds and SFMR winds supporting an intensity of around 70 kt. The 
UW-CIMSS ADT objective satellite estimates have been rising this 
afternoon as well. Given the improved satellite structure combined 
with the earlier data from the NOAA Hurricane Hunters, the initial 
intensity is raised to 75 kt for this advisory. NOAA and Air Force 
Hurricane Hunters will be in the system later this evening.
 
Franklin is moving north-northwestward at 7 kt.  A 
north-northwestward to northward motion is forecast during the next 
few days as the storm moves along the western periphery of a 
mid-level ridge, taking it to the west of Bermuda on Tuesday.  By 
the middle of next week, a faster northeast to east-northeast motion 
is expected between the ridge and a mid- to upper-level trough over 
eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. In the short 
range, models once again have trended westward, and the official NHC 
forecast has been nudged west as well. For the long term, models, 
including the GFS and ECMWF, have made a fairly large shift to the 
right. The NHC track was shifted in that direction in the long term, 
but remains to the left of the consensus aids. The confidence of the 
long-term forecast track is lower than usual.
 
Franklin has been steadily strengthening throughout the day. Further 
strengthening is forecast during the next few days with lower 
vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures in the western 
Atlantic. Franklin is forecast to become a major hurricane early 
next week. The strengthening trend should end in about 3 to 4 days 
with shear expected to increase over the system at that time. By day 
5, the current forecast track takes the system over much cooler 
SSTs. However, the intensity in the long range will be dependent on 
the eventual forecast track of Franklin. The current intensity 
forecast lies near the consensus aids, but still slightly lower than 
the HCCA aid.

Tropical Depression Ten Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
400 PM CDT Sat Aug 26 2023
 
The cloud pattern of the low pressure area located near the
northeastern Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico has gradually become
better organized today.  Radar observations show a circulation has
developed, although surface observations indicate that the western
semicircle of this circulation is rather weak at this time.  Given 
the increased organization, advisories are being initiated on 
Tropical Depression Ten.  Surface synoptic observations suggest that 
the current intensity is around 25 kt.
 
The current motion estimate is nearly stationary.  There is a 
weakness in the subtropical ridge to the north of the tropical 
cyclone, leaving the system in a region of very weak steering flow. 
The dynamical guidance indicates that the system will remain in 
weak steering currents for the next 24 to 36 hours, so very little 
motion is predicted during that period.  After that time, a 
mid-level ridge begins to build to the east of the tropical cyclone. 
This should cause a generally northward motion in the next 2 to 3 
days.  Then, a gradual turn to the north-northeast is expected as 
the system moves along the northwestern periphery of the ridge.  The 
official track forecast is a blend of the simple and corrected 
dynamical model consensus guidance.
 
The tropical cyclone will be moving over very warm waters with only
moderate vertical wind shear anticipated during the next several
days.  Therefore, gradual strengthening is forecast.  The official
forecast is similar to the latest LGEM guidance and shows the 
system becoming a hurricane over the eastern Gulf of Mexico.  Users 
are reminded that there is significant uncertainty in 3-4 day 
intensity predictions and are urged to monitor changes to future 
forecasts.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Tropical Depression Ten is expected across
the eastern Yucatan Peninsula and western Cuba. The heavy rainfall
may produce areas of flash and urban flooding, as well as
landslides, across western Cuba.  The depression is forecast to
become a tropical storm by Sunday, and tropical storm conditions are
expected over portions of the Yucatan Peninsula where a Tropical
Storm Warning is in effect.  Tropical storm conditions are possible
over portions of western Cuba within the Tropical Storm Watch area.
 
2. The depression is forecast to strengthen during the next few days
and could become a hurricane over the eastern Gulf of Mexico,
bringing a potential of dangerous storm surge, heavy rainfall, and
strong winds to portions of the west coast of Florida and the
Florida Panhandle by the middle of next week.  Heavy rainfall is
also likely to spread into portions of the Southeast U.S. by mid to
late next week.  Although it is too soon to specify the exact
location and magnitude of these impacts, residents in these areas
should monitor updates to the forecast of this system and ensure
that they have their hurricane plan in place.
