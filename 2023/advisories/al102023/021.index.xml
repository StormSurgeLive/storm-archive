Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Thu Aug 31 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Franklin, located a few hundred miles northeast of Bermuda, on <br/>
Tropical Storm Idalia, located off the coast of North Carolina, and <br/>
on Tropical Storm Jose, located several hundred miles east of <br/>
Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
An area of low pressure located just west of the Cabo Verde Islands <br/>
continues to produce showers and thunderstorms with some signs of <br/>
organization. Environmental conditions appear conducive for further <br/>
development of this system, and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form during the next day or two while the system moves northwestward <br/>
at 10 to 15 mph across the eastern tropical Atlantic. Interests in <br/>
the Cabo Verde Islands should monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (Remnants of Gert):<br/>
A small area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
north-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands is producing small <br/>
bursts of showers and thunderstorms to the south of its center. This <br/>
system has a short window for further development during the next <br/>
day or so while it drifts northeastward or eastward, before <br/>
upper-level winds become increasingly unfavorable by the weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
An area of low pressure could develop over the eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic early next week in association with a tropical wave. <br/>
Environmental conditions could support some gradual development of <br/>
this system through the middle part of next week while it moves <br/>
westward to west-northwestward over the eastern and central portions <br/>
of the tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Jose Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112023
500 PM AST Thu Aug 31 2023

The cloud pattern of Jose has changed little since earlier today.  
Banding features are limited, and the convection near the center 
is not very deep at this time.  The upper-level outflow is being 
impeded over the western portion of the circulation, suggestive 
of northwesterly shear over the system.  The current intensity 
estimate remains at 35 kt in agreement with a subjective Dvorak 
T-number from TAFB. 

Latest center fixes indicate that the system is moving northward 
with increasing forward speed.  The current motion estimate is 
360/10 kt.  During the next 12 to 24 hours Jose should continue to 
move generally northward, with a continued increase in forward 
speed, along the western side of a mid-level anticyclone,  Then, 
the cyclone is likely to become entrained into the eastern portion 
of the larger circulation of Franklin.  The official track forecast 
is similar to the previous one and in good agreement with the 
global model solutions.

Given the influence of nearby Franklin on both the low-level 
circulation and the upper-level outflow, Jose is not likely to 
strengthen significantly during the next day or so.  The official 
forecast, like the previous one, shows the system dissipating after 
24 hours since it is expected to be absorbed by Franklin by then.

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  45
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 PM AST Thu Aug 31 2023
 
The cloud pattern of Franklin has continued to erode this afternoon.
Deep convection is limited to the southeastern portion of its
circulation, as strong shear continues to negatively affect the
system. Scatterometer data from today show the hurricane is still
producing a very large area of winds greater than 50 kt, though the
resolution limitations of the instrument do not allow for a peak
intensity estimate. The conventional satellite intensity estimates
continue to decrease, and the initial intensity is lowered to 80 kt
based on a blend of the latest objective and subjective estimates.
 
Franklin is expected to lose tropical characteristics over the next
day or so, with strong shear continuing over the system and
intrusions of drier mid-level air into the circulation as it
accelerates deeper into the mid-latitudes. However, this will not
immediately lead to significant weakening of the system. The GFS and
ECMWF both show an enhancement of hurricane-force winds on the
western side of the storm while the system interacts with a
baroclinic system and begins extratropical transition. Thus, the
near-term intensity forecast shows little change in strength, and
Franklin appears likely to maintain hurricane-force winds through
its extratropical transition in 36 h. Thereafter, a faster weakening
trend is shown through the rest of the forecast period, which is
consistent with the latest multi-model consensus aids.
 
The initial motion of Franklin is east-northeastward at 65/12 kt. A
northeastward acceleration is forecast during the next couple of
days while the cyclone moves within the flow between a subtropical
ridge over the central Atlantic and a deep-layer trough over
Atlantic Canada. From there, the track guidance generally supports a
continued northeastward motion over the northern Atlantic, and this
forecast shows a slightly faster motion beyond day 3 to reflect the
model consensus trends this cycle.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
All Tropical Storm Warnings and Storm Surge Watches have been
discontinued along the coast of North Carolina.
 
The Bermuda Weather Service has issued a Tropical Storm Watch for
Bermuda.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products 
issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia 
was located near latitude 33.5 North, longitude 73.5 West.  Idalia 
is moving toward the east near 21 mph (33 km/h), and this motion is 
expected to continue through tonight.  A turn toward the 
east-southeast and east is expected on Friday and Saturday, 
accompanied by a considerable decrease in forward speed.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Idalia will continue moving away from 
the coast of North Carolina and approach Bermuda over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast through Friday night.  
Restrengthening is possible over the weekend, and Idalia is expected 
to transition back to a tropical storm by Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
from the center.  NOAA buoy 41002 well to the south of Cape 
Hatteras recently reported a sustained wind of 47 mph (76 km/h) and 
a gust to 61 mph (98 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  Water levels remain elevated at the following 
heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas but should 
subside overnight...
 
Beaufort Inlet, NC to Ocracoke Inlet, NC...1-3 ft
Neuse and Bay Rivers...1-3 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...1-3 ft
Ocracoke Inlet, NC to Duck, NC...1-3 ft
 
For information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
WIND:  Gusts to tropical storm force are still possible along the
coast of North Carolina through tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda by Saturday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 5 to 7 
inches (125 to 175 millimeters) across Bermuda through Sunday night. 
The heavy rainfall will likely lead to areas of flash and urban 
flooding on the island. 
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia will affect the southeastern U.S.
coast during the next few days and will reach Bermuda on Friday.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia Forecast Discussion Number 20</title>

Tropical Storm Idalia Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
1100 AM EDT Thu Aug 31 2023
 
Satellite imagery, surface observations, and Air Force Reserve
Hurricane Hunter data all indicate that Idalia continues to tangle
with a frontal boundary that extends northward offshore the Outer
Banks.  In addition, organized deep convection has mostly dissipated
near the center, and it appears that Idalia is on its way to
becoming extratropical.  The initial intensity remains 50 kt based
on coastal wind reports and the reconnaissance data.
 
Global model fields show winds increasing on the northwestern side
of the frontal boundary during the day as Idalia is pulling away
from the coast of North Carolina, and as a result, the NHC intensity
forecast shows some strengthening in the short term.  Idalia is
expected to become fully extratropical by this evening, which is
now shown in the official forecast.  Winds should begin decreasing
tonight, and simulated satellite imagery from the GFS and ECMWF
models suggests that the circulation will continue to be devoid of
deep convection, and attached to a front, through at least 36
hours.  By 48 hours, the low will reach warmer waters, the
front is likely to weaken, and the ECMWF shows deep convection
redeveloping.  As a result, the official forecast shows Idalia
becoming a tropical storm again on Saturday.  Intensity-wise, the
guidance indicates that the peak winds are likely to fluctuate
between 40-45 kt from days 2 through 5.
 
Idalia is now moving eastward, or 090/17 kt, between a deep-layer
trough over the northeastern U.S. and a subtropical anticyclone
near the Bahamas.  The trough is likely to bypass Idalia in a few
days, which will cause its eastward motion to slow down to about 5
kt on days 2 and 3 as it approaches Bermuda.  On days 4 and 5, a
second trough is expected to turn Idalia to the northeast, but still
at a relatively slow forward speed.  The track guidance is in a bit
more agreement than the past few days, and the NHC forecast lies
between the TVCX and HCCA consensus aids.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Rainfall will be diminishing by early afternoon from coastal
North Carolina into far southeast Virginia.  Moderate river
flooding, with considerable impacts, will continue across coastal
North Carolina through today.
 
2. Coastal flooding is expected within the Storm Surge Watch
area in North Carolina today.  Residents in these areas should
follow any advice given by local officials.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions will continue across eastern North
Carolina within the Tropical Storm Warning area through this
evening.
