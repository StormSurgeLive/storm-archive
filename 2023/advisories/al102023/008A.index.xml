Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
1100 AM EDT Mon Aug 28 2023
 
Visible, infrared and microwave imagery depict a strengthening major 
hurricane with a well-defined eye, a thick eyewall, and very cold 
cloud tops. This was further supported by data from the Air Force 
Reserve Hurricane Hunters, who have been investigating the storm 
this morning. Minimum pressure has decreased from the previous 
advisory based on a dropsonde measuring a pressure of 937 mb around 
12 UTC. Flight-level, SFMR winds and dropsondes in the eyewall 
indicate maximum sustained winds have increased to 125 kt. 
Subjective and object satellite estimates also have drastically 
increased with this advisory. Given these data, the initial 
intensity is raised to 125 kt for this advisory, and Franklin has 
rapidly intensified into a Category 4 major hurricane.
 
The hurricane continues to make a gradual turn northward, with the 
latest motion estimate northward at 350/8 kt. A northward then 
northeastward motion is forecast during the next 48 hours as 
Franklin rounds the western edge of the subtropical ridge. After 48 
hours, a deep trough is expected to move off the U.S. northeast 
coast and Canada, and has Franklin becoming captured in the 
southwesterly flow, with an increase in forward motion to the 
northeast. There is better agreement in cross-track guidance 
compared to the previous few advisories. However, there is still a 
slight difference in the along track guidance with the GFS being 
faster, and the ECMWF a little slower. The latest NHC track forecast 
is similar to the previous forecast, with only a minor nudge to the 
north.
 
Some additional intensification is possible today, as Franklin 
remains in a low shear environment and is over warm sea-surface 
temperatures. The latest intensity forecast peaks Franklin as a 
strong Category 4 major hurricane. However, inner core changes, such 
as eyewall replacement cycles, could occur at any time, making the 
peak intensity and short-term forecast a little more challenging. 
Some gradual weakening is forecast in about a day or so when models 
forecast a slight increase in northwesterly shear. Toward the end of 
the forecast period, further weakening is expected as Franklin 
encounters increased vertical wind shear and moves over cooler SSTs. 
The latest forecast shows the storm becoming a extratropical cyclone 
in 120 h, though this could occur sooner.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning
Wednesday morning, when Franklin is forecast to make its closest
approach to the island.
 
2. Life-threatening surf and rip currents are occurring along the
coast of the southeast United States. These conditions are
expected to spread northward along the remainder of the U.S.
east coast, Atlantic Canada, and Bermuda during the next couple of
days.

and property should be rushed to completion. 
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests along the southeastern U.S. coast should monitor the
progress of this system.  Additional watches and warnings will
likely be required later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area
outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by
your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Idalia was
located near latitude 21.2 North, longitude 85.1 West. Idalia is
moving toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h). A northward motion is
expected through tonight, followed by a faster north-northeast
motion on Tuesday and Wednesday.  On the forecast track, the center
of Idalia is forecast to pass near or over western Cuba tonight,
over the extreme southeastern Gulf of Mexico by early Tuesday, and
reach the Gulf coast of Florida on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Idalia is forecast to become a hurricane later 
today and a dangerous major hurricane over the northeastern Gulf of 
Mexico by early Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 
km) from the center.
 
The latest minimum central pressure estimated from data from an Air
Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft is 987 mb (29.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Aucilla River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...7-11 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...6-9 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Aucilla River, FL...4-7 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...4-7 ft
Tampa Bay...4-7 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...3-5 ft
Englewood, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...2-4 ft
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to Altamaha Sound, GA...2-4 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...1-3 ft
Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL to Mouth of the St. Mary's
River...1-3 ft
Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances. For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet above
normal tide levels along the southern coast of Pinar del Rio, Cuba.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area in western Cuba later today.  Tropical storm force 
winds are already reaching portions of the southern coast of Cuba. 
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
tropical storm warning area over the Yucatan Peninsula and the Isle
of Youth in Cuba through tonight. 
 
Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane warning area
in Florida by late Tuesday or Wednesday, with tropical storm
conditions beginning on Tuesday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the Dry Tortugas
beginning tonight and within the tropical storm warning area
along the Florida Gulf coast on Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts:
 
Portions of the eastern Yucatan: Additional 1 to 2 inches.
 
Western Cuba: 4 to 7 inches, with isolated higher totals of 10
inches.
 
Portions of the west coast of Florida, the Florida Panhandle,
southeast Georgia and the eastern Carolinas: 4 to 8 inches from
Tuesday into Thursday. Isolated higher totals of 12 inches possible,
primarily near landfall in northern Florida.
 
This rainfall may lead to flash and urban flooding, and landslides
across western Cuba.
 
Areas of flash and urban flooding, some of which may be locally
significant, are expected across portions of the west coast of
Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and southern Georgia Tuesday into
Wednesday, spreading into portions of the eastern Carolinas
Wednesday into Thursday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia are affecting portions of the
southern coast of Cuba and eastern Yucatan.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADO: A few tornadoes will be possible starting Tuesday along the
west central Florida coast and the tornado threat will spread
northward into the Florida Big Bend area by Tuesday night.

Tropical Storm Idalia Discussion Number   8...Corrected
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
1000 AM CDT Mon Aug 28 2023

Corrected a typo.

The satellite presentation of the storm has improved this morning 
with the center more deeply embedded within the deep convection and 
colder cloud tops.  However, recent reconnaissance aircraft data 
from both the U.S. Air Force Reserve and NOAA indicate that the 
improved satellite presentation has not yet resulted in an increase 
in wind speed.  The Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft has measured 
peak 850-mb flight-level winds of 68 kt, and a minimum pressure 
around 990 mb.  Based on these data, the initial intensity remains 
55 kt this advisory.  The Air Force aircraft will be in the storm 
environment through early afternoon and that data should continue to 
provide information Idalia's structure and intensity.
 
Recent satellite and aircraft fixes show that Idalia is moving 
northward or 360/8 kt.  A mid-level trough over the central Gulf of 
Mexico and a ridge near the Greater Antilles should cause Idalia to 
move northward at a faster forward speed during the next 12-24 
hours.  After that time, an even faster north-northeast motion is 
expected an another mid-level trough moves across the central and 
eastern portions of the United States.  The latest NHC track 
forecast is again quite similar to the previous forecast. Although 
the track forecast has been quite consistent, there is still some 
spread in the guidance by 48 hours, and it cannot be emphasized 
enough that only a small deviation in the track could cause a 
significant change in Idalia's landfall location in Florida due to 
the paralleling track to the west coast of the state.
 
Although there is still some moderate northwesterly shear over the 
storm, intensification seems likely during the next 12-18 hours, and 
Idalia is forecast to become a hurricane during that time.  By 
Tuesday, the environment over the eastern Gulf of Mexico is expected 
to become more conducive for strengthening.  Steady to rapid 
intensification is predicted beginning Tuesday while Idalia 
traverses the warm waters of the eastern Gulf and the upper-level 
environment becomes more favorable.  The NHC intensity forecast 
again calls for Idalia to reach major hurricane strength before 
landfall along the Gulf coast of Florida.
 
This forecast has necessitated the issuance of Storm Surge and
Hurricane Warnings for portions of the west coast of Florida and
Storm Surge and Tropical Storm Watches for portions of the Atlantic
coasts of Florida and Georgia.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation 
along portions of the Florida Gulf Coast where a Storm Surge Warning 
is in effect, including Tampa Bay and the Big Bend region of 
Florida. Inundation of 7 to 11 feet above ground level is expected 
somewhere between Chassahowitzka and Aucilla River.  Residents in 
these areas should follow any advice given by local officials. 

2. Hurricane conditions are expected within portions of the 
Hurricane Warning area along the Florida Gulf Coast, with the 
potential for destructive winds where the core of Idalia moves 
onshore. Strong winds will also spread inland across portions of 
northern Florida near the track of the center of Idalia.
 
3. Areas of flash and urban flooding, some of which may be locally 
significant, are expected across portions of the west coast of 
Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and southern Georgia Tuesday into 
Wednesday, spreading into portions of the eastern Carolinas 
Wednesday into Thursday.
 
4. Hurricane-force winds are expected across portions of far western 
Cuba later today.  Heavy rainfall is also expected across portions 
of western Cuba and may produce areas of flash and urban 
flooding as well as landslides across western Cuba.
