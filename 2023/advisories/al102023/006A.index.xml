Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
1100 PM EDT Sun Aug 27 2023
 
Franklin is becoming better organized tonight. A ragged eye has 
emerged in conventional satellite imagery during the past few hours, 
and the Air Force Hurricane Hunters reported a closed eyewall during 
recent passes through the center. Aircraft data indicated the 
minimum pressure has continued to fall, with a 00 UTC dropsonde 
reporting a pressure of 964 mb. Since the plane departed, the 
satellite structure of Franklin has markedly improved, with very 
cold cloud tops wrapping around the eastern portion of the 
circulation. The initial intensity of 90 kt is supported by recent 
objective estimates from UW-CIMSS and a T5.0 subjective Dvorak 
classification from TAFB at 00 UTC.

Recent satellite images suggest the hurricane is finally turning 
more northward as expected, and the initial motion is 
north-northwestward (330/7 kt). A gradual turn to the north and 
north-northeast is forecast during the next couple of days as 
Franklin moves around the western periphery of a high pressure 
ridge. The track guidance is in good agreement on this portion of 
the forecast, and only minor westward adjustments were made 
following the latest HCCA and TVCA aids. Thereafter, track 
uncertainty increases regarding Franklin's interaction with a 
deep-layer trough moving off the U.S. east coast by midweek. The GFS 
and ECMWF lie on opposite sides of the guidance envelope, with an 
850 n-mi spread at 96 h. Given the greater than normal uncertainty, 
the NHC track forecast remains close to the multi-model consensus 
aids at days 3-5, showing a gradually faster east-northeastward to 
northeastward motion during this period.

Based on recent satellite trends, it appears that the shear has 
weakened and the inner core of Franklin has become more solidified. 
Thus, the hurricane could be primed to strengthen in the near term 
within a low shear environment over very warm SSTs. The NHC forecast 
brings Franklin to major hurricane intensity in 12 h with more 
strengthening thereafter, in best agreement with some of the 
regional hurricane models and slightly above the HCCA/IVCN aids. As 
the hurricane recurves, increased deep-layer shear and cooler waters 
should induce some weakening, although the wind field will expand 
while the hurricane moves further into the mid-latitudes. This 
forecast shows Franklin becoming extratropical at day 5, although 
the timing could be refined based on future track forecasts.  

Although the core of Franklin is forecast to pass west and north of 
Bermuda during the next few days, its expanding wind field will 
likely require a tropical storm watch for the island on Monday.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Idalia was
located by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near 
latitude 19.7 North, longitude 85.3 West. Idalia has been moving 
erratically and is nearly stationary.  A motion toward the 
north-northeast and north is expected to begin later today,
bringing the center of Idalia over the extreme southeastern Gulf of
Mexico by tonight.  Idalia will then continue on a northward or
north-northeastward path over the eastern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday
and reach the Gulf coast of Florida on Wednesday.
 
Aircraft data indicate that the maximum sustained winds remain near 
60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.  Strengthening is forecast, and 
Idalia is expected to become a hurricane later today.  Idalia is 
likely to be near or at major hurricane intensity when it reaches 
the Gulf coast of Florida.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.  NOAA buoy 42056 recently reported a sustained wind
of 44 mph (70 km/h) and a gust to 56 mph (91 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data is 
990 mb (29.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Aucilla River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...7-11 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...6-9 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Aucilla River, FL...4-7 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...4-7 ft
Tampa Bay...4-7 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...3-5 ft
Englewood, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...2-4 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...1-3 ft
Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet above
normal tide levels along the southern coast of Pinar del Rio, Cuba.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area in western Cuba by late today.  Winds are expected to
first reach tropical storm strength by this morning, making
outside preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to
protect life and property should be rushed to completion.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
tropical storm warning area over the Yucatan Peninsula and the Isle
of Youth in Cuba through today
 
Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area by
late Tuesday or Wednesday, with tropical storm conditions possible
by Tuesday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the Dry Tortugas beginning
late today and within the tropical storm watch area along the
Florida Gulf coast on Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts:
 
Portions of the eastern Yucatan: 1 to 3 inches, with isolated higher
totals of 5 inches.
 
Western Cuba: 3 to 6 inches, with isolated higher totals of 10
inches.
 
Portions of the west coast of Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and
southern Georgia: From Tuesday into Wednesday, 3 to 6 inches, with
isolated higher totals of 10 inches.
 
Heavy rainfall is also expected across portions of the Carolinas by
Wednesday into Thursday.
 
Heavy rainfall from Tropical Storm Idalia is expected across
portions of the eastern Yucatan and western Cuba and may produce
areas of flash and urban flooding as well as landslides across
western Cuba. Scattered flash and urban flooding is expected across
portions of the west coast of Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and
southern Georgia late Tuesday night through Wednesday. Heavy
rainfall may lead to flash flooding across portions of the Carolinas
Wednesday into Thursday.

<title>Tropical Storm Idalia Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Idalia Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
1000 PM CDT Sun Aug 27 2023
 
Idalia's center has become embedded beneath a large burst of deep
convection, with overshooting cloud-top temperatures as cold as -82
degrees Celsius.  NOAA buoy 42056, located just to the east of the
center, has reported maximum 1-minute sustained winds as high as 45
kt within the past hour or two.  The anemometer height of the buoy
is 4 meters, so converting the wind to a standard 10-meter height
indicates that Idalia's intensity is now up to at least 50 kt, which
is the initial intensity for this advisory.  An Air Force Reserve
reconnaissance aircraft is scheduled to investigate Idalia in a few
hours.
 
The center has been moving erratically since earlier today, and may
have even sagged southward, pulled toward the recently developed
deep convection.  A northward motion is expected to begin on Monday
and continue through Tuesday as Idalia moves between a mid-level
trough over the central Gulf of Mexico and strengthening ridging
over the Greater Antilles.  After 48 hours, a gradual turn toward
the northeast and then east is anticipated due to a deeper trough
that is expected to swing across the Great Lakes.  No significant
changes were required for the updated NHC track forecast compared
to the previous prediction.  The spread among the track models
remains relatively low, and the official track continues to lie
closest to the ECMWF and HCCA consensus aid.
 
Idalia is sitting over very warm waters of about 30 degrees
Celsius, and when it moves northward, it will be over the even
deeper warm waters of the Loop Current in 24-36 hours.  Although
the trough over the Gulf could impart some shear over the system,
this is likely to be offset by upper-level diffluence.  Idalia has
already strengthened more than anticipated, and the environment
looks ripe for additional intensification, possibly rapid.  The NHC
intensity forecast has been increased and lies at the upper bound of
the guidance.  The new prediction now shows a 95-kt hurricane over
the eastern Gulf of Mexico at 48 hours, but it should be stressed
that additional strengthening to major hurricane strength is
becoming increasingly likely before Idalia reaches the Gulf coast
of Florida.  Interests within the storm surge and hurricane watch
areas are urged to prepare for possible significant impacts and
monitor future updates to the forecast.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Idalia is forecast to become a hurricane by the time it reaches
the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, and it could be near or at major
hurricane strength when it reaches the Gulf coast of Florida.  The
risk continues to increase for a life-threatening storm surge and
hurricane-force winds along portions of the west coast of Florida
and the Florida Panhandle beginning as early as Tuesday.  Storm
surge and hurricane watches are in effect for portions of the
west coast of Florida and the coast of the Florida Panhandle, and
residents in these areas should monitor updates to the forecast and
follow any advice given by local officials.
 
2. Scattered flash and urban flooding is expected across portions of
the west coast of Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and southern
Georgia late Tuesday night through Wednesday. Heavy rainfall may
lead to flash flooding across portions of the Carolinas Wednesday
into Thursday.
 
3. Hurricane-force winds are expected across portions of far
western Cuba late Monday.  Heavy rainfall is expected across
portions of the eastern Yucatan and western Cuba and may produce
areas of flash and urban flooding as well as landslides across
western Cuba.
