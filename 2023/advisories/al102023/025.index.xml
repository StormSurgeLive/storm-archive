Tropical Storm Jose Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112023
500 PM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
Jose has started to become more elongated in recent geostationary 
imagery. However, a midday AMSR2 microwave pass showed that the 
system still has a small coherent mid-level circulation. The 
intensity is held at 45 kt for this advisory, in best agreement with 
recent UW-CIMSS AiDT, DMINT, and DPRINT estimates. It is noted that 
the intensity is more uncertain than usual given the compact nature 
of the system and its degraded convective structure. The storm is 
beginning to move underneath the upper-level clouds associated with 
Franklin's outflow.
 
Jose continues to accelerate towards the north-northeast at about 28 
kt. The increase in forward motion and interaction with Franklin 
could lead to a slight expansion of the tropical-storm-force winds 
on the east side of Jose. The tropical storm is still expected to 
dissipate sometime tonight as it becomes absorbed by Franklin. The 
track forecast is largely based on the global model wind fields, and 
little intensity change is anticipated through dissipation as the 
fast forward motion is likely to maintain stronger winds over the 
eastern semicircle.

Tropical Storm Gert Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
500 PM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
Gert appears to have strengthened and has become a tropical storm 
once again. Satellite intensity estimates range from 30 kt (1800 UTC 
SAB Dvorak Current Intensity) to 46 kt (1701 UTC UW-CIMSS SATCON), 
so the intensity has been raised to 35 kt in this advisory. AMSR 
microwave imagery from a few hours ago revealed Gert has a tight 
well-defined low-level inner-core, and it's possible the 35-kt 
estimate is conservative.
 
The AMSR pass was also the first clear indication that Gert is
centered a little farther south than previously estimated. It's
possible that Gert's deep convection, which is limited to the
southeast quadrant, is pulling the center slowly in that direction
in the absence of other strong steering currents right now. In a
couple days, Gert should move a little quicker toward the northeast,
steered by a combination of Idalia to its northwest and a low- to
mid-level ridge over the eastern and central Atlantic. The NHC track
forecast is very close to the multi-model consensus aids TVCN and
HCCA, but is a little slower than the previous advisory.
 
Although continued shear should prevent Gert from strengthening 
much, additional slight intensification is possible today or 
tomorrow. Most models show the cyclone becoming post-tropical in 48 
to 60 hours, and absorbed into the much larger circulation of Idalia 
soon after. The NHC intensity forecast has been adjusted slightly 
higher but is still very similar to the previous advisory. One thing 
to note, the model trackers used to help NHC make track and 
intensity forecasts appear to be following Idalia at the end of the 
forecast instead of Gert in many cases. Users should be aware that 
the tracks and intensities in the NCEP tracker or ATCF files may not 
be representative of the model depiction of Gert beyond 60-72 h.

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  48
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
1100 AM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
The latest satellite images of Franklin indicate the system is
gradually losing tropical characteristics. The inner circulation of
the system is exposed, with a curved band of deep convection
displaced to the east of its center by strong westerly shear. The
low-level center is also losing definition and appears more
elongated than yesterday. A cold front is racing southeastward
toward Franklin, with rope clouds evident in visible satellite
imagery over the northern Atlantic. Recent scatterometer data shows
peak winds of 55-60 kt to the west of the center, with a larger area
of 34-kt winds in the northwest quadrant due to the approaching
front. Based on these data, the initial intensity is set at 65 kt.
 
In the short term, Franklin appears likely to remain at or near
hurricane-force intensity due to baroclinic forcing while it merges
with a frontal system over the northern Atlantic. This scenario is
supported by all the global models, which show a narrow band of
strong winds persisting within the western portion of the
circulation during the next 12-24 h (consistent with the
aforementioned ASCAT data). Soon thereafter, the extratropical
cyclone is forecast to weaken as the low moves deeper into the
mid-latitudes and gradually fills. The updated NHC intensity
forecast lies between the GFS and ECMWF in the near term, and then
trends toward the multi-model consensus later in the period.
 
Franklin is moving northeastward (50 degrees/16 kt) within the flow
between a deep-layer trough over the northwestern Atlantic and a
subtropical ridge over the central Atlantic. A somewhat faster
motion to the northeast is anticipated during the next day or so,
followed by a continued northeastward to east-northeastward motion
into early next week. Through 72 h, the updated NHC forecast lies
close to the previous prediction. As discussed with prior forecasts,
track uncertainty grows beyond day 3 regarding how much interaction
will occur between Franklin and a larger cut-off low meandering over
the eastern Atlantic. The latest NHC track has been adjusted south
of the previous forecast at days 4-5, but future adjustments could
be necessary as it still lies north of the TVCA and HCCA aids.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM CVT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Twelve
was located near latitude 19.6 North, longitude 28.3 West.  The
depression is moving toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 
km/h).  A motion toward the north-northwest and northwest at a 
faster forward speed is expected through Sunday.  A turn toward the 
west-northwest is forecast later on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is expected, and the depression is forecast to 
become a tropical storm later today or this evening.  The system is 
likely to weaken early Sunday and degenerate to a remnant low by 
late Sunday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).

Tropical Depression Twelve Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122023
200 PM CVT Fri Sep 01 2023
 
The area of low pressure over the far eastern Atlantic to the 
northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands has developed a well-defined 
surface circulation with sufficiently organized deep convection to 
be classified as a tropical cyclone.  Dvorak classifications from 
TAFB and SAB are a consensus T2.5, but since the convection is 
loosely organized around the center, the initial intensity is 
started at 30 kt.

Sea surface temperatures of 27-28 degrees Celsius and low vertical 
shear during the next day or so should allow the depression to 
strengthen to a tropical storm later today or on Saturday.  However, 
the cyclone will be reaching marginally warm waters in 24-48 hours, 
and southerly shear is forecast to increase at about that same time. 
 The NHC forecast therefore shows weakening beginning in 48 hours, 
and the system is likely to degenerate into a remnant low by 60 
hours due to a loss of organized deep convection.  The remnant low 
is shown dissipating by day 4, following the majority of the global 
model fields.

The depression is moving toward the north-northwest (340 degrees) at 
7 kt between a mid-level ridge over western Africa and a mid- to 
upper-level low located over the eastern Atlantic.  The steering 
environment changes little during the next couple of days, and the 
depression is therefore expected to move toward the north-northwest 
or northwest, at a slightly faster speed, through 48 hours.  After 
the cyclone becomes a shallower remnant low, lower-level flow is 
expected to turn the system toward the west-northwest until it 
dissipates.  The track guidance is tightly clustered for the next 4 
days, and the NHC track forecast is very close to the HCCA consensus 
aid.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia
was located near latitude 32.0 North, longitude 66.5 West.  Idalia 
is moving toward the east-southeast near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this
general trajectory at a slower forward speed is expected through 
early Saturday.  A turn toward the east and then northeast is 
forecast over the weekend.  On the forecast track, the center of
Idalia will move near or to the south of Bermuda on Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Additional weakening is forecast through early Saturday.
Little change in strength is expected during the next few days. 
Idalia could transition to a tropical or subtropical storm on 
Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda by
Saturday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 3 to 5 
inches, or 75 to 125 millimeters, across Bermuda through the 
weekend.  The heavy rainfall will likely cause areas of flash and 
urban flooding on the island.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia will affect the southeastern U.S.
coast and Bermuda during the next couple of days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
500 PM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
Idalia is still an extratropical cyclone lacking deep convection.  
ASCAT data from a few hours ago showed winds of 40-45 kt to the 
northwest of the center, so the initial intensity is set at 45 kt.

The initial motion is still toward the east-southeast (105 degrees), 
but the forward speed has slowed down to about 13 kt.  Idalia is 
becoming collocated with a developing mid-level low, and it is 
therefore expected to slow down further and turn eastward during 
the next 24 hours as it moves near Bermuda.  After 24 hours, a 
shortwave trough is forecast to move off the coast of New England 
and kick Idalia faster toward the northeast through day 3.  But 
then that shortwave trough is expected to cut off and cause Idalia 
to slow down again on days 4 and 5 while it moves generally 
northward.  The NHC track forecast is shifted a bit to the left of 
the previous forecast based on the latest track guidance, and to 
account for a slight adjustment to the initial position.

ECMWF- and GFS-based simulated satellite imagery insist that deep 
convection will redevelop with Idalia tonight or on Saturday as the 
system moves over warmer waters and while vertical shear is 
relatively low.  However, the associated frontal zone does not 
appear to completely dissipate in the global model fields, and FSU 
phase-space diagrams indicate that the cyclone is likely to have a 
symmetric but shallow warm core.  The NHC forecast continues to show 
Idalia becoming a tropical cyclone on Saturday, however it is 
possible that it could be closer to the subtropical side of the 
spectrum.  Some strengthening is possible during the 
tropical/subtropical phase, and the NHC intensity forecast lies 
close to the IVCN intensity consensus.  Idalia is then expected to 
become fully extratropical again by day 3.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected in Bermuda by Saturday.
Heavy rainfall will likely cause areas of flash and urban flooding
on the island through the weekend.
