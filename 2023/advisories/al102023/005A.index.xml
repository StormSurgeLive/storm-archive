Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 PM AST Sun Aug 27 2023

Visible and infrared satellite imagery has improved slightly since 
this morning, with a tight inner core developing around the center. 
There have been hints of an eye developing in infrared and visible 
images throughout the day, but the eye remains cloud filled. 
Franklin is still dealing with a little bit of drier mid-level dry 
air trying to wrap into the eastern side. Subjective and objective 
Dvorak estimates have remained steady throughout the day today. With 
these estimates combined with the lower surface pressure reported by 
the aircraft, the initial intensity remains at 85 kt this advisory. 
The Air Force Hurricane Hunters will be investigating the system 
later this evening.
 
Environmental conditions are fairly favorable for the next few days, 
with very warm sea surface temperatures and vertical wind shear 
forecast to decrease. Steady to rapid strengthening is forecast, and 
Franklin could become a major hurricane on Monday. In about 3 to 4 
days, weakening is forecast as Franklin encounters increased shear 
and moves over cooler SSTs. The wind field of Franklin is forecast 
to increase in size as it moves into the mid-latitudes.
 
Franklin is moving northwestward at 8 kt, around a broad 
high-pressure ridge to the east of Franklin. This ridge will steer 
the system more north-northwestward and northward over the next 
couple of days. In the longer range of the forecast period, a deep 
trough is expected to move off the U.S. east coast, and most of the 
guidance has Franklin becoming captured in the southwesterly flow, 
with an increase in forward motion to the northeast. The official 
NHC forecast track lies near the model consensus aids, with only 
slight adjustments to the previous advisory. The NHC forecast track 
still has the core of Franklin passing west and north of Bermuda, 
but interests there should continue to monitor the latest NHC 
forecasts. By day 5, Franklin may begin to interact with the upper 
trough and begin an extratropical transition, although that is not 
explicitly forecast.

within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area.
 
Interests along the southeastern U.S. coast should monitor the
progress of this system.  Additional watches and warnings will
likely be required on Monday.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Idalia was
located near latitude 20.1 North, longitude 85.4 West.  Idalia is
moving toward the east-northeast near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A slow, 
possibly erratic, motion is expected overnight.  A generally 
northward to north-northeastward motion at an increasing forward 
speed is expected on Monday and Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the 
center will move over the eastern Gulf of Mexico on Monday and 
Tuesday, and approach the northeastern Gulf coast late Tuesday.
 
Buoy observations indicate that Idalia's maximum sustained winds 
have increased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.  
Additional strengthening is forecast, and Idalia is expected to 
become a hurricane over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico by early 
Tuesday.  Additional strengthening is likely while Idalia approaches 
the northeastern Gulf coast.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.  NOAA buoy 42056 over the far northwestern 
Caribbean Sea recently reported a sustained wind of 42 mph (68 
km/h) and a wind gust to 49 mph (79 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Aucilla River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...7-11 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...5-8 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Aucilla River, FL...4-7 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...3-5 ft
Tampa Bay...3-5 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...2-4 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...1-3 ft
Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above 
normal tide levels along the southern coast of Pinar del Rio, Cuba. 
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
warning area over the Yucatan Peninsula and western Cuba through
Monday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area on the Isle of Youth on Monday.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area by
late Tuesday or Wednesday, with tropical storm conditions possible
by Tuesday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the Dry Tortugas beginning
late Monday and within the tropical storm watch area along the
Florida Gulf coast on Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts:
 
Portions of the eastern Yucatan Peninsula: 2 to 4 inches, with
isolated higher totals of 6 inches.
 
Western Cuba: 3 to 6 inches, with isolated higher totals of 10
inches.
 
Portions of the west coast of Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and
southern Georgia: From Tuesday into Wednesday, 3 to 6 inches, with
isolated higher totals of 10 inches.
 
Heavy rainfall is also likely to spread into portions of the
Carolinas by Wednesday into Thursday.
 
This rainfall may lead to flash and urban flooding, and landslides
across western Cuba.  Scattered flash and urban flooding can also
be expected across portions of the west coast of Florida, the
Florida Panhandle and portions of the Southeast U.S. by Tuesday
into Thursday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Idalia Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
400 PM CDT Sun Aug 27 2023
 
Idalia's cloud pattern is gradually becoming a little better
organized, with a curved convective band forming over the southern
semicircle of the circulation.  Upper-level outflow is currently
restricted over the northern portion of the system, however.
The advisory intensity is held at 35 kt based on a subjective
Dvorak estimate from TAFB.  Another aircraft reconnaissance mission
into the storm is scheduled for tonight.
 
The tropical cyclone continues to move rather slowly, and the
initial motion estimate is 040/3 kt. Idalia should remain in a weak
steering pattern through tonight so slow and possibly erratic
motion is likely for the next 12 hours.  On Monday, a mid-level
ridge begins to build to the northeast of the tropical cyclone.
This should result in a slightly east of northward motion during
the next day or two.  When the system moves into the northeast Gulf
of Mexico, a mid-level trough developing over the eastern United
states will likely cause Idalia to turn northeastward with an
increase in forward speed.  The new official forecast is again
shifted slightly eastward, and is somewhat faster than the previous
one.  This is a blend of the latest ECMWF and GFS solutions and is
also between the simple and corrected dynamical consensus tracks.

The intensity forecast is somewhat challenging.  Idalia will be 
traversing eastern Gulf of Mexico waters of high oceanic heat 
content, and the environmental air mass should remain fairly moist.  
The flow to the east of an upper-level trough could impart some 
vertical wind shear over the system, but this shear could also be 
compensated by the conducive effect of upper-level diffluence.  
There is considerable spread in the model intensity guidance, 
ranging from minimal to major hurricane status before landfall on 
the northeast Gulf coast.  The official intensity forecast is a 
little higher than the previous one, and remains near the higher 
end of the guidance.  Given the uncertainties, users should monitor 
future NHC forecasts for possible changes in the predicted strength 
of Idalia, and prepare for possible significant impacts within the 
hurricane and storm surge watch areas.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Idalia is forecast to become a hurricane over the eastern Gulf of 
Mexico, and there is an increasing risk of life-threatening storm 
surge and hurricane-force winds along portions of the west coast of 
Florida and the Florida Panhandle beginning as early as Tuesday.  
Although it is too soon to specify the exact location and magnitude 
of these impacts, residents in these areas should monitor updates to 
the forecast and follow any advice given by local officials.  Storm 
surge and hurricane watches have been issued for portions of the 
west coast of Florida and the coast of the Florida Panhandle, and 
residents in these areas should monitor updates to the forecast and 
follow any advice given by local officials.

2. Scattered flash and urban flooding can be expected across 
portions of the west coast of Florida, the Florida Panhandle and 
portions of the Southeast U.S. by Tuesday into Thursday.  Flooding 
from heavy rainfall is likely over portions of the southeast U.S. by 
mid to late week. 

3. Heavy rainfall from Tropical Storm Idalia is expected across 
portions of the eastern Yucatan and western Cuba and may produce 
areas of flash and urban flooding as well as landslides across 
western Cuba. 

4. Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the 
Yucatan Peninsula and extreme western Cuba with tropical storm 
conditions possible on the Isle of Youth.
