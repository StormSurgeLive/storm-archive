DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Idalia was
located near latitude 32.7 North, longitude 80.9 West.  Idalia is 
moving toward the northeast near 21 mph (33 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue through tonight.  A generally 
eastward motion is forecast to begin on Thursday and continue 
through Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of Idalia will 
move near or along the coast of South Carolina through tonight, and 
then just offshore of the coast of North Carolina on Thursday.  
Idalia will then move eastward over the western Atlantic into the 
weekend.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Some additional weakening is forecast through 
tonight, but Idalia is expected to remain a tropical storm while it 
moves near the coasts of South Carolina and North Carolina.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
from the center.  A sustained wind of 39 mph (63 km/h) and a gust 
to 50 mph (80 km/h) were recently reported at Folly South End, 
South Carolina, near Charleston.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 985 mb (29.09 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml

STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Savannah River to South Santee River, SC...3-5 ft
Saint Catherines Sound, GA to Savannah River...2-4 ft
Beaufort Inlet, NC to Ocracoke Inlet, NC...2-4 ft
Neuse and Bay Rivers...2-4 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...2-4 ft
South Santee River, SC to Beaufort Inlet, NC...1-3 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...1-3 ft
Tampa Bay...1-3 ft
Charlotte Harbor...1-3 ft
Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL to Saint Catherines Sound, GA...1-3
ft
Ocracoke Inlet, NC to Duck, NC...1-3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring within the tropical
storm warning area along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina, 
and will spread across coastal sections of North Carolina tonight 
through Thursday.

RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce a swath of 4 to 8 inches of
rainfall with isolated maxima up to 10 inches from east-central
Georgia through central to eastern South Carolina and eastern North
Carolina into Thursday.  These rainfall amounts will lead to areas
of flash, urban, and moderate river flooding, with considerable
impacts.  The trailing moisture band from Idalia has the potential
to produce additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches across the
west coast of Florida.

SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia along the eastern and central Gulf
coast will subside tonight and Thursday.  Swells will affect the
southeastern U.S. coast during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes will be possible through this evening
across coastal South Carolina and through tonight across southern
coastal North Carolina.
