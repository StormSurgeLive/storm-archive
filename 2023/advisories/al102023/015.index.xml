Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Wed Aug 30 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Franklin, located a few hundred miles west of Bermuda, on Hurricane <br/>
Idalia, located over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, and on <br/>
Tropical Depression Eleven, located several hundred miles <br/>
east-southeast of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave located <br/>
near the Cabo Verde Islands is producing an area of disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms. Environmental conditions appear <br/>
conducive for gradual development of this system, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form later this week while the system <br/>
initially moves west-northwestward and then turns northwestward <br/>
across the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (Remnants of Gert):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a trough of low pressure <br/>
(the remnants of Gert) are located several hundred miles to the <br/>
north of the northern Leeward Islands. Environmental conditions do <br/>
not appear to be that favorable for additional development over the <br/>
next couple of days as the system drifts slowly northward or north- <br/>
northeastward.  Upper-level winds are forecast to become unfavorable <br/>
for development by the weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Eleven Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112023
500 AM AST Wed Aug 30 2023
 
The depression re-developed a larger area of deep convection early
this morning, with signs of lightning activity associated with that
convection in GLM data. While this will allow the depression to
maintain its classification as a tropical cyclone for a while
longer, satellite intensity estimates from SAB and TAFB still only
support an intensity of around 30 kt.
 
The depression continues to meander, having drifted eastward for
the past several hours.  It is still expected to turn generally
northward later today, albeit at a very slow pace. Models suggest
it could finally begin to accelerate northward by Thursday, but
this acceleration will likely cause the system to open into a
trough. The NHC track forecast remains near the multi-model
consensus.
 
There has been no change to the intensity forecast thinking. The 
depression still has another day or so to briefly strengthen and 
become a very short-lived tropical storm, but most of the intensity 
guidance does not support that scenario. Instead, it is becoming 
more likely that the depression will succumb to a combination of dry 
air and shear and become a post-tropical remnant low in another day 
or so. The NHC forecast is near the middle of the intensity guidance 
envelope.

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  39
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 AM AST Wed Aug 30 2023
 
Franklin has a large eye this morning since completing its eyewall
replacement cycle yesterday. The estimated diameter from satellite
data is about 50 n mi. With that said, there are some subtle signs
that vertical wind shear over the system has begun to increase.  The
hurricane's outflow has become restricted in the western side of the
storm, related to the outflow of Idalia spreading quickly towards
it. Intensity estimates have been gradually decreasing, and the
initial intensity was lowered to 95 kt this advisory. This intensity
lies roughly in between the higher TAFB and lower SAB subjective
estimates, and is very close to the most recent ADT and D-MINT
estimates provided by UW-CIMSS.
 
Franklin appears to be accelerating ever so slightly to the
northeast, with the motion of its large eye estimated at 040/11 kt.
This motion is expected to continue today with a turn to the
east-northeast in about 24-36 h. However, once again the guidance
this cycle has trended much slower compared to the previous
one. The ECMWF, which had been on the slow and south end of the
guidance envelope for days now, related to it missing the
mid-latitude trough capture, is no longer alone, with the latest GFS
forecast substantially slower and also missing an initial trough
capture. The track forecast has thus been slowed down again from the
prior cycle, but since most of this track adjustment was in the
along- and not across-track direction, it actually lies pretty much
on top of the prior NHC track, just slower. This current forecast
may need to be adjusted further in subsequent cycles, as suggested
by the TVCA and HCCA consensus aids. Even though the center of
Franklin is still forecast to pass to the northwest of Bermuda later
today, the large area of tropical-storm-force winds associated with
the hurricane to its southeast are expected to extend near or over
the island, where a tropical storm warning remains in place.
 
Intensity-wise, Franklin should gradually weaken early on, while
shear remains fairly low, but then more quickly as northwesterly
shear increases to between 20-30 kt from 24-48 h. Based on the
latest forecast track, it may take a bit longer for Franklin to
become an extratropical cyclone, and this is now delayed to day 4 in
the latest NHC intensity forecast. This intensity forecast is in
best agreement with the HCCA consensus aid.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda this morning,
when Franklin is forecast to make its closest approach to the
island.
 
2. Life-threatening surf and rip currents are occurring along the
east coast of the United States. These conditions are expected to
continue during the next several days.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Idalia was located
by Tallahassee radar near latitude 29.1 North, longitude 84.1 West.
Idalia is moving toward the north-northeast near 18 mph (30 km/h).
A north-northeastward motion is expected through the morning, with
Idalia's center forecast to reach the Big Bend coast of Florida this
morning. After landfall, Idalia is forecast to turn toward the
northeast and east-northeast, moving near or along the coasts of
Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina late today and Thursday.
 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft data indicate that maximum sustained winds
have increased to near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher gusts.
Idalia is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane
Wind Scale.  Idalia could continue to strengthen before it
reaches the Big Bend coast of Florida in a few hours.  While
Idalia should weaken after landfall, it is likely to still be a
hurricane while moving across southern Georgia, and near the coast
of Georgia or southern South Carolina late today.  Idalia should
emerge off the southeastern United States coast early on Thursday
and move eastward through late week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 940 mb (27.76 inches) 
based on aircraft data.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Wakulla/Jefferson County, FL to Yankeetown, FL...12-16 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Wakulla/Jefferson County, FL...8-12 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...7-11 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...6-9 ft
Carrabelle, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...5-8 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...4-6 ft
Tampa Bay...4-6 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Carrabelle, FL...3-5 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...3-5 ft
Saint Catherines Sound, GA to South Santee River, SC...3-5 ft
Englewood, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...2-4 ft
Beaufort Inlet, NC to Ocracoke Inlet, NC...2-4 ft
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to Saint Catherines Sound, GA...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
Neuse and Bay Rivers...2-4 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...2-4 ft
Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL to Mouth of the St. Mary's 
River...1-3 ft
Mexico Beach, FL to Indian Pass, FL...1-3 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...1-3 ft
South Santee River, SC to Beaufort Inlet, NC...1-3 ft
Ocracoke Inlet, NC to Duck, NC...1-3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area in Florida soon, with tropical storm conditions
spreading northward and westward through this morning.
 
Tropical storm conditions will continue within the tropical storm
warning area along the Florida Gulf and west coasts.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in the Hurricane Warning area
along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina later today and
tonight.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch area along
the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina later today and tonight.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin later today in the
warning area along the east coast of Florida, Georgia, and South
Carolina, and spread into North Carolina tonight and Thursday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce a swath of 4 to 8 inches of
rainfall with isolated maxima up to 12 inches from the Florida Big
Bend through central Georgia and South Carolina, and through eastern
North Carolina into Thursday. These rainfall amounts will lead to
areas of flash, urban, and moderate river flooding, with
considerable impacts.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia are affecting the southwestern
coast of Florida and will spread northward and westward to the
north-central Gulf coast through today.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible this morning across
west-central and northern Florida into southeast Georgia, with the
tornado risk shifting toward the coastal Carolinas this afternoon
and tonight.

Hurricane Idalia Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
500 AM EDT Wed Aug 30 2023
 
Idalia continues to undergo rapid intensification.  Maximum
flight-level winds were 123 kt, with believable SFMR values of 115
kt.  Satellite images show a small eye surrounded by very cold
clouds tops, especially in the western quadrant.  The initial wind
speed is set to 115 kt, making Idalia an extremely dangerous
category 4 hurricane.
 
The hurricane still has a few hours left to intensify before it
makes landfall. The biggest change to the intensity forecast is to
increase the wind speeds over southeastern Georgia and South
Carolina as the rapid motion and track close to the coast is
expected to keep the system near hurricane strength for longer.
Thus a Hurricane Warning has been issued for a portion of those
coasts, and the Hurricane Watch is extended northeastward.  After
the hurricane moves offshore, the wind field on the northwestern
side near eastern North Carolina is expected to be enhanced by a
cold front, and the Tropical Storm Watch has been upgraded to a
Tropical Storm Warning in that area.  The long-range intensity
forecast is quite uncertain with Idalia taking on some hybrid
characteristics due to a baroclinc trough. No changes were made at
this time, and the forecast remains close to the consensus.
 
Idalia is moving faster toward the north-northeast or 025/16 kt.
After landfall, Idalia is expected to move near or along the coast
of Georgia and the Carolinas in 24-36 hours.  Uncertainty in the
track forecast beyond 48 hours remains quite large, and the latest
guidance is significantly faster.  The new forecast is adjusted
toward the consensus, but could be too slow at long range.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Catastrophic impacts from storm surge inundation of 12 to 16 feet
above ground level and destructive waves are expected somewhere
between the Wakulla/Jefferson County line and Yankeetown, Florida.
Life-threatening storm surge inundation is likely elsewhere along
portions of the Florida Gulf Coast where a Storm Surge Warning is in
effect. Residents in these areas should follow any advice given by
local officials.
 
2. Destructive life-threatening winds will occur where the core of
Idalia moves onshore in the Big Bend region of Florida, with
hurricane conditions expected elsewhere in portions of the Hurricane
Warning area along the Florida Gulf Coast. Strong winds will also
spread inland across portions of northern Florida and southern
Georgia near the track of the center of Idalia where Hurricane
Warnings are in effect. Residents in these areas should be prepared
for long-duration power outages. Damaging hurricane-force winds are
likely in portions of eastern Georgia and southeastern South
Carolina where Hurricane Warnings are now in effect.
 
3. Areas of flash, urban, and moderate river flooding, with
considerable impacts, are expected from the Florida Big Ben through,
central Georgia and South Carolina, through eastern North Carolina
into Thursday.
