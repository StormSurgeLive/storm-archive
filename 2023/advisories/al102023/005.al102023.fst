DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Idalia was
located near latitude 20.1 North, longitude 85.5 West.  Idalia is
moving toward the northeast near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A slow, possibly 
erratic, motion is expected overnight.  A generally northward to 
north-northeastward motion at an increasing forward speed is 
expected on Monday and Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center 
will move over the eastern Gulf of Mexico on Monday and Tuesday,  
and approach the northeast Gulf coast late Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Strengthening is forecast, and Idalia is expected to become a 
hurricane over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico by early Tuesday.  
Additional strengthening is likely while Idalia approaches the 
northeastern Gulf coast.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Aucilla River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...7-11 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...5-8 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Aucilla River, FL...4-7 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...3-5 ft
Tampa Bay...3-5 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...2-4 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...1-3 ft
Florida Keys...1-2 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of 
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and 
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative 
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over 
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see 
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast 
office.

Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above 
normal tide levels along the southern coast of Pinar del Rio, Cuba.  
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large waves.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
warning area over the Yucatan Peninsula and western Cuba through 
Monday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch 
area on the Isle of Youth on Monday.

Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area by
late Tuesday or Wednesday, with tropical storm conditions possible 
by Tuesday.

Tropical storm conditions are possible in the Dry Tortugas beginning 
late Monday and within the tropical storm watch area along the 
Florida Gulf coast on Tuesday.

RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts:

Portions of the eastern Yucatan Peninsula: 2 to 4 inches, with
isolated higher totals of 6 inches.

Western Cuba: 3 to 6 inches, with isolated higher totals of 10
inches.

Portions of the west coast of Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and
southern Georgia: From Tuesday into Wednesday, 3 to 6 inches, with
isolated higher totals of 10 inches.

Heavy rainfall is also likely to spread into portions of the
Carolinas by Wednesday into Thursday.

This rainfall may lead to flash and urban flooding, and landslides
across western Cuba.  Scattered flash and urban flooding can also
be expected across portions of the west coast of Florida, the
Florida Panhandle and portions of the Southeast U.S. by Tuesday
into Thursday.
