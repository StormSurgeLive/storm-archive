200 PM EDT Sat Sep 2 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Post-Tropical <br/>
Cyclone Idalia, located just to the east-southeast of Bermuda, on <br/>
Tropical Storm Gert, located about 700 miles east-southeast of <br/>
Bermuda, and on Tropical Storm Katia, located about 700 miles <br/>

Tropical Storm Gert Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
1100 AM AST Sat Sep 02 2023

Gert is one tough little cyclone.  Satellite images indicate that 
deep convection continues near the center of the storm, despite 
northerly shear, and microwave data from this morning shows healthy 
banding structure.  A scatterometer pass from 1259 UTC shows peak 
winds of just over 40 kt, which supports at least 45 kt due to the 
small size of Gert.  The initial wind speed is raised to 45 kt, 
which also matches the latest TAFB Dvorak value and the UW-CIMSS 
SATCON estimate.

The storm is moving a bit faster to the north-northeast this 
morning, roughly 3 kt, as it begins to feel the steering from 
Idalia to the west-northwest.  Gert should accelerate north- 
northeastward later today and turn northward tomorrow around the 
eastern side of Idalia's large circulation.  All of the global 
models open Gert up into a trough of low pressure by 48 h due to 
rapidly increasing forward motion around Idalia, and the official 
forecast follows suit.  Little change in strength is expected with 
Gert before it dissipates, although this system has been more 
resilient to shear than most small tropical cyclones.  No 
significant changes were made to the previous NHC track forecast, 
with a small upward adjustment to the intensity forecast based on 
the initial value.

<title>Tropical Storm Katia Forecast Discussion Number 5</title>

Tropical Storm Katia Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122023
200 PM CVT Sat Sep 02 2023

Satellite images indicate the center of Katia is on the southern 
side of a large central dense overcast.  Scatterometer data from 
this morning indicated maximum winds were at least 40-45 kt, and 
the latest TAFB Dvorak estimate was 45 kt.  The initial wind speed 
is raised to 45 kt from the last full advisory, similar to the 
morning update statement.

Katia continues moving north-northwestward, or 330/10 kt.  The 
motion should gradually bend toward the northwest today due to the 
storm moving between a large middle- to upper-level low to the west 
and a narrow mid-latitude ridge over the eastern Atlantic.  The 
northwestward motion is likely to continue until about Monday, when 
the system becomes weaker and Katia gets stuck in the low-level 
subtropical ridge.  The only notable change to the track forecast is 
that it has been adjusted to the east in the short-term due to the 
initial position and is very close to the previous one at the end.

The storm is probably near its peak intensity with all models 
showing an increase in dry mid-level air near the center later 
today.  Combined with moderate southerly shear, this should be 
enough to choke off deep convection in Katia's core and cause 
gradual weakening.  In about 2 days, the environment becomes quite 
dry, which should finish off any remaining thunderstorm activity, 
and Katia is forecast to degenerate into a remnant low at that time. 
The NHC intensity forecast is raised early on to reflect the higher 
initial wind speed and is blended back with the guidance by the end 
of the forecast period.

LAST NHC ADVISORY...
...DANGEROUS SURF AND RIP CURRENTS FROM IDALIA EXPECTED TO
CONTINUE ALONG THE U.S. EAST COAST THROUGH LABOR DAY WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...32.0N 62.7W
ABOUT 125 MI...200 KM E OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 75 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...997 MB...29.44 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Bermuda Weather Service has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warning for Bermuda.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia
was located near latitude 32.0 North, longitude 62.7 West.  Idalia 
is moving toward the east-northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue through tonight.  A turn 
toward the northeast and then north at a faster forward speed is 
expected through early next week.  Idalia will continue moving away 
from Bermuda tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Gusts to tropical storm force are likely to continue on
Bermuda through tonight.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia will affect the southeastern U.S.
coast and Bermuda during the next couple of days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
500 PM AST Sat Sep 02 2023
 
Winds on Bermuda have been gradually decreasing since earlier this 
morning, and weather stations on the island are no longer measuring 
sustained tropical-storm-force winds (at standard elevation).  
Gusts to tropical storm force will likely continue on Bermuda into 
tonight while Idalia pulls away from the island, but the Bermuda 
Weather Service has elected to discontinue the Tropical Storm 
Warning in favor of local warnings.  Therefore, this will be the 
last NHC advisory on Idalia.

Earlier ASCAT showed that maximum winds remain 50 kt on the 
northwestern side of the attached frontal boundary.  Little change 
in strength is expected during the next few days.  The 
extratropical cyclone is likely to occlude again in about 3 days 
and begin to fill, at which point weakening is expected.  The NHC 
intensity forecast is between the HCCA and IVCN consensus aids.

Idalia appears to have turned toward the east-northeast, or 075/6 
kt.  A shortwave trough is expected to move off the coast of New 
England on Sunday, causing the cyclone to turn northeastward and 
the northward and speed up over the next 2-3 days.  Once it 
occludes, it is expected to slow down and meander to the southeast 
of Nova Scotia on days 4 and 5.

Additional information on this system can be found in High Seas
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Swells from Idalia are forecast to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions along portions of the east coast of the
United States through Labor Day weekend.

2. Gusts to tropical storm force are likely to continue on Bermuda 
through tonight.
