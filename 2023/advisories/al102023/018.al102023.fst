DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Idalia was
located near latitude 33.0 North, longitude 80.0 West.  Idalia is
moving toward the northeast near 21 mph (33 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue through tonight.  An eastward to 
east-southeastward motion is forecast to begin on Thursday and 
continue through Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Idalia will move near or along the coast of South Carolina through 
tonight, and then just offshore of the coast of North Carolina on 
Thursday.  Idalia will then move over the western Atlantic into the 
weekend.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast during the 
next 48 hours, and Idalia is expected to remain a tropical storm 
when if moves off the coast.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km) 
from the center.  A sustained wind of 48 mph (78 km/h) and a gust to 
58 mph (94 km/h) were recently reported from saildrone SD-1045 which 
is located off the South Carolina coast. 

The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml

STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Beaufort Inlet, NC to Ocracoke Inlet, NC...2-4 ft
Savannah River to South Santee River, SC...2-4 ft
Neuse and Bay Rivers...2-4 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...2-4 ft
South Santee River, SC to Beaufort Inlet, NC...1-3 ft
Ocracoke Inlet, NC to Duck, NC...1-3 ft
Altamaha Sound, GA to Savannah River...1-3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring within the tropical
storm warning area along the coast of South Carolina, and will 
spread across coastal sections of North Carolina tonight through 
Thursday.

RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce a storm total of 4 to 8 
inches of rainfall with isolated maxima up to 10 inches from eastern 
South Carolina through eastern North Carolina into Thursday.  These 
rainfall amounts will continue to lead to areas of flash, urban, and 
moderate river flooding, with considerable impacts.  The trailing 
moisture band from Idalia may produce an additional 1 to 2 inches of 
rainfall over the central Florida Peninsula into Thursday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia along the eastern and central Gulf
coast will continue to subside tonight and Thursday.  Swells will 
affect the southeastern U.S. coast during the next few days.  These 
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

TORNADOES:  A couple of tornadoes will be possible through daybreak 
Thursday across coastal North Carolina.
