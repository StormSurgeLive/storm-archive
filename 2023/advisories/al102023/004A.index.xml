LOCATION...25.9N 70.0W
ABOUT 320 MI...515 KM NNE OF GRAND TURK ISLAND
ABOUT 535 MI...855 KM SW OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...100 MPH...155 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 330 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...970 MB...28.65 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Franklin was 
located near latitude 25.9 North, longitude 70.0 West. Franklin is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). This motion 
will continue through tonight, followed by a northward and 
north-northeastward motion into the early part of the week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast, and Franklin is 
forecast to become a major hurricane on Monday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 970 mb (28.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Franklin are expected to begin affecting 
Bermuda by tonight. These swells are also likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions through the 
beginning of this week along portions of the east coast of the 
United States. Please consult products from your local weather 
office.

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 PM AST Sun Aug 27 2023

Visible and infrared satellite imagery has improved slightly since 
this morning, with a tight inner core developing around the center. 
There have been hints of an eye developing in infrared and visible 
images throughout the day, but the eye remains cloud filled. 
Franklin is still dealing with a little bit of drier mid-level dry 
air trying to wrap into the eastern side. Subjective and objective 
Dvorak estimates have remained steady throughout the day today. With 
these estimates combined with the lower surface pressure reported by 
the aircraft, the initial intensity remains at 85 kt this advisory. 
The Air Force Hurricane Hunters will be investigating the system 
later this evening.
 
Environmental conditions are fairly favorable for the next few days, 
with very warm sea surface temperatures and vertical wind shear 
forecast to decrease. Steady to rapid strengthening is forecast, and 
Franklin could become a major hurricane on Monday. In about 3 to 4 
days, weakening is forecast as Franklin encounters increased shear 
and moves over cooler SSTs. The wind field of Franklin is forecast 
to increase in size as it moves into the mid-latitudes.
 
Franklin is moving northwestward at 8 kt, around a broad 
high-pressure ridge to the east of Franklin. This ridge will steer 
the system more north-northwestward and northward over the next 
couple of days. In the longer range of the forecast period, a deep 
trough is expected to move off the U.S. east coast, and most of the 
guidance has Franklin becoming captured in the southwesterly flow, 
with an increase in forward motion to the northeast. The official 
NHC forecast track lies near the model consensus aids, with only 
slight adjustments to the previous advisory. The NHC forecast track 
still has the core of Franklin passing west and north of Bermuda, 
but interests there should continue to monitor the latest NHC 
forecasts. By day 5, Franklin may begin to interact with the upper 
trough and begin an extratropical transition, although that is not 
explicitly forecast.

located near latitude 20.0 North, longitude 85.8 West.  Idalia is 
moving toward the north near 2 mph (4 km/h), and it is likely to 
meander near the Yucatan Channel through tonight. A faster motion 
toward the north is expected on Monday, bringing the system over the 
eastern Gulf of Mexico.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast, and Idalia is expected to 
become a hurricane by Tuesday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC.

Tropical Depression Ten Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
1000 AM CDT Sun Aug 27 2023
 
So far this morning, the overall cloud pattern of the tropical
cyclone has not become significantly better organized.  The small
center is partially exposed on GOES-16 visible imagery, and
convective banding features are still not very well defined.  The 
current intensity is held at 30 kt for this advisory which is in 
line with the latest Dvorak Satellite estimates.  A NOAA Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft, flying at around 12000 ft, is near the center of 
the system taking Doppler radar wind velocity measurements.  These 
data should provide valuable information on the structure of the 
cyclone for initializing the numerical weather prediction models.
  
The center of the cyclone appears to have been moving in a small
clockwise loop overnight and into this morning, and it will
probably complete this loop today.  The initial motion estimate is
now around 090/2 kt.  Steering currents should remain weak through
today and tonight.  Beginning on Monday, a mid-level ridge starts to
build near southern Florida and eastward.  This evolution should
cause a generally northward motion during the next couple of days.
In 48 to 72 hours, a mid-level trough dropping into the eastern U.S.
will likely induce a turn toward the north-northeast and take the
system across the northeast Gulf of Mexico coast on Wednesday.  The
official forecast track has been nudged to the right of the
previous one, but is not quite as far east as the latest corrected
consensus, HCCA, prediction.  Users are reminded not to focus on
the exact forecast track, since strong winds, heavy rains and
dangerous storm surges extend well away from the center.

The cyclone will be moving over waters of high oceanic heat content 
over the eastern Gulf of Mexico and within a moist mid- to 
low-level air mass for the next few days.  An upper-tropospheric 
trough is predicted to develop over the western Gulf of Mexico in 48 
to 72 hours.  Although this feature could produce some moderate 
southwesterly vertical wind shear over the system,  positive 
vorticity advection and diffluent upper-level flow to the east of 
the trough will likely be conducive for strengthening.  The 
official forecast, like the previous one, calls for the cyclone to 
reach hurricane status over the eastern Gulf of Mexico in 48 to 72 
hours.  This is at the high end of the latest intensity model 
guidance.
  
 
KEY MESSAGES:

1. The depression is forecast to become a hurricane over the eastern 
Gulf of Mexico, and there is an increasing risk of life-threatening 
storm surge, flooding from heavy rainfall, and hurricane-force winds 
along portions of the west coast of Florida and the Florida 
Panhandle beginning as early as  Tuesday.  Although it is too soon 
to specify the exact location and magnitude of these impacts, 
residents in these areas should monitor updates to the forecast, 
have their hurricane plan in place, and follow any advice given by 
local officials.  Storm surge and hurricane watches may be required 
for portions of the Gulf coast of Florida later today.

2. Heavy rainfall is expected across the eastern Yucatan Peninsula 
and western Cuba and may produce areas of flash and urban flooding 
and landslides across western Cuba.  The depression is forecast to 
become a tropical storm later today, and tropical storm conditions 
are expected over portions of the Yucatan Peninsula and extreme 
western Cuba with tropical storm conditions possible on the Isle of 
Youth. 

3. Scattered flooding from heavy rainfall is likely over in 
portions of the southeast U.S. by mid to late week.
