BULLETIN
Hurricane Franklin Advisory Number  31
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 AM EDT Mon Aug 28 2023
 
...FRANKLIN BECOMES THE FIRST MAJOR HURRICANE OF THE 2023
ATLANTIC HURRICANE SEASON...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM EDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...27.2N 70.8W
ABOUT 395 MI...635 KM N OF GRAND TURK ISLAND
ABOUT 505 MI...810 KM SW OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...115 MPH...185 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 335 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...956 MB...28.23 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of this system.
Watches will likely be required for Bermuda later today.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Franklin was
located near latitude 27.2 North, longitude 70.8 West. Franklin is
moving toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A gradual
turn toward the north and north-northeast with a slightly faster
forward speed is expected during the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 115 mph (185 km/h) 
with higher gusts. This makes Franklin a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Some additional strengthening 
is forecast today, but gradual weakening is expected to begin by 
Tuesday afternoon. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 956 mb (28.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Franklin are beginning to affect Bermuda.
These swells are expected to spread toward the east coast of the
United States during the next couple of days, likely resulting in
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  31
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 AM EDT Mon Aug 28 2023

Franklin has continued to improve in organization during the 
overnight hours. The eye noted in the previous advisory has 
occasionally cleared out on infrared satellite imagery, with the 
cold eyewall temperatures surrounding it cooling to between -65 to 
-75 C in a thick region around the center. Subjective Dvorak 
classifications were both T5.5/102 kt from TAFB and SAB, while 
UW-CIMSS ADT estimates are now as high as T5.7/107 kt. The initial 
intensity was raised to 100 kt at 06 UTC, and that will remain the 
intensity at 09 UTC. While this may be slightly conservative, 
earlier aircraft data showed that the maximum winds were lagging the 
satellite presentation and minimum pressure of the hurricane. This 
intensity still makes Franklin the first major hurricane of the 2023 
Atlantic hurricane season. Another Air Force Reconnaissance mission 
will be in the hurricane this morning to provide an updated 
assessment of the storm.

The hurricane continues to make a gradual turn northward, with the 
latest motion estimate still north-northwest at 335/7 kt. Over the 
next 48 hours the hurricane should continue to turn northward and 
then north-eastward as it rounds the western periphery of a 
subtropical ridge, and very little change was made to the NHC track 
over this time period. After 48 hours, there continues to be 
significant spread, especially in the along-track direction, related 
to how much a mid-latitude trough ejecting out of Canada is able to 
capture the hurricane. The big change this forecast cycle is that 
the ECMWF has come on board showing a trough capture, though it 
still remains slower than the majority of the guidance suite. The 
latest NHC track forecast has thus been adjusted a bit north and is 
quite a bit faster after 48 hours, but is not quite as fast as the 
TCVN and HCCA consensus aids over this period. 

Some additional intensification is anticipated today, as Franklin 
remains in a low shear environment and is over warm 29-30 C 
sea-surface temperatures. The latest intensity forecast still peaks 
Franklin as a Category 4 (115-kt) major hurricane. However, 
inner-core changes, such as eyewall replacement cycles, could occur 
at any time, making it somewhat tricky to pinpoint exactly when 
Franklin will reach peak intensity. After 24 hours, the broadening 
wind field and relatively slow storm motion could make the hurricane 
prone to some local upwelling. In addition, some northwesterly 
shear may also begin to affect the storm. Toward the end of the 
forecast period, more dramatic weakening is possible as the storm 
gets swept up in the mid-latitudes. The latest forecast shows the 
storm becoming a post-tropical extratropical cyclone in 120 h, 
though this could occur sooner than forecasted if the faster 
solutions, like the GFS, pan out.  

The current forecast shows the core of Franklin passing west and 
north of Bermuda in about 60 h, but a tropical storm watch may still 
become necessary later today as its expanding 34-kt wind field to 
the southeast does get close to the island after 48 hours.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Idalia was
located near latitude 20.6 North, longitude 85.2 West. Idalia is
moving toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A northward motion 
is expected through tonight, followed by a faster north-northeast 
motion on Tuesday and Wednesday. On the forecast track, the center 
of Idalia is forecast to pass near or over western Cuba tonight, 
over the extreme southeastern Gulf of Mexico by early Tuesday, and 
reach the Gulf coast of Florida on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Idalia is forecast to become a hurricane later today and a 
dangerous major hurricane over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico by 
early Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The latest minimum central pressure estimated from data from an Air 
Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft is 989 mb (29.21 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Aucilla River, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...7-11 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...6-9 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Aucilla River, FL...4-7 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...4-7 ft
Tampa Bay...4-7 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...3-5 ft
Englewood, FL to Chokoloskee, FL...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...2-4 ft
Chokoloskee, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...1-3 ft
Florida Keys...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet above
normal tide levels along the southern coast of Pinar del Rio, Cuba.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area in western Cuba later today.  Winds are expected to
first reach tropical storm strength by this morning, making
outside preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to
protect life and property should be rushed to completion.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
tropical storm warning area over the Yucatan Peninsula and the Isle
of Youth in Cuba through today
 
Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area by
late Tuesday or Wednesday, with tropical storm conditions possible
by Tuesday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the Dry Tortugas beginning
late today and within the tropical storm watch area along the
Florida Gulf coast on Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce the following rainfall
amounts:
 
Portions of the eastern Yucatan: Additional 1 to 2 inches.
 
Western Cuba: 4 to 7 inches, with isolated higher totals of 10
inches.
 
Portions of the west coast of Florida, the Florida Panhandle,
southeast Georgia and the eastern Carolinas: 4 to 8 inches from
Tuesday into Thursday. Isolated higher totals of 12 inches possible,
primarily near landfall in northern Florida.
 
This rainfall may lead to flash and urban flooding, and landslides
across western Cuba.
 
Areas of flash and urban flooding, some of which may be locally
significant, are expected across portions of the west coast of
Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and southern Georgia Tuesday into
Wednesday, spreading into portions of the eastern Carolinas
Wednesday into Thursday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia are affecting portions of the
southern coast of Cuba and eastern Yucatan.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Tropical Storm Idalia Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Tropical Storm Idalia Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
400 AM CDT Mon Aug 28 2023

Idalia has intensified overnight.  Data from an Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft showed believable surface winds of 50-55 
kt and a central pressure falling to around 989 mb.  The wind data 
is also confirmed by NOAA buoy 42056, located just southeast of 
the center, which has reported maximum 1-minute adjusted sustained 
winds above 50 kt within the past hour or two. These data support 
raising the initial wind speed to 55 kt.

It seems like Idalia is finally on the move, with aircraft fixes 
indicating a northward motion of about 6 kt.  This motion should 
continue through Tuesday as Idalia moves between a mid-level trough 
over the central Gulf of Mexico and a strengthening ridge over the 
Greater Antilles.  The storm is likely to move faster to the 
north-northeast and northeast by early Wednesday due to a deeper 
trough that is expected to swing across the mid-western United 
States.  The new NHC track forecast is quite close to the last one 
with little significant changes to the track guidance.  It should be 
emphasized that only a small deviation in the track could cause a 
big change in Idalia's landfall location in Florida due to the 
paralleling track to the west coast of the state.
 
The center of Idalia is on the northern edge of the deep convective 
mass, a refection of moderate northwesterly shear, and the last 
aircraft pass showed a vortex tilted southward with height.  This 
shear and structure should persist for about the next 24 hours, 
helping to keep the intensity of the storm from increasing too 
quickly despite the extremely warm waters it will be traversing.  
The NHC short-term forecast will continue to indicate Idalia as a 
hurricane near western Cuba, similar to the guidance.  

Over the Gulf of Mexico, the environment is forecast to become 
conducive for significant strengthening of Idalia due to a new 
trough dropping south over the western Gulf of Mexico as a 
upper-level ridge builds near the cyclone.  Additionally, Idalia 
will be moving over waters near 31C, and some of the guidance is 
even indicating favorable jet dynamics on Wednesday with Idalia in 
the right-rear quadrant of the jet over the southeastern United 
States.  The bottom line is that rapid intensification is becoming 
increasingly likely before landfall, and the NHC forecast now 
explicitly indicates it between 24-48 h in the forecast.  This is 
consistent with almost all of the regional hurricane models and the 
SHIPS rapid intensification indices, which are 5-10 times the 
climatological mean.  The new prediction shows a 100-kt hurricane 
over the eastern Gulf of Mexico at 48 hours, but Idalia should keep 
strengthening up to landfall along the Gulf coast of Florida.  
Interests within the storm surge and hurricane watch areas are urged 
to prepare for possible significant impacts and monitor future 
updates to the forecast for this increasingly dangerous situation.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Idalia is now forecast to become a major hurricane before it 
reaches the Gulf coast of Florida.  The risk continues to increase 
for life-threatening storm surge and dangerous hurricane-force 
winds along portions of the west coast of Florida and the Florida 
Panhandle beginning as early as late Tuesday.  Storm surge and 
hurricane watches are in effect for portions of the west coast of 
Florida and the coast of the Florida Panhandle, and residents in 
these areas should monitor updates to the forecast and follow any 
advice given by local officials.
 
2. Areas of flash and urban flooding, some of which may be locally 
significant, are expected across portions of the west coast of 
Florida, the Florida Panhandle, and southern Georgia Tuesday into 
Wednesday, spreading into portions of the eastern Carolinas 
Wednesday into Thursday.
 
3. Hurricane-force winds are expected across portions of far
western Cuba later today.  Heavy rainfall is also expected across
portions of western Cuba and may produce areas of flash and urban 
flooding as well as landslides across western Cuba.
