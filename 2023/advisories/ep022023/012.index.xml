900 AM MDT Sat Jul 01 2023
 
...ADRIAN NOW A TROPICAL STORM...
...CENTER TO PASS NEAR OR OVER CLARION ISLAND THIS MORNING...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM MDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.4N 114.5W
ABOUT 430 MI...690 KM SW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...994 MB...29.36 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Adrian was 
located near latitude 18.4 North, longitude 114.5 West. Adrian is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h). This general 
motion is expected to continue within a gradual turn toward the west 
during the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Steady to rapid weakening is expected during the next couple 
of days, and Adrian is forecast to weaken to a tropical depression 
early Sunday and become a post-tropical remnant low soon thereafter.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) 
from the center. A Mexican navy automated weather station on Clarion 
Island recently reported a sustained wind of 34 mph (55 km/h) and a 
gust of 49 mph (79 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Adrian are affecting portions of the
southern Baja California peninsula. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM MDT.

Tropical Storm Adrian Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012023
900 AM MDT Sat Jul 01 2023
 
Adrian is rapidly weakening. The cyclone is only producing a small
area of deep convection, which is displaced to the west of its
center due to some easterly shear. The significantly degraded
satellite structure of Adrian indicates it is no longer a hurricane,
and the initial intensity is lowered to 55 kt based on the latest
Dvorak data-T numbers (T3.5) from TAFB and SAB. The center of Adrian
is passing very near Clarion Island, where a Mexican navy automated
weather station has reported sustained winds of 25-30 kt and gusts
of 40-50 kt during the past several hours.
 
The initial motion of Adrian is west-northwestward at 300/6 kt.
Additional weakening is expected as Adrian continues to move
generally west-northwestward toward cooler waters and into a drier,
more stable environment. As a result, simulated satellite imagery
from the global and hurricane models suggest that Adrian could
become devoid of organized convection within the next 24 h. The NHC
forecast shows Adrian weakening to a tropical depression by early
Sunday and degenerating to a remnant low soon thereafter. Then, the
shallow low should turn more westward within the low-level flow and
eventually dissipate by Tuesday. Overall, no significant changes
were made to the official forecast with this advisory.

MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...30 MPH...45 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 315 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1008 MB...29.77 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has discontinued all watches and warnings
for the west-central coast of mainland Mexico.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
Satellite-derived wind data indicate the Beatriz no longer has a 
surface circulation and has dissipated.  At 1200 PM MDT (1800 UTC), 
the remnants of Beatriz were located near latitude 20.7 North, 
longitude 106.2 West. The remnants are moving toward the northwest 
near 12 mph (19 km/h), but are expected to slow down and meander 
over the mouth of the Gulf of California during the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 30 mph (45 km/h) with 
higher gusts. 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Through Monday, storm total rainfall of 3 to 5 inches,
with maximum amounts of 8 inches, is expected across portions of
southern and western Mexico from Colima northwest to Sinaloa and
Durango in association with the remnants of Beatriz.  This rainfall 
could lead to localized flash flooding and mudslides.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Beatriz are expected to diminish along 
the southwestern coast of Mexico during the next day or so.  These 
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. 
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system.  For additional information on the remnant 
low please see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather 
Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and 
on the web at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php

<title>Remnants of Beatriz Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Tropical Storm Beatriz Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022023
1000 AM CDT Sat Jul 01 2023
 
It's a bit of a mystery if Beatriz still has a surface circulation
this morning.  Microwave data and UW-CIMSS's animated MIMIC-TC
product suggest that a center of rotation, at least in the middle
levels of the atmosphere, is now located just off the coast of Cabo
Corrientes, Mexico, and that position closely matches an
extrapolated position from previous forecasts.  The system is still
producing deep convection around this center feature, although
satellite intensity estimates have been decreasing fast.  The
initial intensity is lowered to an uncertain 45 kt.
 
Beatriz may have sped up slightly overnight, but the longer-term
motion remains northwestward (315 degrees) at 11 kt.  A weakening
mid-level ridge over northeastern Mexico should keep Beatriz on a
northwestward path, at a slower speed, during the next 24 hours.
On Sunday and Monday, the low- to mid-level steering currents
collapse, and Beatriz or its remnants are likely to drift toward
the west-northwest or meander over the mouth of the Gulf of
California.  Since many of the global models show Beatriz already
having dissipated, there were relatively few model trackers
available for this forecast.  In general, the NHC track forecast is
close to a blend of the TVCE and HCCA consensus aids.
 
With Beatriz's severely disrupted circulation and less favorable
atmospheric conditions, continued weakening is expected.  The
ECWMF, UKMET, and Canadian model fields indicate that Beatriz's
circulation may have already dissipated, while the GFS shows a
circulation winding down and dissipating in 2-3 days.  The NHC
intensity forecast shows faster weakening than the previous
prediction, with degeneration into a remnant low by 48 hours.
However, it's possible that advisories could be discontinued at any
time if we receive data that shows the circulation has dissipated
and the system is no longer producing tropical-storm-force winds.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions along the west-central coast of Mexico
are forecast to diminish this afternoon as Beatriz begins to move
away from the area.
 
2. Locally heavy rainfall is expected across southern and western
Mexico from Colima northwestward to Sinaloa and Durango.  These
rains could lead to life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides.
