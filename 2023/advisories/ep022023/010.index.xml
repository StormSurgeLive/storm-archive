WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM MDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Adrian was located 
near latitude 18.1 North, longitude 113.5 West. Adrian is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h) and this general 
motion is expected to continue during the next couple of days, 
followed by a turn toward the west on Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 90 mph (150 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast during the next 
couple of days, and Adrian is forecast to become post-tropical on 
Sunday. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 977 mb (28.85 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Adrian are affecting portions of the
west-central coast of Mexico and the southern Baja California

and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM MDT.

Hurricane Adrian Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012023
900 PM MDT Fri Jun 30 2023
 
Adrian appears to have begun its anticipated weakening trend.  The 
eye is no long apparent on geostationary satellite imagery and 
cloud top temperatures have warmed overall.  Microwave satellite 
imagery from 2037 UTC showed deep convection only to the west of 
center, implying the easterly shear has increased.  Subjective 
satellite intensity estimates have also decreased and the final 
T-numbers are at T4.5 from both TAFB and SAB.  Therefore, the 
initial intensity for this advisory has been lowered to 80 kt.

The hurricane has crossed the 26 degree C sea surface temperature 
isotherm this evening and SSTs along the track forecast are 
projected to decrease steadily.  Adrian is also moving into an dry 
and stable airmass.  Model guidance all predict steady to rapid 
weakening in the next couple of days.  The NHC intensity forecast is 
on the higher end of the model guidance and shows steady weakening.  
Adrian is expected to be a tropical storm in the next day or so and 
a post-tropical cyclone in 48 h.

Adrian is moving west-northwestward at about 7 kt.  A general 
west-northwestward motion is expected over the next couple of days 
as the storm is steered by a ridge to the northeast.  A gradual turn 
to the west is forecast as the decaying vortex is caught in the 
low-level flow.  The latest track prediction is similar to the 
previous advisory and close to the corrected consensus track 
guidance.

CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Government of Mexico has changed the Hurricane Warning to a
Tropical Storm Warning from the coast of Mexico from Manzanillo to
Cabo Corrientes, and has discontinued the Hurricane Watch for the
Pacific coast of Mexico.
 
The Government of Mexico has discontinued the Hurricane Warning for

* North of Punta Mita to San Blas Mexico
* Las Islas Marias
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the west-central coast of Mexico and in

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beatriz was
located near latitude 19.4 North, longitude 105.1 West. Beatriz is
moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h) and this general
motion with a gradual decrease in forward speed is expected through
tonight.  On the forecast track, the center of Beatriz is expected
to move near or over portions of the coast of southwestern Mexico
through this morning.  Beatriz is then expected to move away from
the west-central coast of Mexico later today into Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph (100 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Continued weakening is expected during the next
couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beatriz can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/miatcdep2.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical
storm warning area today, and are possible within the tropical
storm watch areas today or tonight.
 
RAINFALL:  Through Monday, storm total rainfall of 3 to 5 inches,
with maximum amounts of 8 inches, is expected across portions of
southern and western Mexico from Colima northwest to Sinaloa and
Durango in association with Beatriz.  This rainfall could lead to
localized flash flooding and mudslides.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds.  Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Beatriz are forecast to spread northward
along the southwestern coast of Mexico during the next day or so.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.

Tropical Storm Beatriz Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022023
400 AM CDT Sat Jul 01 2023

The center of Beatriz brushed the coast of Mexico near Punta San 
Telmo back around 0000 UTC, and since then the cyclone has steadily 
lost organization.  Earlier microwave satellite imagery shows that 
the eye has disappeared, while scatterometer and synthetic aperture 
radar data suggest that the surface circulation has become less well 
defined.  In addition, surface observations in and around Manzanillo 
have not been supportive of a well-defined circulation in the area.  
Based on these observations and an accompanying decrease in the 
satellite cloud pattern, the initial intensity is reduced to an 
uncertain 55 kt.
 
Although Beatriz will be moving away from the coast of Mexico later 
today, the dynamical models suggest that the cyclone will not 
recover from the effects of land interaction, with most of them 
forecasting the system to dissipate to 2-3 days time or less.  The 
new NHC intensity forecast is notably lower than the previous 
forecast and calls for the system to weaken to a depression by 60 h 
and dissipate soon thereafter.  There is a chance that Beatriz could 
weaken faster than currently forecast.

The initial motion is estimated at 315/11 kt as the cyclone 
continues to move along the southwest periphery of a mid-level 
ridge.  This general motion should continue during the next 12-24 
hours, taking the core of Beatriz along or just offshore of the 
coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico this morning.  After 
that time, assuming the storm survives, a slower and generally 
west-northwestward motion is expected.  The NHC track forecast is 
similar to, but a little faster than the previous forecast.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Beatriz is forecast to bring tropical storm conditions to 
portions of western Mexico today.
 
2. Locally heavy rainfall is expected across southern and western
Mexico from the state of Guerrero northwestward to the states of
Sinaloa and Durango.  These rains could lead to life-threatening
flash flooding and mudslides.
