Hurricane Adrian Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012023
900 AM MDT Thu Jun 29 2023
 
Early morning AMSR2 microwave images of Adrian revealed a 
well-defined eye signature in the 89 GHz and 37 GHz channels, 
although a slight displacement of the low- and mid-level centers 
suggests some vortex tilt with height. In conventional satellite 
imagery, the deepest inner-core convection is confined to the 
southern and eastern portions of the circulation, while cloud tops 
have recently warmed to the northwest of the center. Subjective 
Dvorak estimates from SAB and TAFB were a consensus T4.5/77 kt, and 
the initial intensity is held at 75 kt for this advisory.
 
Warm waters and relatively low vertical wind shear through this 
evening could allow for some additional strengthening. Then, Adrian 
is forecast to encounter stronger easterly shear as it moves over 
gradually cooler waters, which is likely to induce weakening by this 
weekend and early next week. The official NHC forecast lies slightly 
above the IVCN consensus aid in the near term, then shows more rapid 
weakening beyond 48 h. Unfavorable environmental conditions should 
make it difficult for Adrian to sustain organized convection beyond 
72 h, and Adrian is forecast to be a remnant low at days 4 and 5.

Adrian is moving west-northwestward at 6 kt to the south of a 
mid-level ridge that extends westward from northern Mexico. This 
general motion is expected to continue for the next several days 
with little change to the overall steering pattern. The center of 
Adrian was relocated slightly farther north based on the early 
morning microwave data, and the updated NHC forecast lies to the 
right of the previous one in the direction of the TVCE/HCCA aids. 
The latest track guidance also keeps Adrian on a more steady 
westward course through the forecast period. As a result, this 
forecast is somewhat faster than previous issuances at days 3-5.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Lazaro Cardenas to Cabo Corrientes Mexico
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Punta Maldonado to Manzanillo Mexico
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests along the west-central coast of Mexico and in the southern
portion of the Baja California peninsula should monitor the progress
of this system.  Additional warnings and watches may be required
later today or on Friday.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Two-E
was located near latitude 14.8 North, longitude 99.2 West.  The
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph.  A
west-northwestward to northwestward motion at a similar forward
speed is expected through early Saturday, followed by a decrease in
forward speed later on Saturday and Sunday.  On the forecast track,
the center of the system is expected to move parallel to and very
close to the southwestern coast of Mexico through Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts. Strengthening is forecast, and the depression is expected to
become a tropical storm later today.  The system could become a
hurricane by Friday evening.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Two-E can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO
header WTPZ42 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/miatcdep2.shtml
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch
area Friday and Saturday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in
the tropical storm warning area beginning later today and continuing
through Friday evening.
 
RAINFALL: Through Saturday, storm total rainfall of 3 to 5 inches,
with maximum amounts of 7 inches, is expected across southern Mexico
from Oaxaca west to Jalisco.  This rainfall could lead to localized
flash flooding.
 
SURF: Swells generated by the depression are forecast to build and
spread northward along the southwestern coast of Mexico during the
next couple of days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Depression Two-E Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022023
1000 AM CDT Thu Jun 29 2023
 
The depression is producing a large area of deep convection off the 
southern coast of Mexico, however microwave imagery indicates that 
the banding features are still in the process of taking shape.  
Dvorak intensity estimates are T2.5/35 kt from TAFB and T1.5/25 kt 
from SAB, therefore the initial intensity remains 30 kt for this 
advisory.

There is still a lot of uncertainty in the location of the 
depression's center, and the estimated motion (west-northwestward, 
or 300/11 kt) is primarily based on extrapolation from the previous 
advisory.  A west-northwestward to northwestward motion at a fairly 
constant speed is expected during the next 2 days or so while the 
system moves between a mid-level ridge over northern Mexico and 
Hurricane Adrian to its west.  During this period, all of the track 
guidance moves the system parallel to and within 100 n mi of the 
southwestern coast of Mexico, with the typically reliable ECMWF and 
HCCA aids, as well as the new HAFS models, leaning on the right 
side of the envelope.  The NHC track forecast is closest to those 
solutions and is very similar to the previous forecast, although it 
has been sped up a bit to account for recent model trends.  After 
48 hours, the cyclone is expected to gradually bend toward the left 
and slow down as Adrian weakens and a stronger ridge develops over 
the southwestern United States.  However, it is not yet clear how 
sharp that bend will be, and the system could approach the southern 
part of the Baja California peninsula in 3 to 4 days.

The depression appears poised to strengthen in a low-shear and 
moist environment and over very warm sea surface temperatures of 
30-31 degrees Celsius.  In fact, the intensity guidance has become 
much more aggressive on this forecast cycle, including an increase 
in the chance for rapid intensification.  Most of the guidance 
shows the cyclone reaching a peak in intensity in 36-48 hours when 
it's very close to the southwestern coast of Mexico, and the new 
NHC intensity forecast has been increased rather significantly 
to hurricane strength during that period compared to the previous 
forecast.  Even this forecast could be conservative, as several of 
the regional hurricane models, as well as the IVCN and HCCA 
consensus aids, are 5-25 kt higher than the official forecast at 36 
hours.  A combination of shear, a drier atmosphere, and cooler 
waters are expected to lead to weakening after 48 hours, and the 
system could be a remnant low by day 5.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The depression is forecast to strengthen quickly and could 
become a hurricane by Friday evening, bringing a risk of strong 
winds to portions of the southwestern coast of Mexico during the 
next couple of days.  A Hurricane Watch is now in effect for the 
coasts of Michoacan, Colima, and Jalisco, and hurricane conditions 
are possible in those areas late Friday through Saturday.
 
2. Locally heavy rainfall of 3 to 5 inches with maximum amounts of
7 inches, is expected across southern Mexico from the state of
Oaxaca westward to the state of Jalisco.  These rains could lead to
localized flash flooding.
