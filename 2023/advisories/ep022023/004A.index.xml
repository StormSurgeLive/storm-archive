Hurricane Adrian Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012023
300 PM MDT Thu Jun 29 2023
 
A ragged eye briefly emerged in visible satellite imagery today, but 
it has once again become obscured by the central dense overcast of 
Adrian. It appears that the hurricane is struggling with some drier 
mid-level air in the surrounding environment. A dry slot is wrapping 
around the southern and eastern portions of the circulation, and 
earlier SSMIS microwave data showed a weakness in the inner-core 
convection around the eyewall. The 18 UTC subjective Dvorak 
estimates from SAB and TAFB were both T4.5/77 kt, while the 
objective ADT and SATCON estimates are in the 65-70 kt range. A 
blend of these data support keeping the initial intensity at 75 kt 
for this advisory.
 
The vertical wind shear is forecast to gradually increase over 
Adrian during the next several days, which is expected to induce a 
weakening trend that is supported by all the available intensity 
guidance. The official NHC forecast remains near or just above the 
latest IVCN and HCCA consensus aids. Based on the latest GFS and 
ECMWF model-simulated satellite imagery, the updated NHC forecast 
shows Adrian becoming post-tropical at day 3, as it appears likely 
to lose all deep convection over cooler waters and within a drier 
and stronger shear environment. While the official forecast carries 
a remnant low through day 5, it could be near dissipation by the end 
of the period.

The track of Adrian today has been to the right of previous 
forecasts, and its initial motion is west-northwestward or 300/6 kt. 
The hurricane is expected to move generally west-northwestward 
during the next few days while being steered by a high-pressure 
ridge to its northeast. The updated NHC forecast has again been 
adjusted to the right of the previous one, and it generally lies 
between the TVCE and HCCA aids. As the shallow remnant low spins 
down later in the forecast period, it is expected to turn more 
westward within the low-level flow.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beatriz was
located near latitude 15.3 North, longitude 99.8 West.  Beatriz is
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A
northwestward motion is expected to begin tonight, with a decrease
in forward speed occurring over the weekend.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Beatriz is expected to move very near or along 
the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Rapid strengthening is forecast, and Beatriz is likely to
become a hurricane on Friday.  Beatriz is forecast to be a hurricane
while it moves near portions of the coast of southwestern Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beatriz can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/miatcdep2.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected somewhere within the
hurricane warning area Friday and Friday night.  Hurricane
conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area on Saturday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area through early Friday, and are possible within the tropical
storm watch area on Saturday.
 
RAINFALL:  Through Sunday morning, storm total rainfall of 3 to 5
inches, with maximum amounts of 7 inches, is expected across
southern Mexico from Oaxaca west to Jalisco.  This rainfall could
lead to localized flash flooding.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds.  Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Beatriz are forecast to build and spread
northward along the southwestern coast of Mexico during the next
couple of days.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.

Tropical Storm Beatriz Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022023
400 PM CDT Thu Jun 29 2023
 
The cyclone's satellite presentation, at least in visible imagery,
has improved markedly through the day, and the low-level center had
become apparent in a relatively cloud-free region (which has 
recently become obscured) surrounded by developing deep convection.  
Dvorak satellite intensity estimates are T2.5/35 kt from TAFB and 
T2.0/30 kt from SAB (with similar objective numbers), so the initial 
intensity is raised to 35 kt, with the cyclone now designated as 
Tropical Storm Beatriz.
 
Beatriz is moving toward the west-northwest, or 300/10 kt, along
the southern periphery of a mid-level ridge located over northern 
Mexico.  This ridge is forecast to weaken a bit during the next few 
days, and Beatriz is therefore expected to move northwestward for 
the next 4 days or so.  The track guidance has continued to shift 
to the right, closer to the coast of Mexico, and some models (in 
particular the ECMWF and HCCA) bring the center inland in about 
24-36 hours.  The NHC track forecast has been shifted to the east as 
well, and now shows the center of Beatriz grazing the coasts of 
Michoacan, Colima, and Jalisco in the next 24-48 hours.  It is 
important to remember that Beatriz's oblique angle of approach to 
the southwestern coast of Mexico makes it difficult to know exactly 
where the center might come onshore, if at all, and therefore a 
larger-than-normal part of the coastline is at risk of some effects 
from the storm.

Beatriz is now expected to rapidly intensify during the next 24 
hours in an environment of low shear and abundant moisture, and 
over very warm waters of 30-31 degrees Celsius.  Following the 
trend from this morning, the intensity guidance shows significant 
strengthening in the short term, and the NHC intensity forecast has 
been raised to the high end of the guidance, closest to the HAFS-A 
and HCCA solutions at 24 hours.  After that time, Beatriz's 
intensity will largely depend on if the center reaches land.  Based 
on the official track forecast's proximity to land, intensification 
is shown through 36 hours, with weakening thereafter.  Faster 
weakening is anticipated near the end of the forecast period due to 
drier air and cooler sea surface temperatures, and global model 
guidance suggests that Beatriz could degenerate into a remnant low 
by day 5, if not sooner.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Beatriz is forecast to rapidly intensify and become a hurricane 
on Friday, bringing a risk of hurricane-force winds and a dangerous 
storm surge to portions of the southwestern coast of Mexico during 
the next couple of days.  A Hurricane Warning is now in effect for 
portions of the coasts of Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima, and Jalisco, 
and hurricane conditions are expected somewhere in those areas 
Friday and Saturday.
 
2. Locally heavy rainfall is expected across southern Mexico from 
the state of Oaxaca westward to the state of Jalisco.  These rains 
could lead to life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides.
