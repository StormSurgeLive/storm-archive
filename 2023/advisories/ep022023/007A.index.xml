Hurricane Adrian Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012023
900 AM MDT Fri Jun 30 2023
 
The overall satellite presentation of Adrian has improved this
morning. The eye is embedded deeper within a more symmetric central
dense overcast and surrounded by a ring of deep convection with
infrared cloud top temperatures colder than -60 deg C. Recent SSMIS
microwave images reveal a well-defined mid-level eyewall, although
some vertical tilt is noted between the 91 GHz and 37 GHz channels,
which suggests Adrian may be experiencing some easterly shear. The
initial intensity is a bit more uncertain than normal given the
large spread in the satellite intensity estimates, which range from
77-102 kt. Based on the improved satellite structure, the initial
intensity is raised to 90 kt for this advisory. This lies in between
the subjective SAB and TAFB Dvorak estimates, and is in best
agreement with recent UW-CIMSS ADT and AiDT estimates.
 
The hurricane is forecast to cross the 26 deg C SST isotherm and
encounter increased easterly shear during the next 12 to 24 h.
Therefore, the official NHC forecast shows gradual weakening in the
near term, followed by more rapid weakening as the cyclone becomes
increasingly sheared and moves over even cooler waters. Adrian will
likely struggle to produce organized convection beyond 48 h given
these hostile conditions, and it is forecast to degenerate to a
remnant low shortly thereafter and dissipate by early Wednesday.
 
Adrian has recently been moving more northwestward, and its initial
motion is 305/6 kt. The cyclone is forecast to move generally
west-northwestward during the next couple of days, around the
southwestern periphery of mid-tropospheric high pressure centered
over the southern United States. As Adrian loses deep convection and
becomes more vertically shallow, the remnant low is expected to turn
more westward on Monday within the low-level trade wind flow. Once
again, the center of Adrian and the latest track guidance has
trended to the right of the previous forecast, and so the updated
NHC forecast has been adjusted in that direction.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Beatriz was
located by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near 
latitude 17.5 North, longitude 102.6 West.  Beatriz is moving toward 
the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this motion with some 
decrease in forward speed is expected through early Sunday.  A turn 
toward the west-northwest with an additional decrease in forward 
speed is expected on Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Beatriz is expected to move near or over portions of the coast of 
southwestern Mexico later today through Saturday.  Beatriz is then 
expected to move away from the west-central coast of Mexico 
Saturday night and Sunday.
 
Preliminary reconnaissance reports and recent satellite images 
indicate that Beatriz continues to strengthen, and maximum sustained 
winds have increased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher gusts.  
Additional strengthening is possible today and tonight if Beatriz's 
center remains over water. Weakening is expected to begin on Sunday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70
miles (110 km).
 
The minimum central pressure reported by aircraft data is 992 mb 
(29.29 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beatriz can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/miatcdep2.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected somewhere within the
hurricane warning area today through Saturday.  Hurricane conditions
are possible within the hurricane watch area on Saturday.  Tropical
storm conditions are likely occurring in the tropical storm warning
area, and are possible within the tropical storm watch areas
Saturday or Saturday night.
 
RAINFALL: Through Sunday, storm total rainfall of 3 to 5 inches,
with maximum amounts of 8 inches, is expected across southern Mexico
from Guerrero west-northwest to Nayarit from Beatriz. This rainfall
could lead to localized flash flooding and mudslides.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds.  Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Beatriz are forecast to spread northward
along the southwestern coast of Mexico during the next day or so.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.

Hurricane Beatriz Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022023
1000 AM CDT Fri Jun 30 2023
 
Recent GOES 1-minute visible and infrared satellite imagery show 
that an eye is forming.  A special classification from TAFB yielded 
an estimate of T4.0/65 kt, and raw UW-CIMSS ADT values are also up 
to 4.0.  Therefore, Beatriz has been upgraded to a hurricane with 
maximum winds estimated to be 65 kt.  An Air Force Reserve Hurricane 
plane is scheduled to investigate the storm in a few hours, 
hopefully providing a refinement in the estimated intensity.
 
Beatriz's initial motion remains northwestward, or 305/11 kt.  The
storm is expected to continue moving northwestward during the next
48 hours as it moves along the southwestern periphery of a
mid-level ridge located over the southern United States and
northern Mexico.  However, as is often the case with cyclones
paralleling the west coast of Mexico, there is significant
uncertainty as to whether Beatriz's center will continue to skirt
the coast or move inland at some point.  The NHC track forecast
continues to show a scenario where Beatriz grazes the coast during
the next 24-36 hours, but models such as the ECMWF and UKMET do
bring the system inland and show dissipation.  If Beatriz survives
the next 48 hours, it would then likely slow down and turn toward
the west-northwest as a mid-level ridge builds over the
southwestern U.S.
 
If Beatriz's center remains offshore, environmental conditions
should otherwise be conducive for additional strengthening during
the next 12-24 hours, and the storm is forecast to remain a 
hurricane until after it passes Cabo Corrientes.  On the other hand, 
if the center reaches land, the mountainous terrain of Mexico would 
likely cause rapid weakening.  Assuming survival during the next 36 
hours, increasing shear out of the east-northeast, cooler sea 
surface temperatures, and a drier, more subsident environment would 
likely lead to gradual weakening on days 2 and 3.  Based on the 
latest global model guidance, Beatriz is likely to have degenerated 
into a remnant low by day 4 and dissipate by day 5.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Beatriz is forecast to continue strengthening and remain a 
hurricane through Saturday, bringing a risk of hurricane-force 
winds and a dangerous storm surge to portions of the southwestern 
coast of Mexico during the next day or so.  A Hurricane Warning is 
in effect for portions of the coasts of Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima, 
and Jalisco, and hurricane conditions are expected somewhere in
those areas later today and on Saturday.
 
2. Locally heavy rainfall is expected across southern Mexico from
the state of Oaxaca westward to the state of Nayarit.  These rains
could lead to life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides.
