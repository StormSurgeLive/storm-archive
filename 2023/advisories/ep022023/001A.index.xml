<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Adrian, located a few hundred miles off the coast of southwestern <br/>
Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South of Southern Mexico (EP92):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms are showing signs of organization in <br/>
association with a broad area of low pressure located a few hundred <br/>
miles south of the coast of southern Mexico. Environmental <br/>
conditions appear conducive for development of this system, and a <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form during the next couple of days <br/>
while it moves generally west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph, roughly <br/>
parallel to the southern and southwestern coasts of Mexico. <br/>
Interests along the southwestern coast of Mexico should monitor the <br/>
progress of this system during the next several days.  Additional <br/>
information on this system, including gale warnings, can be found in <br/>
High Seas Forecast issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

<title>Hurricane Adrian Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Hurricane Adrian Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012023
900 PM MDT Wed Jun 28 2023

Adrian's satellite presentation has shown little change in 
organization since earlier today.  Central convection has been 
waxing and waning, and the eye is not very well defined.  Some 
banding features are evident and the upper-level outflow is still a 
bit impeded to the north of the system.  Dvorak satellite intensity 
estimates from both SAB and TAFB have not changed since the last 
advisory cycle, so the intensity estimate remains 70 kt. 

Dynamical guidance indicates that the vertical shear over Adrian 
should remain fairly low for the next day or so.  Therefore some 
additional strengthening is forecast in the short term.  By 48 
hours, increasing easterly shear, associated with an 
upper-tropospheric high building to the north of Adrian, is 
anticipated.  This, coupled with cooler ocean waters, should cause 
weakening.  The official intensity forecast is a blend of the 
statistical-dynamical guidance and the dynamical model consensus.

Adrian continues to plod slowly westward, or at about 280/5 kt.  A 
weak mid-level ridge to the north of the tropical cyclone 
should maintain a westward to west-northwestward motion until late 
in the forecast period.  In 4 to 5 days, the ridge weakens and 
Adrian's motion should slow even further.  Another factor in the 
track late in the period is the possible interaction of Adrian 
or its remnant low with another system to the east.  The details of 
this interaction are quite uncertain at this time, and the official 
track forecast remains close to the dynamical model consensus.

<title>Potential Tropical Cyclone Two-E Forecast Discussion Number 1</title>

Potential Tropical Cyclone Two-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022023
1000 PM CDT Wed Jun 28 2023
 
The system the NHC has been monitoring off of Mexico is starting to 
show signs of organization based on geostationary satellite imagery. 
 An elongated area of low pressure has formed with convection
gradually building over the past several hours.  The current 
subjective satellite estimate from TAFB give the disturbance a 
T-number of 1.5, suggesting that it is close to becoming a tropical 
cyclone, but it has not quite become one yet.  The initial intensity 
is estimated to 25 kt for this advisory.  
 
The disturbance is moving northwestward at about 10 kt.  This 
general motion is expected to continue as the system moves along the 
southwest periphery of a mid-level trough centered over the 
southern United States.  At the end of the forecast period, the 
system is expected to turn west-northwestward in the low-level flow. 
 There is increased uncertainty in this track forecast due to the 
uncertainty in the location of where the storm will ultimately 
form. A more northern position will likely bring the potential 
cyclone closer to Mexican coast.  The NHC track forecast is closest 
to the simple consensus aid.

The potential tropical cyclone is embedded in an environment 
conducive for intensification, with low vertical wind shear and high 
mid-level moisture.  The system is also over warm sea surface 
temperatures of more than 30 degrees C.  Model guidance is in fairly 
good agreement that the disturbance will become a tropical cyclone 
in the next day or so and steadily strengthen over the next few 
days.  Atmospheric and ocean conditions are expected to become more 
hostile day 4 and beyond, likely leading to weakening.  The official 
intensity forecast is closest to the LGEM model.


KEY MESSAGES:

1. A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect along the southwestern 
coast of Mexico from Punta Maldonado to Lazaro Cardenas, and 
tropical storm conditions should begin within this area by Thursday 
afternoon.

2. Locally heavy rainfall of 3 to 5 inches with maximum amounts of 
7 inches, is expected across southern Mexico from the state of 
Oaxaca westward to the state of Jalisco.  These rains could lead to 
localized flash flooding.
