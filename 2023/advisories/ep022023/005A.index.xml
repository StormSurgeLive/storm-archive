Hurricane Adrian Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012023
900 PM MDT Thu Jun 29 2023
 
After a brief hiatus, Adrian appears to once again be strengthening 
this evening.  An SSMI/S satellite pass at 2239 UTC showed an 
apparent dry air intrusion reaching the hurricane's core with a 
weakness in the convection to the north.  However, recent 
geostationary infrared imagery suggests the storm has recovered and 
an eye has emerged.  Subjective Dvorak estimates from SAB and TAFB 
were T5.0/90 kt and T4.5/77 kt, respectively.  Therefore, the 
initial intensity has been increased to 80 kt to represent a blend 
of these estimates.
 
Adrian has a short window of conducive environmental and oceanic 
conditions that could lead to some additional intensification.  
Beginning in about 12 h or so, easterly deep-layer wind shear is 
expected to increase while sea-surface temperatures along the 
forecast track cool.  These conditions should induce a weakening 
trend.  The NHC intensity prediction is above the all of the model 
guidance in the short-term forecast, but follows the consensus aids 
beyond 24 h.  Adrian is still expected to become a post-tropical 
remnant low by day 3.

The initial motion of the hurricane is estimated to be northwestward 
or 305/7 kt.  The storm is still expected to move generally 
west-northwestward during the next few days around a ridge to its 
northeast.  The weaker, shallower vortex is then forecast to turn 
westward in the low-level trade winds.  As mentioned in previous 
advisories, the track forecast for Adrian has been shifting to the 
right and it has done so again for this cycle.  The latest official 
forecast is closest to the simple consensus aid, TVCE.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beatriz was
located near latitude 15.9 North, longitude 100.9 West. Beatriz is
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A
northwestward motion is expected to begin later today, with a
decrease in forward speed occurring over the weekend.  On the
forecast track, the center of Beatriz is expected to move very near
or along the coast of southwestern Mexico during the next couple of
days.
 
Recently-received satellite wind data indicate that maximum 
sustained winds are now near 50 mph (80 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Rapid strengthening is forecast, and Beatriz is likely to become a 
hurricane by later today.  Beatriz is forecast to be a hurricane 
while it moves near portions of the coast of southwestern Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
mainly to the northeast of the center.  The Mexican automated 
station at Isla Roqueta near Acapulco recently reported a wind gust 
of 35 mph (56 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beatriz can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/miatcdep2.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected somewhere within the
hurricane warning area later today and tonight.  Hurricane
conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area on Saturday.
Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area starting later today, and are possible within the tropical
storm watch area on Saturday.
 
RAINFALL: Through Sunday, storm total rainfall of 3 to 5 inches,
with maximum amounts of 8 inches, is expected across southern Mexico
from Guerrero west-northwest to Nayarit.  This rainfall could lead
to localized flash flooding
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds.  Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Beatriz are forecast to build and spread
northward along the southwestern coast of Mexico during the next
couple of days.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Beatriz Forecast Discussion Number 5</title>

Tropical Storm Beatriz Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022023
1000 PM CDT Thu Jun 29 2023

Beatriz is still in the organizing stage at this time.  Some 
convective banding features are starting to develop near and west 
of the estimated center location.  Although the outer cloud 
structure is becoming better defined, deep convection is 
currently not very strong near the center.  Dvorak satellite 
intensity estimates from SAB and TAFB remain at 30 and 35 kt 
respectively, so the intensity is held at 35 kt for this advisory.

Although the center is not that easy to locate, the latest center 
fixes indicate that the motion is west-northwestward, or 300/10 kt. 
Over the next few days, a mid-level ridge to the north and northeast 
of Beatriz should steer the cyclone on a generally northwestward 
heading.  There continues to be significant difference among the 
track models, however, with the HAFS and ECMWF models bringing the 
center onshore in 36-48 hours and the GFS, HWRF, and HMON 
guidance keeping the core of Beatriz offshore.  The official 
forecast is similar to the previous one and shows the center on the 
coast in the 36-hour time frame, in closer agreement with the ECMWF 
solution.  It is important to note that Beatriz's oblique angle of 
approach to the southwestern coast of Mexico makes it difficult to 
know exactly where the center might come onshore, if at all, and 
therefore a larger-than-normal part of the coastline is at risk of 
some effects from the storm.  Over the weekend the ridge weakens, 
and the forward motion of Beatriz is likely to slow.

The atmospheric and oceanic environment for Beatriz appears to be 
quite conducive for strengthening, with low vertical shear, high 
mid-level humidity, and SSTs near 30 deg C.  The SHIP rapid 
intensification (RI) indices show a greater than normal chance for 
RI during the next day or so, and the official forecast calls for 
Beatriz to become a hurricane in just 24 hours.  This is on the 
high side of the intensity model guidance. The cyclone's intensity 
in 36-48 hours will be dependent on how much the system interacts 
with land.  At this time, the official forecast calls for at least 
some land interaction and weakening in a couple of days.  Later in 
the forecast period, drier air and cooler waters are expected to 
cause weakening, and the model guidance indicates that Beatriz will 
degenerate into a remnant low by day 5.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Beatriz is forecast to rapidly intensify and become a hurricane
later on Friday, bringing a risk of hurricane-force winds and a 
dangerous storm surge to portions of the southwestern coast of 
Mexico during the next couple of days.  A Hurricane Warning is now 
in effect for portions of the coasts of Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima, 
and Jalisco, and hurricane conditions are expected somewhere in 
those areas Friday and Saturday.
 
2. Locally heavy rainfall is expected across southern Mexico from
the state of Oaxaca westward to the state of Jalisco.  These rains
could lead to life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides.
