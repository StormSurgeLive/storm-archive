300 AM MDT Sat Jul 01 2023
 
...ADRIAN WEAKENING QUICKLY AS IT NEARS CLARION ISLAND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM MDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.1N 114.0W
ABOUT 425 MI...685 KM SW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...80 MPH...130 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...983 MB...29.03 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Adrian was located
near latitude 18.1 North, longitude 114.0 West. Adrian is moving
toward the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h) and this general
motion is expected to continue with a gradual turn westward during
the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 80 mph (130 km/h)
with higher gusts. Rapid weakening is forecast over the next couple
of days and Adrian is forecast to become post-tropical on Sunday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km). An automated Mexican navy weather station on Clarion 
Island recent reported a wind gust of 44 mph (71 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 983 mb (29.03 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Adrian are affecting portions of the
west-central coast of Mexico and the southern Baja California
peninsula. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.

Hurricane Adrian Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012023
300 AM MDT Sat Jul 01 2023

Adrian's structure on both microwave and geostationary satellite has 
continued to deteriorate overnight. While a small cluster of deep 
convection remains, it is becoming increasingly separated to the 
northwest of the low-level center which is becoming exposed on 
nighttime GOES-18 shortwave-IR imagery. An earlier F-16 microwave 
pass at 0020 UTC also showed this increasingly detached convection, 
possibly a result of increasing easterly vertical wind shear 
decoupling the vertical structure of Adrian. Subjective satellite 
intensity estimates are quickly decreasing, though the CI numbers 
are constrained by the Dvorak technique. The initial intensity has 
been set to 70 kt for this advisory, closer to unconstrained data-T 
Dvorak values from TAFB and SAB, in addition to experimental D-PRINT 
and AiDT intensity estimates provided by UW-CIMSS. Adrian is now 
over sub-26 C sea-surface temperatures, which cool to below 24 C in 
24 hours, and steady to rapid weakening is likely to continue. The 
latest intensity forecast is in line with the intensity consensus, 
with both regional-hurricane and global model guidance suggesting 
Adrian will become a post-tropical cyclone devoid of deep convection 
by Sunday. 

Adrian continues to move west-northwestward at a slightly slower 
pace than before, estimated at 300/6 kt. This general 
west-northwestward motion should continue, with a gradual turn 
westward as Adrian becomes a shallow cyclone steered by the 
low-level trade wind flow. Aside from some initial position 
adjustments southward, the track forecast is quite similar to the 
prior advisory, following the reliable HCCA and TVCE consensus aids.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Beatriz was
located near latitude 19.8 North, longitude 105.4 West.  Beatriz is
moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this general
motion with a gradual decrease in forward speed is expected through
tonight.  On the forecast track, the center of Beatriz is expected
to move near or over portions of the coast of southwestern Mexico
through this morning.  Beatriz is then expected to move away from
the west-central coast of Mexico later today into Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Continued weakening is expected during the next
couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beatriz can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/miatcdep2.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical
storm warning area today, and are possible within the tropical
storm watch areas today or tonight.
 
RAINFALL:  Through Monday, storm total rainfall of 3 to 5 inches,
with maximum amounts of 8 inches, is expected across portions of
southern and western Mexico from Colima northwest to Sinaloa and
Durango in association with Beatriz.  This rainfall could lead to
localized flash flooding and mudslides.
 
STORM SURGE:  Coastal flooding is possible in areas of onshore 
winds.  Large, potentially damaging waves are also possible along 
the coast.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Beatriz are occurring along the 
southwestern coast of Mexico.  These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Beatriz Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022023
400 AM CDT Sat Jul 01 2023

The center of Beatriz brushed the coast of Mexico near Punta San 
Telmo back around 0000 UTC, and since then the cyclone has steadily 
lost organization.  Earlier microwave satellite imagery shows that 
the eye has disappeared, while scatterometer and synthetic aperture 
radar data suggest that the surface circulation has become less well 
defined.  In addition, surface observations in and around Manzanillo 
have not been supportive of a well-defined circulation in the area.  
Based on these observations and an accompanying decrease in the 
satellite cloud pattern, the initial intensity is reduced to an 
uncertain 55 kt.
 
Although Beatriz will be moving away from the coast of Mexico later 
today, the dynamical models suggest that the cyclone will not 
recover from the effects of land interaction, with most of them 
forecasting the system to dissipate to 2-3 days time or less.  The 
new NHC intensity forecast is notably lower than the previous 
forecast and calls for the system to weaken to a depression by 60 h 
and dissipate soon thereafter.  There is a chance that Beatriz could 
weaken faster than currently forecast.

The initial motion is estimated at 315/11 kt as the cyclone 
continues to move along the southwest periphery of a mid-level 
ridge.  This general motion should continue during the next 12-24 
hours, taking the core of Beatriz along or just offshore of the 
coast of southwestern and west-central Mexico this morning.  After 
that time, assuming the storm survives, a slower and generally 
west-northwestward motion is expected.  The NHC track forecast is 
similar to, but a little faster than the previous forecast.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Beatriz is forecast to bring tropical storm conditions to 
portions of western Mexico today.
 
2. Locally heavy rainfall is expected across southern and western
Mexico from the state of Guerrero northwestward to the states of
Sinaloa and Durango.  These rains could lead to life-threatening
flash flooding and mudslides.
