Hurricane Adrian Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012023
300 AM MDT Thu Jun 29 2023
 
Adrian has had several convective bursts in the inner core 
throughout the overnight period, particularly on the eastern side. 
However, the eye is still not very well defined, with the system 
struggling to wrap deep convection around western side. Dvorak 
satellite intensity estimates from both SAB and TAFB have increased 
slightly from the last advisory cycle, thus the initial intensity 
of 75 kt.

Adrian is moving westward, or 285/7 kt, south of a mid-level 
ridge.  This ridge is forecast to weaken the next 2 days,
which will slow the storm's forward motion. Towards the end of the 
forecast period the ridge weakens further, and the hurricane may 
begin to interact with Tropical Depression Two-E to its east. 
As this happens, the track model guidance shows Adrian meandering 
or becoming stationary by the end of the forecast period. The track 
forecast is very close to the previous forecast.

Adrian will remain in a fairly favorable environment for the next 
day or so, with guidance indicating low vertical wind shear, and 
warm SSTs near 28 degrees Celsius. Therefore, some slight 
additional strengthening is forecast in the short term.  By 48 
hours, models show increasing easterly shear over the system, 
associated with an upper-level high building to the north.  Adrian 
will also be moving into cooler SSTs during this time frame, the 
combination of cooler SST and vertical wind shear should cause 
weakening. The official intensity forecast is near the model 
consensus.

Tropical Depression Two-E Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022023
400 AM CDT Thu Jun 29 2023

Satellite imagery indicates that convection associated with the low 
pressure area off the coast of southern Mexico has become better 
organized during the past several hours, with convective bands 
forming near the center and an outer band in the northern 
semicircle near the coast. Based on this, the system is being 
designated a tropical depression. The initial intensity is 30 kt in 
agreement with a satellite intensity estimate from TAFB.

The initial motion is 310/12 kt.  This general motion is expected 
to continue for the next 3-4 days as the cyclone moves between a 
mid-level ridge over the southwestern United States and Hurricane 
Adrian to its west and southwest.  After that time, a more westward 
motion is expected as the weakening system is steered by Adrian 
and a low-level ridge to its northwest.  The new NHC forecast track 
is similar to the previous track and in good agreement with 
the consensus models.  However, there is some uncertainty in both 
the track and the forward speed, and it is possible the center 
could come closer to the coast of Mexico than currently forecast. 

Conditions appear favorable for strengthening, as the cyclone 
should be in an environment of light- to moderate easterly shear 
and high mid-level moisture for the next few days.  In addition, 
the sea surface temperatures are at or above 30C along much of the 
forecast track during that time.  The various rapid intensification 
indices of the SHIPS model show a significant chance of rapid 
development during the next 2-3 days, although the system may be too 
close to the coast of Mexico to fully take advantage of the 
favorable environment.  After 72 h, decreasing sea surface 
temperatures along the forecast track should cause a quick 
weakening.  The official intensity forecast follows the trend of the 
guidance and is near the intensity consensus.  
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect along the southwestern
coast of Mexico from Punta Maldonado to Punta San Telmo, and
tropical storm conditions should begin within this area by Thursday
afternoon.
 
2. Locally heavy rainfall of 3 to 5 inches with maximum amounts of
7 inches, is expected across southern Mexico from the state of
Oaxaca westward to the state of Jalisco.  These rains could lead to
localized flash flooding.
