Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 PM PDT Tue Oct 24 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Otis, located near Acapulco, Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern East Pacific:<br/>
An area of low pressure about 1300 miles southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula is producing disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms. Environmental conditions are marginally <br/>
conducive for some slow development of the system during the next <br/>
several days while the low meanders over the southwestern east <br/>
Pacific.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Central America and Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure is likely to form in a day or two over <br/>
the far eastern Pacific, partially related to the remnants of <br/>
Atlantic Tropical Depression Twenty-One. Environmental conditions <br/>
should be conducive for some development of this system, and a <br/>
tropical depression could form late this week or this weekend while <br/>
the low moves slowly westward to west-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

MEXICO...
...HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLASH FLOODING OCCURRING OVER PORTIONS OF
SOUTHERN MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 400 AM CDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.2N 100.1W
ABOUT 25 MI...40 KM NNW OF ACAPULCO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...130 MPH...215 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 345 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...948 MB...28.00 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warning and Hurricane Watch east of Punta Maldonado.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Punta Maldonado westward to Zihuatanejo
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Otis was located
near latitude 17.2 North, longitude 100.1 West. Otis is moving
toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this general
motion is expected through early tonight.  On the forecast track, 
the center of Otis will move farther inland over southern Mexico 
through tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 130 mph (215 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Otis is a category 4 hurricane on the
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Rapid weakening is expected
as Otis moves inland over the higher terrain of Mexico.  Otis will
likely dissipate over southern Mexico tonight.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles
(110 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 948 mb (28.00 inches).

 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Otis can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP3 and WMO header WTPZ43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP3.shtml
 
WIND:  Damaging hurricane-force winds will spread inland over
southern Mexico this morning with extremely destructive
winds near the core during the next few hours.  Wind speeds atop
and on the windward sides of hills and mountains are often up to
30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds indicated in this
advisory, and in some elevated locations could be even greater.
 
STORM SURGE:  Life-threatening storm surge will continue along the
coast of southern Mexico this morning in areas of onshore winds
within the hurricane warning. Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Otis is expected to produce rainfall totals of 8 to 16
inches with maximum amounts of 20 inches through Thursday across
Guerrero and the western coastal sections of Oaxaca.  This rainfall
will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas
of higher terrain.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Otis will affect portions of the southern
coast of Mexico during the next day or so. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 AM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

Hurricane Otis Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP182023
1000 PM CDT Tue Oct 24 2023
 
A nightmare scenario is unfolding for southern Mexico this evening
with rapidly intensifying Otis approaching the coastline.  Satellite
images show that Otis has continued to intensify, with Dvorak
Data-T estimates between 130-145 kt during the past few hours.  The 
initial wind speed is set to 140 kt as a blend of these values, 
making Otis a Category 5 hurricane.  Otis has explosively 
intensified 95 kt during the past 24 hours, a mark only exceeded in 
modern times by Patricia in 2015.
 
Otis should maintain category 5 status before the hurricane makes 
landfall near the Acapulco area overnight or early on Wednesday. 
The only significant change to mention to the track forecast is 
that it has been shifted to the right due to a recent wobble to the 
east and the latest model trends, and a general north-northwest 
motion at about 8 kt is anticipated through landfall.  Rapid 
weakening is anticipated after landfall, and Otis should dissipate 
tomorrow night over the higher terrain of Mexico.
 
This is an extremely serious situation for the Acapulco
metropolitan area with the core of the destructive hurricane likely
to come near or over that large city early on Wednesday. There are 
no hurricanes on record even close to this intensity for this part 
of Mexico.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Otis is forecast to be a potentially catastrophic Category 5
hurricane when it reaches the southern coast of Mexico early
Wednesday.  Life-threatening hurricane-force winds are expected in
portions of the Hurricane Warning area with catastrophic damage
expected.
 
2. A potentially catastrophic storm surge is expected to produce
life-threatening coastal flooding near and to the east of where the
center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
3. Heavy rains from Otis will continue to impact areas of southwest
Mexico this week.  This rainfall will produce flash and urban
flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
