<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Otis, located a few hundred miles south-southeast of <br/>
Acapulco, Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South of Central America and Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure is likely to form in a couple of days <br/>
over the far eastern Pacific, partially related to the remnants of <br/>
Atlantic Tropical Depression Twenty-One which are forecast to move <br/>
into the region.  Environmental conditions could support some slow <br/>
development of this system by late this week or this weekend while <br/>
the low moves slowly westward to west-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

SUMMARY OF 700 PM CDT...0000 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...13.3N 97.8W
ABOUT 290 MI...465 KM SSE OF ACAPULCO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 345 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Lagunas de Chacahua to Tecpan de Galeana
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Lagunas de Chacahua to Tecpan de Galeana
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests in elsewhere in southern and southwestern Mexico should
monitor the progress of Otis.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Otis was
located near latitude 13.3 North, longitude 97.8 West. Otis is
moving toward the north-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this
general motion is expected during the next few days.  On the
forecast track, Otis is expected to reach the coast of southern
Mexico on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Gradual strengthening is forecast, and Otis is expected to 
be near hurricane strength before it reaches southern Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Otis can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP3 and WMO header WTPZ43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP3.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Otis is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10
inches with maximum amounts of 15 inches through Friday across
Guerrero and the western coastal sections of Oaxaca.  This rainfall
will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas
of higher terrain.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected and hurricane
conditions are possible within the warning area beginning Tuesday
night.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the east of where
the center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Otis will begin to affect portions of the
southern coast of Mexico on Tuesday. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Otis Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP182023
400 PM CDT Mon Oct 23 2023
 
The latest satellite images indicate that Otis is becoming better
organized with a curved band wrapping about halfway around the
center.  However, the low-level center is still partially exposed
due to ongoing easterly vertical wind shear.  An ASCAT-C pass from
a few hours ago showed peak winds close to 40 kt on the east side
of the system, and the 18Z Dvorak estimates have increased to 3.0/45
kt.  Based on all of that data, the initial intensity is increased
to 45 kt.
 
Otis is moving slowly north-northwestward at 6 kt in the flow
between a mid- to upper-level trough to its northwest and a ridge to
its east.  The models have trended to a faster solution with the
ECMWF, CMC, and UKMET global models bringing Otis to the coast of
southern Mexico on Wednesday.  The GFS, however, remains an outlier
and keeps Otis weaker and offshore.  The NHC track forecast leans on
the ECMWF/UKMET/CMC solutions and is a little faster than the
previous one.
 
Although Otis is expected to remain in a moderate wind shear
environment, abundant moisture and warm SSTs should support gradual
strengthening until Otis makes landfall.  The models have
trended higher, and it now appears likely that Otis will be near
hurricane strength when it reaches the coast.  Rapid weakening is
expected after Otis moves inland due to the rugged terrain in
southern and southwestern Mexico.
 
Based on the forecast, the government of Mexico has issued a
Tropical Storm Warning and Hurricane Watch for portions of southern
Mexico.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Otis will begin to impact areas of southwest
Mexico early this week.  This rainfall will produce flash and urban
flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected and hurricane conditions
are possible beginning late Tuesday along portions of the southern
coast of Mexico, where a Tropical Storm Warning and Hurricane Watch
are in effect.
