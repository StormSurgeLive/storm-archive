...NORMA WEAKENS TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION...
...STILL A THREAT OF LOCALIZED HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLOODING...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM MDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.5N 108.4W
ABOUT 60 MI...95 KM WSW OF CULIACAN MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...E OR 90 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...998 MB...29.47 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warning along the coast of mainland Mexico.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Norma 
was located near latitude 24.5 North, longitude 108.4 West. The 
depression is moving toward the east near 7 mph (11 km/h) and this 
motion is expected to continue until dissipation occurs later today 
or tonight.  On the forecast track, the center of Norma is forecast 
to move inland along the coast of the Mexican state of Sinaloa later 
this morning. 
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Little change in strength is expected before 
Norma reaches the coast of Mexico.  Weakening and dissipation is 
anticipated once Norma moves inland.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Norma can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP2 and WMO header WTPZ42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP2.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Rainfall from Norma will diminish across northern 
portions of Sinaloa, northern Durango and southern Chihuahua later 
today. Additional isolated totals of 1 to 2 inches are possible, 
along with isolated flash flooding and mudslides in areas of higher 
terrain.

WIND: Gusty winds are possible along the coast of mainland Mexico 
within the state of Sinaloa this morning. 
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Norma will continue to affect the coast 
of southwestern and west-central Mexico and Baja California Sur for 
the next day or so. These swells are likely to cause life- 
threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products 
from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.

Tropical Depression Norma Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172023
300 AM MDT Mon Oct 23 2023
 
Norma has weakened to a tropical depression as the cyclone has been 
void of deep convection since yesterday afternoon. A couple of ASCAT 
overpass between 0354 and 0441 UTC showed peak winds in the 31 to 33 
kt range, and assuming additional weakening has occurred since that 
time, the initial intensity has been lowered to 30 kt. Dry mid-level 
air has been entrained into the circulation from the northwest, and 
given the current strong shear over the system, it appears unlikely 
that significant deep convection will return.  Norma should move 
onshore the coast of western mainland Mexico later this morning, and 
it is expected to rapidly weaken and either become post-tropical or 
dissipate today over the high terrain of western Mexico.
 
Norma took a southeastward jog overnight, but it appears to have 
resumed an eastward motion at about 6 kt.  A general eastward to
motion is expected to continue until dissipation occurs.  The more 
southward initial position required a southward adjustment of the 
track forecast, but it otherwise remains near the center of the 
guidance envelope. 
 
Heavy rainfall associated flooding remains the primary threat with
this system.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall associated with Norma will diminish across 
portions of western Mexico today.  Additional isolated heavy 
rainfall may produce isolated flash flooding and mudslides in areas 
of higher terrain.
 
2. Gusty winds are possible along the coast of Sinaloa Mexico this 
morning.

RAINFALL:  Otis is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10
inches with maximum amounts of 15 inches across Guerrero and the
western coastal sections of Oaxaca.  This rainfall is likely to
produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of
higher terrain.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area by Tuesday night.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Otis will begin to affect portions of the
southern coast of Mexico by late Tuesday. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Otis Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP182023
400 AM CDT Mon Oct 23 2023
 
Deep convection has continued to pulse over the northwestern portion 
of Otis overnight.  The center was noted near the southeastern edge 
of the deep convection in shortwave infrared satellite imagery 
earlier in the night.  Since that time, the center has become a 
little more embedded within the cold cloud tops. As a result, the 
initial intensity has been increased to 40 kt for this advisory.  
This intensity is a blend of the most recent Dvorak T- and CI- 
numbers from TAFB and SAB, and close to the latest SATCON and 
D-PRINT objective estimates from UW/CIMSS.
 
Otis has been moving northward or 360/4 kt.  The storm is expected 
to move northward to north-northwestward between a ridge over the 
northwestern Caribbean Sea and a trough over northwestern Mexico.   
The ECMWF, UKMET, and Canadian models all take Otis near the coast 
of southern Mexico by midweek, with the ECMWF being the fastest.  
That model shows the storm making landfall in southern Mexico in 
just over 48 hours.  Meanwhile, the GFS continues to depict a weaker 
system that stays embedded within the Intertropical Convergence Zone 
and meanders well south of Mexico for several days.  Since the 
majority of the guidance has a track closer or inland over Mexico, 
the NHC forecast continues to lean toward that scenario and takes 
Otis inland in a few days, but this could occur much sooner.  The 
NHC track is a blend of the ECMWF, UKMET, Canadian, HMON, and the 
HFIP corrected consensus aid. 

The storm is over very warm waters and within an environment of 
light to moderate shear.  These conditions should allow for gradual 
strengthening while the system remains over water.  Some increase 
in shear and the possibility of land interaction could cause the 
intensity to level off in a couple of days.  The NHC intensity 
forecast is again near the higher end of the guidance, close to the 
statistical guidance and the HCCA model. 

Based on this latest forecast, the government of Mexico has issued a 
Tropical Storm Watch for a portion of the coast of southern Mexico. 

Key Messages:

1. Heavy rains from Otis will begin to impact areas of southwest 
Mexico early this week.  This rainfall will produce flash and urban 
flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible by Tuesday night or early 
Wednesday along portions of the southern coast of Mexico where a 
Tropical Storm Watch is now in effect.
