NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 PM PDT Tue Oct 24 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Otis, located near Acapulco, Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern East Pacific:<br/>
An area of low pressure about 1300 miles southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula is producing disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms. Environmental conditions are marginally <br/>
conducive for some slow development of the system during the next <br/>
several days while the low meanders over the southwestern east <br/>
Pacific.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Central America and Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure is likely to form in a day or two over <br/>
the far eastern Pacific, partially related to the remnants of <br/>
Atlantic Tropical Depression Twenty-One. Environmental conditions <br/>
should be conducive for some development of this system, and a <br/>
tropical depression could form late this week or this weekend while <br/>
the low moves slowly westward to west-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Otis was located
inland near latitude 17.7 North, longitude 100.3 West.  Otis is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected through early tonight.  On the forecast 
track,  the center of Otis will move farther inland over southern 
Mexico through tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 110 mph (175 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Continued rapid weakening is expected while Otis 
moves farther inland over the higher terrain of Mexico.  Otis will 
likely dissipate over southern Mexico tonight.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70
miles (110 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 965 mb (28.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Otis can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP3 and WMO header WTPZ43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP3.shtml
 
WIND:  Damaging hurricane-force winds will spread inland over
southern Mexico this morning with extremely destructive
winds near the core during the next few hours.  Wind speeds atop
and on the windward sides of hills and mountains are often up to
30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds indicated in this
advisory, and in some elevated locations could be even greater.
 
STORM SURGE:  Life-threatening storm surge will continue along the
coast of southern Mexico this morning in areas of onshore winds
within the hurricane warning area. Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Otis is expected to produce rainfall totals of 8 to 16
inches with maximum amounts of 20 inches through Thursday across
Guerrero and the western coastal sections of Oaxaca.  This rainfall
will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas
of higher terrain.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Otis will affect portions of the southern
coast of Mexico during the next day or so. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

Hurricane Otis Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP182023
400 AM CDT Wed Oct 25 2023
 
Satellite data indicated that Otis continued to strengthen to near
the time of landfall in southern Mexico.  Subjective Dvorak data
T-numbers were around T7.0 (140 kt) around 04-05Z while raw
objective ADT numbers were in the T7.2 to T7.6 range between about
01-05Z.  Based on that data, Otis is estimated to have made landfall
around 0625 UTC as a category 5 hurricane with maximum winds of 145
kt. The core of the hurricane moved onshore in the greater Acapulco
area.  Now that the center of Otis has moved inland, weakening has
begun and the initial intensity has been lowered to 115 kt for this
advisory.  Rapid weakening will occur during the next 12 to 24 hours
as Otis moves over the rugged terrain of southern Mexico, however
damaging hurricane-force winds are likely to spread inland through
this morning, and heavy rainfall and flash flooding is also likely
to spread inland over portions of southern Mexico.  The circulation
of Otis is forecast to dissipate over the mountains of southern
Mexico tonight or Thursday.
 
The hurricane is moving north-northwestward or 345 degrees at 9 kt.
A ridge to the northeast of Otis and a trough to the west of the
storm should continue to steer the cyclone north-northwestward
until dissipation occurs tonight.  The NHC track forecast is
similar to, but a little faster than the previous advisory.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Damaging hurricane-force winds will spread inland over southern
Mexico this morning with extremely destructive winds near the core
during the next few hours.
 
2. Life-threatening storm surge will continue along the coast of
southern Mexico this morning in areas of onshore winds within the
hurricane warning. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by 
large and dangerous waves.
 
3. Heavy rains from Otis will continue to impact areas of southwest
Mexico through Thursday. This rainfall will produce flash and urban
flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
