Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD<br/>
1100 PM PDT Mon Oct 23 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Otis, located a few hundred miles south-southeast of <br/>
Acapulco, Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
1. South of Central America and Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure is likely to form in a couple of days <br/>
over the far eastern Pacific, partially related to the remnants of <br/>
Atlantic Tropical Depression Twenty-One which are forecast to move <br/>
into the region.  Environmental conditions could support some slow <br/>
development of this system by late this week or this weekend while <br/>
the low moves slowly westward to west-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests in elsewhere in southern and southwestern Mexico should
monitor the progress of Otis.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Otis was
located near latitude 13.8 North, longitude 98.0 West. Otis is
moving toward the north-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this
general motion is expected during the next few days.  On the
forecast track, Otis is expected to reach the coast of southern
Mexico on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual strengthening is forecast, and Otis is expected to
be near hurricane strength before it reaches southern Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Otis can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP3 and WMO header WTPZ43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP3.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Otis is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10
inches with maximum amounts of 15 inches through Friday across
Guerrero and the western coastal sections of Oaxaca.  This rainfall
will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas
of higher terrain.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected and hurricane
conditions are possible within the warning area beginning Tuesday
night.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the east of where
the center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Otis will begin to affect portions of the
southern coast of Mexico on Tuesday. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Otis Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Tropical Storm Otis Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP182023
1000 PM CDT Mon Oct 23 2023

Otis has the appearance of a sheared tropical storm this evening, 
with the center on the eastern edge of a relatively new burst of 
deep convection.  The overall satellite intensity estimates still 
support an initial wind speed of 45 kt for this advisory.  Despite 
the shear, recent microwave data indicate that Otis has notable 
low-level structure, with a ring observed in 37 GHz microwave data. 
While this can be associated with rapid intensification, none of 
the models show that intensity change occurring, seemingly due to 
persistent moderate shear and some dry air in the mid-levels.  
Still, it makes sense to stay on the high side of the guidance given 
the structure and very warm SSTs in the path.  Thus, the new NHC 
forecast track is similar to the previous one, showing Otis near 
hurricane strength at landfall between 36-48 hours. 

Otis continues moving slowly north-northwestward at 6 kt in the flow
between a mid- to upper-level trough to its northwest and a ridge to
its east.   This flow will likely cause the storm to move to the 
north-northwest or northwest through landfall.  While most of the 
models respond by bringing Otis to the coast of southern Mexico on 
Wednesday, the GFS model remains an outlier and keeps Otis weaker 
and offshore.  The GFS solution seems very unlikely given the 
overall synoptic pattern, so the NHC track forecast will put little 
weight on its solution, keeping the official forecast about the same 
as the previous one, on the eastern side of the guidance envelope.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Otis will begin to impact areas of southwest
Mexico on Tuesday.  This rainfall will produce flash and urban
flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected and hurricane conditions
are possible beginning late Tuesday along portions of the southern
coast of Mexico, where a Tropical Storm Warning and Hurricane Watch
remain in effect.
