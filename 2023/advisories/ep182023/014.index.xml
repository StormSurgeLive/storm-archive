Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 AM PDT Wed Oct 25 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Otis, located inland over southern Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South of Central America and Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure is likely to form in a day or two over <br/>
the far eastern Pacific, partially related to the remnants of <br/>
Atlantic Tropical Depression Twenty-One. Environmental conditions <br/>
should be conducive for development of this system, and a tropical <br/>
depression will likely form late this week or this weekend while <br/>
the <br/>
low moves slowly westward to west-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern East Pacific:<br/>
An area of low pressure about 1300 miles southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula is producing disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms. Environmental conditions are marginally <br/>
conducive for some slow development of the system during the next <br/>
several days while the low meanders over the southwestern east <br/>
Pacific.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

west of Acapulco, and changed the Hurricane Warning from Acapulco
to Punta Maldonado to a Tropical Storm Warning.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Punta Maldonado westward to Acapulco
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Otis was located
near latitude 18.2 North, longitude 100.6 West.  Otis is moving
toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected through early tonight.  On the forecast track,  
the center of Otis will continue to move farther inland over 
southern Mexico through tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Continued rapid weakening is expected while Otis
moves farther inland over the mountains of Mexico.  Otis will
likely dissipate over southern Mexico tonight.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles
(95 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Otis can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP3 and WMO header WTPZ43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP3.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane-force winds will continue to occur inland over
southern Mexico near the center of Otis this morning, with the
strongest winds atop and on the windward sides of hills and
and mountains.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge and waves along the southern coast of
Mexico are gradually subsiding.
 
RAINFALL:  Otis is expected to produce additional rainfall totals of
4-6 inches (locally as high as 8) through Thursday across Guerrero
and the western coastal sections of Oaxaca.  This rainfall will
produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of
higher terrain.
 
SURF: Swells along the southern coast of Mexico will gradually
subside today.
  
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Hurricane Otis Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP182023
1000 AM CDT Wed Oct 25 2023

The center of Otis continues to move farther inland, and assuming a 
typical overland decay rate, the current intensity estimate is 
reduced to 70 kt.  These hurricane-force winds are likely occurring 
over a small area near the center of the circulation.  Otis should 
continue to weaken rapidly over the rugged terrain of southern 
Mexico today, and the system is expected to dissipate by late 
tonight.
 
Otis is moving north-northwestward at about 345/9 kt.  A ridge to 
the northeast of Otis and a trough to its northwest should
continue to steer the cyclone north-northwestward until dissipation 
in 24 hours.  The official track forecast is very similar to the 
previous advisory.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Hurricane-force winds are still occuring inland over the 
mountainous terrain of southern Mexico near the center of Otis.
 
3. Heavy rains from Otis will continue to impact areas of southwest 
Mexico through Thursday.  This rainfall will produce flash and 
urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
