Tropical Weather Outlook...Corrected<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>

<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Corrected order of systems<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Otis, located roughly a hundred miles south of the southern coast <br/>
of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern East Pacific:<br/>
A weak area of low pressure has formed about 1300 miles southwest <br/>
of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula with some <br/>
associated shower activity.  Upper-level winds could support some <br/>
slow development of the system during the next several days while <br/>
the low meanders over the southwestern east Pacific.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Central America and Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure is likely to form in a day or two over <br/>
the far eastern Pacific, partially related to the remnants of <br/>
Atlantic Tropical Depression Twenty-One which are forecast to move <br/>
into the region.  Environmental conditions should be conducive <br/>
for some development of this system, and a tropical depression <br/>
could form late this week or this weekend while the low moves <br/>
slowly westward to west-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Otis was located
near latitude 15.7 North, longitude 99.6 West. Otis is moving toward
the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h), and a north-
northwestward to northwestward motion is expected during the next
couple of days.  On the forecast track, Otis is expected to reach
the coast of southern Mexico by early Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 145 mph (230 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Otis is a category 4 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional strengthening is 
forecast, and Otis is forecast to be a potentially catastrophic 
category 5 hurricane when the center reaches the coast.  Rapid 
weakening will occur after landfall.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles
(110 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 941 mb (27.79 inches).

This special advisory takes the place of the regularly scheduled 
700 PM CDT intermediate advisory for Otis.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Otis can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP3 and WMO header WTPZ43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP3.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within portions of the 
hurricane warning area by late tonight and Wednesday, with extremely 
destructive winds near the core.  Tropical storm conditions are 
expected to first reach the coast within the warning areas this 
evening, and then spread northwestward within the warning areas 
through Wednesday.
 
STORM SURGE:  A potentially catastrophic storm surge is expected to 
produce life-threatening coastal flooding near and to the east of
where the center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.

RAINFALL:  Otis is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10
inches with maximum amounts of 15 inches through Friday across
Guerrero and the western coastal sections of Oaxaca.  This rainfall
will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas
of higher terrain.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Otis will affect portions of the southern
coast of Mexico during the next couple of days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Otis Special Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP182023
700 PM CDT Tue Oct 24 2023

This special advisory is being issued to update the current and 
forecast intensity of Otis.  Satellite images show that the very 
rapid intensification observed earlier today has continued, and the 
latest data support an initial intensity of 125 kt.  The intensity 
forecast peak is updated to 140 kt, category 5 strength, since the 
environment isn't forecast to change much before landfall, and there 
are no signs of this explosive intensification stopping.  This is 
an extremely dangerous situation, and all preparations for Otis 
should be rushed to completion.

There are no changes to the track or wind radii forecast on this 
advisory, and this special advisory is being issued in lieu of the 
Intermediate Advisory.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Otis is forecast to be a potentially catastrophic Category 5
hurricane when it reaches the southern coast of Mexico late tonight
or early Wednesday, and preparations to protect life and property
should be rushed to completion.
 
2. A potentially catastrophic storm surge is expected to produce
life-threatening coastal flooding near and to the east of where the
center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
3. Heavy rains from Otis will continue to impact areas of southwest
Mexico this week.  This rainfall will produce flash and urban
flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
