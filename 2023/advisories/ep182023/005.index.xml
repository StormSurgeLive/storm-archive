Post-Tropical Cyclone Norma Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172023
900 AM MDT Mon Oct 23 2023
 
Norma made landfall as a tropical depression around 1030 UTC fairly
close to Eldorado in the state of Sinaloa.  The system has lacked
organized deep convection for more than 12 hours, and therefore, no
longer qualifies as a tropical cyclone.  The remnant low is
estimated to have maximum winds around 30 kt, which are likely
confined to the waters just off the coast of Sinaloa.
 
The remnant low is expected to weaken and dissipate over the rugged
terrain of Mexico later today or tonight.  The remnant moisture
could still result in areas of heavy rain in portions of northern
Mexico throughout the day.
 
This is the last NHC advisory on Norma.

MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1002 MB...29.59 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Lagunas de Chacahua to Tecpan de Galeana
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests in elsewhere in southern and southwestern Mexico should
monitor the progress of the Otis.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Otis was
located near latitude 12.0 North, longitude 97.5 West. Otis is
moving toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h). A
north-northwestward motion is expected during the next few days.  On
the forecast track, the center of Otis will reach the southern coast
of Mexico early Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is forecast during the next couple of
days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Otis can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP3 and WMO header WTPZ43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP3.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Otis is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10
inches with maximum amounts of 15 inches through Friday across
Guerrero and the western coastal sections of Oaxaca.  This rainfall
will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas
of higher terrain.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area by Tuesday night.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Otis will begin to affect portions of the 
southern coast of Mexico on Tuesday. These swells are likely to 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Otis Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP182023
1000 AM CDT Mon Oct 23 2023
 
Otis has been relatively steady in strength this morning. Satellite 
images indicate that deep convection has been pulsing during the 
past several hours.  The low-level center remains on the east side 
of the thunderstorm activity due to easterly wind shear. The 
satellite intensity estimates have not changed much, therefore, the 
initial intensity is held at 40 kt.

Otis is moving slowly north-northwestward at 5 kt in the flow 
between a mid- to upper-level trough to its northwest and a ridge to 
its east.  There continues to be significant disagreement among the 
models with the ECMWF showing Otis moving inland in about 48 hours 
while the GFS, HWRF, and HAFS models keep the system offshore during 
the next several days.  A closer inspection of the guidance suggests 
that the differences in these solutions are related to the vertical 
depth and convective organization of Otis in the short term, which 
affects its forward speed.  Since it appears that the ECMWF model 
has the best handle on the short term convective trends, the NHC 
track forecast continues to favor that solution overall.  This 
prediction is a little to the left of the previous one, mostly based 
on the initial position/motion.

Although Otis is expected to remain in a moderate wind shear 
environment, abundant moisture and warm SSTs should support gradual 
strengthening as long as Otis remains offshore.  The NHC intensity 
forecast is a little higher than the previous one, following the 
IVCN and HCCA consensus aids.  Rapid weakening is expected after 
Otis moves inland due to the rugged terrain in southern and 
southwestern Mexico.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Otis will begin to impact areas of southwest
Mexico early this week.  This rainfall will produce flash and urban
flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible by Tuesday night along
portions of the southern coast of Mexico, where a Tropical Storm
Watch is in effect.
