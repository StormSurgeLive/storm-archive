<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Otis, located about 145 miles south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South of Central America and Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure is likely to form in a couple of days <br/>
over the far eastern Pacific, partially related to the remnants of <br/>
Atlantic Tropical Depression Twenty-One which are forecast to move <br/>
into the region.  Environmental conditions could support some slow <br/>
development of this system by late this week or this weekend while <br/>
the low moves slowly westward to west-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Otis was
located near latitude 14.9 North, longitude 99.3 West.  Otis is
moving toward the north-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this
general motion is expected during the next couple of days.  On the
forecast track, Otis is expected to reach the coast of southern
Mexico by early Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Continued strengthening is forecast until 
the center reaches the coastline.  Rapid weakening is likely after 
landfall.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from 
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 
miles (95 km) from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 985 mb (29.09 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Otis can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP3 and WMO header WTPZ43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP3.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Otis is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10
inches with maximum amounts of 15 inches through Friday across
Guerrero and the western coastal sections of Oaxaca.  This rainfall
will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas
of higher terrain.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within portions of the
hurricane warning area by late tonight and Wednesday.  Tropical
storm conditions are expected to first reach the coast within the
warning areas later today or this evening, and then spread
northwestward within the warning areas through Wednesday.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the east of where the
center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Otis will affect portions of the southern
coast of Mexico during the next couple of days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Otis Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP182023
1000 AM CDT Tue Oct 24 2023
 
Satellite imagery indicates that Otis continues to become better
organized.  There is very cold-topped convection with the Central
Dense Overcast surrounded by a number of convective banding
features.  Upper-level outflow is well-defined over most of the
circulation.  Subjective Dvorak intensity estimates range from
55 to 65 kt and the current intensity estimate is set at 60 kt
for this advisory.  An Air Force Reserve Unit Hurricane Hunter
aircraft is scheduled to investigate Otis this afternoon, which
should provide a good estimate of the intensity of the tropical
cyclone.
 
Sea surface temperatures are very warm, around 30 deg C, and the
low-to mid-level humidities are fairly high.  There is weak to
moderate south-southeasterly shear over the system, which is
located on the western periphery of an upper-tropospheric
anticyclone.  Steady strengthening seems likely until Otis makes
landfall within the next day or so.  Based on the current
trends, the official intensity forecast is above most of the model
guidance.  The SHIPS Rapid Intensification (RI) indices show a
greater than normal probability of RI, so some further upward
adjustments to the intensity forecast are possible later today.
Otis should rapidly weaken over the mountains of Mexico after it
moves inland.
 
Otis continues on its north-northwestward track and the initial
motion estimate is 330/7 kt.  A mostly north-northwestward
motion is expected to continue during the next couple of days while
the tropical cyclone moves between a mid- to upper-level trough to
the cyclone's northwest and a ridge to its east.  On this track,
the center should cross the coastline of southern Mexico in a day
or so.  The interaction of the circulation of Otis with the
mountainous terrain of Mexico could induce a slight leftward turn
as the system nears the coastline.  The official track forecast is
fairly close to the previous NHC prediction and on the left side of
the model guidance suite.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Otis is forecast to become a hurricane before it reaches the
southern coast of Mexico late tonight or Wednesday, and hurricane
and tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
southern coast of Mexico where hurricane and tropical storm
warnings are in effect.
 
2. Heavy rains from Otis will begin to impact areas of southwest
Mexico early this week.  This rainfall will produce flash and urban
flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
3. A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce significant
coastal flooding near and to the east of where the center makes
landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large
and destructive waves.
