Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 AM PDT Wed Oct 25 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Otis, located <br/>
inland over southern Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South of Central America and Mexico (EP92):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure has formed over the far eastern <br/>
Pacific, partially related to the remnants of Atlantic Tropical <br/>
Depression Twenty-One. Environmental conditions should be conducive <br/>
for development of this system, and a tropical depression will <br/>
likely form late this week or this weekend while the low moves <br/>
slowly west-northwestward to northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Southwestern East Pacific:<br/>
An area of low pressure about 1300 miles southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula is producing disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms. Environmental conditions are marginally <br/>
conducive for some slow development of this system during the next <br/>
several days while the low meanders over the southwestern east <br/>
Pacific.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
