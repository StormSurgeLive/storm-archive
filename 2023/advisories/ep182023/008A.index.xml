<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Otis, located a couple hundred miles south-southeast of <br/>
Acapulco, Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South of Central America and Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure is likely to form in a couple of days <br/>
over the far eastern Pacific, partially related to the remnants of <br/>
Atlantic Tropical Depression Twenty-One which are forecast to move <br/>
into the region.  Environmental conditions could support some slow <br/>
development of this system by late this week or this weekend while <br/>
the low moves slowly westward to west-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Otis was
located near latitude 14.7 North, longitude 98.6 West.  Otis is
moving toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this
general motion is expected during the next couple of days.  On the
forecast track, Otis is expected to reach the coast of southern
Mexico late tonight or Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast, Otis is expected to become a 
hurricane before it reaches southern Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Otis can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP3 and WMO header WTPZ43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP3.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Otis is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10
inches with maximum amounts of 15 inches through Friday across
Guerrero and the western coastal sections of Oaxaca.  This rainfall
will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas
of higher terrain.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within portions of the
hurricane warning area by late tonight and Wednesday.  Tropical
storm conditions are expected to first reach the coast within the
warning areas later today or this evening, and then spread
northwestward within the warning areas through Wednesday.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the east of where the
center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Otis will affect portions of the southern
coast of Mexico during the next couple of days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

Tropical Storm Otis Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP182023
400 AM CDT Tue Oct 24 2023
 
Otis has strengthened overnight.  There has been a significant 
increase in banding and the center is now well embedded within the 
deep convection.  While there has been no recent microwave imagery 
to evaluate the inner core structure, a couple of earlier ASCAT 
overpass indicated that the center had become embedded within the 
cold cloud tops.  The initial intensity has been increased to 55 kt 
for this advisory, and that is in agreement with subjective Dvorak 
data T-numbers of 3.5 from both SAB and TAFB.  

It appears that the vertical shear over Otis has decreased as there 
has been an expansion of the cirrus outflow over the eastern portion 
of the storm.  The shear is expected to remain light to moderate 
while Otis moves over SSTs of 29-30 degrees C during the next day or 
so.  These conditions should allow for continued strengthening as 
Otis approaches the southern coast of Mexico.  The latest NHC 
intensity forecast calls for Otis to become a hurricane today, and 
it shows additional strengthening before Otis reaches southern 
Mexico in a day or so. By 36 hours, Otis is forecast to be inland, 
and rapid weakening should occur as the cyclone moves over 
mountainous terrain.  The NHC intensity forecast is at the high end 
of the guidance in best agreement with the HWRF and HAFS-B models.  
The SHIPS Rapid Intensification Index now shows about a 1 in 4 
chance of rapid strengthening during the next 24 hours, which 
supports being on the higher side of the guidance. 

Otis is moving north-northwestward at about 7 kt. A north-northwest 
motion is expected to continue during the next couple of days 
between a mid- to upper-level trough to the cyclone's northwest and 
a ridge to its east.  The GFS has finally come onboard with this 
scenario and the track guidance is much more tightly clustered than 
before.  The main difference is in the forward speed with the ECMWF 
being on the faster side of the guidance envelope.  The NHC 
forecast is near a blend of the latest GFS and ECMWF models, which 
is a little faster than the simple consensus aids. 

Based on the updated track and intensity forecast, the government 
of Mexico has issued a Hurricane Warning for a portion of the 
southern coast of Mexico. 

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Otis is forecast to become a hurricane before it reaches the 
southern coast of Mexico late tonight or Wednesday, and hurricane 
and tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the 
southern coast of Mexico where hurricane and tropical storm 
warnings are in effect. 

2. Heavy rains from Otis will begin to impact areas of southern and 
southwestern Mexico later today.  This rainfall will produce flash 
and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.

3. A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce significant 
coastal flooding near and to the east of where the center makes 
landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large 
and destructive waves.
