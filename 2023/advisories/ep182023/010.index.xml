1100 AM PDT Tue Oct 24 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Otis, located about 145 miles south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
South of Central America and Mexico:<br/>
A broad area of low pressure is likely to form in a couple of days <br/>
over the far eastern Pacific, partially related to the remnants of <br/>
Atlantic Tropical Depression Twenty-One which are forecast to move <br/>
into the region.  Environmental conditions could support some slow <br/>
development of this system by late this week or this weekend while <br/>
the low moves slowly westward to west-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Otis was located
near latitude 15.3 North, longitude 99.5 West. Otis is moving 
toward the north- northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h), and a north- 
northwestward to northwestward motion is expected during the
next couple of days.  On the forecast track, Otis is expected to
reach the coast of southern Mexico by early Wednesday.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 125 mph (205 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Otis is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional strengthening is 
forecast, and Otis is expected to be an extremely dangerous 
category 4 hurricane when the center reaches the coast.  Rapid 
weakening will occur after landfall.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles
(110 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Hurricane 
Hunter observations is 960 mb (28.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Otis can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP3 and WMO header WTPZ43 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP3.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Otis is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10
inches with maximum amounts of 15 inches through Friday across
Guerrero and the western coastal sections of Oaxaca.  This rainfall
will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas
of higher terrain.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within portions of the
hurricane warning area by late tonight and Wednesday, with
extremely destructive winds near the core.  Tropical storm
conditions are expected to first reach the coast within the
warning areas later today or this evening, and then spread
northwestward within the warning areas through Wednesday.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous, life-threatening storm surge is expected
to produce significant coastal flooding near and to the east of
where the center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Otis will affect portions of the southern
coast of Mexico during the next couple of days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.

Hurricane Otis Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP182023
400 PM CDT Tue Oct 24 2023
 
Otis has undergone very rapid intensification today.  An eye became
apparent on visible satellite images only a few hours ago, embedded 
in very deep convection.  An Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft
penetrated the eye around 1900 UTC and again around 2000 UTC, and 
found that the maximum sustained winds had increased to near 110 kt 
over a very small area near the center, while the central pressure 
remarkably dropped around 10 mb from the first to the second center 
fix.  The intensity of Otis is well above the Dvorak satellite 
estimates, and again underscores the value of aerial reconnaissance 
in monitoring hurricanes.
 
Otis should remain in an atmospheric and oceanic environment
that will be conducive for further strengthening later today and
tonight.  Vertical wind shear should not be too strong, with SSTs
near 30 deg C.  Based on the observed changes, the short-term  
official intensity forecast remains above the model guidance.  The 
system is now forecast to be at extremely dangerous Category 4 
hurricane status by the time it reaches the coast of southern Mexico 
late tonight or tomorrow morning.  After landfall, the system 
should weaken rapidly over the mountainous terrain of Mexico.
 
The hurricane continues on about the same heading, or around 330/7
kt.  For the next couple of days, Otis should move between a
mid-level ridge to the east and northeast and a trough to its
northwest.  The official track forecast is about the same as the
previous one and is a little faster than the dynamical consensus.
On this track, the center of the hurricane will make landfall
within the hurricane warning area late tonight or early Wednesday.

Key Messages:
 
1. Otis is forecast to be an extremely dangerous Category 4 
hurricane when it reaches the southern coast of Mexico late tonight 
or early Wednesday, and preparations to protect life and property 
should be rushed to completion.

2. A dangerous, life-threatening storm surge is expected to produce 
significant coastal flooding near and to the east of where the 
center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be 
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
3. Heavy rains from Otis will continue to impact areas of southwest
Mexico this week.  This rainfall will produce flash and urban 
flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
