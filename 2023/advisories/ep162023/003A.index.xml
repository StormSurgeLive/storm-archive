Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen-E Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162023
1000 AM CDT Sun Oct 08 2023
 
The system appears to be getting slowly better organized this 
morning, though it remains unclear if a well-defined center has 
formed. An SSMIS pass at 1110 UTC revealed a decent curved 
convective band to the northwest of the best low-level turning, but 
there is a lack of clear evidence of a tighter low-level circulation 
on the low-level 37 GHz channel. First-light visible images on the 
1-minute GOES-18 meso-sector also remain unclear on the circulation 
definition. Thus, the system remains a potential tropical cyclone, 
but given the improvement in banding the initial intensity was 
raised to 30 kt, a bit higher than the TAFB and SAB Dvorak 
estimates.
 
First-light visible imagery suggests the best position of the system 
right now is just a little north and west of overnight estimate, 
resulting in a slow northwest motion at 320/4 kt. The overall track 
reasoning remains unchanged, as the system is expected to move 
north-northwestward or northward over the next 24-36 h, in between a 
mid-level ridge centered to its east over the northwest Caribbean, 
and Tropical Storm Lidia located to its west. This motion should 
bring the system inland over Mexico just beyond 36 h from now. 
However, notable differences in the timing of landfall between the 
guidance remain. The GFS model, in addition to the 
hurricane-regional models based on the GFS initial conditions  
(HWRF, HMON, HAFS-A/B) continue to be much faster than other global 
model guidance such as the ECMWF and CMC. This disagreement is 
likely at least partially related to the fact the disturbance does 
not yet have a well-defined center, and may potentially form further 
north closer to land. For now, the NHC track forecast leans towards 
the slower solutions, but has shifted a bit east compared to the 
previous track, and is a little slower than the consensus aid TVCE.
 
Given the gradually improving structure, the system is expected to 
become a tropical cyclone soon, and most of the intensity guidance 
suggest continued intensification up till landfall. The NHC 
intensity forecast continues to show a peak intensity of 45 kt near 
landfall, which is on the high end of the intensity guidance that 
appears biased by the GFS and its hurricane-regional models that 
bring the system inland faster than shown here. It is notable that 
the ECMWF and CMC show a stronger tropical cyclone than the NHC 
forecast, mainly because they spend a longer period of time 
offshore.
 
Based on the latest forecast showing the system near landfall in   
36 h, the government of Mexico has upgraded the area previously 
under a Tropical Storm Watch to a Warning.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. The disturbance is expected to become a tropical storm before it
approaches the coast of southern Mexico on Monday.  A tropical storm
warning is now in effect for a portion of the coast of southern
Mexico.
 
2. Heavy rains from this system will likely produce flash and urban
flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain
across the states of Guerrero, Michoacan and coastal sections of
western Oaxaca.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was 
located near latitude 16.9 North, longitude 112.8 West. Lidia is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h) and a slow 
northward motion is expected later today, followed by a much 
faster northeastward or east-northeastward motion on Monday and 
Tuesday. On the forecast track, the center of Lidia should approach 
the Islas Marias and the coast of west-central Mexico on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected today, but some 
strengthening is forecast on Monday and Tuesday, and Lidia is 
forecast to be a hurricane when it reaches Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.24 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lidia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP5.shtml

Tropical Storm Lidia Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
900 AM MDT Sun Oct 08 2023
 
Lidia continues to be relatively steady state this morning.  
Geostationary satellite images show little change in the convective 
pattern, and recent microwave data indicate that the system remains 
sheared with the low-level center located on the north side of the 
thunderstorm activity.  There is a large spread in the latest 
satellite intensity estimates that currently range from 49-77 kt.  
Given the structure of Lidia in microwave data, the initial 
wind speed is held steady at 60 kt, closer to the lower end of the 
intensity estimates.

The storm has been moving slowly north-northwestward at about 4 kt 
over the past 12-18 hours.  A turn to the north should occur later 
today, followed by a considerably faster motion to the northeast or 
east-northeast on Monday and Tuesday as a mid- to upper-level trough 
approaches the cyclone.  There is a fair amount of model spread on 
how sharply Lidia turns to the right and how quickly it moves toward 
the coast of Mexico.  The NHC official track forecast has been 
nudged to the left, or north, at 48 and 60 h toward the latest 
consensus aids.  

Given the current structure of Lidia and ongoing mid-level shear, 
little change in strength seems likely during the next day or so.  
However, the models show a more favorable upper-level pattern 
developing over the system on Monday and Tuesday while it moves over 
29-30 C SSTs.  These conditions should allow Lidia to strengthen, 
and it is expected to reach the coast of Mexico by late Tuesday as a 
hurricane.  Rapid weakening is expected after landfall. The NHC 
intensity forecast lies near the middle of the guidance envelope and 
is similar to the previous one.

Based on the latest forecast, Hurricane Watches will likely be 
required for portions of west-central Mexico later today. 
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Lidia is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane while it moves
toward the west-central coast of Mexico on Tuesday. There is an
increasing risk of strong winds and heavy rain for the Islas Marias
and portions of the west-central coast of Mexico. Interests in these
locations should closely monitor the latest forecast updates, as
watches will likely be required later today or tonight.
 
2. Swells from Lidia will cause dangerous surf and rip current
conditions along the west coast of Mexico and the Baja California
peninsula during the next few days.
