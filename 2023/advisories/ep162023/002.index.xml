Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen-E Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162023
400 AM CDT Sun Oct 08 2023

This system has become a bit better organized since the last 
advisory with increased convection near the cloud system center.  
Still, there's not much curvature to the thunderstorm activity and 
no clear signs that the system has become a tropical cyclone, 
although it is closer than yesterday.  So the system will remain 
a potential tropical cyclone, and the initial wind speed is held at 
25 kt, consistent with earlier ship data.  

Much of this forecast is based on the previous NHC prediction since 
there hasn't been a lot of in situ or microwave data overnight.  
The initial motion estimate remains northwest at 6 kt.  The system
is forecast to turn north-northwestward late today between a 
mid-level ridge to its east and Tropical Storm Lidia to its west.  
This motion should bring the center of the system near the southern 
coast of Mexico in about 36-48 hours.  The GFS seems 
unrealistically fast with landfall in less than 24 hours given the 
flow regime.  Only a small adjustment to the left was made to the 
previous forecast, near but slower than the consensus aids.

The disturbance has some chance to intensify over very warm waters 
in moderate shear conditions. Model guidance has generally come 
down, however, but this appears to be due to the GFS-based 
guidance having too fast of a forward speed, which limits the 
system's time over water, rather than a change in the near-term 
environment. Little change was made to the previous forecast, though 
this prediction is now on the higher side of the guidance envelope.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. The disturbance is expected to become a tropical storm before it
approaches the coast of southern Mexico on Monday.  A tropical storm
watch remains in effect, and tropical storm warnings could be 
required later today for a portion of the coast of southern Mexico.
 
2. Heavy rains from this system will likely produce flash and urban
flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain
across the states of Guerrero and Michoacan.

...LIDIA SLIGHTLY STRONGER...
...FORECAST TO APPROACH THE WEST COAST OF MEXICO AS A HURRICANE
EARLY NEXT WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM MDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.1N 112.6W
ABOUT 580 MI...935 KM WSW OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
ABOUT 500 MI...805 KM SSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...70 MPH...110 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 285 DEGREES AT 3 MPH...6 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...990 MB...29.24 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the Islas Marias and along the west-central coast of
Mexico should monitor the progress of this system. Watches could be
required for portions of these areas on Sunday.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM MDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was 
located near latitude 16.1 North, longitude 112.6 West. Lidia is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h). A gradual turn 
toward the north is expected on Sunday, followed by a faster 
northeastward motion on Monday and Tuesday. On the forecast track, 
the center of Lidia should approach the Islas Marias and the coast 
of west-central Mexico early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Some gradual strengthening is expected through 
early next week, and Lidia is forecast to become a hurricane by 
early Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.24 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lidia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone 
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC 
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP5.shtml

SURF: Swells generated by Lidia will affect the west coast of Mexico
and the Baja California peninsula for the next several days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM MDT.

Tropical Storm Lidia Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
900 PM MDT Sat Oct 07 2023
 
The satellite presentation of Lidia has improved since yesterday. 
Recent AMSR2 and SSMIS passive microwave images show signs of a 
mid-level eye feature in the 89 GHz channel. However, the vortex 
still appears tilted, with the low-level 37 GHz center situated to 
the northeast of the mid-level center. While the upper-level outflow 
is still restricted on the eastern side of the storm, the center has 
been located deeper underneath the cold convective canopy today. As 
a result, the satellite intensity estimates have risen, but they 
seem a little high based on the earlier ASCAT data. The initial 
intensity is raised to 60 kt, which is in best agreement with recent 
UW-CIMSS SATCON and D-PRINT estimates.
 
The moderate easterly shear over Lidia is forecast to persist for 
another 12-24 h, then weaken into early next week. The weaker 
shear should allow Lidia to become more vertically aligned and 
strengthen within a diffluent upper-level environment while moving 
over very warm waters. Most of the intensity guidance shows 
strengthening after 24 h while Lidia moves toward the coast of 
Mexico. The regional hurricane models (HAFS, HWRF, HMON) show some 
potential for significant intensification, and overall it appears 
more likely that Lidia reaches the coast at hurricane strength early 
next week. As a result, the NHC intensity forecast has been raised 
at 24-72 h, though it still lies below the IVCN and HCCA aids. Given 
the large spread noted in the intensity guidance, future adjustments 
are certainly possible. 
 
Lidia has not moved much since the last advisory, and its estimated 
initial motion is west-northwestward or 285/3 kt. The storm is 
expected to slowly turn northward on Sunday while moving around the 
western periphery of a mid-level ridge. Then, the southwesterly flow 
ahead of an upper-level trough to the north will cause Lidia to 
accelerate northeastward toward the west-central coast of Mexico. 
The largest spread in the track models is related to the forward 
speed of Lidia while it interacts with the trough. The GFS brings 
Lidia inland over mainland Mexico about 24 h earlier than the rest 
of the global models, and thus there is more uncertainty in the 
longer-range track forecast. For now, the NHC track follows a 
consensus approach and lies between the TVCE and HCCA aids, similar 
to but slightly faster than the previous prediction.


Key Messages:

1. Lidia is forecast to strengthen to a hurricane while it moves 
toward the west-central coast of Mexico early next week. There is an 
increasing risk of strong winds and heavy rain for the Islas Marias 
and portions of the west-central coast of Mexico. Interests in these 
locations should closely monitor the latest forecast updates, as 
watches could be required as early as Sunday.

2. Swells from Lidia will cause dangerous surf and rip current 
conditions along the west coast of Mexico and the Baja California 
peninsula during the next several days.
