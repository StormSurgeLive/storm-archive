DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Max was
located near latitude 16.3 North, longitude 101.9 West. Max is
moving toward the north-northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h), and a 
gradual northward and then north-northeastward turn is expected 
tonight and during the day on Monday. Max is forecast to reach the 
coast of southern Mexico within the warning area by late Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast during the next 24 hours before landfall, 
and rapid weakening is expected after the system moves inland on 
Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Max can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP1.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Max is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches with local maxima of 12 inches through Tuesday across the
states of Guerrero, Michoacan and the coastal sections of western
Oaxaca in southwest Mexico. These rains will likely produce flash
and urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of
higher terrain near the coast.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area on Monday, making outside preparations
difficult or dangerous.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 AM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

Tropical Storm Max Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162023
1000 PM CDT Sun Oct 08 2023
 
Tropical Depression Sixteen-E has strengthened into Tropical Storm 
Max. Visible and infrared satellite imagery this evening indicates 
that the system maintains a well-defined center, which was further 
confirmed by recent AMSR-2 and SSMIS microwave passes. 
Additionally, deep convection, which was only loosely organized 
over a large area for most of the day, has increased in intensity 
tonight in a concentrated area to the southwest of the center. 
Subjective intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB have increased, and 
objective estimates from UW-CIMSS also support an increase in 
intensity since the prior advisory. Thus, the initial intensity for 
this advisory is set at 35 kt. 

Max is continuing to move north-northwestward at 340/5 kt. The 
storm is expected to gradually turn northward and eventually 
north-northeastward tonight and tomorrow. The primary steering 
influences are a mid-level ridge over the Caribbean Sea to the 
storm's east, and Tropical Storm Lidia to its west. Max is expected 
to make landfall in the next 24 h or so, although some uncertainty 
remains in the exact timing and location, with global models 
differing in the forward speed. Regardless of the exact timing and 
landfall location, tropical storm impacts are expected to occur far 
from the landfall location. The current NHC forecast represents a 
blend of the TVCN and HCCA consensus aids, and it is slightly west 
of the prior forecast.

The current intensity forecast indicates intensification prior to 
landfall in Mexico. Some of the dynamical models indicate 
intensification in the next 12-24 h, but with limited time 
before landfall and moderate easterly wind shear that will persist 
through tomorrow, the system is expected to remain a tropical 
storm at landfall. After landfall, Max is forecast to weaken rapidly 
as it interacts with the mountainous terrain of southern Mexico. 
However, this interaction of the storm's circulation with the 
terrain is likely to result in heavy rainfall as the storm 
dissipates and its remnants continue moving inland on Tuesday. The 
NHC intensity forecast is similar to the prior forecast and is on 
the high end of the guidance envelope. 
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Max is forecast to bring tropical storm conditions to portions 
of the southern coast of Mexico on Monday where a Tropical Storm
Warning remains in effect.
 
2. Heavy rains from this system will likely produce flash and urban
flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain
across the states of Guerrero, Michoacan and coastal sections of
western Oaxaca.

A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in west-central Mexico and the southern portion
of the Baja California peninsula should monitor the progress of
Lidia.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM MDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was
located near latitude 18.2 North, longitude 112.6 West. Lidia is
moving toward the north near 7 mph (11 km/h). A faster
northeastward or east-northeastward motion is expected on Monday and
Tuesday. On the forecast track, the center of Lidia should approach
the Islas Marias and the coast of west-central Mexico on Tuesday, 
and move inland over west-central Mexico Tuesday night. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected overnight.  
Strengthening is forecast on Monday and Tuesday, and Lidia is 
expected to be a hurricane when it approaches the Islas Marias 
and the coast of west-central Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.24 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lidia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP5.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8 
inches with local maxima of 12 inches through Wednesday across the 
state of Nayarit, southern portions of the state of Sinaloa, and 
coastal portions of the state of Jalisco in western Mexico. These 
rains will likely produce flash and urban flooding, along with 
possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain near the coast.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the south of where
the center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area by
late Tuesday, with tropical storm conditions possible on Tuesday.
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the Tropical Storm Watch
areas beginning Tuesday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Lidia will affect the west coast of Mexico
and the Baja California peninsula for the next few days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Lidia Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
900 PM MDT Sun Oct 08 2023
 
Lidia's convective structure has become somewhat less organized
since this afternoon. The cloud tops have warmed and there has been
an overall decrease in the deep convection near the center.  There 
were some arc clouds noted in late evening visible satellite 
images which suggests the system may have entrained some drier 
mid-level air.  Despite the recent loss of organization, the 
initial intensity is held at 60 kt, which is a blend of the 
various subjective and objective satellite estimates. 

It is interesting to note that simulated satellite imagery from 
the 18Z GFS and regional hurricane models showed a decrease in 
convection this evening, but they also indicated a return of the 
convection overnight, which is expected to lead to strengthening on 
Monday.  The upper-level winds over the system are forecast to 
become more conducive for strengthening while Lidia moves over 
slightly warmer SSTs on its approach to west-central Mexico.  Much 
of the dynamical model guidance calls for steady strengthening 
beginning tomorrow, and the latest NHC forecast shows a slightly 
higher peak intensity before landfall.  This is in good agreement 
within the latest HFIP corrected consensus model.  It should be 
mentioned that if Lidia is able to finally able to establish an 
inner core within the next 12-24 hours, this intensity forecast 
could be on the conservative side.  Rapid weakening is expected 
after Lidia moves inland over west-central Mexico.  A 72-hour point 
is provided for continuity but it is very likely that the cyclone 
will have dissipated by that time. 

Lidia is moving northward or 010 degrees at 6 kt.  A faster motion 
to the northeast and east-northeast is expected on Monday and 
Tuesday as a mid- to upper-level trough approaches the storm from 
the northwest.  The track guidance has not changed much this cycle, 
with the GFS still quite a bit faster than the remainder of the 
dynamical aids.  The NHC track forecast remains near the latest 
consensus models, and is very similar to the previous official 
forecast.  
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Lidia is expected to strengthen before it reaches west-central
Mexico, and hurricane and tropical storm conditions are possible in
the watch areas beginning Tuesday.
 
2. Heavy rains from Lidia will likely produce flash and urban
flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain
across the the state of Nayarit, southern portions of the state of 
Sinaloa, and coastal  portions of the state of Jalisco in western 
Mexico.

3.  A dangerous storm surge is expected near and to the south where 
the center of Lidia moves over the Islas Marias and the coast of 
west-central Mexico.  
 
4. Swells from Lidia will cause dangerous surf and rip current
conditions along the west coast of Mexico and the Baja California
peninsula during the next few days.
