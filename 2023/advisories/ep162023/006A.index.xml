WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Acapulco to Punta San Telmo
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case in the
next 24 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Max was 
located near latitude 16.9 North, longitude 101.4 West. Max is 
moving toward the north near 5 mph (8 km/h) and this motion is 
expected to continue through Tuesday.  On the forecast track, Max 
should make landfall later today within the warning area, then move 
farther inland over southern Mexico.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Max could intensify up until it makes landfall later 
today, with rapid weakening expected afterwards. Max should 
dissipate over Mexico on Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Max can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP1.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Max is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches with local maxima of 12 inches through Tuesday across the
states of Guerrero, Michoacan and the coastal sections of western
Oaxaca in southwest Mexico. These rains will likely produce flash
and urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of
higher terrain near the coast.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring in the warning area
and expected to overspread the warning area throughout the day.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Max will affect the southern coast of
Mexico for the next day or two.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

Tropical Storm Max Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162023
400 AM CDT Mon Oct 09 2023

Satellite images indicate that Max has become better organized, 
with a large burst of convection near the center and a well-defined 
banding feature in the southern semicircle of the storm.  Recent 
scatterometer data indicates maximum winds of 40-45 kt, so the 
initial wind speed is set to 45 kt on this advisory.  Further 
strengthening is possible in a conducive environment before Max 
makes landfall later today.  Rapid weakening is then anticipated 
this evening over the high terrain of Mexico.  The new forecast is 
similar to the previous one, but a bit higher due to the initial 
intensity. 

Max has turned northward or 010/5 kt this morning, and this general 
motion is forecast until landfall later today.  The biggest 
change on this advisory is that the landfall of Max is expected to 
be sooner and farther east than before, which is consistent with 
recent trends and the latest model solutions. Max should dissipate 
over southern Mexico early on Tuesday.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Max is forecast to continue bringing tropical storm conditions 
today to portions of the southern coast of Mexico where a Tropical 
Storm Warning remains in effect.
 
2. Heavy rains from this system will likely produce flash and urban
flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain
across the states of Guerrero and Michoacan.

A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected 
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued  
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of 
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside 
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life 
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in west-central Mexico and the southern portion
of the Baja California peninsula should monitor the progress of
Lidia.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM MDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was
located near latitude 18.4 North, longitude 112.1 West. Lidia is
moving toward the northeast near 5 mph (7 km/h). A faster
northeastward to east-northeastward motion is expected later today
and Tuesday. On the forecast track, the center of Lidia should
approach Las Islas Marias and the coast of west-central Mexico on
Tuesday, and move inland over west-central Mexico Tuesday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Strengthening is forecast later today and Tuesday, and Lidia 
is expected to be a hurricane when it approaches Las Islas Marias 
and the coast of west-central Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lidia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP5.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches with local maxima of 12 inches through Wednesday across the
state of Nayarit, southern portions of the state of Sinaloa, and
coastal portions of the state of Jalisco in western Mexico. These
rains will likely produce flash and urban flooding, along with
possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain near the coast.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the south of where
the center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the warning area
on Tuesday.  Winds are expected to first reach tropical storm
strength for the warning area by early Tuesday, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous. Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion. Hurricane conditions
are possible within the watch area by late Tuesday, with tropical
storm conditions possible on Tuesday. Tropical storm conditions are
possible in the Tropical Storm Watch areas beginning Tuesday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Lidia will affect the west coast of Mexico
and the Baja California peninsula for the next few days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Lidia Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
300 AM MDT Mon Oct 09 2023
 
Lidia's convective structure has improved during the last several 
hours with deep bursts of convection, and cold cloud tops near -90 
degrees Celsius at times. The low-level center has become embedded 
beneath this recent burst as well. There is a fairly large range of 
intensity estimates this advisory cycle, however. Subjective Dvorak 
satellite final-T intensity estimates are a T4.0/ 65 kts, from both 
TAFB and SAB. Objective satellite estimates from UW-CIMSS ADT and 
AiDT are 51 kt and 61 kt, respectively. An ASCAT-B pass from a few 
hours ago depicted a much weaker wind field around 35 kt, although 
the convective pattern has markedly improved since that time. Using 
a blend of these data, the initial intensity is set to an uncertain 
55 kt for this advisory. The Air Force Hurricane Hunters are 
scheduled to investigate the system later this afternoon, which will 
provide valuable in-situ data to bring clarity to Lidia's intensity.
 
Vertical wind shear over the system is forecast to relax over the 
next 24-36 hr while Lidia moves over warm sea surface temperatures 
on its approach to west-central Mexico.  Models are in fairly good 
agreement with this strengthening scenario, and Lidia is forecast 
to become a hurricane late today, with the peak intensity unchanged 
from the previous advisory of 85 kt when the system is near the 
coast of Mexico. The NHC intensity forecast lies near the HFIP 
corrected consensus model, on the higher side of the guidance. 
After Lidia makes landfall, rapid weakening is expected given the 
high terrain, and the system is now forecast to dissipate by 60 h.
 
Lidia is moving north-northeastward or 020 degrees at 4 kt.  A 
faster motion to the northeast and east-northeast is expected later 
today and Tuesday as a mid- to upper-level trough approaches the 
system. The track guidance has shifted slightly south this 
cycle, with still some along-track timing differences with the GFS 
being the fastest.  The NHC track forecast has been nudged 
southward and lies near the various consensus aids.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Lidia is expected to strengthen before it reaches west-central 
Mexico, and hurricane conditions are expected within the Hurricane 
Warning area on Tuesday, and hurricane and tropical storm 
conditions are possible in the watch areas beginning Tuesday.
 
2. Heavy rains from Lidia will likely produce flash and urban
flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain
across the the state of Nayarit, southern portions of the state of
Sinaloa, and coastal portions of the state of Jalisco in western
Mexico.
 
3. A dangerous storm surge is expected near and to the south where
the center of Lidia moves over the Islas Marias and the coast of
west-central Mexico.
 
4. Swells from Lidia will cause dangerous surf and rip current
conditions along the west coast of Mexico and the Baja California
peninsula during the next few days.
