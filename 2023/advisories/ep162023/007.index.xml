WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Acapulco to Punta San Telmo
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case over the
next 12 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Max was 
located near latitude 17.1 North, longitude 101.2 West. Max is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 5 mph (7 km/h) and this 
motion is expected to continue through tomorrow.  On the forecast 
track, Max should make landfall by this afternoon within the warning 
area, then move farther inland over southern Mexico.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Max could intensify up until it makes landfall this afternoon, with 
rapid weakening expected afterwards. Max should dissipate over 
Mexico on Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) 
from the center. In the past few hours, a surface observing station 
at Puerto Vicente Guerrero reported a wind gust of 41 mph        
(65 km/h). 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches). A 
surface observing station at Puerto Vicente Guerrero recent reported 
a minimum surface pressure of 1000 mb (29.53 inches). 
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Max can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP1.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Max is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches with local maxima of 12 inches through Tuesday across the
states of Guerrero and Michoacan. These rains will likely produce
flash and urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of
higher terrain near the coast.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring in the warning area
and expected to overspread the warning area throughout the day.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Max will affect the southern coast of
Mexico for the next day or two.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Max Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162023
400 AM CDT Mon Oct 09 2023

Satellite images indicate that Max has become better organized, 
with a large burst of convection near the center and a well-defined 
banding feature in the southern semicircle of the storm.  Recent 
scatterometer data indicates maximum winds of 40-45 kt, so the 
initial wind speed is set to 45 kt on this advisory.  Further 
strengthening is possible in a conducive environment before Max 
makes landfall later today.  Rapid weakening is then anticipated 
this evening over the high terrain of Mexico.  The new forecast is 
similar to the previous one, but a bit higher due to the initial 
intensity. 

Max has turned northward or 010/5 kt this morning, and this general 
motion is forecast until landfall later today.  The biggest 
change on this advisory is that the landfall of Max is expected to 
be sooner and farther east than before, which is consistent with 
recent trends and the latest model solutions. Max should dissipate 
over southern Mexico early on Tuesday.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Max is forecast to continue bringing tropical storm conditions 
today to portions of the southern coast of Mexico where a Tropical 
Storm Warning remains in effect.
 
2. Heavy rains from this system will likely produce flash and urban
flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain
across the states of Guerrero and Michoacan.

preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in west-central Mexico and the southern portion
of the Baja California peninsula should monitor the progress of
Lidia.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was
located near latitude 18.5 North, longitude 111.8 West. Lidia is
moving toward the northeast near 6 mph (9 km/h). A faster
northeastward to east-northeastward motion is expected later today
and Tuesday. On the forecast track, the center of Lidia should
approach Las Islas Marias on Tuesday, and move inland over 
west-central Mexico Tuesday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast later today and Tuesday, and Lidia
is expected to be a hurricane when it approaches Las Islas Marias
and the coast of west-central Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lidia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP5.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches with local maxima of 12 inches through Wednesday across the
state Nayarit, southern portions of the state of Sinaloa, and
coastal portions of the state of Jalisco in western Mexico. These
rains will likely produce flash and urban flooding, along with
possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain near the coast.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the south of where
the center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the warning area
on Tuesday, with winds expected to first reach tropical
storm strength by early Tuesday, making outside preparations
difficult or dangerous. Preparations to protect life and property
should be rushed to completion. Tropical storm conditions are
expected in the Tropical Storm Warning areas beginning Tuesday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Lidia will affect the west coast of Mexico
and the Baja California peninsula for the next few days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Lidia Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
900 AM MDT Mon Oct 09 2023
 
Deep convection has been on the increase during the past several
hours, but it is unclear if it has resulted in Lidia strengthening
yet.  Throughout Lidia's lifespan, there has been notable
uncertainty in the initial intensity, and it is no different at the
current time.  The latest satellite intensity estimates span from
47 to 65 kt, and based on that data, the initial intensity is held
at 55 kt.  However, the ASCAT data mentioned in the previous
discussion supported a lower wind speed estimate.  The Air Force
Hurricane Hunters are currently en route to investigate Lidia, and
the data they collect should provide very valuable information in
estimating Lidia's intensity and structure.
 
Lidia has made the expected turn to the northeast, and the initial
motion is now estimated to be 045/5 kt.  A mid- to upper-level 
trough that is approaching Lidia should cause the storm to 
accelerate to the northeast or east-northeast later today through 
Tuesday.  The models are in fair agreement on the overall path of 
Lidia, but there is still a significant spread in the timing of 
landfall with the GFS showing Lidia reaching the coast about 12 
hours before the ECMWF shows landfall.  The NHC track forecast 
continues to lie between those solutions and remains close to the 
various consensus models.  Based on the forecast approach, Lidia 
will likely reach the coast by late Tuesday.

The environmental conditions are becoming increasingly conducive for 
strengthening.  The storm is expected to move over SSTs near 30 C 
and into a conducive upper-level wind pattern related to a favorable 
trough interaction for the system.  The models show significant or 
rapid strengthening before Lidia reaches the coast, and the forecast 
continues to follow suit and lies near the middle of the guidance 
envelope.  Rapid weakening is forecast once Lidia moves inland due 
to the rugged terrain in west-central Mexico.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Lidia is expected to strengthen before it reaches west-central
Mexico, and hurricane conditions are expected within the Hurricane
Warning area beginning Tuesday.
 
2. Heavy rains from Lidia will likely produce flash and urban 
flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain 
across the the state of Nayarit, southern portions of the state of 
Sinaloa, and coastal portions of the state of Jalisco in western 
Mexico.

3. A dangerous storm surge is expected near and to the south of 
where the center of Lidia moves over the Islas Marias and the coast 
of west-central Mexico.
 
4. Swells from Lidia will cause dangerous surf and rip current
conditions along the west coast of Mexico and the Baja California
peninsula during the next few days.
