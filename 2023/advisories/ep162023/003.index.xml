* Acapulco to Punta San Telmo
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the disturbance was centered near 
latitude 15.0 North, longitude 101.1 West. The system is moving 
toward the northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h). A slow northwestward to 
north-northwestward motion is forecast to continue through late 
Monday. On the forecast track, the center of the disturbance is 
forecast to reach the coast of southern Mexico within the warning 
area by late Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and this
system is forecast to become a tropical storm by this evening.
 
Satellite imagery indicate the system is gradually becoming better
organized, and it is forecast to become a tropical depression or
storm later today.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for the disturbance can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header
WTPZ41 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP1.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  The system is expected to produce rainfall totals of 4 to
8 inches with local maxima of 12 inches through Tuesday across the
states of Guerrero, Michoacan and the coastal sections of western
Oaxaca in southwest Mexico. These rains will likely produce flash
and urban flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher
terrain near the coast.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area on Monday, making outside preparations
difficult or dangerous.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen-E Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162023
400 AM CDT Sun Oct 08 2023

This system has become a bit better organized since the last 
advisory with increased convection near the cloud system center.  
Still, there's not much curvature to the thunderstorm activity and 
no clear signs that the system has become a tropical cyclone, 
although it is closer than yesterday.  So the system will remain 
a potential tropical cyclone, and the initial wind speed is held at 
25 kt, consistent with earlier ship data.  

Much of this forecast is based on the previous NHC prediction since 
there hasn't been a lot of in situ or microwave data overnight.  
The initial motion estimate remains northwest at 6 kt.  The system
is forecast to turn north-northwestward late today between a 
mid-level ridge to its east and Tropical Storm Lidia to its west.  
This motion should bring the center of the system near the southern 
coast of Mexico in about 36-48 hours.  The GFS seems 
unrealistically fast with landfall in less than 24 hours given the 
flow regime.  Only a small adjustment to the left was made to the 
previous forecast, near but slower than the consensus aids.

The disturbance has some chance to intensify over very warm waters 
in moderate shear conditions. Model guidance has generally come 
down, however, but this appears to be due to the GFS-based 
guidance having too fast of a forward speed, which limits the 
system's time over water, rather than a change in the near-term 
environment. Little change was made to the previous forecast, though 
this prediction is now on the higher side of the guidance envelope.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. The disturbance is expected to become a tropical storm before it
approaches the coast of southern Mexico on Monday.  A tropical storm
watch remains in effect, and tropical storm warnings could be 
required later today for a portion of the coast of southern Mexico.
 
2. Heavy rains from this system will likely produce flash and urban
flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain
across the states of Guerrero and Michoacan.

...FORECAST TO APPROACH THE WEST COAST OF MEXICO AS A HURRICANE
ON TUESDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM MDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.9N 112.8W

Interests in the Islas Marias and along the west-central coast of
Mexico should monitor the progress of this system. Watches will
likely be required for portions of these areas later today.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was 
located near latitude 16.9 North, longitude 112.8 West. Lidia is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h) and a slow 
northward motion is expected later today, followed by a much 
faster northeastward or east-northeastward motion on Monday and 
Tuesday. On the forecast track, the center of Lidia should approach 
the Islas Marias and the coast of west-central Mexico on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected today, but some 
strengthening is forecast on Monday and Tuesday, and Lidia is 
forecast to be a hurricane when it reaches Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.24 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lidia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP5.shtml
 
SURF: Swells generated by Lidia will affect the west coast of Mexico
and the Baja California peninsula for the next few days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 PM MDT.

Tropical Storm Lidia Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
900 AM MDT Sun Oct 08 2023
 
Lidia continues to be relatively steady state this morning.  
Geostationary satellite images show little change in the convective 
pattern, and recent microwave data indicate that the system remains 
sheared with the low-level center located on the north side of the 
thunderstorm activity.  There is a large spread in the latest 
satellite intensity estimates that currently range from 49-77 kt.  
Given the structure of Lidia in microwave data, the initial 
wind speed is held steady at 60 kt, closer to the lower end of the 
intensity estimates.

The storm has been moving slowly north-northwestward at about 4 kt 
over the past 12-18 hours.  A turn to the north should occur later 
today, followed by a considerably faster motion to the northeast or 
east-northeast on Monday and Tuesday as a mid- to upper-level trough 
approaches the cyclone.  There is a fair amount of model spread on 
how sharply Lidia turns to the right and how quickly it moves toward 
the coast of Mexico.  The NHC official track forecast has been 
nudged to the left, or north, at 48 and 60 h toward the latest 
consensus aids.  

Given the current structure of Lidia and ongoing mid-level shear, 
little change in strength seems likely during the next day or so.  
However, the models show a more favorable upper-level pattern 
developing over the system on Monday and Tuesday while it moves over 
29-30 C SSTs.  These conditions should allow Lidia to strengthen, 
and it is expected to reach the coast of Mexico by late Tuesday as a 
hurricane.  Rapid weakening is expected after landfall. The NHC 
intensity forecast lies near the middle of the guidance envelope and 
is similar to the previous one.

Based on the latest forecast, Hurricane Watches will likely be 
required for portions of west-central Mexico later today. 
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Lidia is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane while it moves
toward the west-central coast of Mexico on Tuesday. There is an
increasing risk of strong winds and heavy rain for the Islas Marias
and portions of the west-central coast of Mexico. Interests in these
locations should closely monitor the latest forecast updates, as
watches will likely be required later today or tonight.
 
2. Swells from Lidia will cause dangerous surf and rip current
conditions along the west coast of Mexico and the Baja California
peninsula during the next few days.
