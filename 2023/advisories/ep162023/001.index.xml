Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162023
1000 PM CDT Sat Oct 07 2023

A couple of SSMIS microwave overpasses this evening show that 
the disturbance (EP99) located a couple of hundred miles south of 
Acapulco, Mexico, is becoming better organized. There is evidence 
of some curved banding over the southwestern portion of the 
system.  While the disturbance does not have enough organization to 
be a classified as a tropical cyclone, it is expected to develop 
into one within the next day or so, and the forecast track brings it 
near the southern coast of Mexico within the next 36 to 48 hours.  
Therefore, Potential Tropical Cyclone advisories are being initiated 
in order to issue a Tropical Storm Watch for a portion of the 
southern coast of Mexico.  The initial intensity of the disturbance 
is set at 25 kt, which is supported by a couple of earlier ship 
observations. 

Since the system is still in its formative stage, the initial motion 
estimate is a somewhat uncertain 310 degrees at 6 kt.  The system 
is forecast to move northwestward overnight, but it should turn 
north-northwestward on Sunday between a mid-level ridge to its east 
and Tropical Storm Lidia to its west.  This motion should bring the 
center of the system near the southern coast of Mexico in about 48 
hours.  The GFS is much faster than the remainder of the global 
model guidance and takes the center ashore in a little more than 24 
hours, while the ECMWF and UKMET models are about 12 to 24 hours 
slower.  The NHC track forecast is near the various consensus aids, 
accounting for the variations in forward speed.

The disturbance is located within a moist atmosphere and over SSTs 
of 29-30 degrees C. However, the upper-level environment is not as 
conducive as there is currently moderate to strong vertical wind 
shear over the system.  The shear is forecast to relax during the 
next day or two, and this should allow the system to develop into a 
tropical cyclone and strengthen into a tropical storm before it 
reaches the southern coast of Mexico.  The NHC intensity forecast 
shows a peak that is similar to the latest HFIP corrected consensus 
aid.  After landfall, rapid weakening is expected, and the system 
is forecast to dissipate by 72 hours. 

Key Messages:

1. The disturbance is expected to become a tropical storm before it 
approaches the coast of southern Mexico on Monday.  A tropical storm 
watch has been issued for a portion of the southern coast of Mexico.

2. Heavy rains from this system will likely produce flash and urban 
flooding, along with possible mudslides in areas of higher terrain 
across the states of Guerrero and Michoacan.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM MDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was 
located near latitude 16.1 North, longitude 112.6 West. Lidia is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h). A gradual turn 
toward the north is expected on Sunday, followed by a faster 
northeastward motion on Monday and Tuesday. On the forecast track, 
the center of Lidia should approach the Islas Marias and the coast 
of west-central Mexico early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Some gradual strengthening is expected through 
early next week, and Lidia is forecast to become a hurricane by 
early Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.24 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Tropical Storm Lidia Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152023
900 PM MDT Sat Oct 07 2023
 
The satellite presentation of Lidia has improved since yesterday. 
Recent AMSR2 and SSMIS passive microwave images show signs of a 
mid-level eye feature in the 89 GHz channel. However, the vortex 
still appears tilted, with the low-level 37 GHz center situated to 
the northeast of the mid-level center. While the upper-level outflow 
is still restricted on the eastern side of the storm, the center has 
been located deeper underneath the cold convective canopy today. As 
a result, the satellite intensity estimates have risen, but they 
seem a little high based on the earlier ASCAT data. The initial 
intensity is raised to 60 kt, which is in best agreement with recent 
UW-CIMSS SATCON and D-PRINT estimates.
 
The moderate easterly shear over Lidia is forecast to persist for 
another 12-24 h, then weaken into early next week. The weaker 
shear should allow Lidia to become more vertically aligned and 
strengthen within a diffluent upper-level environment while moving 
over very warm waters. Most of the intensity guidance shows 
strengthening after 24 h while Lidia moves toward the coast of 
Mexico. The regional hurricane models (HAFS, HWRF, HMON) show some 
potential for significant intensification, and overall it appears 
more likely that Lidia reaches the coast at hurricane strength early 
next week. As a result, the NHC intensity forecast has been raised 
at 24-72 h, though it still lies below the IVCN and HCCA aids. Given 
the large spread noted in the intensity guidance, future adjustments 
are certainly possible. 
 
Lidia has not moved much since the last advisory, and its estimated 
initial motion is west-northwestward or 285/3 kt. The storm is 
expected to slowly turn northward on Sunday while moving around the 
western periphery of a mid-level ridge. Then, the southwesterly flow 
ahead of an upper-level trough to the north will cause Lidia to 
accelerate northeastward toward the west-central coast of Mexico. 
The largest spread in the track models is related to the forward 
speed of Lidia while it interacts with the trough. The GFS brings 
Lidia inland over mainland Mexico about 24 h earlier than the rest 
of the global models, and thus there is more uncertainty in the 
longer-range track forecast. For now, the NHC track follows a 
consensus approach and lies between the TVCE and HCCA aids, similar 
to but slightly faster than the previous prediction.


Key Messages:

1. Lidia is forecast to strengthen to a hurricane while it moves 
toward the west-central coast of Mexico early next week. There is an 
increasing risk of strong winds and heavy rain for the Islas Marias 
and portions of the west-central coast of Mexico. Interests in these 
locations should closely monitor the latest forecast updates, as 
watches could be required as early as Sunday.

2. Swells from Lidia will cause dangerous surf and rip current 
conditions along the west coast of Mexico and the Baja California 
peninsula during the next several days.
