BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Philippe Advisory Number  31
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 PM AST Sat Sep 30 2023
 
...PHILIPPE REMAINS DISORGANIZED...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.1N 57.0W
ABOUT 430 MI...690 KM ESE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...SW OR 235 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, the U.S. and British
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of this
system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 16.1 North, longitude 57.0 West.  Philippe is
moving toward the southwest near 5 mph (7 km/h), and this general
motion should continue through tonight.  A turn toward the
northwest with an increase in forward speed is expected Sunday and 
Monday, followed by a northward motion on Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast during the next few days, and
Philippe could become a hurricane early next week.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, and Puerto Rico through early next week. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Philippe Forecast Discussion Number 31</title>

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  31
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 PM AST Sat Sep 30 2023
 
Philippe's convective cloud pattern remains rather ragged-looking,
but there are very cold cloud tops of -80 deg C or colder over the
southeastern part of the circulation.  The center of circulation is
estimated to be near the northwestern edge of the main area of deep
convection.  There is little evidence of banding features at this
time.  The current intensity estimate is kept at 45 kt in agreement 
with the latest Dvorak classification from TAFB although objective 
satellite estimates are somewhat lower.  A recent scatterometer 
pass showed slightly higher winds over the southeastern quadrant 
but these are believed to be rain-inflated.  Another Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate Philippe tomorrow 
morning to check on the intensity of the storm.
 
The motion is somewhat uncertain since the center is not easy to
locate in nighttime satellite imagery.  However it appears that
Philippe is moving more to the right and the initial motion
estimate is now 230/4 kt.  Steering currents are expected to remain 
ill-defined for the next day or two, but a weak mid-level high to 
the northeast of the system should cause Philippe to turn 
northwestward on Sunday.  In about 3 days, a turn to the north is 
expected as the cyclone moves along the western side of the high.  
Late in the forecast period, the system should turn toward the 
north-northeast on the southeast side of a mid-tropospheric trough 
over the western Atlantic.  The latest track guidance for the next 
48 hours or so, in particular the new GFS, has shifted westward 
from the previous cycle.  This has resulted in a westward shift of 
the model consensus and necessitated a westward shift in the NHC 
track as well, which is now closer to the northern Leeward Islands. 
It should be noted that the model guidance continues to show very 
little outward extent of tropical-storm-force winds over the 
western semicircle of Philippe through 48 hours, and this forecast 
still does not necessitate the issuance of tropical storm watches 
for those islands.  However, interests there should continue to 
monitor the progress of Philippe.
 
Based on the global model forecasts, the system is likely to
continue experiencing significant vertical wind shear for the next
day or two.  Therefore only a slow increase in intensity is
forecast during the next couple of days.  Later in the forecast 
period, vertical shear is expected to lessen somewhat which should 
allow the system to strengthen into a hurricane, as suggested by 
the regional hurricane model, HAFS-A.  However, the official 
intensity forecast is now above most of the model guidance.

Tropical Storm Rina Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182023
1100 PM AST Sat Sep 30 2023
 
Satellite imagery this evening indicates that Rina is maintaining a 
well-defined center of circulation. However, strong northwesterly 
vertical shear continues to impact the storm, resulting in 
short-lived, episodic convection in the southeastern quadrant of the 
circulation. Based on the limited convective activity, as well as 
subjective and objective satellite estimates, the intensity for this 
advisory is lowered to 35 kt. 

Not much has changed with the intensity forecast, with all reliable 
consensus aids suggesting that Rina will continue to gradually 
weaken. The large-scale environment appears unfavorable for further 
intensification due to low mid-level humidity and continued 
moderate northwesterly wind shear, as well as the detrimental 
influence of nearby Tropical Storm Philippe. Thus, the NHC forecast 
shows Rina gradually weakening through tomorrow and degenerating 
into a remnant low on Sunday.
 
Rina is continuing to track northwestward at approximately 12 kt. 
The storm is expected to continue on this trajectory tonight, with a 
turn to the north expected tomorrow. Early next week, Rina or its 
remnants will accelerate northeastward between a mid-level ridge to 
its east and an upper-level trough to its west. The new track 
forecast is very similar to both the previous NHC forecast and the 
consensus aids HCCA and TVCN.
