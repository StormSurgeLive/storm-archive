For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Philippe, located several hundred miles east of the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL91):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to show signs of organization <br/>
in association with an area of low pressure located roughly halfway <br/>
between the Cabo Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles. <br/>
Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive for <br/>
development, as long as this system remains far enough removed from <br/>
Tropical Storm Philippe to its west. A tropical depression or storm <br/>
is expected to form later today or on Friday while the system moves <br/>
northwestward across the central tropical Atlantic. Additional <br/>
information on this system, including gale warnings, can be found in <br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 AM AST Thu Sep 28 2023
 
Philippe remains a very disorganized and elongated storm.
Geostationary and microwave satellite images show a low-level
circulation center well to the west of the mid-level center, where
most of the deep convection is currently concentrated.  The
estimated center position shown in this advisory is roughly midway
between those features, however confidence is very low on the
storm's position. In fact, it is possible that Philippe no longer
has a well-defined center. The initial intensity is held at 45 kt,
which is near the high end of the satellite intensity estimates.
 
The initial motion is highly uncertain since the storm is elongated 
and confidence in the initial position is very low.  The track 
forecast is challenging, in part due to Philippe's close proximity 
to newly formed Tropical Storm Rina.  In the short term, a slow 
southwestward motion seems likely as Philippe moves in weak steering 
currents between a mid- to upper-level trough to its northeast and 
Rina to its east-southeast.  By late in the weekend, a mid-level 
ridge is anticipated to build over the subtropical central Atlantic, 
and that feature should cause Philippe to turn sharply northward 
east of the northern Leeward Islands.  The NHC track forecast has 
been adjusted to the south for the first couple of days, but lies to 
the east of the previous forecast at days 4 and 5.  This prediction 
is closest to the ECMWF model.
 
The environmental conditions for Philippe no longer seem unfavorable
given its expected to track to the east of the islands and not
within a region of strong shear.  Therefore, the NHC intensity
forecast has been adjusted upward and generally shows little change
in strength during the next several days.  This prediction still
lies near the low end of the model guidance, however, so future
advisories might show a higher intensity forecast if the guidance
persists.

Tropical Storm Rina Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182023
1100 AM AST Thu Sep 28 2023
 
Visible imagery early this morning indicates that a well-defined 
center has emerged to the northwest of persistent deep convective 
activity. A recent ASCAT pass and subjective Dvorak estimates from 
TAFB both indicate that the system has become a tropical cyclone. 
Thus, advisories have been initiated on Tropical Storm Rina. 

The recent partial ASCAT pass indicated winds in the 30-35 kt 
range but did not capture the most intense convection east of the 
center. Therefore, the current intensity for this advisory is set 
at 35 kt. Moderate deep-layer westerly shear is likely to limit 
intensification in the short term, and this shear is expected to 
increase this weekend and early next week. Persistent shear, in 
addition to the close proximity and uncertain interaction with 
Tropical Storm Philippe, should limit intensification during the 
forecast period. The NHC forecast is in the middle of the guidance 
envelope and very close to the HCCA solution. Rina is expected to 
remain a tropical storm throughout the forecast period, though some 
of the regional hurricane models do indicate a faster rate of 
intensification during the next several days compared to the NHC 
forecast. 

Rina is moving north-northwestward, with an initial forward speed 
near 9 kt. The tropical storm should begin to turn more westward 
today and continue this general motion for the next several days. 
Early next week, the system is expected to turn northward as a 
mid-level ridge builds to the west. The NHC forecast is a blend of 
the HCCA and TVCN consensus guidance throughout the forecast 
period. Confidence in the track forecast is lower than normal based 
on the model spread and uncertainty regarding the potential 
interaction with Tropical Storm Philippe during the next several 
days.
