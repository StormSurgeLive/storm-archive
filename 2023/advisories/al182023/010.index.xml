BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Philippe Advisory Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
500 PM AST Sat Sep 30 2023
 
...PHILIPPE STILL SHEARED AND MOVING SLOWLY SOUTHWESTWARD...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.3N 56.5W
ABOUT 455 MI...730 KM ESE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...SW OR 215 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, the U.S. and British
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of this
system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was 
located near latitude 16.3 North, longitude 56.5 West. Philippe is 
moving toward the southwest near 5 mph (7 km/h), and this general 
motion should continue through tonight. A turn toward the 
west-northwest and northwest with an increase in forward speed is 
expected Sunday and Monday, followed by a northward motion on 
Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast during the next few days, and
Philippe could become a hurricane early next week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on Air Force Reserve
Hurricane Hunter dropsonde data is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, and Puerto Rico through early next week. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
500 PM AST Sat Sep 30 2023
 
Philippe remains a sheared tropical cyclone. Its low-level center
has become increasingly separated from the deep convection today.
Visible satellite images and and fixes from the Air Force Hurricane
Hunters indicate the center is farther south and slightly east of
our previous estimates. In terms of Philippe's current intensity,
there were mixed signals in the aircraft data. The peak 850-mb
flight-level winds were only 49 kt, and a center dropsonde indicated
no change of the minimum pressure (999 mb) since the previous
flight. On the other hand, the SFMR retrievals showed winds of 45-50
kt outside of convection that were visually supported by the flight
crew, but a coincident dropsonde reported much lower near-surface
wind speeds. Given the conflicting data and less impressive
satellite presentation, the initial intensity is held at 45 kt.
 
The tropical storm has continued to move southwestward today, with
an initial motion of 215/4 kt. In the near term, the models suggest
Philippe will not move very much and could drift erratically through
early Sunday while Tropical Storm Rina passes to its north. Then,
there is general agreement that the storm will turn toward the
west-northwest and northwest around the western extent of a low- to
mid-level ridge over the central Atlantic. While there is still a
large spread in the track guidance during the 24-72 h time frame, it
is noteworthy that the 12z ECMWF has trended eastward this cycle and
shows Philippe passing farther east of the northern Leeward Islands.
The latest NHC track forecast is slightly farther south and west
early in the forecast due to the center relocation. However, the
updated prediction ends up near or slightly east of the previous
forecast at 36-72 h, in best agreement with the TVCA simple
consensus. By days 4-5, Philippe is forecast to accelerate northward
and northeastward between a central Atlantic ridge and a deep-layer
trough over the western Atlantic.
 
Only modest strengthening is forecast during the next 24-36 h while 
Philippe contends with moderate to strong northwesterly shear. The 
upper-level winds are forecast to become more conducive for 
intensification in a couple of days or so, which should allow the 
cyclone to become more vertically aligned and establish an inner 
core. Thus, more strengthening is forecast at days 2-4 while 
Philippe moves over the very warm SSTs of the central Atlantic, 
which is supported by almost all of the intensity guidance. The NHC 
forecast calls for Philippe to become a hurricane by 60 h with 
continued strengthening thereafter. The peak intensity was raised to 
bring the NHC forecast slightly closer to the latest HCCA and IVCN 
aids at days 4-5, but it is noted that the regional hurricane models 
are even stronger than the current NHC forecast.

<title>Tropical Storm Rina Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Tropical Storm Rina Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182023
1100 AM AST Sat Sep 30 2023

Satellite images show that Rina remains disorganized with any deep 
convection sheared off well southeast of the center.  Intensity 
estimates are dropping, and ASCAT just came in with maximum winds 
just above 35 kt, so the initial wind speed is set to 40 kt.  
Strong shear should continue near the cyclone until it dissipates 
in 2-3 days.  Model guidance is in relatively good agreement on 
this scenario, and the new intensity forecast is lower than before, 
showing remnant low status as the weekend closes.

Rina continues moving west-northwestward, now at 10 kt.  The storm 
should rotate northwestward and northward on the northern side of 
Philippe for the next couple of days.  Thereafter, a weakened Rina
is forecast to degenerate into a trough of low pressure as it moves 
into the subtropics.  The new track forecast is very similar to the 
last forecast, with no big changes to the guidance.
