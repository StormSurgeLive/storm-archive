...PHILIPPE SLIGHTLY STRONGER...
...EXPECTED TO DRIFT AROUND EAST OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
THROUGH THE WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.0N 55.9W
ABOUT 475 MI...760 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WSW OR 240 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1002 MB...29.59 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, the U.S. and British
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of this
system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was 
located near latitude 18.0 North, longitude 55.9 West. Philippe is 
moving toward the west-southwest near 5 mph (7 km/h), and this 
motion is expected to continue through Saturday night.  A gradual 
turn toward the west and northwest is forecast Sunday and Sunday 
night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Gradual strengthening is forecast during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, and Puerto Rico through the weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
500 PM AST Fri Sep 29 2023
 
Satellite imagery shows the center of Philippe has become exposed 
again due to 15-20 kt of mid-level westerly shear. Deep convection 
is generally confined to the southeast portion, with a growing band 
to the south of the center. The Air Force Hurricane Hunters 
investigated Philippe this afternoon and found the minimum pressure 
to be 1002 mb and winds to support an intensity of 45 kt. Based on 
the aircraft and ASCAT data, tropical-storm-force winds extend well 
east and southeast of the center.
 
Philippe is moving a little faster this afternoon, but still 
relatively slowly as it continues in a general southwest direction. 
The current track is due to its interaction with Tropical Storm Rina 
several hundred miles to its east.  Since these tropical cyclones 
are expected to continue to interact through the weekend, Philippe 
is forecast to crawl southwestward through Sunday.  After that time, 
Rina is expected to separate from Philippe as a mid-level ridge 
builds over the subtropical central Atlantic. In response, Philippe 
should turn sharply northward early next week. Recent guidance has 
shown an overall shift to the west, with the 12Z ECMWF model about 
60 n mi west of its previous run. The NHC track forecast has also 
been nudged to the west toward the various consensus models.
 
Although Philippe is still being affected by shear, the environment 
over the next couple of days appears to become less hostile. 
Moderate wind shear, upper-level diffluence, increasing mid-level 
humidities around the storm, and very warm SSTs should allow 
Philippe to gradually strengthen through the weekend. Beyond that 
time, the intensity forecast becomes more dependent on the future 
track. If Philippe tracks along the western side of the guidance, it 
will likely weaken due to stronger wind shear. Whereas, if the 
system tracks east of the NHC track, it could strengthen more than 
predicted due to more favorable environmental factors. The NHC 
intensity forecast is a little higher than the previous cycle in the 
short term, but is still on the low end of the guidance.

<title>Tropical Storm Rina Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Rina Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182023
500 PM AST Fri Sep 29 2023
 
Strong northwesterly shear has caused the low-level center of Rina 
to become completely exposed today. The overall convective structure 
of the storm has deteriorated as well, with only small bursts of 
deep convection observed in satellite images well downshear of its 
center. An earlier scatterometer pass did not sample the core of the 
system, but still showed 30-35 kt winds well removed from the center 
in the southeast quadrant. The latest objective and subjective 
satellite intensity estimates range from 30-45 kt, and the initial 
intensity is conservatively held at 40 kt this afternoon. A full 
scatterometer pass should be available this evening to better assess 
the current intensity of Rina.
 
The tropical cyclone has turned northwestward and is accelerating,
with an initial motion of 320/8 kt. This general motion with a
slight increase in forward speed is expected during couple of days
while Rina moves around the northeastern periphery of the broader
circulation associated with Tropical Storm Philippe. Thereafter, the
shallow cyclone is forecast to separate from Philippe and turn
north-northwestward between a subtropical ridge to the east and an
approaching frontal system over the western Atlantic. There is still
large spread in the track guidance regarding the extent and speed of
this turn, with the GFS still on the western edge of the guidance.
With this uncertainty in mind, the updated NHC forecast remains
close to the HCCA and TVCA consensus aids and lies near the center
of the guidance envelope.
 
The strong wind shear currently affecting Rina is unlikely to relent
during the next couple of days. So despite warm SSTs along its path,
Rina seems unlikely to sustain a more organized convective structure
going forward, which is consistent with simulated satellite imagery
from the global models. The NHC intensity forecast shows gradual
weakening during the next several days, following the latest
multi-model intensity consensus aids. By 96 h, Rina is forecast to
open into a trough and/or merge with a frontal system. But if the
center remains decoupled from the convection, it is possible that
Rina degenerates into a remnant low even sooner than forecast.
