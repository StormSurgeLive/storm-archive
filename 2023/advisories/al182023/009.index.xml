Tropical Storm Philippe Advisory Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 AM AST Sat Sep 30 2023
 
...PHILIPPE MOVING SLOWLY SOUTHWESTWARD...
...AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTERS TO INVESTIGATE PHILIPPE LATER
TODAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.9N 56.3W
ABOUT 455 MI...735 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...SW OR 215 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, the U.S. and British
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of this
system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was 
located near latitude 16.9 North, longitude 56.3 West. Philippe is 
moving toward the southwest near 5 mph (7 km/h). A slow turn toward 
the west-southwest and west is expected through early Sunday, 
followed by a turn toward the northwest and north-northwest Sunday 
night through Tuesday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast during the next few days, and
Philippe could become a hurricane early next week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Philippe will affect portions of the
Atlantic coasts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin
Islands, and Puerto Rico through early next week. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Philippe Forecast Discussion Number 28</title>

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
500 AM AST Sat Sep 30 2023
 
An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter crew investigated Philippe a 
few hours ago and found that the minimum pressure had fallen to 999 
mb, however the maximum winds do not appear to have increased.  The 
maximum flight-level wind was 46 kt at 700 mb, and SFMR readings 
outside of deep convection were as high as 45 kt (SFMR measurements 
higher than 50 kt appeared questionable due to coincident heavy 
rain).  The low-level center remains located on the northwestern 
edge of the deep convection due to continued shear.

The reconnaissance fixes showed that Philippe has been moving toward 
the south-southwest (200 degrees) at about 4 kt.  The storm has 
moved a little farther south than expected, possibly due to a more 
pronounced binary interaction with Tropical Storm Rina about 450 n 
mi to its east-northeast.  As the interaction continues, Philippe is 
forecast to move slowly toward the west and then northwest during 
the next few days.  However, there is still quite a bit of model 
spread in how far west Philippe will get before it turns, and the 
ECMWF and HAFS-B models in particularly bring the storm very close 
to the northern Leeward Islands in about 48 hours.  The NHC track 
forecast has been shifted west of the previous prediction and lies 
just to the west of the TVCA consensus aid.  It is noteworthy that 
several models and ensemble members still lie west of the new 
forecast, and it's possible that additional adjustments may be 
required in future forecast cycles.  All models show Philippe 
accelerating toward the north and north-northeast by days 4 and 5, 
steered by the flow between a mid-level high over the central 
Atlantic and a deep-layer trough over the western Atlantic.

The intensity forecast remains tricky and is complicated by 
competing positive and negative environmental factors.  On one hand, 
moderate-to-strong northwesterly shear is likely to continue at 
least for the next 48 hours.  However, the magnitude of the shear 
will depend on Philippe's exact location, and it could also be 
offset by a more diffluent upper-level environment.  Since the storm 
has already been overachieving in the sheared environment, the NHC 
intensity forecast shows gradual strengthening during the next few 
days, and is near or just below the IVCN and HCCA consensus aids 
through 60 hours.  The atmosphere could become more favorable for 
strengthening after that time, and the NHC forecast now shows 
Philippe reaching hurricane intensity while it recurves toward the 
subtropical Atlantic.  It's worth noting that this new forecast is 
still on the conservative side, and that many of the intensity 
models and consensus aids are at least 20 kt higher on days 4 and 5. 
 Only the ECMWF and its SHIPS and LGEM derivatives remain on the 
weaker end of the scale and don't bring Philippe to hurricane 
strength.

Tropical Storm Rina Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182023
500 AM AST Sat Sep 30 2023
 
Rina remains a sheared tropical cyclone.  Deep bursts of convection
have been flaring to the southeast of an exposed low-level
circulation.  However, recent trends in geostationary satellite
imagery have shown the convection shrinking in areal coverage and
becoming shallower.  The latest subjective Dvorak intensity
estimates were T3.0 (45 kt) and T2.5 (35 kt) from TAFB and SAB,
respectively.  The initial intensity is held at a possibly
generous 45 kt in deference to the earlier scatterometer pass and
the latest TAFB estimate.
 
It is unlikely Rina will regain significant convective organization. 
Global model guidance indicates that the deep-layer vertical wind 
shear is likely to remain strong for the entirety of the forecast 
period.  Simulated satellite imagery shows convection attempting 
to re-form near the center for the next couple of days, but it is 
quickly stripped away by the strong upper-level winds.  The NHC 
intensity forecast shows Rina gradually weakening and becoming a 
remnant low in 48 h.
 
Rina is moving to the west-northwest at 9 kt.  Tropical Storm 
Philippe, to its west-southwest, and a subtropical mid-level ridge 
to the northeast are likely to steer Rina generally 
west-northwestward to northwestward through 48 h.  Only minor 
adjustments have been made to the latest track forecast.
