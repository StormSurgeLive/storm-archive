Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Sun Aug 20 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Six, located several hundred miles east of the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands. <br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL98):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to show signs of organization in <br/>
association with a broad area of low pressure located several <br/>
hundred miles west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands. However, <br/>
recent satellite wind data indicate the surface circulation is <br/>
elongated and lacks a well-defined center. Environmental conditions <br/>
still appear generally favorable for development, and a short-lived <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form later today or tonight while <br/>
it moves west-northwestward at about 10 mph over the central <br/>
tropical Atlantic. By Monday, upper-level winds are forecast to <br/>
strengthen over the system, and further development is not expected. <br/>
For additional information on this system, including gale warnings, <br/>
see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Caribbean (AL90):<br/>
An area of low pressure over the far eastern Caribbean Sea is <br/>
producing showers and thunderstorms with some signs of organization. <br/>
Additional development of this system is expected, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form during the early or middle part of this <br/>
week. The system is forecast to move westward to west-northwestward <br/>
at 10 to 15 mph over the eastern and central Caribbean during the <br/>
next couple of days, then turn northward and move over the <br/>
southwestern Atlantic Ocean by midweek. Regardless of development, <br/>
heavy rainfall is possible over portions of the Lesser Antilles <br/>
during the next couple of days. Interests in the eastern and central <br/>
Caribbean should monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
An area of disturbed weather located over the Straits of Florida and <br/>
the southern Florida peninsula will move into the Gulf of Mexico <br/>
later today, where a broad area of low pressure is expected to form <br/>
early this week. Some slow development of this system could occur <br/>
thereafter as it moves westward at about 15 to 20 mph, and a <br/>
tropical depression could form as it approaches the western Gulf of <br/>
Mexico coastline by Tuesday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the far <br/>
eastern tropical Atlantic is associated with a tropical wave. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear conducive for gradual development of <br/>
this system, and a tropical depression could form later this week <br/>
while it moves west-northwestward across the eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Six Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
500 AM AST Sun Aug 20 2023
 
The center of the depression remains fully exposed in satellite
imagery this morning, with the associated convection displaced well
to the east by strong westerly shear. Given the lack of improvement
in the cyclone's satellite presentation, and a blend of the latest
objective and subjective satellite estimates, the initial intensity
remains 30 kt for this advisory.
 
The strong deep-layer westerly shear plaguing the depression is
forecast to increase to over 40 kt later today. This, combined with
relatively dry mid-level air in the surrounding environment, will
make it difficult for the cyclone to sustain organized convection
going forward. Therefore, the official forecast now calls for the
system to degenerate to a remnant low in 24 h, in agreement with the
latest GFS and ECMWF model-simulated satellite imagery. The global
models suggest the weak low is likely to open into a trough soon
thereafter, and so this update shows dissipation in 36 h.
 
The depression has moved a bit south of due west over the past
several hours, but its long-term motion remains westward at 13 kt.
This general motion is expected to continue until dissipation
occurs, as the system moves within low-level easterly flow to the
south of a subtropical ridge. Given the recent motion toward the
west-southwest, this updated track forecast lies to the south of the
previous one.
