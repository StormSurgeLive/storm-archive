Tropical Weather Outlook... Corrected <br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Sun Aug 20 2023<br/>
<br/>
Corrected Emily's location relative to the Cabo Verde Islands<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Six, located several hundred miles east of the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands and on newly formed Tropical Storm Emily, located <br/>
about 1000 miles west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Caribbean (AL90):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to show signs of organization in <br/>
association with an area of low pressure over the eastern Caribbean <br/>
Sea. In addition, visible satellite imagery shows evidence that a <br/>
well-defined center is developing, and earlier satellite wind data <br/>
indicated the system was producing winds of 35-40 mph. If these <br/>
trends continue, a tropical depression or storm could form as soon <br/>
as later this afternoon. A NOAA Hurricane Reconnaissance mission is <br/>
currently en route to investigate the system this afternoon. The <br/>
system is forecast to move westward to west-northwestward at 10 to <br/>
15 mph over the eastern and central Caribbean, before turning <br/>
northward and potentially affecting the Dominican Republic and Haiti <br/>
on Tuesday or Wednesday, where tropical storm watches could become <br/>
necessary later this afternoon. Regardless of development, heavy <br/>
rainfall is possible over portions of the Lesser Antilles during the <br/>
next couple of days. Interests in the eastern and central Caribbean <br/>
should monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Gulf of Mexico (AL91):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms have increased this afternoon in <br/>
association with an area of disturbed weather located in the eastern <br/>
Gulf of Mexico. Additional development of this system is possible as <br/>
it moves westward at about 15 to 20 mph, and a tropical depression <br/>
could form as it approaches the western Gulf of Mexico coastline by <br/>
Tuesday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the far <br/>
eastern tropical Atlantic is associated with a tropical wave <br/>
centered just southeast of the Cabo Verde Islands. Environmental <br/>
conditions appear conducive for gradual development of this system, <br/>
and a tropical depression could form later this week while it moves <br/>
west-northwestward across the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Six Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
500 PM AST Sun Aug 20 2023
 
Visible satellite imagery indicates that the deep convection 
north and east of the depression has dissipated this afternoon. Once 
again, the center of circulation is completely exposed and is not as 
well-defined as earlier today. Based on a blend of objective and 
subjective satellite estimates, the initial intensity estimate for 
this advisory is held at 30 kt.

Not much has changed with the forecast reasoning. Strong deep-layer 
westerly shear and unfavorable mid-level thermodynamics are 
expected to preclude further development of the depression. Global 
models and ensembles are in agreement that intensification 
is unlikely, and thus the official forecast has the depression as a 
remnant low in 12 h and dissipated in 24 h.
 
The depression is now moving slightly north of due west, and this 
general motion is expected to continue until dissipation occurs. 
The official track forecast is a blend of consensus guidance and is 
similar to the previous forecast.

<title>Tropical Storm Emily Forecast Discussion Number 2</title>

Tropical Storm Emily Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072023
500 PM AST Sun Aug 20 2023
 
Emily is feeling the effects of southwesterly vertical wind shear 
with the low-level center fully exposed to the southwest of the main 
area of deep convection.  The initial intensity is held at 45 kt 
based on the earlier ASCAT data and the TAFB Dvorak satellite 
estimate.  The environment around Emily is expected to become 
increasingly hostile the next couple of days with shear increasing 
to near 40 kt while the system remains in relatively stable air.  
These unfavorable atmospheric conditions should cause steady 
weakening, and Emily could become a remnant low in a few of days.
 
The storm is moving to the northwest at 8 kt, and a general
west-northwest to northwest motion is expected during the next 2 to
3 days while the storm moves along the southwestern periphery of
the ridge.  After that time, a turn to the north is forecast while
the storm moves around the west side of the ridge and toward a
weakness.  The new track forecast is similar to the previous one and
near the middle of the guidance envelope.
