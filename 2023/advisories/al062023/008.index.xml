Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Mon Aug 21 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories recently <br/>
upgraded Tropical Storm Gert, located several hundred miles east of <br/>
the northern Leeward Islands, on Tropical Storm Emily, located <br/>
a little over 1000 miles west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands, <br/>
and on Tropical Storm Franklin, located over the eastern Caribbean <br/>
Sea.<br/>
<br/>
Western Gulf of Mexico (AL91):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue in association with a trough of <br/>
low pressure located in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.  Environmental <br/>
conditions appear favorable for development of this system while it <br/>
moves westward at about 15 to 20 mph across the central Gulf of <br/>
Mexico.  A tropical depression or storm is likely to form while it <br/>
approaches the western Gulf of Mexico coastline by Tuesday. <br/>
Interests in the western Gulf of Mexico should monitor the progress <br/>
of this system.  Tropical storm watches or warnings may be <br/>
necessary on Monday for portions of the southern Texas and northern <br/>
Mexico coastlines.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL92):<br/>
A large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the <br/>
far eastern tropical Atlantic is associated with a tropical wave <br/>
located near the Cabo Verde Islands.  Environmental conditions <br/>
appear conducive for gradual development of this system, and a <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form later this week while it <br/>
moves west-northwestward across the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Gert Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
500 AM AST Mon Aug 21 2023
 
After a brief intensification period overnight, Gert is quickly
unraveling this morning.  The surface circulation is becoming
ill-defined while the associated sheared mass of convection is
shrinking.  Although the cloud pattern has certainly become less
organized during the past few hours, the initial intensity is
generously held at 35 kt for this advisory and is supported by the
Dvorak satellite intensity estimates.  Despite a rather diffluent
upper-wind pattern, strong, persistent westerly shear and a
statically stable and dry mid-tropospheric surrounding air mass
should force Gert's surface center to separate farther from the
diminishing convective mass later today and degenerate to a remnant
low by this evening.  The morning's global model simulated infrared
imagery also shows the cyclone opening to a trough of low pressure
in less than 36 hours, and the NHC official forecast reflects this
prediction.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be westward, or 280/8 kt.  A
gradual turn toward the west-northwest is expected by tonight, and
this general motion should continue until dissipation occurs on
Tuesday.  The official forecast has been adjusted slightly to the
right of the previous one and is based on the simple and NOAA HFIP
Corrected Consensus forecasts.

Tropical Storm Emily Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072023
500 AM AST Mon Aug 21 2023
 
During the past few hours, Emily has rapidly lost what remained of 
its deep convection displaced well to the northeast of the exposed 
surface center.  The initial intensity estimate is lowered to 35 kt 
for this advisory and is supported by the available subjective and 
objective satellite intensity estimates.  The environment 
surrounding Emily is forecast to become increasingly belligerent by 
tonight due to deep-layer shear increasing to near 40 kt and a an 
intruding dry stable air mass.  These negatively contributing 
atmospheric conditions should induce gradual weakening, and Emily 
should become a post-tropical cyclone by this evening.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be west-northwestward, or 290/10 
kt.  During the next several days, Emily should maintain a general 
west-northwestward motion while being steered by a low to 
mid-tropospheric ridge to the north.  By the 48 hour period, a 
gradual turn northward is expected after Emily degenerates to 
remnant low, rounding the southern periphery of the aforementioned 
subtropical ridge. The track guidance is in good agreement on this 
scenario, and the NHC track forecast is basically an update of the 
previous advisory.

moving toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A westward to 
west-northwestward track is expected to continue today.  A sharp
turn to the north is expected tonight or early Tuesday, and a 
generally northward motion is expected on Tuesday.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Franklin is forecast to reach the southern 
coast of Hispaniola late Tuesday or Tuesday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast before Franklin reaches Hispaniola.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).

4 inches, with isolated higher amounts of 6 inches, across Puerto 
Rico through the middle of the week. Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 
inches, with isolated higher amounts up to 15 inches, will be 
possible across portions of Hispaniola. 
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin within the
warning area on Tuesday and are possible within the watch area
beginning late Tuesday.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast near and to
the east of where the center makes landfall in Hispaniola.

Tropical Storm Franklin Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 AM AST Mon Aug 21 2023
 
Franklin's cloud pattern has not become significantly better 
organized overnight.  The system is producing several clusters of 
bursting very deep convection, but convective banding features are 
not well defined at this time.  Based on microwave imagery, the 
cyclone center is apparently located near the western edge of the 
overall convective mass.  The current intensity is held at 45 kt in 
agreement with a subjective Dvorak satellite classification from 
TAFB.  This value is also supported by objective intensity estimates 
from UW-CIMSS.

The storm continues moving generally westward, with a motion 
estimate of 270/10 kt.  Franklin's forecast track is somewhat 
problematic.  A weakness in the subtropical ridge is expected to 
cause the tropical cyclone to turn northward in 24 hours or so.  
This should result in Franklin crossing Hispaniola in the 48 hour 
time frame.  After moving into the Atlantic, Franklin should turn 
northeastward while interacting with a mid-level cyclonic 
circulation.  By late in the forecast period, the mid-level cyclone 
lifts out which could allow Franklin to turn more to the left.  
However there is more than the usual amount of uncertainty in the 
3-5 day track prediction, with lots of spread in the model guidance. 
The official forecast, like the previous one, is near the middle of 
the guidance envelope and close to the model consensus.
 
The flow on the south side of a broad upper-level trough to the 
northwest of Franklin is causing moderate southwesterly vertical 
wind shear over the storm.  Dynamical guidance such as the SHIPS 
model indicate that Franklin will remain in an environment of 
moderate shear for the next several days, and the interaction with 
the mountainous land mass of Hispaniola should temporarily disrupt 
Franklin's circulation.  The current thinking is that the shear will 
not be strong enough to prevent the system from eventually becoming 
a hurricane over the southwest Atlantic.  The official intensity 
forecast follows the model consensus.  

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Franklin is expected across portions of 
Puerto Rico and Hispaniola through the middle of the week.  The 
heavy rainfall may produce areas of flash and urban flooding as well 
as river rises and mudslides.  Across Hispaniola, significant and 
potentially life-threatening flash flooding is possible Tuesday into 
Wednesday.
 
2. Franklin is expected to bring tropical storm conditions to
portions of the Dominican Republic and Haiti beginning on Tuesday
where Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect.
