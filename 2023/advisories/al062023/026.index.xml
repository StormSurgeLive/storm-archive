Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Mon Sep 4 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gert, located over the central subtropical Atlantic, and on <br/>
recently downgraded Tropical Depression Katia, located over the <br/>
eastern subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
 <br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL95):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to show signs of organization <br/>
in association with a tropical wave located several hundred miles <br/>
southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to be conducive for further development, and this system is <br/>
expected to become a tropical depression in two or three days. <br/>
Additional strengthening is likely late this week while the system <br/>
moves westward to west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the <br/>
central and western portions of the tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is forecast to move off the African coast in a <br/>
couple of days.  Environmental conditions could support some slow <br/>
development starting midweek while the wave moves to the west- <br/>
northwest at about 15 mph over the far eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Gert Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
1100 PM AST Sun Sep 03 2023
 
The low-level center of Gert is exposed in proxy-visible satellite 
images tonight. Recent ASCAT-B wind retrievals indicate the surface 
center is becoming elongated and less defined. There are still 
tropical-storm-force winds occurring in the eastern semicircle, with 
scatterometer winds as high as 40-42 kt. However, this is more a 
product of Gert's translational speed than its paltry convective 
structure. Based on these data, the initial intensity is held at 45 
kt for this advisory.
 
Gert is moving quickly northward (010/19 kt) while being captured
within the broader cyclonic flow associated with Post-Tropical
Cyclone Idalia. Gert is forecast to accelerate northward to
north-northwestward while it continues rounding the northeastern
portion of Idalia's circulation. The global models show Gert
becoming absorbed on Monday, and the updated NHC forecast predicts
dissipation by 24 h. However, it is entirely possible that Gert
opens into a trough even sooner based on its current structure.

<title>Tropical Depression Katia Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Tropical Depression Katia Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122023
300 AM GMT Mon Sep 04 2023
 
Deep convection has been on the decline and only a small area of 
thunderstorms remain well north of the center.  A recent ASCAT pass 
showed peak winds in the 25-30 kt range, and based on that data, 
Katia has been downgraded to a 30-kt tropical depression. This value 
is also in line with the latest satellite intensity estimates.
 
The depression is moving slowly west-northwestward.  A slow
west-northwestward to northwestward motion is expected for about
another day before the system reverses course and drifts
southeastward in the flow between a low- to mid-level ridge to
its west and a deep-layer low to the northeast.  Only small
changes were made to the previous NHC track forecast, and this one
lies near the various consensus models.
 
West-southwesterly vertical wind shear and dry air should continue
to weaken Katia, and this system will likely become a remnant low
in 12 to 24 hours.  Dissipation is expected in 3 to 4 days.
