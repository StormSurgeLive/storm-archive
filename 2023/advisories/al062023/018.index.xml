Remnants Of Jose Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112023
1100 PM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
Jose has been absorbed into the powerful extratropical cyclone,
Franklin.  Geostationary imagery suggests the remnants of Jose are
embedded in a convective band in the northeast quadrant of Franklin.
The initial intensity has been set to 40 kt, though it is hard to
determine a maximum wind speed associated with the remnants, when
the intensity of Franklin is likely much stronger.
 
This is the last advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center on
Jose.  Additional information on this system can be found in High
Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php

Tropical Storm Gert Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
500 AM AST Sat Sep 02 2023
 
This morning's conventional satellite imagery and a recent AMSR2
microwave overpass indicate some improvement in the cloud pattern
overnight, although Gert's surface center remains near the 
northern edge of the convective canopy where the colder cloud top 
temperatures are evident.  The subjective and objective satellite 
intensity estimates have increased a bit during the past 6 hours, 
and the initial intensity is bumped up to 40 kt for this advisory.
 
Gert's intensity shouldn't change much during the next few days 
while the cyclone continues moving in a harsh northerly wind shear 
environment. Gert is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone 
during the next couple of days as indicated in the global 
models fields and their simulated infrared imagery forecasts.  
Afterwards, Gert is expected to become absorbed by Post-Tropical 
Idalia.  The official intensity forecast follows the IVCN intensity 
consensus aid through the period and indicates dissipation in 60 
hours.
 
Gert should commence a northward track later today while the
southerly peripheral steering flow of larger Idalia captures the
cyclone and a subtropical ridge builds westward over the central
tropical Atlantic.  There is quite a bit of along-track spread of 
the models, however, so the best solution for the NHC forecast 
track is to side with the consensus models, HCCA and TVCA through 
dissipation early this week.

Tropical Storm Katia Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122023
800 AM CVT Sat Sep 02 2023
 
The depression has become better organized overnight.  Cloud tops
temperatures have decreased to -76 Celsius over the surface center
and curved banding has improved, mainly over the northern
semi-circle.  UW-CIMSS AiDT and DPRINT objective satellite 
intensity estimates, as well as the Dvorak estimated from TAFB 
support upgrading the system to a tropical storm.
 
Katia is expected to be a short-lived storm as deep-layer 
southerly shear should increase soon while Katia moves into an 
inhibiting, dry and stable surrounding environment.  As a result, a 
weakening trend is forecast through the period and is in agreement 
with the deterministic models and the statistical-dynamic SHIPS 
intensity guidance.
 
Katia is estimated to be moving north-northwestward, or 330/11 kt, 
and is situated midway between a subtropical ridge extending toward 
the west from western Africa, and a large cut-off low centered over 
the central subtropical Atlantic.  A turn toward the northwest is 
expected today followed by a a gradual turn toward the north at a 
slower forward pace around mid-period while Katia degenerates to a 
vertically shallow low-pressure system.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia
was located near latitude 31.7 North, longitude 64.9 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east near 14 mph (22
km/h) and this general trajectory at a slower forward speed is
expected through today.  A turn toward the northeast is forecast on 
Sunday.  On the forecast track, Idalia will remain near Bermuda 
today, and then begin to move away from the island on Sunday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast during the next few
days. Idalia could transition to a tropical or subtropical storm 
later today.  

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles (350 km)
from the center.  A wind gust to 40 mph (65 km/h) was recently 
reported at the LF Wade International Airport on Bermuda.  An 
elevated observing site at the National Museum of Bermuda recently 
reported sustained winds of 46 mph (74 km/h) with a gust to 54 mph 
(87 km/h). 
  
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda through 
tonight. 
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 3 to 5
inches, or 75 to 125 millimeters, across Bermuda through the
weekend.  The heavy rainfall will likely cause areas of flash and
urban flooding on the island.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia will affect the southeastern U.S.
coast and Bermuda during the next couple of days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
1100 PM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
Satellite images and surface observations indicate that Idalia
remains an extratropical cyclone with frontal features extending
through the center.  However, deep convection has recently formed
just to the northeast of the center, and that could signal the
beginning of a transition to a subtropical or tropical cyclone.
The initial intensity is held at 45 kt.
 
The cyclone is still moving eastward, or 100 degrees, at about 14
kt.  A continued eastward motion, but at a much slower pace, is
expected on Saturday as the system separates from a deep-layer
trough.  After that time, a turn to the northeast and then the
north is forecast as the cyclone cuts off from the progressive flow
over the north Atlantic.  The NHC track forecast is a little
slower than the previous one to be in better agreement with the
latest consensus models.
 
GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite images suggest that deep
convection will continue to increase near the center overnight, and
that could influence Idalia's transition to a tropical or
subtropical cyclone on Saturday.  There could also be some increase
in strength during that time.  However, by late in the weekend,
very strong southwesterly shear is expected to affect the system
and that should end the opportunity for strengthening and cause the
system to transition back to an extratropical cyclone.  The NHC
intensity forecast is similar to the previous one and near the
middle of the guidance envelope.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected in Bermuda on Saturday.
Heavy rainfall will likely cause areas of flash and urban flooding
on the island through the weekend.
