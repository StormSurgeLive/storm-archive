Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Mon Sep 4 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gert, located over the central subtropical Atlantic, and on <br/>
Tropical Depression Katia, located over the eastern subtropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
 <br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL95):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to show signs of organization <br/>
in association with a tropical wave located several hundred miles <br/>
southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands. Environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to be conducive for further development, and this system is <br/>
expected to become a tropical depression around midweek. Additional <br/>
strengthening is likely late this week while the system moves <br/>
westward to west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the central and <br/>
western portions of the tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave over western Africa is forecast to move off the <br/>
African coast in a couple of days.  Environmental conditions should <br/>
support some slow development, and a tropical depression could form <br/>
over the far eastern tropical Atlantic around the latter part of <br/>
the week while the wave moves to the west-northwest at about 15 mph.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>

Remnants Of Gert Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
1100 AM AST Mon Sep 04 2023
 
Visible satellite imagery indicates that Gert has dissipated. It is 
also no longer producing organized deep convection. Therefore, this 
is the final NHC advisory on Gert. 

SAR data around 0930 UTC indicated that the remnants of Gert were 
still producing winds near 45 kt, and that is the basis for the max 
wind analysis. The remnants of Gert will continue to move quickly 
around the circulation of Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia today. Gert 
will likely be fully absorbed by Idalia by tomorrow, so there does 
not appear to be any potential for another regeneration of Gert.

<title>Tropical Depression Katia Forecast Discussion Number 13</title>

Tropical Depression Katia Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122023
300 PM GMT Mon Sep 04 2023

Katia continues to produce small areas of convection well north of 
the center, but they aren't showing much organization. If the 
convective pattern does not improve, Katia will likely be declared 
a remnant low this evening.  A partial scatterometer pass indicated 
maximum winds of 30 kt, so this will stay as the initial wind 
speed. 

The cyclone should gradually weaken in a moderate shear, low 
relative humidity environment, and this is indicated in the NHC 
forecast and all of the model guidance.  The dry environment will 
likely cause Katia to become a remnant low soon, similar to the 
model simulated satellite forecasts.  Katia is moving slower to the 
northwest, and should executive a slow clockwise loop over the next 
couple of days as its poleward motion is blocked by a low-level 
ridge.  A steadier southward course should begin late Wednesday due 
to the ridge building to Katia's west.  No notable changes were 
made to the intensity or track forecasts.
