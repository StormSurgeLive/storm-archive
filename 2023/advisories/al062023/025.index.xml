Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Sun Sep 3 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gert, located over the central subtropical Atlantic, and <br/>
Tropical Storm Katia, located over the eastern subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
 <br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL95):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms are showing signs of organization in <br/>
association with a tropical wave located several hundred miles <br/>
southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands. Environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to be conducive for further development, and this system is <br/>
expected to become a tropical depression in two or three days. <br/>
Additional strengthening is likely late this week while the system <br/>
moves westward to west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the <br/>
central and western portions of the tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave over western Africa is forecast to move offshore in <br/>
a couple of days.  Environmental conditions could support some slow <br/>
development starting midweek while the wave moves to the west- <br/>
northwest at about 15 mph over the far eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

located near latitude 35.4 North, longitude 50.7 West. Gert is 
moving toward the north near 22 mph (35 km/h). A faster northward to 
north-northwestward motion is expected on Monday while Gert moves 
around Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia. 
 
Satellite wind data indicate that maximum sustained winds remain
near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. Little change in strength
is forecast before Gert dissipates on Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km),
mainly to the east of the center.

Tropical Storm Gert Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
1100 PM AST Sun Sep 03 2023
 
The low-level center of Gert is exposed in proxy-visible satellite 
images tonight. Recent ASCAT-B wind retrievals indicate the surface 
center is becoming elongated and less defined. There are still 
tropical-storm-force winds occurring in the eastern semicircle, with 
scatterometer winds as high as 40-42 kt. However, this is more a 
product of Gert's translational speed than its paltry convective 
structure. Based on these data, the initial intensity is held at 45 
kt for this advisory.
 
Gert is moving quickly northward (010/19 kt) while being captured
within the broader cyclonic flow associated with Post-Tropical
Cyclone Idalia. Gert is forecast to accelerate northward to
north-northwestward while it continues rounding the northeastern
portion of Idalia's circulation. The global models show Gert
becoming absorbed on Monday, and the updated NHC forecast predicts
dissipation by 24 h. However, it is entirely possible that Gert
opens into a trough even sooner based on its current structure.

<title>Tropical Depression Katia Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Tropical Depression Katia Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122023
300 AM GMT Mon Sep 04 2023
 
Deep convection has been on the decline and only a small area of 
thunderstorms remain well north of the center.  A recent ASCAT pass 
showed peak winds in the 25-30 kt range, and based on that data, 
Katia has been downgraded to a 30-kt tropical depression. This value 
is also in line with the latest satellite intensity estimates.
 
The depression is moving slowly west-northwestward.  A slow
west-northwestward to northwestward motion is expected for about
another day before the system reverses course and drifts
southeastward in the flow between a low- to mid-level ridge to
its west and a deep-layer low to the northeast.  Only small
changes were made to the previous NHC track forecast, and this one
lies near the various consensus models.
 
West-southwesterly vertical wind shear and dry air should continue
to weaken Katia, and this system will likely become a remnant low
in 12 to 24 hours.  Dissipation is expected in 3 to 4 days.
