<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gert, located over the central subtropical Atlantic, and <br/>
Tropical Storm Katia, located over the eastern subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
 <br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL95):<br/>
A tropical wave located several hundred miles southwest of the Cabo <br/>
Verde Islands is producing a large area of shower and thunderstorm <br/>
activity.  This system has become better organized since yesterday, <br/>
and environmental conditions appear conducive for further <br/>
development this week. A tropical depression is likely to form <br/>
around midweek while the system moves westward to west-northwestward <br/>
at 15 to 20 mph over the central and western portions of the <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave over western Africa is forecast to move offshore in <br/>
a few days.  Environmental conditions could support some slow <br/>
development starting midweek while the wave moves to the west- <br/>
northwestward at about 15 mph over the far eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Gert Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
500 AM AST Sun Sep 03 2023

Gert appears to be maintaining its intensity for the time being, in 
spite of the presence of strong northeasterly vertical wind shear.  
The system has been producing a blob of deep convection to the 
southwest of the estimated center and the low-level circulation is 
still fairly well defined on GOES-16 proxy-vis imagery.  The 
current intensity is kept at 50 kt for this advisory in agreement 
with an Advanced Dvorak Technique estimate from UW-CIMSS.

The tropical storm is accelerating north-northeastward at a faster 
forward speed of around 10 kt.  A north-northeastward to 
northward motion with a continued increase in forward speed is 
likely during the next day or so as Gert becomes entrained into the 
eastern portion of the much larger circulation of Post-Tropical 
Cyclone Idalia.  Global model guidance shows the system becoming 
absorbed by Idalia and dissipating in 24 hours or so.  The official 
forecast is similar to that from the previous advisory.

Tropical Storm Katia Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122023
300 PM GMT Sun Sep 03 2023

Katia has a large, well-defined circulation on visible satellite 
imagery, but any associated deep convection is well north of the 
center. Intensity estimates are mostly at tropical-storm strength, 
so the initial wind speed is kept at 35 kt.  Weakening should 
resume later today as a combination of southerly shear and very dry 
air in the mid-levels wipes out the rest of the deep convection.  
The global models continue to show no organized thunderstorm 
activity by tomorrow, and thus remnant low status is anticipated at 
that time.
 
The storm is still moving northwest, but a bit slower at 6 kt.  
Katia is forecast to be steered between a large middle- to 
upper-tropospheric cut-off low to the west over the subtropical 
Atlantic and a northwest-to-southeast oriented mid-level ridge to 
the east during the next 36 hours or so.  As the tropical cyclone 
weakens, it should get trapped within the low-level subtropical 
ridge, causing little motion in a couple of days, with the forecast 
remnants of Katia drifting southeastward at at long range.  Other 
than a small northward adjustment based on the initial position, no 
notable changes were made to the NHC predicted track.
