Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Sun Sep 3 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gert, located about 700 miles east-southeast of Bermuda, and <br/>
Tropical Storm Katia, located about 850 miles north-northwest of <br/>
the Cabo Verde Islands. <br/>
 <br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic (AL95):<br/>
A tropical wave located over the far eastern tropical Atlantic is <br/>
producing disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity to the <br/>
south-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands.  Environmental <br/>
conditions appear conducive for some gradual development of this <br/>
system by the middle part of this week, and a tropical depression <br/>
is likely to form while it moves westward to west-northwestward at <br/>
15 to 20 mph over the eastern and central portions of the tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Gert Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
500 AM AST Sun Sep 03 2023

Gert appears to be maintaining its intensity for the time being, in 
spite of the presence of strong northeasterly vertical wind shear.  
The system has been producing a blob of deep convection to the 
southwest of the estimated center and the low-level circulation is 
still fairly well defined on GOES-16 proxy-vis imagery.  The 
current intensity is kept at 50 kt for this advisory in agreement 
with an Advanced Dvorak Technique estimate from UW-CIMSS.

The tropical storm is accelerating north-northeastward at a faster 
forward speed of around 10 kt.  A north-northeastward to 
northward motion with a continued increase in forward speed is 
likely during the next day or so as Gert becomes entrained into the 
eastern portion of the much larger circulation of Post-Tropical 
Cyclone Idalia.  Global model guidance shows the system becoming 
absorbed by Idalia and dissipating in 24 hours or so.  The official 
forecast is similar to that from the previous advisory.

<title>Tropical Storm Katia Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Tropical Storm Katia Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122023
900 AM GMT Sun Sep 03 2023
 
MET-10 proxy-vis and a series of AMSR2 microwave overpasses indicate
that the surface center is farther south than earlier thought and is
displaced about 170 mi to the south of a small patch of deep 
convection.  Subsequently, Katia has been devoid of convection 
since 0100 UTC, and unless organized deep convection redevelops, 
it will likely be classified as a post-tropical cyclone within the 
next 24 hours.  The initial intensity is lowered to 35 kt and is 
based on a blend of the subjective satellite intensity estimates 
from TAFB and SAB.
 
The intensity forecast philosophy remains unchanged.  A gradual
spin-down of the cyclone should continue as deep-layer southerly
shear is expected to increase while Katia moves into an inhibiting,
dry and stable surrounding environment.  As a result, The NHC
intensity forecast is similar to the previous one except that it 
now shows Katia degenerating to a remnant low a little sooner, and 
within the next 24 hours.
 
Katia's initial motion is estimated to be northwestward, or 310/8 
kt.  The cyclone is forecast to move between a large middle- to
upper-tropospheric cut-off low to the west over the subtropical
Atlantic and a northwest-to-southeast oriented mid-level ridge to
the east during the next 36 hours or so.  The picture is more 
explicit through the remaining portion of the forecast than in 
previous global model runs.  As mentioned above, the cut-off feature 
situated west of Katia fills and retrogrades northwestward, while a 
deep-layer mid-latitude trough digs southeastward over the northeast 
Atlantic.  This change in the synoptic steering pattern causes Katia 
to slow to a crawl and gradually turn northward, or meander, on 
Tuesday.  The official track forecast is shifted toward the left of 
the previous advisory to agree more with the tightly clustered 
consensus aids.
