Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Sun Aug 20 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Six, located several hundred miles east of the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands, on Tropical Storm Emily, located about 1000 miles <br/>
west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands, and on newly formed <br/>
Tropical Storm Franklin, located over the eastern Caribbean Sea.<br/>
<br/>
Western Gulf of Mexico (AL91):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms have increased this evening, and are <br/>
becoming better organized in association with a trough of low <br/>
pressure located in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Environmental <br/>
conditions appear favorable for development of this system as it <br/>
moves westward at about 15 to 20 mph across the central Gulf of <br/>
Mexico. A tropical depression or storm is likely to form as it <br/>
approaches the western Gulf of Mexico coastline by Tuesday. <br/>
Interests in the western Gulf of Mexico should monitor the progress <br/>
of this system. Tropical storm watches or warnings may be necessary <br/>
on Monday for portions of the southern Texas and northern Mexico <br/>
coastlines.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the <br/>
far eastern tropical Atlantic is associated with a tropical wave <br/>
located near the Cabo Verde Islands. Environmental conditions appear <br/>
conducive for gradual development of this system, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form later this week while it moves <br/>
west-northwestward across the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Six Discussion Number   6

1100 PM AST Sun Aug 20 2023
 
Proxy-vis satellite imagery indicates that the center of the 
depression remains exposed with convection displaced to the east. 
The system is also starting to be impacted by the outer rainbands 
of Tropical Storm Franklin. Based on a blend of objective and
subjective satellite estimates, the initial intensity remains at 
30 kt for this system.
 
The depression remains in a strong deep-layer sheared environment, 
while also starting to be impacted by outer bands of Franklin. 
Models and simulated satellite data show the system becoming a 
remnant low overnight and dissipated in 24 hours.
 
The depression is moving west-northwestward, and this
general motion is expected to continue until dissipation occurs.
The track forecast is very similar to the previous forecast, and 
lies near the consensus aids.

Tropical Storm Emily Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072023
1100 PM AST Sun Aug 20 2023
 
Emily continues to be in a highly sheared environment this evening, 
with convection displaced well to the northeast of the exposed 
low-level center. A recent scatterometer (ASCAT-B) had a partial 
pass over the system that showed winds around 40 
kt. Subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB/SAB and objective 
satellite CIMMS ADT and AiDT were slightly lower with this 
advisory. Given the satellite estimates and scatterometer 
wind data, the intensity is lowered to 40 kt for this advisory.

Emily likely reached peak intensity earlier this afternoon, with a 
gradual weakening trend expected over the next day or so. The 
system is in a highly sheared environment, with shear forecast to 
increase even more over the next 24 to 36 hours. Models are in 
fairly good agreement that the system will become a remnant low in 
a couple of days. While the NHC forecast has the system remaining a 
remnant low throughout the period, there is some guidance, including 
the ECMWF, that dissipate the system earlier. The intensity 
guidance remains in fairly good agreement, and the forecast lies 
near the corrected model consensus aids.
 
The storm is moving to the west-northwest at 8 kt, and a general
west-northwest to northwest motion is expected during the next 
couple of days while the storm moves along the southwestern 
periphery of the ridge.  After that time, a turn to the north is 
forecast while the storm moves around the west side of the ridge 
and toward a weakness.  The new track forecast is similar to the 
previous, and lies near the middle of the guidance envelope closest 
to model consensus.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Franklin was
located near latitude 14.8 North, longitude 67.8 West. Franklin is
moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A
west-northwestward track is expected to continue for the next day or
so followed by a sharp turn to the north. On the forecast track,
Franklin should approach the southern coast of Hispaniola on 
Tuesday.
 
Data from NOAA reconnaissance aircraft indicate that the maximum 
sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. Some 
strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure measured by NOAA reconnaissance
aircraft is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area beginning late Tuesday.
 
RAINFALL: Franklin is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 2 to 4
inches, with isolated higher amounts of 6 inches, across Puerto Rico
through the middle of the week. Rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches,
with isolated higher amounts up to 12 inches, will be possible
across portions of Hispaniola.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 PM AST Sun Aug 20 2023
 
This afternoon we have received a wealth of data from both a NOAA
reconnaissance mission and satellite imagery near the area of low
pressure located in the eastern Caribbean Sea. Earlier visible
satellite imagery showed the system had likely formed a tight
low-level vortex based on the earlier cloud motions before a
convective burst obscured the center. Scatterometer data that
clipped the system on the east side also showed winds near tropical
storm intensity. The NOAA aircraft flew through the system shortly
thereafter, and found the system had indeed formed a well-defined
center, with 950-mb flight level winds of 51 kt just to the
northeast of the center. All this information confirms that
Tropical Storm Franklin has formed this afternoon, with an initial
intensity set at 40 kt.
 
The initial motion is off to the west-northwest at 290/12 kt. Over 
the next 24 hours this general motion should continue while the 
system remains steered by a narrow mid-level ridge. Thereafter, a 
large mid-ocean trough over the western Atlantic will produce a 
pronounced weakness in this ridging, likely causing the tropical 
storm to make a sharp turn northward, bringing the storm near or 
over the large island of Hispaniola in about 48-60 h. Afterwards, 
another mid-latitude trough is forecast to amplify southward, 
maintaining this weakness, and resulting in Franklin turning 
northeastward towards the end of the forecast period. There is a 
decent amount of spread in the track guidance, related to just when 
Franklin will make the initial northward turn. For this initial 
forecast, the NHC track forecast will stick close to the track 
consensus TVCN, which favors a track in between the latest ECMWF and 
GFS solutions, favoring the GFS a bit more.
 
Intensity wise, Franklin may have to deal with a bit of westerly
wind shear in the short-term, limiting more robust intensification
early on. However, this shear drops off as the system makes its turn
northward towards Hispaniola a bit more intensification is shown
with a 55-kt intensity peak as Franklin approaches the coast. The
intensity forecast then is complicated by the fact that Franklin
will likely pass near or over the island sometime in the 2-3 day
time period, and some weakening is shown during this time.
However, the forecast environment after the system re-emerges into
the Western Atlantic looks mostly favorable, with reintensification
likely as long as the system is not too disrupted by the higher
terrain of Hispaniola. The NHC intensity forecast is in good
agreement with the consensus aids, and lies closest to the HFIP
corrected consensus approach through the forecast period.
 
Based on the current track forecast, a tropical storm watch has
been issued for the entire southern coastline of Haiti and the
Dominican Republic.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Franklin is forecast to approach Hispaniola late on Tuesday and
move across the island on Wednesday as a tropical storm, bringing a
risk of flooding from heavy rainfall, strong winds, and dangerous
waves along the coast.
 
2. Heavy rainfall from Franklin is expected across portions of
Puerto Rico and Hispaniola through the middle of the week. The heavy
rainfall may produce areas of flash and urban flooding as well as
river rises and mudslides. Across Hispaniola, significant and
potentially life-threatening flash flooding is possible Tuesday into
Wednesday.
