Tropical Storm Gert Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
1100 AM AST Sat Sep 02 2023

Gert is one tough little cyclone.  Satellite images indicate that 
deep convection continues near the center of the storm, despite 
northerly shear, and microwave data from this morning shows healthy 
banding structure.  A scatterometer pass from 1259 UTC shows peak 
winds of just over 40 kt, which supports at least 45 kt due to the 
small size of Gert.  The initial wind speed is raised to 45 kt, 
which also matches the latest TAFB Dvorak value and the UW-CIMSS 
SATCON estimate.

The storm is moving a bit faster to the north-northeast this 
morning, roughly 3 kt, as it begins to feel the steering from 
Idalia to the west-northwest.  Gert should accelerate north- 
northeastward later today and turn northward tomorrow around the 
eastern side of Idalia's large circulation.  All of the global 
models open Gert up into a trough of low pressure by 48 h due to 
rapidly increasing forward motion around Idalia, and the official 
forecast follows suit.  Little change in strength is expected with 
Gert before it dissipates, although this system has been more 
resilient to shear than most small tropical cyclones.  No 
significant changes were made to the previous NHC track forecast, 
with a small upward adjustment to the intensity forecast based on 
the initial value.

<title>Tropical Storm Katia Forecast Discussion Number 5</title>

Tropical Storm Katia Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122023
200 PM CVT Sat Sep 02 2023

Satellite images indicate the center of Katia is on the southern 
side of a large central dense overcast.  Scatterometer data from 
this morning indicated maximum winds were at least 40-45 kt, and 
the latest TAFB Dvorak estimate was 45 kt.  The initial wind speed 
is raised to 45 kt from the last full advisory, similar to the 
morning update statement.

Katia continues moving north-northwestward, or 330/10 kt.  The 
motion should gradually bend toward the northwest today due to the 
storm moving between a large middle- to upper-level low to the west 
and a narrow mid-latitude ridge over the eastern Atlantic.  The 
northwestward motion is likely to continue until about Monday, when 
the system becomes weaker and Katia gets stuck in the low-level 
subtropical ridge.  The only notable change to the track forecast is 
that it has been adjusted to the east in the short-term due to the 
initial position and is very close to the previous one at the end.

The storm is probably near its peak intensity with all models 
showing an increase in dry mid-level air near the center later 
today.  Combined with moderate southerly shear, this should be 
enough to choke off deep convection in Katia's core and cause 
gradual weakening.  In about 2 days, the environment becomes quite 
dry, which should finish off any remaining thunderstorm activity, 
and Katia is forecast to degenerate into a remnant low at that time. 
The NHC intensity forecast is raised early on to reflect the higher 
initial wind speed and is blended back with the guidance by the end 
of the forecast period.

LOCATION...31.6N 63.5W
ABOUT 90 MI...145 KM ESE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...E OR 100 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Idalia was located near latitude 31.6 North, longitude 63.5 West.
Idalia is moving toward the east near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue through the day.  A faster 
northeastward motion is forecast to begin on Sunday, followed by a 
turn toward the north-northeast and north on Monday and Tuesday.  
On the forecast track, Idalia will remain near Bermuda today, and 
then begin to move away from the island tonight and Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next few days. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
from the center and are occurring on Bermuda.  An elevated 
observing site at the National Museum of Bermuda recently reported 
sustained winds of 57 mph (91 km/h) and a gust to 68 mph (109 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda through
early Sunday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia will affect the southeastern U.S.
coast and Bermuda during the next couple of days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
1100 AM AST Sat Sep 02 2023
 
Although the center of Idalia has moved to the southeast of 
Bermuda, the island is experiencing the cyclone's strongest winds, 
which are located on the northwestern side of the frontal boundary.  
Deep convection persists to the northeast of the center, but the 
system is still extratropical due to the presence of attached 
fronts.  The initial wind speed remains 50 kt based on continuity.

Idalia's initial motion is eastward, or 100/8 kt, and a relatively 
slow eastward motion is expected to continue today.  A shortwave 
trough is forecast to move off the coast of New England and cut off 
from the mid-latitude flow, which should cause Idalia to accelerate 
toward the northeast and then north during the next few days.  
Another slow down is likely on days 4 and 5 a couple of hundred 
miles southeast of Nova Scotia when Idalia becomes collocated with 
the cut-off low.  The NHC track forecast is a bit east of the 
previous forecast, but not as far east as the HCCA aid.

Even though Idalia is producing what could be considered organized 
deep convection, global models fields are fairly unanimous that the 
cyclone will not shed its associated frontal boundaries.  Since the 
most likely scenario is that Idalia will remain an extratropical 
cyclone, a transition to a tropical or subtropical cyclone is no 
longer indicated in the official forecast during the short term 
(although it still can't be completely ruled out).  Little change 
in strength is anticipated during the next day or two, but gradual 
weakening is forecast toward the end of the forecast period when 
Idalia goes through another occlusion and fills south of Nova 
Scotia.
 
Even though Idalia is no longer explicitly forecast to transition 
to a tropical or subtropical cyclone, NHC advisories will continue 
until tropical storm conditions diminish on Bermuda and the 
Tropical Storm Warning is discontinued (most likely some time 
Sunday morning). 

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions will continue in Bermuda through early 
Sunday.

2. Swells from Idalia are forecast to cause life-threatening surf 
and rip current conditions along portions of the east coast of the 
United States through Labor Day weekend.
