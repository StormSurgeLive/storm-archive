Special Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
335 PM EDT Sat Aug 19 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Special outlook issued to update the discussion of the disturbance <br/>
in the Central Tropical Atlantic (AL99).<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL98):<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity continues in association with a <br/>
broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles west of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands. Environmental conditions appear generally <br/>
favorable for further development of this system, and a short-lived <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form this weekend while it moves <br/>
west-northwestward or northwestward at about 10 mph across the <br/>
eastern tropical Atlantic. By early next week, upper-level winds <br/>
over the system are forecast to increase, and further development is <br/>
not expected.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL99):<br/>
Updated: Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low <br/>
pressure located roughly halfway between the Cabo Verde Islands and <br/>
the Lesser Antilles have persisted and become better organized <br/>
this afternoon.  If these development trends continue, a <br/>
short-lived tropical depression is likely to form this afternoon or <br/>
evening, while the system moves west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph <br/>
across the tropical Atlantic. Upper-level winds are expected to <br/>
become increasingly unfavorable by late this weekend, with any <br/>
further development not anticipated.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Near the Windward Islands (AL90):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure has formed near the Windward Islands, <br/>
shower and thunderstorm activity has become better organized since <br/>
yesterday. Some additional development of this system is likely and <br/>
a tropical depression could form by early next week while this <br/>
system moves westward to west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph, across <br/>
the Lesser Antilles and over the eastern and central Caribbean Sea. <br/>
Regardless of development, heavy rainfall is possible over portions <br/>
of the Windward Islands during the next couple of days.  Interests <br/>
in the eastern and central Caribbean should monitor the progress of <br/>
this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
An area of disturbed weather located near the northwestern and <br/>
central Bahamas is expected to move into the Gulf of Mexico by early <br/>
next week, where a broad area of low pressure is expected to form. <br/>
Some slow development of this system is possible thereafter, and a <br/>
tropical depression could form as it moves westward and approaches <br/>
the western Gulf of Mexico coastline by the middle of next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Near the coast of Africa:<br/>
A tropical wave located near the western coast of Africa is <br/>
producing a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  <br/>
Some slow development is possible while it moves generally <br/>
west-northwestward across the tropical eastern Atlantic during the <br/>
next several days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Six Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
500 PM AST Sat Aug 19 2023
 
Visible imagery has shown a partially-exposed, well-defined 
low-level circulation for the past several hours. Infrared imagery 
has also shown deep convection persisting since around 0600 UTC east 
of the center with cold cloud tops of less than -85 degrees C. 
Therefore, the system now meets the necessary requirements to be 
classified as a tropical cyclone. Subjective satellite estimates 
from TAFB and SAB are 35 kt and 25 kt, respectively, and the initial 
intensity is set to 30 kt based on that data. 

Models indicate that the depression is currently in a relatively 
hostile environment. There is strong deep-layer vertical shear and 
the mid-level relative humidities are near 40 percent. These 
conditions are not expected to change much and global models suggest 
this will be a short-lived depression. Simulated satellite imagery 
from the ECMWF shows a few bursts of deep convection that are 
sheared away by 48 hours. The official forecast shows a steady-state 
depression through 36 hours that degenerates to a remnant low in 48 
hours, and dissipates by 60 hours. This prediction is near the 
various consensus model guidance.

The depression is moving west-northwestward at 14 kt. It is 
currently being steered by a narrow low-level ridge to its north. 
The system is expected to turn more westward and slow in forward 
speed over the next day or so followed by a slight bend back to the 
west-northwest on day 2. The NHC track forecast is near the simple 
and corrected model consensus aids, and leans towards the more 
southerly ECMWF track.
