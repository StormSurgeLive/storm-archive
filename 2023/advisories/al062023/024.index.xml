Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Sun Sep 3 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gert, located over the central subtropical Atlantic, and <br/>
Tropical Storm Katia, located over the eastern subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
 <br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL95):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave located <br/>
several hundred miles southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands have <br/>
become better organized since yesterday.  Environmental conditions <br/>
are forecast to be conducive for further development, and this <br/>
system is expected to become a tropical depression around midweek.  <br/>
Additional strengthening is likely late this week while the system <br/>
moves westward to west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the <br/>
central and western portions of the tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave over western Africa is forecast to move offshore in <br/>
a few days.  Environmental conditions could support some slow <br/>
development starting midweek while the wave moves to the west- <br/>
northwestward at about 15 mph over the far eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Gert Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
500 PM AST Sun Sep 03 2023
 
All indications suggest that Gert is finally weakening. Gert's 
center has been intermittently exposed since sunrise, displaced to 
the northeast from a small area of persistent deep convection. 
Dvorak estimates from TAFB, SAB, and the UW-CIMSS ADT have all 
decreased from earlier values. The initial intensity of 45 kt is a 
little above a consensus of the various satellite estimates, but I 
would rather only make a small change until we get a surface wind 
retrieval or another data set to help confirm the apparent weakening 
trend.
 
Gert continues to accelerate toward the north-northeast. A turn
northward as Gert continues to speed up and wrap around the eastern
periphery of Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia should begin soon. Most
models indicate that Gert will dissipate in the next 12 h or so, but
the NHC forecast carries it through 24 h since Gert has repeatedly
lasted longer than any model forecast indicated it should. The NHC
track and intensity forecasts are again very similar to previous
advisories, near the HCCA and simple consensus aids.

Tropical Storm Katia Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122023
900 PM GMT Sun Sep 03 2023

The center of Katia remains exposed on the latest satellite 
imagery, with a large convective burst in the northern semicircle 
noted this evening.  The intensity estimates are a split decision, 
with about half of data points suggesting tropical depression, and 
the other half still a tropical storm.  With the burst in 
convection, the initial wind speed is held at 35 kt, and there 
could be further clarity from partial scatterometer data this 
evening. A combination of southerly shear and very dry mid-level air 
should extinguish the thunderstorm activity early Monday and cause 
gradual weakening. The global models continue to show no organized 
thunderstorm activity by tomorrow, and Katia is likely to become a 
remnant low in 12-24 h.
 
The storm is holding steady on a northwest course at 6 kt. Katia 
is expected to be steered between a large middle- to upper- 
tropospheric cut-off low to the west over the central subtropical
Atlantic and a mid-level ridge to the east during the next 36 hours 
or so.  As Katia weakens, it should get trapped within the 
low-level subtropical ridge, causing little motion by Tuesday, and 
a southward drift by Wednesday. No significant changes were made to 
the NHC track or intensity forecasts.
