Remnants Of Jose Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112023
1100 PM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
Jose has been absorbed into the powerful extratropical cyclone,
Franklin.  Geostationary imagery suggests the remnants of Jose are
embedded in a convective band in the northeast quadrant of Franklin.
The initial intensity has been set to 40 kt, though it is hard to
determine a maximum wind speed associated with the remnants, when
the intensity of Franklin is likely much stronger.
 
This is the last advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center on
Jose.  Additional information on this system can be found in High
Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php

Tropical Storm Gert Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
1100 PM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
Gert remains relatively stationary to the southeast of Idalia.  The
tropical storm is quite compact and deep convection has been
persisting, mostly to the south of the center.  The Dvorak
classifications from TAFB and SAB are steady at 2.5/35 kt. but the
other satellite estimates from CIMSS at the University of Wisconsin
are a little higher.  Blending all of the satellite estimates
supports increasing the intensity to 40 kt.
 
Gert has barely moved during the past 12 hours as it is caught in
weak steering currents between Idalia and a mid- to upper-level low
over the central Atlantic.  As Idalia moves closer to Gert, the
storm is expected to turn northward on Saturday, and that motion
should continue until it dissipates by early Monday.
 
The storm has been resilient in an environment of strong northerly
shear.  Although the shear is expected to remain high, it seems
likely that Gert will maintain its strength or weaken only slightly
until it becomes absorbed by Idalia in a couple of days.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Franklin Discussion Number  49
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 PM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
The satellite appearance of Franklin suggests the cyclone has 
undergone a warm core seclusion process. Earlier scatterometer data 
showed a cold front nearing the core of Franklin, and recent visible 
satellite images suggest the presence of a bent-back occlusion 
wrapping around the western side of the low that appears to be the 
focus for the ongoing convection. Also, the latest FSU phase space 
diagrams from the GFS and ECMWF models show a thickness asymmetry 
consistent with a warm-core frontal cyclone. Therefore, it appears 
Franklin has completed its extratropical transition and is no longer 
a tropical cyclone. Since the earlier scatterometer data, the latest 
global model fields suggest that baroclinic forcing has resulted in 
a deepening of the low, with an acceleration of northerly winds to 
the west of the bent-back front. A blend of wind speeds from the 
various global models supports an initial intensity of 70 kt.

Franklin appears likely to remain a powerful, hurricane-force 
extratropical cyclone during the next 12 h or so due to baroclinic 
forcing. Thereafter, the extratropical cyclone is forecast to weaken 
as the low moves deeper into the mid-latitudes and gradually fills. 
Franklin is still moving northeastward (50/15 kt) within the flow 
between a deep-layer trough over the northwestern Atlantic and a 
subtropical ridge over the central Atlantic. A faster northeastward 
motion is forecast during the next couple of days, followed by a 
gradual turn toward the east and east-southeast later in the 
period as the cyclone rotates around a larger cut-off low over the 
eastern Atlantic. The global models are finally in better agreement 
on this outcome, and the track forecast has been adjusted south of 
the previous one at days 3-5. 

This is the last advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center on 
Franklin. Additional information on this system can be found in High 
Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS 
header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at

Tropical Depression Twelve Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122023
800 PM CVT Fri Sep 01 2023
 
A 1458 UTC AMSR-2 microwave pass showed that the depression has a
well-defined circulation, however the associated deep convection
was rather disjointed.  Dvorak CI numbers classifications are still
T2.5 from TAFB, but the final-T number dropped to 2.0 from SAB, so
the system is still being classified as a 30-kt depression at this
time.  Some more defined convective bands are now developing within
the circulation, so the system may be on its way to becoming a
tropical storm.  ASCAT data should provide a better handle on the
maximum winds of the system this evening.
 
The initial motion is toward the north-northwest (345 degrees) at 10
kt, with the depression situated between a mid-level ridge over
western Africa and a mid- to upper-level low over the
eastern/central Atlantic.  Another ridge near the Azores is expected
to force the depression to turn northwest and then west-northwest
around the mid-level low during the next few days.  The NHC track
forecast is a little east of the previous forecast near the
multi-model consensus aids, but this is more a function of an
adjustment of the initial position.  Once the system becomes a
remnant low, the low-level flow should turn it toward the northwest
and north on days 3 and 4.
 
The depression has a small window of relatively low shear, warm
waters, and a sufficiently moist atmosphere to strengthen to a
tropical storm tonight or on Saturday, which is shown in the
official forecast.  However, the system will be moving into a much
drier atmosphere with strengthening southerly shear, which should
cause weakening to begin in about 36 hours.  Organized deep
convection could also dissipate in a couple of days, and the
cyclone is forecast to become a remnant low by 48 hours.  Global
model fields suggest the remnant low could last a little bit longer
than shown in the previous forecast, and dissipation is now shown a
day later on day 5.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone 
Idalia was located near latitude 31.8 North, longitude 65.3 West. 
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east near 16 mph (26 
km/h) and this general trajectory at a slower forward speed is 
expected through Saturday as it remains near Bermuda.  A turn 
toward the northeast is forecast on Sunday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next few days. 
Idalia could transition to a tropical or subtropical storm on
Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles (350 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda on
Saturday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 3 to 5
inches, or 75 to 125 millimeters, across Bermuda through the
weekend.  The heavy rainfall will likely cause areas of flash and
urban flooding on the island.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia will affect the southeastern U.S.
coast and Bermuda during the next couple of days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
1100 PM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
Satellite images and surface observations indicate that Idalia
remains an extratropical cyclone with frontal features extending
through the center.  However, deep convection has recently formed
just to the northeast of the center, and that could signal the
beginning of a transition to a subtropical or tropical cyclone.
The initial intensity is held at 45 kt.
 
The cyclone is still moving eastward, or 100 degrees, at about 14
kt.  A continued eastward motion, but at a much slower pace, is
expected on Saturday as the system separates from a deep-layer
trough.  After that time, a turn to the northeast and then the
north is forecast as the cyclone cuts off from the progressive flow
over the north Atlantic.  The NHC track forecast is a little
slower than the previous one to be in better agreement with the
latest consensus models.
 
GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite images suggest that deep
convection will continue to increase near the center overnight, and
that could influence Idalia's transition to a tropical or
subtropical cyclone on Saturday.  There could also be some increase
in strength during that time.  However, by late in the weekend,
very strong southwesterly shear is expected to affect the system
and that should end the opportunity for strengthening and cause the
system to transition back to an extratropical cyclone.  The NHC
intensity forecast is similar to the previous one and near the
middle of the guidance envelope.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected in Bermuda on Saturday.
Heavy rainfall will likely cause areas of flash and urban flooding
on the island through the weekend.
