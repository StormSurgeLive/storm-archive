Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Sat Aug 19 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on newly formed <br/>
Tropical Depression Six, located roughly 1300 miles east of the <br/>
northern Leeward Islands. <br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL98):<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity continues to become better <br/>
organized in association with a broad area of low pressure located <br/>
several hundred miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands. Environmental <br/>
conditions appear generally favorable for further development, and <br/>
a short-lived tropical depression is likely to form within the <br/>
next day or so while it moves west-northwestward or northwestward at <br/>
about 10 mph across the eastern tropical Atlantic.  By early next <br/>
week, upper-level winds over the system are forecast to increase, <br/>
and further development is not expected.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Near the Windward Islands (AL90):<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity continues in association with an <br/>
area of low pressure near the Windward Islands. Some additional <br/>
development of this system is likely and a tropical depression could <br/>
form by early next week while this system moves westward to <br/>
west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph over the eastern and central <br/>
Caribbean Sea. Regardless of development, heavy rainfall is possible <br/>
over portions of the Windward Islands during the next couple of <br/>
days.  Interests in the eastern and central Caribbean should monitor <br/>
the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Western Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
An area of disturbed weather located over the Florida peninsula is <br/>
expected to move into the Gulf of Mexico by early next week, where a <br/>
broad area of low pressure is expected to form. Some slow <br/>
development of this system is possible thereafter, and a tropical <br/>
depression could form as it moves westward and approaches the <br/>
western Gulf of Mexico coastline by the middle of next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Near the coast of Africa:<br/>
A tropical wave located near the western coast of Africa is <br/>
producing a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  <br/>
Some slow development is possible while it moves generally <br/>
west-northwestward across the tropical eastern Atlantic during the <br/>
next several days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Six Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
1100 PM AST Sat Aug 19 2023
 
The latest CIMSS proxy-vis satellite imagery shows that the 
low-level center of Tropical Depression Six has become completely 
exposed, with all the convection displace to the east. Infrared 
imagery also shows that the cold cloud tops from earlier this 
afternoon have warmed over the last few hours. A blend of 
subjective and objective satellite estimates remain around 30 kt. 
Therefore, the intensity is held at 30 kt for this advisory.
 
The depression is currently in a hostile environment with strong 
deep-layer vertical shear, and dry mid-level relative humidities. 
These conditions are expected to persist, with the depression 
expected to be fairly short-lived. Simulated satellite imagery shows 
the potential for a few more convective bursts over the next day or 
so. The official forecast calls for no further strengthening, and 
for the system to become a post-tropical remnant low in 36 hours and 
dissipate by 48 hours. However, some models suggest that it may 
become devoid of convection a little earlier than currently 
forecast. The intensity forecast remains near the model consensus.
 
The depression is moving westward at 12 kt, to the south of a 
low-level ridge. The system is expected to continue westward, with a 
slight decrease in forward speed over the next day or so. By Monday, 
the system will round the edge of the ridge with a gradual turn to 
the west-northwest. The track forecast is very close to the previous 
NHC forecast and lies near the corrected model consensus aids.
