Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Mon Aug 21 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Franklin, located over the eastern Caribbean Sea, on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gert, located several hundred miles east-southeast of the <br/>
northern Leeward Islands, and on Tropical Storm Emily, located a <br/>
little over 1100 miles west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands.<br/>
<br/>
Western Gulf of Mexico (AL91):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms are showing signs of organization <br/>
in association with a broad area of low pressure located over the <br/>
central Gulf of Mexico.  Environmental conditions appear conducive <br/>
for development of this system, and a tropical depression or <br/>
tropical storm is likely to form before it reaches the western Gulf <br/>
of Mexico coastline on Tuesday. Interests in southern Texas and <br/>
northern Mexico should monitor the progress of this system as <br/>
tropical storm watches or warnings are likely to be issued later <br/>
today.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL92):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms over the Cabo Verde Islands and portions <br/>
of the tropical eastern Atlantic are associated with a tropical <br/>
wave. Environmental conditions appear generally conducive for <br/>
gradual development of this system, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form later this week while it moves west-northwestward <br/>
across the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Gert Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
1100 AM AST Mon Aug 21 2023
 
Gert barely qualifies a tropical cyclone. Visible satellite imagery 
indicates it still has a well-enough defined circulation sustained 
by a small area of deep convection that is displaced east of Gert's 
surface center. That said, during the few hours since sunrise, the 
tropical storm's circulation appears to have become stretched as 
convection has waned. The initial intensity estimate is 35 kt based 
on recent satellite estimates and ASCAT data last night, but new 
ASCAT data is expected very soon that will provide better 
information about the current maximum winds.
 
Strong upper-level winds associated with an upper-level low to the 
north of Gert and outflow from the more robust Franklin to its west 
ought to prevent Gert's convection from getting better organized. 
Most dynamical models continue to indicate that Gert will open into 
a trough within the next 12-36 h. While the tiny tropical cyclone 
has been quite persistent thus far, its hard to envision Gert 
lasting much longer in its current environment. Although the NHC 
forecast maintains Gert for a little longer, it could realistically 
dissipate at any time.
 
The initial motion of the tropical cyclone remains westward at a
slightly slower forward pace than overnight. Gert (or its remnants)
will likely turn west-northwestward or northwestward by tonight
until dissipation occurs. The NHC track forecast is very close to
the various consensus aids.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Emily Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL072023
1100 AM AST Mon Aug 21 2023
 
Emily has been devoid of deep convection for nearly 15 hours and no 
longer meets the definition of a tropical cyclone. Although sea 
surface temperatures are sufficiently warm to support occasional 
bursts of convection, strong wind shear and a very dry environment 
should prevent it from re-organizing as a tropical cyclone for at 
least the next couple days. The initial intensity of 30 kt is based 
on ASCAT-B data valid at 1200 UTC.
 
In about 3 days, the remnant low is forecast to turn northward as it 
encounters a deep-layer trough over the central Atlantic. While it 
turns, Emily could briefly encounter a more favorable upper-level 
wind pattern, which could support the redevelopment of convection. 
However, the low-level center may also become stretched and 
ill-defined at the same time. Regeneration as a tropical cyclone 
does not appear likely enough to explicitly forecast it at this 
time. Information on the potential for regeneration will be included 
in future Tropical Weather Outlooks, if necessary. Future 
information on Emily can also be found in High Seas forecasts issued 
by the National Hurricane Center and Ocean Prediction Center.

moving toward the west near 6 mph (9 km/h) and a slow westward 
motion is expected through this afternoon.  A sharp turn to the 
north is expected tonight or early Tuesday, and a generally 
northward motion is expected later on Tuesday.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Franklin is forecast to reach the southern 
coast of Hispaniola by Tuesday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some strengthening is forecast before Franklin reaches Hispaniola.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).

4 inches, with isolated higher amounts of 6 inches, across Puerto
Rico through the middle of the week. Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10
inches, with isolated higher amounts up to 15 inches, will be
possible across portions of Hispaniola.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin within the
warning area on Tuesday and are possible within the watch area
beginning late Tuesday into Wednesday.
 
STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above ground level along the immediate coast near and to
the east of where the center makes landfall in Hispaniola.

Tropical Storm Franklin Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
1100 AM EDT Mon Aug 21 2023

There are no lack of cold cloud tops associated with Tropical Storm 
Franklin this morning. The structure on satellite consists of a 
large bursting pattern, with cloud tops as cold as -90C close to and 
just east of the estimated center. However, it is unclear if any of 
this deep convection has resulted in structural improvement to 
the storm, with the most recent microwave imagery from a SSMIS F-16 
pass at 1007 UTC showing a chaotic structure, with evidence the 
center remains near the western edge of this large convective 
shield. The latest subjective satellite intensity estimates form 
TAFB is unchanged from earlier this morning. Thus, the initial 
intensity will remain 45 kt this advisory, which is also close to 
the latest D-MINT and D-PRINT estimates from UW-CIMSS. 

Franklin does appear to be slowing down a tad this morning while 
moving westward, with the latest estimate at 270/5 kt. The track 
forecast in the short-term is a bit problematic, with a large spread 
in model solutions even at 12 h, much higher than the climatological 
spread. This initial uncertainty may be related intensity 
differences in the global models, with some of the stronger guidance 
suggesting the tropical cyclone might reform further to the north 
and east over the next 12-24 hours. Thereafter, a large weakness to 
the north of Franklin, produced by a large mid-ocean trough draped 
across the Western Atlantic, should allow the storm to begin moving 
northward. A mid-latitude trough reinforces this weakness to the 
north in 60-72h, allowing the storm to begin moving northeastward. 
The most significant change in the guidance this cycle is the 
majority are quite a bit slower than the prior cycle, and the NHC 
forecast track was slowed down a bit, but not as much as some of the 
consensus aids.

Currently, Franklin is experiencing some moderate 15-20 kt westerly 
shear, which has paused its intensification for the time being. 
However, this shear is forecast to gradual decrease as it begins to 
move more northward, providing an opportunity for the tropical storm 
to strengthen as it approaches Hispaniola. Some weakening appears 
likely once the system moves over Hispaniola, especially if the 
storm moves over the highest terrain in the Dominican Republic. By 
Thursday, Franklin should be back over open waters in the Atlantic 
Ocean and has an opportunity to start strengthening again. However, 
the environment does not appear to be especially pristine, with the 
ECMWF showing more southwesterly vertical wind shear than the GFS. 
For now, its assumed this shear will not prevent slow 
intensification, possibly because the storm should be moving in the 
same direction as the shear vector, and the NHC intensity forecast 
will still show Franklin becoming a hurricane towards the end of the 
forecast period. This forecast is in best agreement with the HFIP 
corrected consensus approach (HCCA) but remains lower than some of 
the more aggressive regional-hurricane models (COAMPS-TC, HWRF).
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Heavy rainfall from Franklin is expected across portions of
Puerto Rico and Hispaniola through the middle of the week.  The
heavy rainfall may produce areas of flash and urban flooding as well
as river rises and mudslides.  Across Hispaniola, significant and
potentially life-threatening flash flooding is possible Tuesday into
Wednesday.
 
2. Franklin is expected to bring tropical storm conditions to
portions of the Dominican Republic and Haiti beginning on Tuesday
where Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect.

A Tropical Storm Warning has been issued for portions of south
Texas south of Port O'Connor.  A Tropical Storm Watch has been
issued from Port O'Connor northward to Sargent.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Mouth of Rio Grande to Port O'Connor, Texas
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Port O'Connor to Sargent, Texas
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within 24
hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within 24 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in eastern Texas and northern Mexico should
monitor the progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the disturbance was centered near
latitude 25.0 North, longitude 89.9 West. The system is moving
toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h).  A fast motion to the west 
is expected to continue, and the system is forecast to move inland 
over south Texas early Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast, and the system is expected to become a 
tropical storm before it reaches the Texas coast.
 
Satellite images indicate that the system is becoming better 
organized and it is expected to become a tropical depression later 
today.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for the disturbance can be found in the Tropical 
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header 
WTNT44 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml.

RAINFALL:  Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine is expected to produce
storm total rainfall amounts of 3 to 5 inches, with isolated higher
amounts of 7 inches, across Southern Texas on Tuesday and Wednesday.
This rainfall could lead to areas of flash and urban flooding.
 
Across Mexico, storm total rainfall of 4 to 6 inches, with local
amounts of 10 inches, are expected across portions of Coahilla and
Nuevo Leon on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Areas of flash and 
urban flooding are expected.
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area
and are possible in the watch area by Tuesday morning.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will 
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Mouth of Rio Grande to Sargent, including Baffin Bay, Corpus 
Christi Bay and Matagorda Bay...1 to 3 ft 

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large waves.  Surge-related flooding 
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, 
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
SURF: Large swells generated by the disturbance will affect
portions of southern Texas tonight through Tuesday.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092023
1000 AM CDT Mon Aug 21 2023

The broad area of low pressure over the central Gulf of Mexico 
continues to gradually become better organized with showers and 
thunderstorms increasing on the system's north side.  However, 
surface observations and early morning visible satellite images 
suggest that it does not have a well-defined center yet, and 
therefore, does not meet the definition of a tropical cyclone at 
this time.  Since the system is forecast to strengthen and make 
landfall as a tropical storm on Tuesday, advisories are being 
initiated on Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine with Tropical Storm 
Warnings now in effect for portions of south Texas.

The disturbance is moving fairly quickly to the west at 14 kt on the 
south side of a strong mid-level ridge located over the central U.S. 
An even faster motion to the west or west-northwest is expected, 
taking the system over southern Texas by midday Tuesday.  It should 
be noted that since the system does not yet have a clear center, the 
details of the track forecast are a bit uncertain.  The Air Force 
Hurricane Hunters are scheduled to investigate the system this 
afternoon, which should help assess the low-level structure.

The environmental factors are generally favorable for the system to 
strengthen. However, there is limited time for the disturbance to 
take advantage of those conditions, especially since it still lacks 
a well-defined center.  The NHC official intensity forecast shows 
the system reaching a peak intensity of 40 kt before landfall, which 
is near the high end of the model guidance.  Rapid weakening is 
expected after landfall.

KEY MESSAGES:

1. Heavy rainfall from Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine is expected 
across South Texas on Tuesday and Wednesday. The heavy rainfall may 
produce areas of flash and urban flooding. Across portions of 
Coahilla and Nuevo Leon in Mexico, flash flooding with possible 
landslides in mountainous terrain is expected Tuesday into 
Wednesday.

2. Coastal flooding is possible along the south Texas coast 
tonight through Tuesday morning.  

3. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area and 
are possible in the watch area beginning Tuesday morning.
