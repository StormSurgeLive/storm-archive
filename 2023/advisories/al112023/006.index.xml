Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Wed Aug 30 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Franklin, located a couple hundred miles northwest of Bermuda, on <br/>
Hurricane Idalia, located over southeastern Georgia, and on Tropical <br/>
Depression Eleven, located several hundred miles east-southeast of <br/>
Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave located <br/>
near the Cabo Verde Islands is producing disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms. Environmental conditions appear conducive for gradual <br/>
development of this system, and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form later this week while the system moves west-northwestward to <br/>
northwestward across the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (Remnants of Gert):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a trough of low pressure <br/>
(the remnants of Gert) are located several hundred miles north of <br/>
the northern Leeward Islands. Environmental conditions are becoming <br/>
unfavorable for additional development as the system drifts <br/>
northward or north- northeastward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Eleven Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112023
500 PM AST Wed Aug 30 2023
 
The depression has become a little less organized on visible 
satellite imagery this afternoon, with multiple vortices exposed on 
the western edge of the convection. Satellite intensity estimates 
from TAFB/SAB are around 30 kt, and given the current disorganized 
structure, with an exposed center, the intensity will remain at 30 
kt for this advisory.
 
The depression continues to drift over the central Atlantic.  It 
will slowly move northward later today, and then a little faster 
northward by Thursday. The NHC track forecast is close to the 
previous one, and lies near the corrected consensus aids.
 
The intensity forecast remains unchanged from the previous forecast. 
The depression still may briefly strengthen into a very short-lived 
tropical storm, but most of the intensity guidance keeps the system 
as a depression. As the system moves northward, it will encounter 
dry air and increased vertical wind shear. Therefore, the 
depression is forecast to become a post-tropical remnant low in 
about day or so, and dissipate by 48 h.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Franklin was 
located near latitude 33.9 North, longitude 66.6 West. Franklin is 
moving toward the northeast near 13 mph (20 km/h). A gradual turn 
toward the east-northeast is expected tonight, with a slightly 
faster east-northeastward motion through Friday. On the forecast 
track, the center of Franklin is expected to pass to the northwest 
of Bermuda through this evening.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast over the next several days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles 
(260 km). An elevated weather station at the National Museum of 
Bermuda recently reported a sustained wind of 39 mph (63 km/h) and a 
gust of 62 mph (100 km/h). A weather station at the Bermuda airport 
recently reported a 2-minute average wind of 40 mph (65 km/h) and a

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  40
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
1100 AM AST Wed Aug 30 2023
 
The large eye of Franklin has become a bit ragged in recent
satellite images. Upper-level outflow from Hurricane Idalia
continues to impinge on the western side of Franklin's circulation,
and recent SSMIS microwave data show a thinner ring of inner core
convection on the western side of the eye, though the eyewall
remains closed. The overall satellite presentation has degraded some
since yesterday, and this is reflected in the latest objective and
subjective satellite estimates. The initial intensity is lowered
slightly to 90 kt, based on consensus T5.0/90 kt Dvorak estimates
from SAB and TAFB and UW-CIMSS ADT and AiDT estimates around 85-90
kt. Radar data from Bermuda reveal an outer band of the hurricane is
passing near the island, and tropical storm conditions are expected
to spread over the area within the next few hours.
 
The flow between a deep-layer trough over the eastern United States
and Canada and a high pressure ridge over the central Atlantic is
steering Franklin northeastward (50/11 kt). The aforementioned
trough is forecast to move eastward during the next couple of days,
and the flow ahead of this feature should cause Franklin to move
slightly faster toward the east-northeast. Little change was made to
this portion of the forecast. It is still unclear whether or not
Franklin will become completely captured by the trough, which
introduces greater uncertainty in the days 3-5 track forecast. The
GFS favors a faster northeastward motion with greater trough
interaction, while the ECMWF and UKMET keep Franklin on a slower
eastward track before it is steered deeper into the mid-latitudes.
The updated NHC forecast follows the consensus trends and is again
slower than the previous prediction beyond 72 h. Franklin is
forecast to become extratropical by 96 h, although this timing
largely depends on the extent of trough interaction.
 
Increasing northwesterly shear is expected over Franklin during the
next couple of days. This should induce at least gradual weakening
in the near term, though the tropical-storm-force wind field is
likely to expand as the system accelerates and gains latitude. The
updated track forecast brings Franklin over sub-26C waters in
about 72 h, with extratropical transition forecast to occur by 96
h. Note that this timing largely depends on the extent of trough
interaction that occurs in the coming days, so future adjustments
could be necessary.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda today while
Franklin makes its closest approach to the island.
 
2. Life-threatening surf and rip currents are occurring along the
east coast of the United States. These conditions are expected to
continue during the next couple of days.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Idalia was located
by Doppler radar near latitude 31.4 North, longitude 82.5 West.
Idalia is moving toward the northeast near 20 mph (31 km/h).
A turn toward the east-northeast is expected tonight, followed by an
eastward motion on Thursday.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Idalia will continue moving across southeastern Georgia through 
this evening, near the coast of South Carolina tonight, and just 
offshore the coast of southern North Carolina on Thursday.  Idalia 
is then expected to move east-southeastward over the western 
Atlantic on Friday.
 
NOAA Doppler radar data indicate that maximum sustained winds have 
decreased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher gusts.  Idalia is 
forecast to weaken further, but it could still produce 
hurricane-force winds, especially in gusts, through this evening 
across portions of southeastern Georgia and southern South Carolina. 
Idalia is forecast to be a tropical storm while moving near the 
coasts of northeastern South Carolina and North Carolina tonight and 
on Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230
miles (370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 981 mb (28.97 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Keaton Beach, FL to Yankeetown, FL...5-8 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Anclote River, FL...3-5 ft
Aucilla River, FL to Keaton Beach, FL...2-4 ft
Anclote River, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...2-4 ft
Tampa Bay...2-4 ft
Saint Catherines Sound, GA to South Santee River, SC...3-5 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to Saint Catherines Sound, GA...2-4 ft
Beaufort Inlet, NC to Ocracoke Inlet, NC...2-4 ft
Neuse River and Pamlico River...2-4 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...1-3 ft
South Santee River, SC to Beaufort Inlet, NC...1-3 ft
Ocracoke Inlet, NC to Duck, NC...1-3 ft
Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL to Mouth of the St. Mary's
River...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are occurring within the hurricane
warning area in southern Georgia and will spread to the coasts of 
Georgia and southern South Carolina within the hurricane warning 
area later today.  Hurricane conditions are possible within the 
hurricane watch area along the Georgia and South Carolina coasts 
later today.

Tropical storm conditions will continue through this afternoon 
within the tropical storm warning area along the Florida west coast. 
Tropical storm conditions are occurring within the tropical storm
warning area along the northeastern coast of Florida and Georgia
and will spread into South Carolina and North Carolina through the
day and into Thursday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce a swath of 4 to 8 inches of
rainfall with isolated maxima up to 12 inches from portions of North
Florida through central Georgia and South Carolina, and through
eastern North Carolina into Thursday. These rainfall amounts will
lead to areas of flash, urban, and moderate river flooding, with
considerable impacts.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia are affecting the eastern and
central Gulf coast from Florida to Louisiana, and will increase
along the southeastern U.S. coast today.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES:  A couple of tornadoes are possible today across central
and northeast Florida into southeast Georgia.  The tornado threat
will increase through this afternoon across coastal South Carolina
and continue into tonight for coastal North Carolina.

<title>Hurricane Idalia Forecast Discussion Number 16</title>

Hurricane Idalia Discussion Number  16...Retransmitted
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
1100 AM EDT Wed Aug 30 2023
 
Although Idalia reached category 4 intensity early this morning 
over the far northeastern Gulf of Mexico, Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter data just before landfall indicated that the peak 
winds had started to decrease and the minimum pressure had begun to 
rise.  This was likely due to an eyewall replacement cycle (which 
was shown by radar data) and an increase in shear over the 
hurricane.  Idalia made landfall near Keaton Beach, Florida, 
as a category 3 hurricane around 1145 UTC, and it has been 
weakening quickly since then over northern Florida.  WSR-88D 
Doppler velocities suggest that the maximum winds are now down to 
about 80 kt.

Idalia is moving toward the north-northeast, or 030/17 kt.  The 
hurricane is located between a subtropical ridging near the Greater 
Antilles and a deep-layer trough over the eastern United States.  
This pattern is expected to cause Idalia to turn toward the 
northeast and then east during the next 36 hours, and the track 
guidance is very good agreement on the center moving near the 
coasts of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina through 
Thursday.  Model spread increases beyond 36 hours, although there 
is not as much uncertainty as yesterday.  None of the models shows 
the circulation curving back toward the U.S. anymore, but the 
guidance is suggestive that Idalia will likely slow down as it 
approaches Bermuda on days 3 through 5.  During that period, the 
NHC track forecast is a blend of the previous forecast with the 
current HCCA and TVCX consensus aids.

Relatively fast weakening is anticipated through the rest of the 
day.  The intensity guidance is hovering right around the hurricane 
threshold at 12 hours, and the official forecast therefore 
conservatively shows a 65-kt hurricane near the Georgia/South 
Carolina border this evening.  Idalia should become a tropical 
storm by tonight while moving near the coast of South Carolina.  
The intensity forecast is a little bit above the guidance at 24 and 
36 hours to account for the possibility of a band of strong winds 
developing on the back side of Idalia near eastern North Carolina, 
associated with a nearby frontal boundary.  Beyond 36 hours, the 
guidance suggests that Idalia's intensity is likely to hover 
between 45-50 kt through the end of the forecast period.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Significant impacts from storm surge will continue along the 
Gulf coast of Florida within the Storm Surge Warning through this 
evening.  Dangerous storm surge is also expected along the 
southeastern U.S. coast within the Storm Surge Warning area tonight 
and Thursday.  Residents in these areas should follow any advice 
given by local officials.
 
2. Damaging hurricane-force winds will occur where the core of 
Idalia moves across southern Georgia and southern South Carolina 
within the hurricane warning area through this evening.  Residents 
in these areas should be prepared for long-duration power outages.  
Strong winds are also expected to spread northeastward across South 
Carolina and North Carolina through Thursday within the Tropical 
Storm Warning area.
 
3. Areas of flash, urban, and moderate river flooding, with 
considerable impacts, are expected from portions of North Florida 
through central Georgia and South Carolina, through eastern North 
Carolina into Thursday.
