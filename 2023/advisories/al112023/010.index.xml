Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Thu Aug 31 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Franklin, located a few hundred miles northeast of Bermuda, on <br/>
Tropical Storm Idalia, located off the coast of North Carolina, and <br/>
on Tropical Storm Jose, located several hundred miles east of <br/>
Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
An area of low pressure located just west of the Cabo Verde Islands <br/>
continues to produce showers and thunderstorms with some signs of <br/>
organization. Environmental conditions appear conducive for further <br/>
development of this system, and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form during the next day or two while the system moves northwestward <br/>
at 10 to 15 mph across the eastern tropical Atlantic. Interests in <br/>
the Cabo Verde Islands should monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (Remnants of Gert):<br/>
A small area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
north-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands is producing small <br/>
bursts of showers and thunderstorms to the south of its center. This <br/>
system has a short window for further development during the next <br/>
day or so while it drifts northeastward or eastward, before <br/>
upper-level winds become increasingly unfavorable by the weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
An area of low pressure could develop over the eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic early next week in association with a tropical wave. <br/>
Environmental conditions could support some gradual development of <br/>
this system through the middle part of next week while it moves <br/>
westward to west-northwestward over the eastern and central portions <br/>
of the tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Jose Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112023
1100 AM AST Thu Aug 31 2023
 
Jose is producing bursts of deep convection near and over the 
estimated center position this morning. Overnight microwave data 
suggest the surface center was pulled slightly eastward by an 
increase in convection during the diurnal maximum period. The 
various satellite intensity estimates range from 32-45 kt this 
morning, with the subjective Dvorak classifications from SAB and 
TAFB (45 kt) higher than the objective UW-CIMSS estimates which are 
around 35 kt. A timely ASCAT-B pass over Jose shows believable wind 
vectors up to 32 kt in the eastern semicircle, which supports 
holding the initial intensity at 35 kt for this advisory.
 
The storm is moving northward at about 6 kt. An acceleration toward
the north is expected during the next day or so as the small system
gets caught in the broader cyclonic circulation associated with
Hurricane Franklin. Deep-layer shear is forecast to increase over
Jose as it accelerates northward toward Franklin, but Jose appears
likely to maintain some tropical-storm-force winds in its eastern
semicircle due to its faster northward motion. There have been no
notable changes to the NHC track or intensity forecast, and Jose is
now expected to be absorbed by Franklin in 36 h, in agreement with
the latest global models.

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  45
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 PM AST Thu Aug 31 2023
 
The cloud pattern of Franklin has continued to erode this afternoon.
Deep convection is limited to the southeastern portion of its
circulation, as strong shear continues to negatively affect the
system. Scatterometer data from today show the hurricane is still
producing a very large area of winds greater than 50 kt, though the
resolution limitations of the instrument do not allow for a peak
intensity estimate. The conventional satellite intensity estimates
continue to decrease, and the initial intensity is lowered to 80 kt
based on a blend of the latest objective and subjective estimates.
 
Franklin is expected to lose tropical characteristics over the next
day or so, with strong shear continuing over the system and
intrusions of drier mid-level air into the circulation as it
accelerates deeper into the mid-latitudes. However, this will not
immediately lead to significant weakening of the system. The GFS and
ECMWF both show an enhancement of hurricane-force winds on the
western side of the storm while the system interacts with a
baroclinic system and begins extratropical transition. Thus, the
near-term intensity forecast shows little change in strength, and
Franklin appears likely to maintain hurricane-force winds through
its extratropical transition in 36 h. Thereafter, a faster weakening
trend is shown through the rest of the forecast period, which is
consistent with the latest multi-model consensus aids.
 
The initial motion of Franklin is east-northeastward at 65/12 kt. A
northeastward acceleration is forecast during the next couple of
days while the cyclone moves within the flow between a subtropical
ridge over the central Atlantic and a deep-layer trough over
Atlantic Canada. From there, the track guidance generally supports a
continued northeastward motion over the northern Atlantic, and this
forecast shows a slightly faster motion beyond day 3 to reflect the
model consensus trends this cycle.

Tropical Storm Idalia Intermediate Advisory Number 20A
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
200 PM EDT Thu Aug 31 2023
 
...IDALIA LOSING TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS...
...STRONG WINDS AND STORM SURGE CONTINUE ALONG THE COAST OF NORTH 
CAROLINA...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM EDT...1800 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...33.6N 74.8W
ABOUT 120 MI...195 KM SE OF CAPE LOOKOUT NORTH CAROLINA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...E OR 90 DEGREES AT 20 MPH...31 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...994 MB...29.35 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Tropical Storm Warning has been discontinued from Surf City, 
North Carolina, southward.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* North of Surf City North Carolina to the North Carolina/Virginia 
border
* Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds
 
A Storm Surge Watch is in effect for...
* Beaufort Inlet to Ocracoke Inlet North Carolina
* Neuse and Pamlico Rivers North Carolina
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline in the indicated locations. For a depiction of areas at
risk, please see the National Weather Service Storm Surge
Watch/Warning Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Idalia.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Idalia was
located near latitude 33.6 North, longitude 74.8 West.  Idalia is
moving toward the east near 20 mph (31 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue today.  A turn toward the
east-southeast and southeast with a reduction in forward speed is
expected on Friday, followed by a turn toward the east and northeast
over the weekend.  On the forecast track, Idalia will move away from
the coast of North Carolina today and tonight, and approach Bermuda 
over the weekend.
 
Satellite-derived wind data and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter 
measurements indicate that maximum sustained winds have increased to 
near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher gusts.  Little change in strength 
is expected through this evening.  Some slight weakening is 
forecast tonight and on Friday.
 
Idalia is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone later today,
but it is expected to make a transition back to a tropical storm
over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
from the center.  NOAA buoy 41025 just offshore Cape Hatteras near 
Diamond Shoals recently reported a sustained wind of 54 mph (86 
km/h) and a gust to 69 mph (111 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Beaufort Inlet, NC to Ocracoke Inlet, NC...2-4 ft
Neuse and Bay Rivers...2-4 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...2-4 ft
Ocracoke Inlet, NC to Duck, NC...1-3 ft
Cape Fear, NC to Beaufort Inlet, NC...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue within the tropical
storm warning area along the coast of North Carolina through this
evening.
 
RAINFALL:  Rainfall will be diminishing by early afternoon across
eastern North Carolina into southeast Virginia.  Additional rainfall
totals of .50 to 1.5 inches are possible across these areas.   This
rainfall may compound any ongoing flooding concerns.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia along the eastern Gulf coast will
continue to subside today.  Swells will affect the southeastern U.S.
coast during the next few days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 500 PM EDT.

Tropical Storm Idalia Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
1100 AM EDT Thu Aug 31 2023
 
Satellite imagery, surface observations, and Air Force Reserve
Hurricane Hunter data all indicate that Idalia continues to tangle
with a frontal boundary that extends northward offshore the Outer
Banks.  In addition, organized deep convection has mostly dissipated
near the center, and it appears that Idalia is on its way to
becoming extratropical.  The initial intensity remains 50 kt based
on coastal wind reports and the reconnaissance data.
 
Global model fields show winds increasing on the northwestern side
of the frontal boundary during the day as Idalia is pulling away
from the coast of North Carolina, and as a result, the NHC intensity
forecast shows some strengthening in the short term.  Idalia is
expected to become fully extratropical by this evening, which is
now shown in the official forecast.  Winds should begin decreasing
tonight, and simulated satellite imagery from the GFS and ECMWF
models suggests that the circulation will continue to be devoid of
deep convection, and attached to a front, through at least 36
hours.  By 48 hours, the low will reach warmer waters, the
front is likely to weaken, and the ECMWF shows deep convection
redeveloping.  As a result, the official forecast shows Idalia
becoming a tropical storm again on Saturday.  Intensity-wise, the
guidance indicates that the peak winds are likely to fluctuate
between 40-45 kt from days 2 through 5.
 
Idalia is now moving eastward, or 090/17 kt, between a deep-layer
trough over the northeastern U.S. and a subtropical anticyclone
near the Bahamas.  The trough is likely to bypass Idalia in a few
days, which will cause its eastward motion to slow down to about 5
kt on days 2 and 3 as it approaches Bermuda.  On days 4 and 5, a
second trough is expected to turn Idalia to the northeast, but still
at a relatively slow forward speed.  The track guidance is in a bit
more agreement than the past few days, and the NHC forecast lies
between the TVCX and HCCA consensus aids.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Rainfall will be diminishing by early afternoon from coastal
North Carolina into far southeast Virginia.  Moderate river
flooding, with considerable impacts, will continue across coastal
North Carolina through today.
 
2. Coastal flooding is expected within the Storm Surge Watch
area in North Carolina today.  Residents in these areas should
follow any advice given by local officials.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions will continue across eastern North
Carolina within the Tropical Storm Warning area through this
evening.
