Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Fri Sep 1 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Franklin, located several hundred miles northeast of Bermuda, on <br/>
Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia, located a few hundred miles west of <br/>
Bermuda, on Tropical Storm Jose, located several hundred miles <br/>
east-northeast of Bermuda, and has resumed advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Gert, located several hundred miles east-southeast of <br/>
Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
Recent microwave satellite images indicate the circulation of a low <br/>
pressure system located west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands has <br/>
become better defined since yesterday. In addition, the associated <br/>
shower and thunderstorm activity continues to show signs of <br/>
organization. Based on these trends, advisories are likely to be <br/>
initiated on a tropical depression or tropical storm later this <br/>
morning. The system is moving northwestward at 10 to 15 mph across <br/>
the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...near 100 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...near 100 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa <br/>
this weekend. Environmental conditions appear conducive for some <br/>
gradual development of this system during the early and middle <br/>
parts of next week, and a tropical depression could form while it <br/>
moves westward to west-northwestward over the eastern and central <br/>
portions of the tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>

Tropical Storm Jose Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112023
1100 AM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
Deep convection is waning and becoming more asymmetric near the 
center of Jose on satellite imagery as northerly shear from 
Franklin's outflow increases. The low-level center is starting to 
become exposed. Jose's initial intensity is conservatively lowered 
to 45 kt for this advisory based on the automated Dvorak intensity 
estimate from UW-CIMSS and the degraded satellite structure of Jose. 
This lies near the average of the upper uncertainty bound from the 
CIMSS DMINT intensity estimate (which incorporated the overnight 
SSMIS microwave overpass) and the Dvorak estimates of 35 kt from 
TAFB and SAB. 

Jose is accelerating and the forward motion is currently estimated 
to be north-northeastward (15 degrees) at 20 kt. The increase in 
forward speed and interaction with Franklin could lead to a slight 
expansion of the tropical-storm-force winds on the east side of 
Jose. The tropical storm is expected to dissipate sometime tonight 
as it is absorbed by Franklin. The track forecast is slightly 
faster than the consensus aids based on the global model wind 
fields. Little intensity change is forecast as the fast forward 
speed of the system is likely to maintain stronger winds in the 
eastern semicircle, despite diminished convection.

Tropical Depression Gert Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
500 AM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
After more than a week of meandering over the central Atlantic, the 
circulation of former Tropical Storm Gert has again become well 
defined, and the system has acquired enough persistent and 
organized deep convection for it to be classified as a tropical 
depression once again.  A recent AMSR2 microwave overpass shows that 
the small circulation is located near the northeastern portion of 
the persistent convective mass.  The initial intensity is set at 30 
kt and is based on the latest subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB 
and SAB.   
 
Gert is located within an area of moderate to strong shear.  The 
shear is forecast to increase even more in the next 18-24 hours 
which should limit strengthening, however Gert could re-gain 
tropical storm status today.  Over the weekend, gradual weakening 
is expected when the upper-level environment becomes more hostile.  
The global models are in relatively good agreement that Gert will 
be absorbed by the larger circulation of Idalia when it is over the 
central Atlantic in 3 to 4 days. 

Gert is moving eastward at about 7 kt.  The eastward motion should 
continue today, but by Saturday, Gert is forecast to turn 
northeastward as it is steered around the low- to mid-level flow 
around the eastern side of the larger circulation of Idalia.  By 48 
hours Gert should turn northward around the eastern flank of Idalia 
and that motion should continue until dissipation occurs.  The 
track guidance is in good agreement on the overall scenario but 
there are significant differences in Gert's forward speed.  The NHC 
track is a blend of the GFS and ECMWF models.

NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 AM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
Franklin has a much more asymmetric appearance this morning,
indicative of the increasingly disruptive upper-wind pattern
associated with an approaching mid-latitude baroclinic zone.  In 
fact, the remaining deep convective mass is about 100 mi southeast 
of the surface center.  The initial intensity is lowered to 70 kt 
and is based on a compromise of the available subjective and 
objective intensity estimate techniques. 
 
Franklin is showing signs of losing its tropical characteristics
while drier, more stable mid-level air and increasing northwesterly
shear impedes over the northwest portion of the cyclone. 
Consequently, the completion of an extratropical transition is
expected later tonight or early Saturday.  However, little change in
strength is forecast, and Franklin should maintain its 
hurricane-force sustained winds through the weekend.  By early next 
week, gradual weakening is expected, which agrees with a blend of
the intensity consensus guidance and the statistical-dynamic SHIPS
models.
 
Franklin's initial motion is estimated to be east-northeastward or 
060/16 kt.  An increase in forward speed toward the northeast is 
forecast.  At the same time, Franklin moves within the mid-latitude 
steering flow between high pressure to the east, over the central 
Atlantic, and an extensive baroclinic system moving out of the 
Canadian Maritimes.  Global model spread continues to increase 
beyond day 3.  Two scenarios are possible.  The European models 
take a southeastward track while interacting with a larger 
cut-off low meandering west of the Iberian peninsula.  The other 
solution involves the GFS and the regional guidance which gradually 
turns the cyclone northeastward to northward over the northeast 
Atlantic. The official forecast track indicates a blend of the two 
model clusters, lying between both, and is close to the multi-model 
consensus aid.

The Bermuda Weather Service has upgraded to the Tropical Storm
Watch for Bermuda to a Tropical Storm Warning.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Idalia was located near latitude 31.9 North, longitude 67.9 West.
Idalia is moving toward the east-southeast near 17 mph (28 km/h), 
and this general trajectory at a slower forward speed is expected 
through Saturday.  A turn toward the east and then northeast is 
forecast late Saturday and Sunday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Idalia will move near or to the south of Bermuda on 
Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual weakening is forecast through early Saturday.
Restrengthening is possible over the weekend, and Idalia is expected
to transition back to a tropical storm on Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda by
Saturday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 3 to 5
inches, or 75 to 125 millimeters, across Bermuda through Sunday
night. The heavy rainfall will likely cause areas of flash and urban
flooding on the island.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia will affect the southeastern U.S.
coast and Bermuda during the next couple of days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
1100 AM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
Idalia is not producing deep convection and remains an extratropical 
cyclone, with the strongest winds located along the northwestern 
side of the attached frontal boundary.  The initial intensity 
remains 50 kt based on continuity from the previous advisory.  
Scatterometer should hit the area of strongest winds later this 
morning and give us a better idea on the intensity.

The cyclone may be finally slowing down a bit, and the initial 
motion estimate is east-southeastward (110 degrees) at 15 kt.  
Additional deceleration is expected during the next 36 hours while 
the center turns eastward and moves near or to the south of 
Bermuda.  A shortwave trough is forecast to move off the coast of 
New England by early Sunday (about 48 hours), and that feature 
should turn Idalia toward the northeast at a faster speed by day 3. 
Even then, there is disagreement among the models whether this 
trough will pull Idalia quickly northward (e.g., the ECMWF) or if 
it will leave Idalia behind (e.g, the GFS).  The NHC track forecast 
therefore shows a slower north or north-northeast motion on days 4 
and 5, leaning toward the various consensus aids.
 
There remains significant uncertainty on what type of cyclone 
Idalia will be during the next 3 days.  On one hand, simulated 
satellite imagery from the GFS and ECMWF models shows deep 
convection redeveloping near Idalia's center on Saturday once the 
cyclone reaches warmer waters.  On the other hand, global model 
fields show the thickness gradient near the front weakening, but 
they don't necessarily show Idalia shedding all of its frontal 
features.  To maintain continuity from previous forecasts, the NHC 
forecast shows Idalia regaining tropical storm status in about 24 
hours while it is near Bermuda, and some reintensification is 
possible after that time.  Model fields show the temperature 
gradient tightening again as Idalia goes through a possible 
occlusion in 3-4 days, and the forecast therefore shows an 
extratropical cyclone again on day 4.  
 
Based on the updated forecast, the Bermuda Weather Service has 
issued a Tropical Storm Warning for the island.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected in Bermuda by Saturday.
Heavy rainfall will likely cause areas of flash and urban flooding 
on the island.
