Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Wed Aug 30 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Franklin, located a couple of hundred miles west-northwest of <br/>
Bermuda, on Hurricane Idalia, near the coast of the Florida Big <br/>
Bend, and on Tropical Depression Eleven, located several hundred <br/>
miles east-southeast of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave located <br/>
near the Cabo Verde Islands is producing an area of disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms. Environmental conditions appear <br/>
conducive for gradual development of this system, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form later this week while the system <br/>
initially moves west-northwestward and then turns northwestward <br/>
across the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (Remnants of Gert):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a trough of low pressure <br/>
(the remnants of Gert) are located several hundred miles to the <br/>
north of the northern Leeward Islands. Environmental conditions do <br/>
not appear to be that favorable for additional development over the <br/>
next couple of days as the system drifts slowly northward or north- <br/>
northeastward.  Upper-level winds are forecast to become unfavorable <br/>
for development by the weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Tropical Depression Eleven Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112023
1100 AM AST Wed Aug 30 2023
 
The depression had a large burst of convection this morning. 
Scatterometer missed the system this morning, so we did 
not get any data of the wind field with this convective burst. A 
blend of subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates are 
still around 30 kt, and the intensity is held at 30 kt for this 
advisory cycle.
 
The depression continues to meander over the central Atlantic.  It 
is expected to slowly move northward later today, and then a little 
faster northward by Thursday. The NHC track forecast is slower in 
short-term than the previous forecast, given the initial slow 
motion, and lies near the corrected consensus aids.
 
The intensity forecast remains unchanged from the previous forecast. 
The depression still may briefly strengthen into a very short-lived 
tropical storm, but most of the guidance keep the system as a 
depression. As the system moves northward it will encounter an 
environment of dry air and increased shear. The depression is 
forecast to become a post-tropical remnant low in about day or so.

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  39
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
500 AM AST Wed Aug 30 2023
 
Franklin has a large eye this morning since completing its eyewall
replacement cycle yesterday. The estimated diameter from satellite
data is about 50 n mi. With that said, there are some subtle signs
that vertical wind shear over the system has begun to increase.  The
hurricane's outflow has become restricted in the western side of the
storm, related to the outflow of Idalia spreading quickly towards
it. Intensity estimates have been gradually decreasing, and the
initial intensity was lowered to 95 kt this advisory. This intensity
lies roughly in between the higher TAFB and lower SAB subjective
estimates, and is very close to the most recent ADT and D-MINT
estimates provided by UW-CIMSS.
 
Franklin appears to be accelerating ever so slightly to the
northeast, with the motion of its large eye estimated at 040/11 kt.
This motion is expected to continue today with a turn to the
east-northeast in about 24-36 h. However, once again the guidance
this cycle has trended much slower compared to the previous
one. The ECMWF, which had been on the slow and south end of the
guidance envelope for days now, related to it missing the
mid-latitude trough capture, is no longer alone, with the latest GFS
forecast substantially slower and also missing an initial trough
capture. The track forecast has thus been slowed down again from the
prior cycle, but since most of this track adjustment was in the
along- and not across-track direction, it actually lies pretty much
on top of the prior NHC track, just slower. This current forecast
may need to be adjusted further in subsequent cycles, as suggested
by the TVCA and HCCA consensus aids. Even though the center of
Franklin is still forecast to pass to the northwest of Bermuda later
today, the large area of tropical-storm-force winds associated with
the hurricane to its southeast are expected to extend near or over
the island, where a tropical storm warning remains in place.
 
Intensity-wise, Franklin should gradually weaken early on, while
shear remains fairly low, but then more quickly as northwesterly
shear increases to between 20-30 kt from 24-48 h. Based on the
latest forecast track, it may take a bit longer for Franklin to
become an extratropical cyclone, and this is now delayed to day 4 in
the latest NHC intensity forecast. This intensity forecast is in
best agreement with the HCCA consensus aid.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda this morning,
when Franklin is forecast to make its closest approach to the
island.
 
2. Life-threatening surf and rip currents are occurring along the
east coast of the United States. These conditions are expected to
continue during the next several days.

moving near or along the coasts of Georgia, South Carolina, and 
North Carolina late today and Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are estimated near 120 mph (195 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Idalia is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Although Idalia will weaken 
further now that the center is inland, it is likely to still be a 
hurricane while moving across southern Georgia, and near the coast 
of Georgia or southern South Carolina late today. Idalia is forecast 
to be a tropical storm while moving near the coasts of northeastern 
South Carolina and North Carolina tonight and on Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175
miles (280 km).
 
The minimum central pressure is 950 mb (28.05 inches) based on 
aircraft data.

Water levels along the coast of the Florida Big Bend continue to 
rise rapidly.  A NOAA National Ocean Service tide gauge at Cedar 
Key, Florida, recently reported a water level of 6.2 feet above 
mean higher high water, which is an approximation of inundation in 
that area. 
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Wakulla/Jefferson County, FL to Yankeetown, FL...12-16 ft
Ochlockonee River, FL to Wakulla/Jefferson County, FL...8-12 ft
Yankeetown, FL to Chassahowitzka, FL...7-11 ft
Chassahowitzka, FL to Anclote River, FL...6-9 ft
Carrabelle, FL to Ochlockonee River, FL...5-8 ft
Anclote River, FL to Middle of Longboat Key, FL...4-6 ft
Tampa Bay...4-6 ft
Indian Pass, FL to Carrabelle, FL...3-5 ft
Middle of Longboat Key, FL to Englewood, FL...3-5 ft
Saint Catherines Sound, GA to South Santee River, SC...3-5 ft
Englewood, FL to Bonita Beach, FL...2-4 ft
Beaufort Inlet, NC to Ocracoke Inlet, NC...2-4 ft
Mouth of the St. Mary's River to Saint Catherines Sound, GA...2-4 ft
Charlotte Harbor...2-4 ft
Neuse and Bay Rivers...2-4 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...2-4 ft
Flagler/Volusia County Line, FL to Mouth of the St. Mary's
River...1-3 ft
Mexico Beach, FL to Indian Pass, FL...1-3 ft
Bonita Beach, FL to East Cape Sable, FL...1-3 ft
South Santee River, SC to Beaufort Inlet, NC...1-3 ft
Ocracoke Inlet, NC to Duck, NC...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the center, where the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are occurring within the hurricane
warning area in Florida and will spread into southern Georgia later 
today.  Tropical storm conditions will continue through today within 
the tropical storm warning area along the Florida Gulf and west 
coasts.
 
Hurricane conditions are expected in the Hurricane Warning area
along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina later today and
tonight, and possible within the Hurricane Watch area.
 
Tropical storm conditions are beginning within the tropical storm 
warning area along the northeastern coast of Florida and will spread 
into Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina through the day and 
into Thursday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce a swath of 4 to 8 inches of
rainfall with isolated maxima up to 12 inches from the Florida Big
Bend through central Georgia and South Carolina, and through eastern
North Carolina into Thursday. These rainfall amounts will lead to
areas of flash, urban, and moderate river flooding, with
considerable impacts.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia are affecting the eastern and 
central Gulf coast from Florida to Louisiana, and will increase 
along the southeastern U.S. coast today.  These swells are likely to 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible this morning across
west-central and northern Florida into southeast Georgia, with the
tornado risk shifting toward the coastal Carolinas this afternoon
and tonight.

<title>Hurricane Idalia Forecast Discussion Number 15</title>

Hurricane Idalia Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
500 AM EDT Wed Aug 30 2023
 
Idalia continues to undergo rapid intensification.  Maximum
flight-level winds were 123 kt, with believable SFMR values of 115
kt.  Satellite images show a small eye surrounded by very cold
clouds tops, especially in the western quadrant.  The initial wind
speed is set to 115 kt, making Idalia an extremely dangerous
category 4 hurricane.
 
The hurricane still has a few hours left to intensify before it
makes landfall. The biggest change to the intensity forecast is to
increase the wind speeds over southeastern Georgia and South
Carolina as the rapid motion and track close to the coast is
expected to keep the system near hurricane strength for longer.
Thus a Hurricane Warning has been issued for a portion of those
coasts, and the Hurricane Watch is extended northeastward.  After
the hurricane moves offshore, the wind field on the northwestern
side near eastern North Carolina is expected to be enhanced by a
cold front, and the Tropical Storm Watch has been upgraded to a
Tropical Storm Warning in that area.  The long-range intensity
forecast is quite uncertain with Idalia taking on some hybrid
characteristics due to a baroclinc trough. No changes were made at
this time, and the forecast remains close to the consensus.
 
Idalia is moving faster toward the north-northeast or 025/16 kt.
After landfall, Idalia is expected to move near or along the coast
of Georgia and the Carolinas in 24-36 hours.  Uncertainty in the
track forecast beyond 48 hours remains quite large, and the latest
guidance is significantly faster.  The new forecast is adjusted
toward the consensus, but could be too slow at long range.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Catastrophic impacts from storm surge inundation of 12 to 16 feet
above ground level and destructive waves are expected somewhere
between the Wakulla/Jefferson County line and Yankeetown, Florida.
Life-threatening storm surge inundation is likely elsewhere along
portions of the Florida Gulf Coast where a Storm Surge Warning is in
effect. Residents in these areas should follow any advice given by
local officials.
 
2. Destructive life-threatening winds will occur where the core of
Idalia moves onshore in the Big Bend region of Florida, with
hurricane conditions expected elsewhere in portions of the Hurricane
Warning area along the Florida Gulf Coast. Strong winds will also
spread inland across portions of northern Florida and southern
Georgia near the track of the center of Idalia where Hurricane
Warnings are in effect. Residents in these areas should be prepared
for long-duration power outages. Damaging hurricane-force winds are
likely in portions of eastern Georgia and southeastern South
Carolina where Hurricane Warnings are now in effect.
 
3. Areas of flash, urban, and moderate river flooding, with
considerable impacts, are expected from the Florida Big Ben through,
central Georgia and South Carolina, through eastern North Carolina
into Thursday.
