Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Thu Aug 31 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Franklin, located a few hundred miles northeast of Bermuda, on <br/>
Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia, located off the coast of North <br/>
Carolina, and on Tropical Storm Jose, located several hundred miles <br/>
east of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to show signs of organization in <br/>
association with an elongated area of low pressure located just <br/>
west of the Cabo Verde Islands. A short-lived tropical depression <br/>
or tropical storm is expected to form later tonight or on Friday <br/>
while the system moves northwestward at 10 to 15 mph across the <br/>
eastern tropical Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central Subtropical Atlantic (Remnants of Gert):<br/>
A small area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
north-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands is producing small <br/>
bursts of showers and thunderstorms to the south of its center. This <br/>
system has a short window to become a tropical depression during the <br/>
next day or so while it drifts northeastward or eastward, before <br/>
upper-level winds become increasingly unfavorable by the weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa <br/>
this weekend.  Environmental conditions could support some gradual <br/>
development of this system through the middle part of next week <br/>
while it moves westward to west-northwestward over the eastern and <br/>
central portions of the tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Jose Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112023
1100 PM AST Thu Aug 31 2023
 
Jose is a tiny tropical cyclone with the convective cloud tops only
extending 50 to 60 n mi across.  However, geostationary satellite
and microwave images indicate that the storm has a tight
circulation with evidence of a mid-level eye feature. A recent
ASCAT pass showed peak winds in the 40-45 kt range, but since the
system is so small that instrument likely can not resolve the peak
winds.  The initial intensity is increased to 50 kt, which is above
the Dvorak estimates.
 
Jose is likely near its peak intensity.  There is no way Jose will 
escape the outflow associated with Hurricane Franklin, that is 
expected to begin affecting the small storm by midday Friday.  
Therefore, the forecast shows a steady weakening trend until it 
becomes absorbed by Franklin in about 36 hours.

The storm is moving northward at 11 kt and is moving in the flow 
between Franklin and a mid-level ridge over the central Atlantic.  A 
faster motion to the north is expected until the system dissipates 
on Saturday.  The NHC track forecast is slightly to the west of the 
previous one.

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  46
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082023
1100 PM AST Thu Aug 31 2023
 
Convection is separating from the low-level circulation of Franklin
this evening.  Infrared satellite imagery show the coldest cloud
tops limited to the southeast quadrant, confirming the cyclone is
experiencing significant vertical wind shear.  Subjective and
objective satellite intensity estimates have continued to decrease
and range from 70-77 kt.  The initial intensity has been lowered to
75 kt for this advisory.
 
Franklin is forecast to complete its extratropical transition during
the next day or so.  However, global models indicate it will remain
a powerful system despite losing its tropical characteristics.
Therefore, the official intensity forecast shows Franklin gradually
weakening before becoming a hurricane-force extratropical cyclone.
A faster weakening trend is predicted later in the forecast period,
similar to the previous prediction and lies on the higher end of
the guidance envelope.
 
The hurricane is moving to the east-northeast at 13 kt. The track 
reasoning remains unchanged.  An acceleration generally 
northeastward is expected during the next couple of days as the 
hurricane is steered by the flow between a subtropical ridge over 
the central Atlantic and a deep-layer trough over the coast of 
Atlantic Canada.  The track guidance is in good agreement and little 
changes have been made to the official forecast.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone 
Idalia was located near latitude 33.1 North, longitude 71.5 West. 
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east near 23 mph (37 
km/h).  A turn toward the east-southeast and east is expected on 
Friday and Saturday, accompanied by a considerable decrease in 
forward speed.  On the forecast track, the center of Idalia will 
continue moving away from the coast of North Carolina and approach 
Bermuda over the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast through early Saturday.
Restrengthening is possible over the weekend, and Idalia is expected
to transition back to a tropical storm on Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  Water levels are expected to recede overnight and 
into early Friday.  For information specific to your area, please 
see products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast 
office.
 
WIND:  Gusts to tropical storm force are expected to continue along
the coast of North Carolina through early Friday.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda by Saturday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 4 to 6 
inches, or 100 to 150 millimeters, across Bermuda through Sunday 
night. The heavy rainfall may cause areas of flash and urban 
flooding on the island.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia will affect the southeastern U.S.
coast during the next couple of days and will reach Bermuda on
Friday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 AM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 500 AM EDT.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
500 PM EDT Thu Aug 31 2023
 
Idalia has become post-tropical.  The center has become less 
defined, and the system is attached to a well-defined frontal 
boundary that extends to the north and northeast of the center.  In 
addition, the cyclone is no longer producing deep convection.  
Earlier ASCAT and Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft showed 
that a band of 50-55 kt winds has developed to the northwest of the 
center near the front, and the initial intensity is therefore set 
at 55 kt.
 
The initial motion is eastward, or 090/18 kt.  Idalia is embedded 
within the base of a deep-layer trough moving across the 
northeastern U.S. and Atlantic Canada, but this trough is expected 
to leave Idalia behind in the next 24-48 hours.  As a result, 
Idalia is forecast to turn east-southeastward and slow down 
considerably (less than 5 kt) when it approaches Bermuda by 48 
hours.  A second trough that moves off the U.S. east coast on 
Sunday should turn Idalia toward the northeast and north at a 
faster forward speed on days 4 and 5.  The updated NHC track 
forecast is a little south and east of the previous forecast beyond 
day 2, leaning toward the model consensus aids.  HCCA, in 
particular, is on the eastern side of the guidance envelope, which 
may suggest that additional eastward adjustment might be needed in 
subsequent advisories.

Idalia is expected to remain a convection-less extratropical 
cyclone for the next day or two, particularly since it is expected 
to move over the cold wake of Hurricane Franklin.  Its intensity is 
also likely to gradually weaken during that time.  However, the 
cyclone is forecast to reach warm sea surface temperatures again by 
Saturday, and global model fields show the thickness gradient 
weakening.  In addition, the GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite show 
deep convection redeveloping by Saturday or Saturday night.  
Therefore, Idalia is expected to transition back to a tropical storm 
in 48 hours, with some restrengthening possible.  Global model 
fields show a possible occlusion occurring around day 5, and the 
NHC forecast therefore shows Idalia again becoming extratropical by 
the end of the forecast period.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are possible in Bermuda by Saturday.  
Heavy rainfall will likely lead to areas of flash and urban 
flooding on the island.
 
2. Water levels are expected to subside and winds are expected to 
diminish along the coast of North Carolina through tonight.
