Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Fri Jul 14 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Central Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
Satellite data indicate that the area of low pressure located about <br/>
1000 miles west-southwest of the Azores is producing a large area of <br/>
gale-force winds on its east side.  In addition, the thunderstorm <br/>
activity has remained organized near the center during the past <br/>
several hours.  If current trends continue, advisories could be <br/>
initiated on a subtropical storm later this morning while it <br/>
meanders over the central Atlantic.  By the weekend, the low should <br/>
turn northward, bringing the system over cooler waters and into a <br/>
drier airmass potentially limiting further development.  Additional <br/>
information on this system, including storm warnings, can be found <br/>
in High Seas Forecasts, issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>

High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service<br/>
can be found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 <br/>

Subtropical Storm Don Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052023
500 AM AST Fri Jul 14 2023

The area of low pressure that NHC has been monitoring roughly midway 
between Bermuda and the Azores has become Subtropical Storm Don.  
The storm is assessed as subtropical because it is embedded within 
an upper-level trough and has a relatively large radius of maximum 
wind.  Several hours ago, a well-defined center of circulation 
developed and deep convection has remained sufficiently organized, 
especially in bands to the east of the center.  A pair of partial 
ASCAT passes from around 00Z showed peak winds around 45 kt, and 
that is the initial intensity set for this advisory.

Don has been moving slowly northward at about 5 kt during the past 6 
to 12 hours, and a continued slow northward or north-northwestward 
motion is expected during the next couple of days as a building 
ridge over the central Atlantic prevents it from accelerating 
poleward.  That ridge is expected to weaken on Sunday while another 
ridge builds to the southeast of Don and a trough amplifies over the 
northeastern Atlantic.  This pattern change should cause Don to turn 
eastward on Sunday and then southeastward early next week.  The NHC 
track forecast lies near the middle of the guidance envelope, in 
best agreement with the various consensus aids.

The storm is likely near its peak intensity already.  Dry air is 
wrapping in on the south and west sides of the circulation and that 
stable air is expected to continue to entrain into the storm during 
the next several days.  In addition, sea surface temperatures are 
expected to decrease along the forecast track during the next 2 or 
3 days.  Although the environment is not conducive for 
strengthening, it is also not hostile enough to cause significant 
weakening.  Therefore, the NHC official forecast shows a gradual 
decay in Don’s strength.  The environment looks more conducive by 
the end of the period, and some strengthening is possible by then 
if the storm survives that long.  The NHC intensity forecast 
follows the theme of the models, which are tightly clustered.
