Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Thu Jul 20 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Don, located over the central Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located a few hundred miles southwest of the Cabo <br/>
Verde Islands is currently interacting with the Intertropical <br/>
Convergence Zone. The combination of these features is producing an <br/>
elongated area of showers and thunderstorms over the eastern <br/>
and central tropical Atlantic. While dry air to the north may <br/>
prevent significant organization during the next couple of days, <br/>
environmental conditions could become more conducive for some <br/>
development this weekend as the system moves westward across <br/>
the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Don Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052023
900 AM GMT Thu Jul 20 2023

Deep convection associated with Don has become a little better 
organized since the last advisory, with a curved convective band 
currently developing near and to the north of the center.  However, 
the various subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates 
have not changed significantly, and thus the initial intensity 
remains 45 kt.

Conditions appear favorable for some strengthening during the next 
18-24 h, and the intensity forecast follows the previous forecast 
in bringing the winds up to 50 kt during this time.  After 24 h, 
the cyclone will be moving over cooler sea surface temperatures, 
and after 72 h the cyclone should move north of the Gulf Stream 
into an area where the water temperatures are below 20C.  Based on 
this and forecast dry air entrainment, the new intensity forecast 
follows the previous forecast in showing Don starting to weaken 
around 48 h, then it shows a faster rate of weakening after 72 h.  
The cyclone is forecast to degenerate to a post-tropical low with 
no convection by 96 h.

The initial motion is now 285/6 kt.  A low to mid-level ridge is 
forecast to build north and east of Don during the next 72 h, which 
should steer the cyclone west-northwestward, northwestward, and 
eventually northward during the next 72 h.  The guidance has 
shifted a little more westward after 48 h, and thus the 60 and 72 h 
forecast are a bit to the west of the previous track,  However these 
points lie to the east of the various consensus models, and some 
additional adjustments may be needed on subsequent advisories.  
After 72 h, Don is forecast to recurve northeastward along the 
southern edge of the mid-latitude westerlies.
