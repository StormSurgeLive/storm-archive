Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
Cloudiness and showers over the eastern tropical Atlantic centered <br/>

organization during the next few days, environmental conditions <br/>
could become more conducive for some development by this weekend <br/>
while the wave moves westward across the central tropical Atlantic <br/>
at 15 to 20 mph.<br/>

Tropical Storm Don Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052023
900 AM GMT Wed Jul 19 2023

Convection associated with Don remains disorganized this morning, 
primarily occurring in a group of short bands in the eastern 
semicircle.  Satellite intensity estimates have not changed much 
since the last advisory, and the initial intensity is held at 35 kt 
in best agreement with the CIMSS satellite consensus.

As Don turns more westward during the next couple of days, it 
should move over warmer sea surface temperatures into a somewhat 
more moist air mass.  This should allow some gradual strengthening, 
and the new intensity forecast follows the previous forecast in 
calling for a 45 kt intensity by 48 h.  It should be noted that 
several of the dynamical models forecast Don to get stronger than 
that, possibly due to them expecting Don to move west of the 
current forecast track into even warmer sea surface temperatures.  
After Don turns northward later in the forecast period, it should 
move north of the Gulf Stream and degenerate to a post-tropical low 
over cold water between 96-120 h.

The initial motion is now 185/4 kt.  Don should turn southwestward 
and westward during the next 24-36 h as the subtropical ridge 
builds to the northwest and north of the cyclone.  This ridge 
should then move eastward, leaving the cyclone in a area of 
southeasterly to southerly flow on its west side.  This should 
allow Don to turn northward by about 72 h and then subsequently 
recurve into the westerlies.  The new forecast track is essentially 
an update of the previous forecast.
