<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Don, located over the north-central Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
East of the Windward Islands (AL95):<br/>
A weak area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave <br/>
continues to produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms about <br/>
650 miles east of the Windward Islands.  While this system has not <br/>
become any better organized recently, some slow development remains <br/>
possible during the next couple of days while it moves westward <br/>
across the tropical Atlantic and eastern Caribbean Sea.  <br/>
Environmental conditions are expected to become unfavorable for <br/>
development by the middle of the week. Locally heavy rainfall is <br/>
possible across the Windward Islands early this week from this <br/>
system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Don Discussion Number  40
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052023
300 AM GMT Mon Jul 24 2023

Don continues to slowly weaken and has lost just about all of its 
deep convection due to very cool waters.  An ASCAT-B pass around 
00Z showed peak winds of about 40 kt, and because the instrument 
can't always resolve the maximum winds in the storm, the initial 
intensity is set to 45 kt.  Don is well on its way to become a 
post-tropical cyclone and it will likely complete the process later 
today.

The storm is moving northeastward at 17 kt in the flow on the 
northwest side of a subtropical ridge.  A turn to the east-northeast 
and then the east are expected later today and tonight while the 
storm moves in generally zonal flow on the north side of the ridge. 
Little change was made to the previous NHC track forecast.  Don is 
expected to continue to weaken due to cool waters and dry air 
entrainment until it dissipates early Tuesday.
 
Don has been a very long-lasting tropical cyclone (including 
subtropical stages) for the month of July.  Preliminary,
up to this point the storm is tied for the 6th longest-lasting 
system on record for the month.
