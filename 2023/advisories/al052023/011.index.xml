DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Subtropical Depression Don
was located near latitude 39.3 North, longitude 47.0 West. The
depression is moving toward the east near 9 mph (15 km/h). Don 
should turn southeastward on Monday, southward on Tuesday, and 
southwestward on Wednesday over the central Atlantic.

<title>Subtropical Depression Don Forecast Discussion Number 10</title>

Subtropical Depression Don Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052023
1100 AM AST Sun Jul 16 2023
 
Satellite images indicate that Don is producing a small area of
convection in the southeastern quadrant, though it is stretch to
call it very organized.  Overall, the system is mostly a big swirl
of low- to mid-level clouds with occasional bursts of modest
convection.  A 1250 UTC ASCAT-B scatterometer pass showed maximum 
winds of about 30 kt, so that will be the initial wind speed. 
 
Don has turned to the east-northeast this morning, and should
gradually execute a large clockwise loop over the central Atlantic
during the next few days, turning southeast, south and southwest. 
Model guidance is in good agreement on this course through midweek, 
and little change was made to the previous forecast.  The long 
range forecast is more uncertain, however, with Don potentially 
becoming trapped in an area of lighter steering currents before 
moving more northward, rather than westward in the loop.  The model 
spread is enormous by day 5, with about 1000 n mi of distance 
between some of the ECMWF ensemble members.  The new forecast is 
trended westward toward the multi-model ensemble mean, with a 
majority suggesting a northwest track at the end of the forecast 
period, but that's far from certain.
 
The environment near Don is expected to be pretty hostile for the 
next few days, with any cold air aloft promoting convection being 
neutralized by cool waters, dry air surrounding the cyclone, and 
some shear.  This should result in little intensity change during 
the next few days, and Don could also degenerate into a remnant low, 
especially tomorrow when conditions could be the most harsh.  At 
long range, Don might have a chance to re-strengthen since it moves 
over warmer waters with more instability, but Don could also be too 
weak to take advantage of these factors.  Considering the large 
track uncertainty, the new forecast is the same as the previous one 
at long range, below the model guidance.
