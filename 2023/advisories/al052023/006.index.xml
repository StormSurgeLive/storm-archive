<title>Subtropical Storm Don Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Subtropical Storm Don Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052023
1100 AM AST Sat Jul 15 2023

While the low-level circulation of Don remains robust, any 
associated convection is weaker than overnight and farther from the 
center.  Satellite intensity estimates haven't changed much, so the 
initial wind speed will stay at 40 kt, though this feels a little 
generous.  Unfortunately, the morning scatterometer passes missed 
the center.

Don has wobbled northwestward overnight, at about 8 kt.  The storm 
should turn northward later today and then eastward by late tomorrow 
while it moves around the periphery of a strong subtropical ridge. 
The biggest change to the forecast of Don is that the track guidance 
has shifted northward in the first few days of the forecast period.  
The NHC forecast is shifted in that direction, with little change in 
the longer range as Don moves southward around the east side of the 
strong ridge.

The storm should remain in a marginal environment during the next 
few days with cool SSTs and dry air lurking, causing the system to 
keep about the same strength or gradually decay.  With the northward 
forecast change, taking Don across cooler waters, it is possible 
that Don could weaken into a depression or a remnant low in a 
couple of days.  Some re-intensification is possible at long 
range when Don moves over warmer waters, though the uncertainty is 
high.  No big changes were made to the previous forecast, but it 
wouldn't be surprising if downward adjustments were necessary in 
the afternoon forecast package.
