<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Don, located over the north-central Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
East of the Windward Islands (AL95):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave is <br/>
located several hundred miles east of the Windward Islands.  While <br/>
this system has not become significantly better organized since <br/>
yesterday, some slow development remains possible during the next <br/>
couple of days while it moves westward across the tropical Atlantic <br/>
and into the eastern Caribbean Sea.  Regardless of development, <br/>
locally heavy rains and strong gusty winds are possible across <br/>
portions of the Lesser Antilles during the next day or two.  <br/>
Environmental conditions are expected to become unfavorable for <br/>
development of this system by the middle of the week. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Post-Tropical Cyclone Don Discussion Number  42
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052023
300 PM GMT Mon Jul 24 2023
 
Satellite imagery shows that Don lacks sufficient deep convection to 
classify the system as a tropical cyclone, and it is now post 
tropical.  The initial wind speed remains at 40 kt for this 
advisory, based on a recent ASCAT-B scatterometer pass.  Don should 
slowly weaken over the next day or so while moving over cold waters 
and within high vertical wind shear.

The system is moving east-northeastward at about 17 kt, and this
general motion will likely to continue until Don dissipates in
about a day.  Most of the global guidance has post-tropical Don
opening up into a trough and becoming absorbed by a larger
extratropical low over the north Atlantic tomorrow. Very few changes
were made to the previous NHC forecast.
 
Don has been a very long-lasting tropical cyclone (including
subtropical stages) for the month of July.  Preliminary data
indicate that the storm is the 5th longest-lasting system on record
for the month, just behind Emily of 2005.
 
This is the last advisory on Don.  Additional information on this
system can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National
Weather Service...under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1 and WMO header
FZNT01 KWBC, and online at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSDAT1.php
