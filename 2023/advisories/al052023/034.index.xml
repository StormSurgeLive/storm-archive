<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Don, located over the central Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL95):<br/>
Shower activity associated with a small area of low pressure located <br/>
roughly midway between the Cabo Verde Islands and the Lesser <br/>
Antilles continues to show signs of organization. Although <br/>
environmental conditions are only marginally conducive, some <br/>
additional gradual development is anticipated and this system will <br/>
likely become a tropical depression by early next week while it <br/>
moves westward across the tropical Atlantic.  Interests in the <br/>
Lesser Antilles should monitor the progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Don Discussion Number  34
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052023
1100 AM AST Sat Jul 22 2023
 
Don's convective structure has increased in organization this
morning. A curved band has wrapped completely around the center
with a ragged eye-like feature becoming apparent during the past
couple of hours.  Earlier microwave imagery also revealed this
feature, but the convection surrounding it was fragmented.
Subjective satellite estimates from SAB and TAFB were T3.5 (55 kt)
and T3.0 (45 kt) at 1200 UTC, but given the more recent increase in
organization, the initial intensity is raised to the higher end
of those estimates at 55 kt.
 
Don has made its anticipated northward turn.  A northward motion
with some increase in forward speed is expected today as the
cyclone is steered around the western periphery of a mid-level
ridge.  After that time, Don should turn north-northeastward and
then northeastward within the mid-latitude westerlies.  The
dynamical model guidance remains tightly clustered, and the new NHC
track is essentially an update of the previous advisory.
 
Don is currently crossing the Gulf Stream with SSTs of around 26C.
Although it is not explicitly shown below, it is possible that some
slight additional strengthening occurs within the next 6-12 hours
while Don is over the slightly warmer Gulf Stream waters.  After
that time, a sharp decrease in SSTs along the track of Don and
increasing vertical wind shear should cause weakening.  Don is
expected to become post-tropical around the 36 hour time period
and dissipate by 72 hours.
