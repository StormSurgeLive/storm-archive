Subtropical Depression Don Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052023
900 AM GMT Mon Jul 17 2023
 
Don continues to produce an area of deep convection on its east side 
and has generally changed little during the past several hours.  
Satellite imagery suggest that the circulation of Don has become 
elongated from east to west and confidence is low on its center 
position.  Since the system has not changed much, the initial 
intensity remains 30 kt based on continuity.  This estimate is a 
little below the latest satellite intensity guidance.

The depression is moving eastward at about 8 kt on the north side of 
a subtropical ridge.  A turn to the southeast is expected later 
today followed by a turn to the south tonight and Tuesday as the 
system moves in the flow between the ridge and an amplifying trough 
over the northeastern Atlantic.  Don is expected to stall during the 
middle of the week when the steering currents weaken, but a motion 
to the northwest is expected later in the week when the system moves 
on the south side of the ridge.  Regardless, Don is not expected to 
move much during the next several days.  This forecast is fairly 
similar to the previous one and near the various consensus aids.

Don could gradually gain strength during the next few days while it 
moves over slightly warmer waters and remains in low to moderate 
wind shear conditions.  The models also show the wind field 
contracting, suggesting that Don could transition to a tropical 
cyclone in the next day or two.  The environment is expected to 
remain marginally conducive late in the week, which should allow to 
Don to maintain its strength.  The NHC intensity forecast is the 
same as the previous one and below the model consensus.
