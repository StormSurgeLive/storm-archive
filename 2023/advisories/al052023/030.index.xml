<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Don, located over the central Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (95L):<br/>
A small area of low pressure, located several hundred miles <br/>
west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands, is producing an area of <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic. Environmental conditions appear generally conducive for <br/>
some gradual development of this system, and a tropical depression <br/>
could form in the next several days, as it moves westward across <br/>
the tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Don Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052023
1100 AM AST Fri Jul 21 2023
 
Shortly after the release of the previous advisory convection 
nearly wrapped completely around the center of Don.  Since the 
time, the convection has become somewhat more fragmented, but there 
is still a well-defined curved band that wraps about three-quarters 
of the way around Don's center.  Subjective Dvorak T-numbers from 
SAB and TAFB are a unanimous T3.0 or 45 kt, so the initial 
intensity remains 45 kt for this advisory.  A recently arriving 
scatterometer overpass missed the core of the cyclone so there is 
no information on the system's strength from that data source 
this morning. 

The initial motion estimate is still west-northwestward or 300 
degrees at 9 kt.  A low- to mid-level ridge to the north-northeast 
of the cyclone is forecast to shift eastward during the next 24 to 
36 hours causing Don to turn northwestward, and then northward 
during the next day or two.  After that time, Don is expected to 
turn northeastward within low- to mid-level southwesterly flow 
between the ridge and a broad trough over eastern Canada and the 
northeastern United States.  The dynamical models are tightly 
clustered and little overall change was made to the previous NHC 
track forecast. 

Don remains over marginally warm sea surface temperatures and 
within a relatively dry mid-level environment so little overall 
change in strength is predicted during the next 12 to 24 hours.  
The system is forecast to pass over the slightly warm waters of 
the Gulf stream on Saturday, but this is not likely to result in a 
significant change in strength.  By Sunday morning, Don will have 
moved north of the Gulf stream and over much colder SSTs.  This 
should result in weakening and the system's transition into a 
post-tropical cyclone.  Dissipation is predicted by the global 
models in a little more than 3 days, and the official forecast 
follows suit.
