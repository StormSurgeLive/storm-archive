SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...33.7N 47.3W
ABOUT 1170 MI...1885 KM W OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 340 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1004 MB...29.65 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Subtropical Storm Don was
located near latitude 33.7 North, longitude 47.3 West.  Don is
moving toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h), and that
general motion should continue through tonight.  A turn toward the
north is expected Saturday, followed by a turn toward the east by
Sunday or Monday.
 
Recent satellite-derived wind data indicate that maximum sustained 
winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.  
Additional gradual weakening is expected during the next few days, 
and Don could possibly become a post-tropical cyclone or remnant 
low at any time.
 
Winds of 40 mph extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km) from the
center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Subtropical Storm Don Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052023
1100 AM AST Fri Jul 14 2023
 
Don's deep convection has been waning in intensity since the
overnight hours, with most of the activity located in broken bands
to the north and east of the center of circulation.  The cyclone
remains subtropical, given that it is embedded within a deep-layer
trough and has a relatively large radius of maximum winds.  A 
just-received ASCAT pass over Don shows a swath of 35-40 kt winds 
to the east of the center, so the initial intensity is therefore 
lowered to 40 kt.
 
Don's recent motion has been north-northwestward, or 340/6 kt, with
the cyclone surrounded by a pair of strong mid-level ridges to its
east and north, and a broad trough over the western Atlantic.  The
ridge to the east will be the main steering influence, and that
feature is expected to migrate westward across the Atlantic during
the next several days.  Don is forecast to move slowly around the
northern side of the ridge, turning northward, eastward, and then
southeastward over the next 5 days.  In spite of the somewhat
complicated mid-latitude pattern, the track models are in fairly
good agreement for much of the forecast period.  The new NHC track
forecast is nudged northward during the 2- to 4-day part of the
forecast toward the consensus aids but otherwise is very similar to
the forecast from earlier this morning.
 
Subsiding dry air on the back side of the trough is getting
entrained into Don's circulation, and the storm is over waters of
25-26 degrees Celsius, heading towards waters as cold as 23 degrees
in about 3 days.  Although the trough may be able to continue to
supply some baroclinic energy to Don, the cyclone's maximum winds
are likely to gradually diminish over the next few days given the
less favorable thermodynamic environment.  There is a chance that
Don could lose enough convective organization and become a
post-tropical cyclone at some point during the next few days.
However, by days 4 and 5, Don will be heading back southward toward
relatively warmer waters, and a new mid-latitude shortwave trough
may provide a boost to the system's organization and strength.  As a
result, the NHC intensity forecast shows possible restrengthening at
the end of the forecast period.
