Hurricane Don Discussion Number  35
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052023
500 PM AST Sat Jul 22 2023
 
Don's cloud pattern continued to become better organized after the 
release of the previous advisory with convection wrapping around an 
eye in infrared imagery.  Since that time, the cloud tops over the 
western semicircle have warmed somewhat, but a 1648 UTC AMSR2 
microwave pass showed a well-defined low- to mid-level eye with deep 
convection surrounding it.  Subjective Dvorak estimates at 1800 UTC 
ranged from T4.0 (65 kt) from TAFB and T3.5 (55 kt) from SAB, with 
objective estimates in the 60 to 63 kt range.  Since subjective 
estimates have yielded a T4.0 throughout much of the afternoon, the 
initial intensity has been raised to 65 kt, making Don a hurricane.

Today's strengthening was the result of the storm passing over the 
warmer waters of the Gulf Stream, however it will move north of 
those warmer waters later this evening, and Don has likely peaked in 
intensity.  Weakening should begin overnight, with a faster rate of 
weakening expected Sunday through Monday as Don moves over even 
colder waters and the vertical wind shear increases. The cyclone is 
expected to become post-tropical by Sunday night, and dissipate by 
Monday night or early Tuesday.
 
Don is moving northward or 005 degrees at 10 kt. The cyclone is 
forecast to turn northeastward late tonight as it becomes embedded 
within southwesterly flow between a ridge to its east and a broad 
trough over eastern Canada.  A northeastward to east-northeastward 
motion should then continue until the system dissipates in 2-3 days. 
The track guidance is again tightly clustered and no significant 
changes to the previous official forecast were required.
