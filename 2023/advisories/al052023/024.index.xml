<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Don, located over the central Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located a few hundred miles south of the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands is currently interacting with the Intertropical Convergence <br/>
Zone. The combination of these features is producing a broad area of <br/>
showers and thunderstorms over the eastern and central tropical <br/>
Atlantic. While dry air to the north may prevent significant <br/>
organization during the next few days, environmental conditions <br/>
could become more conducive for some development by this weekend as <br/>
the wave moves westward across the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Don Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052023
900 PM GMT Wed Jul 19 2023

Don has continued to become better organized during the day, with a 
deep convective band now curving more than halfway around the 
center, and an expanding outflow pattern especially southeast of 
the storm.  While the western side of the circulation still has a 
lot of dry air lurking, it seems like the lack of shear is allowing 
the core of the cyclone to develop.  Dvorak estimates have 
increased, and a blend of the latest data gives an initial wind 
speed of 40 kt.  Scatterometer has missed the core for about the 
past day, so hopefully tonight's passes will validate the improving 
satellite presentation.

Further intensification is likely for the next day or so while Don 
moves over a local maximum in sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) with 
light shear.  Thereafter, the environment becomes less conducive 
with cooling SSTs, drier environmental air, and perhaps an increase 
in shear.  The forecast is kept steady through the end of the work 
week, then some weakening while Don crosses its own cool wake.  The 
NHC wind speed prediction is bumped up from the last one, consistent 
with the latest model consensus, and most of the guidance is in 
pretty good agreement on this scenario.  The storm should lose all 
of its deep convection and become post-tropical late Sunday or on 
Monday after it crosses north of the Gulf Stream.

Don has turned westward, now moving a bit faster at 7 kt.  The 
system should turn west-northwestward tomorrow as it moves beneath a 
large blocking ridge over the north-central Atlantic, with no 
changes to the forecast in the short term.  However, there has been 
a pretty significant synoptic pattern shift in the models by Friday 
with the blocking ridge much slower to depart, resulting in Don 
moving more to the northwest and not accelerating as quickly 
northeastward.  The new forecast follows the guidance trend, but for 
continuity concerns, the forecast is still faster than most of the 
guidance, and further changes will likely be required on the next 
advisory.
