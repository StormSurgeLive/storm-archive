200 PM EDT Sun Sep 10 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Lee, located a few hundred miles north-northeast of the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands, and on Tropical Storm Margot, located over the <br/>
central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL97):<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity associated with a weak area of <br/>
low pressure, located a few hundred miles to the southwest of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands remains disorganized.  Environmental conditions <br/>
are forecast to become less conducive for development during the <br/>
next day or so as the disturbance moves slowly westward over the <br/>
eastern tropical Atlantic.  The system is forecast to merge with a <br/>
larger tropical wave to its east in a couple of days and no further <br/>
development is expected after that time. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent. <br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located over the far eastern tropical Atlantic just <br/>
west of the coast of Africa is producing disorganized cloudiness <br/>
and showers.  Environmental conditions appear conducive for some <br/>
gradual development of this system during the latter part of this <br/>
week as it moves westward to west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph <br/>
over the central tropical Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent. <br/>

SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...22.1N 61.7W
ABOUT 285 MI...455 KM NNE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...120 MPH...195 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...954 MB...28.17 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located 
near latitude 22.1 North, longitude 61.7 West. Lee is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A slower west-northwestward 
motion is expected during the next few days.  On the forecast track, 
Lee is expected to pass well north of the northern Leeward Islands, 
the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico during the next day or two.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that the maximum sustained winds have increased to near 120 mph (195 
km/h) with higher gusts.  Lee is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional strengthening 
is forecast during the next day or so.  Some fluctuations in 
intensity are possible on Monday and Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure reported by Air Force Reserve 
reconnaissance is 954 mb (28.17 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, and Bermuda.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Dangerous surf and rip currents have begun 
to reach portions of the southeast U.S. East Coast and are forecast 
to worsen and spread northward along much of the U.S. East Coast 
during the next couple of days. Please consult products from your 
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
1100 AM AST Sun Sep 10 2023
 
Earlier SSMIS and GMI microwave overpasses along with reports from 
a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that Lee has a larger 
banded-type eye as compared to yesterday.  The ragged eye has 
become apparent in visible and infrared satellite images within 
the past hour or so.  The NOAA aircraft has measured a peak 700-mb 
flight-level wind of 106 kt and SFMR winds of 95 kt, and the minimum 
pressure has been oscillating in the 956-958 mb range during the 
flight.  Based on these data, and the recent improvement in 
structure, the initial intensity has been raised to 95 kt. 

The vertical wind shear over Lee appears to have relaxed some since 
yesterday as there has been an expansion of the upper-level outflow 
over the southern and southwestern portions of the storm.  Most of 
the guidance suggests that the shear will decrease more over the 
next couple of days, allowing Lee to re-strengthen.  The expected 
slow motion of the hurricane could cause some upwelling, especially 
in the 2-3 day time period when Lee is forecast to be moving at only 
around 5 kt.  The NHC wind speed forecast calls for steady 
restrengthening during the next 24-48 hours, then shows some gradual 
weakening after that time due to the potential for upwelling. Later 
in the forecast period, increasing southwesterly shear is likely to 
cause additional weakening, however Lee is forecast to remain a 
strong hurricane through most of this week. 

Recent aircraft center fixes show that the hurricane is beginning 
to slow down.  The initial motion is now west-northwest or 300 
degrees at 7 kt. A high pressure ridge to the northwest of Lee is 
forecast to build southwestward during the next couple of days, 
further slowing Lee's progress.  By midweek, a mid-latitude trough 
moving into the northeastern United States is expected to weaken 
the western extent of the ridge, allowing Lee to turn northward. 
There is still significant uncertainty in the global model guidance 
regarding the forward speed of Lee later in the forecast period.  
The NHC track forecast continues to lie between the faster GFS and 
slower ECMWF, close to the various consensus models. 

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Lee's core is expected to pass well north of the northern
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico during the 
next couple of days.
 
2. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents are affecting
portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. 
Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos 
Islands, the Bahamas, and Bermuda. 
 
3. It remains too soon to know what level of impacts, if any, Lee
might have along the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic Canada, or Bermuda
late next week, especially since the hurricane is expected to slow
down considerably over the southwestern Atlantic.  Regardless,
dangerous surf and rip currents are expected along most of the U.S.
East Coast beginning later today and continuing through the week as 
Lee grows in size. Users should continue to monitor updates to the
forecast of Lee during the next several days.

Tropical Storm Margot Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
500 PM AST Sun Sep 10 2023
 
Margot has become better organized this afternoon. Visible and 
infrared satellite imagery indicate that the low-level center has 
tucked up under the deep convection. A recent SSMI/S microwave pass 
depicts that there is well-defined curved banding around the center. 
Deep convection continues to burst near the center. Subjective and 
objective Dvorak satellite estimates from TAFB and SAB are T/3.5 and 
T/3.0, respectively. Given the improved structure, this advisory 
will lean towards the higher end of these estimates and the initial 
intensity is raised to 55 kt. 
 
Margot is still within an environment of moderate southwesterly wind 
shear. The vertical wind shear is forecast to persist, but 
strengthening is forecast over the coming days as the system is 
entering a more favorable upper-level divergent wind pattern. Margot 
will continue to traverse warm sea surface temperatures throughout 
the forecast period, around 28 degrees Celsius.  The NHC forecast is 
slightly higher in the short term, with Margot forecast to become a 
hurricane on Monday. The NHC intensity forecast lies near the HCCA 
and IVCN consensus intensity aids.
 
Margot is moving northward at around 8 kt. A northward motion is 
expected to continue into a weakness in the central Atlantic 
subtropical ridge. In about 2 to 3 days, Margot's forward motion is 
forecast to slow down as the steering flow weakens. Towards the end 
of the forecast period, there remains considerably large 
cross-track model spread. The NHC track forecast lies between the 
consensus aids, with the system meandering over the central 
Atlantic.
