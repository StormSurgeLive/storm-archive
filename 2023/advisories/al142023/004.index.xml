SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.8N 53.5W
ABOUT 630 MI...1015 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...165 MPH...270 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...926 MB...27.35 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 17.8 North, longitude 53.5 West. Lee is moving toward
the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this motion is
expected to continue through early next week with a significant
decrease in forward speed.  On the forecast track, Lee is expected
to pass well to the north of the northern Leeward Islands, the
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico over the weekend and into early
next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds based on data from the Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft have increased to near 165 mph (270 
km/h) with higher gusts.  Lee is a category 5 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional strengthening is 
forecast today.  Fluctuations in intensity are likely over the next 
few days, but Lee is expected to remain a major hurricane through 
early next week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 926 mb (27.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are expected to reach portions of the
Lesser Antilles later today, and reach the British and U.S. Virgin
Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the
Bahamas, and Bermuda this weekend. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Dangerous surf and
rip currents are expected to begin along most of the U.S. East Coast
beginning Sunday.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Hurricane Lee Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
1100 PM AST Thu Sep 07 2023
 
The Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters have found that Lee has
skyrocketed to category 5 strength.  The aircraft measured peak
700-mb flight-level winds of 148 kt and trustworthy SFMR winds
slightly over 140 kt, and dropsonde data shows that the minimum
pressure has plummeted to 928 mb.  Based on these data, the initial
intensity is set at 140 kt, and Lee's maximum winds have increased
by an incredible 70 kt over the past 24 hours.  The hurricane has a
clear 15 n mi-wide eye, with an infrared eye temperature as warm
as 21 C surrounded by convective cloud tops as cold as -76 C.
 
Additional strengthening appears likely, as Lee remains in a
low-shear environment and over very warm waters near 30 degrees
Celsius, and there are no signs of an imminent eyewall replacement.
In fact, based on guidance from UW-CIMSS, the probability of a
secondary eyewall formation during the next 24 hours is well below
climatology.  There is some chance that moderate deep-layer
southwesterly shear could develop over the hurricane, but this
could be offset by strong upper-level divergence and thus have
little to no impact.  To account for the recent rate of
intensification, the NHC intensity forecast is slightly above the
IVCN and HCCA consensus aids and shows a peak intensity of 155 kt in
12 hours.  Amazingly, the 1800 UTC HAFS-A and -B runs show a peak
intensity between 170-180 kt, but that's getting into rarefied air.
The NHC forecast will be adjusted accordingly if those solutions
begin looking like a more distinct possibility.  Only very gradual
weakening is shown after 12-24 hours, and it is likely that Lee's
intensity will fluctuate for much of the forecast period.  Lee is
forecast to remain a dangerous category 4 or 5 hurricane for the
next 5 days.
 
For the next 5 days--through next Tuesday evening--Lee is expected
to maintain a steady west-northwestward track, passing well to the
north of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico.  The hurricane is currently moving at about 12 kt, but
it is expected to slow down considerably through early next week as
the steering ridge to its north builds southwestward, effectively
blocking Lee's progress.  The NHC track forecast remains of high
confidence through day 5, and again, no significant changes were
required from the previous forecast.  Although there are some
indications that Lee might begin a northward turn around the middle
of next week, it is still way to soon to focus on specific model
scenarios that far out into the future.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Lee has become a dangerous category 5 hurricane, and further
strengthening is forecast overnight.  Lee's core is expected to move
well north of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico this weekend and early next week.
 
2. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents are likely in
the northern Leeward Islands beginning Friday.  These conditions
will spread westward and northward, affecting Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, and Bermuda through
the weekend.
 
3. It is way too soon to know what level of impacts, if any, Lee 
might have along the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic Canada, or Bermuda 
late next week, particularly since the hurricane is expected to 
slow down considerably over the southwestern Atlantic.  Regardless, 
dangerous surf and rip currents are expected along most of the U.S. 
East Coast beginning Sunday.  Continue to monitor updates to Lee's 
forecast during the next several days.

Tropical Storm Margot Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
500 AM AST Fri Sep 08 2023
 
Deep convection has been gradually increasing near and to the north 
of the center of Margot during the past few hours.  The satellite 
intensity estimates range from 30 to 38 kt, and based on that data, 
the initial wind speed is held at 35 kt.

Margot is moving to the west-northwest at about 14 kt on the 
southwest side of a mid-level ridge.  The storm is expected to 
gradually turn to the northwest and then the north as it moves 
toward a weakness in the ridge induced by a mid- to upper-level low 
over the central subtropical Atlantic.  The models are in fairly 
good agreement, but there are some differences on where and when 
Margot makes the northward turn.  The NHC track forecast is similar 
to the previous one and near the middle of the guidance envelope.
 
Global models show Margot strengthening for unconventional reasons. 
While there are sufficiently warm ocean water along the forecast 
track, deep-layer vertical wind shear is expected to be strong to 
moderate as the storm nears an upper-level low pressure.  Typically, 
increased shear would lead to a weakening cyclone, but Margot could 
be positioned beneath an area of diffluence leading to increased 
convection and therefore, strengthening.  The NHC intensity forecast 
is similar to the previous one and near the IVCN and HCCA consensus 
models.
