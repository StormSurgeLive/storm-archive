...AIR FORCE RESERVE AND NOAA HURRICANE HUNTERS FIND LEE NOT AS
STRONG BUT STILL A MAJOR HURRICANE...
...HAZARDOUS BEACH CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP AROUND THE WESTERN
ATLANTIC THROUGH NEXT WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.3N 56.5W
ABOUT 440 MI...705 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...115 MPH...185 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...963 MB...28.44 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 19.3 North, longitude 56.5 West.  Lee is moving toward
the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this motion is
expected to continue through early next week with a significant
decrease in forward speed.  On the forecast track, Lee is expected
to pass well to the north of the northern Leeward Islands, the
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico over the weekend and into early
next week.
 
Data from Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
indicate that maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 115 
mph (185 km/h) with higher gusts.  Lee is a category 3 hurricane on 
the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Fluctuations in intensity 
are likely over the next few days, however Lee is expected to remain 
a powerful hurricane through early next week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 963 mb (28.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, and will reach the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto
Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, and
Bermuda this weekend. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Dangerous surf
and rip currents are expected to begin along most of the U.S. East
Coast Sunday and Monday and worsen through the week.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
1100 PM AST Fri Sep 08 2023
 
Strong southwesterly shear has taken a toll on Lee's structure.
The crews of ongoing NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter
missions reported that the hurricane's eyewall has opened up, and
the satellite presentation has degraded significantly since earlier
today.  Both planes have found the minimum pressure rising during 
their missions, with the latest measurements being around 963 mb.  
Based on this pressure and the planes' wind measurements, Lee's 
initial intensity is set at 100 kt.  

Moderate-to-strong deep-layer southwesterly shear is expected to 
continue for at least the next 24 hours, if not longer.  The GFS 
model is the quickest to show the shear abating, but the ECMWF 
now maintains shear over Lee for much of the forecast period.  Most
of the intensity guidance shows Lee weakening further during the 
next 12-24 hours while the shear is at its strongest, and that is 
shown in the new NHC forecast.  Despite the uncertainty in how 
the upper-level pattern, and hence the shear profile, will evolve 
around Lee, it is assumed that the atmospheric environment will 
become at least a little more conducive for restrengthening after 
24 hours.  The NHC intensity forecast blends the latest IVCN 
and HCCA consensus models with the previous official forecast, 
particularly after 48 hours.  Confidence in the intensity forecast 
is low at the moment, although it is likely that Lee will remain a 
dangerous hurricane for at least the next 5 days.
 
Lee's heading and speed remain 300 degrees at 11 kt.  The 
mid-tropospheric ridge to the north of the hurricane is forecast to 
build to the west and southwest during the next few days, which 
will keep Lee on a west-northwestward course with a decrease in 
speed through next Tuesday.  By Wednesday, a deep-layer trough is 
forecast to amplify over the eastern United States, erode the 
ridge, and cause Lee to gradually turn toward the northwest.  
Although the track models agree on this general scenario, there is 
disagreement on how far west Lee will get before it makes the turn. 
To account for the latest suite of models, the NHC track forecast 
has been shifted slightly westward on days 3 through 5, close to 
the consensus aids but not as far west as the ECMWF, UKMET, and the 
GEFS ensemble mean. 
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Lee's core is expected to move well north of the northern
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico this weekend
and early next week.
 
2. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents are affecting
portions of the northern Leeward Islands.  These conditions
will spread westward and northward, affecting Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, and Bermuda
through the weekend.
 
3. It is way too soon to know what level of impacts, if any, Lee
might have along the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic Canada, or Bermuda
late next week, particularly since the hurricane is expected to
slow down considerably over the southwestern Atlantic.  Regardless,
dangerous surf and rip currents are expected along most of the U.S.
East Coast beginning Sunday and Monday.  Continue to monitor
updates to Lee's forecast during the next several days.

Tropical Storm Margot Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
1100 PM AST Fri Sep 08 2023
 
Margot hasn't become any better organized during the last six hours. 
Deep convection is limited to the northeast quadrant of the sheared 
tropical storm. A pair of ASCAT passes showed winds up to 30 kt in 
the eastern half of the cyclone, but did not sample the location 
where the maximum winds are likely occuring. Satellite estimates 
from TAFB and the ADT were therefore used as the basis for the 
intensity for this advisory, which is still 35 kt.
 
Despite the shear and some dry air around the tropical storm noted 
in water vapor imagery, all of the intensity guidance indicates that 
Margot will strengthen over the next few days. The NHC forecast 
therefore shows slow strengthening throughout the forecast period, 
similar to the previous advisory. Most of the models are similar to 
the NHC forecast, but both HAFS models are outliers, showing Margot 
strengthening to a major hurricane in 3-4 days. This appears 
unlikely at least within the next 3 days or so, given the expected 
wind shear and the current structure of the tropical storm. 
Therefore, the NHC forecast is very close to, but generally just 
below the intensity consensus.
 
In contrast, there is higher confidence in the track forecast. All 
models indicate that Margot will continue its current 
west-northwestward motion for another day or so, and then turn 
north-northwestward to northward after that. The track model spread 
increases quickly beyond day 4, at which time confidence in the 
forecast is a little lower than normal. The model consensus hasn't 
changed much, so only small adjustments were made to the official 
track forecast.
