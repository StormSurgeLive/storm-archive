200 PM EDT Tue Sep 12 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Lee, located several hundred miles south of Bermuda, and on <br/>
Hurricane Margot, located over the central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic (AL97 and AL98):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure over the eastern tropical Atlantic <br/>
continues to produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms. This <br/>
system is expected to consolidate, with a low on the western side <br/>
becoming dominant over the next day or two. Gradual development of <br/>
the low is expected after that, and a tropical depression is likely <br/>
to form by this weekend while the system moves west-northwestward <br/>
or northwestward at about 15 mph across the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent. <br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 24.5 North, longitude 66.2 West. Lee is moving toward
the west-northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h).  A slow west-northwest to
northwest motion is expected during the next day or two, followed by
a turn toward the north by midweek. On the forecast track, Lee is
expected to pass near but to the west of Bermuda in a few days.
 
Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter data indicate that the maximum 
sustained winds remain near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher gusts.  
Lee is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind 
Scale.  Some slow weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, 
but Lee is expected to remain a large and powerful hurricane.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 951 mb (28.09 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm force winds are possible on Bermuda starting
Thursday morning.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, and Bermuda.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Dangerous surf and rip currents are affecting
portions of the southeastern U.S. coast, and these conditions are
forecast to spread northward along much of the U.S. East Coast
during the next couple of days. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
RAIN: Outer rain bands from Lee may produce rainfall amounts of 1 to
2 inches, 25 to 50 millimeters, across Bermuda Thursday into
early Friday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

<title>Hurricane Lee Forecast Discussion Number 29</title>

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
1100 AM AST Tue Sep 12 2023
 
GOES-16 satellite and radar images from the NOAA Hurricane Hunter
indicate that Lee is trying to consolidate into one large eyewall,
but the eye remains obscured with fragments of the old eyewall
structures.  Peak 700-mb flight-level winds were about 110 kt, 0.5
km radar estimates were near 121 kt and surface SFMR estimates were
about 90 kt, which could be under sampled with such a large
radius of maximum winds.  The initial wind speed is held at 100 kt
as a compromise of the aircraft estimates.
 
Lee is still moving slowly west-northwestward (300/5 kt), with
mid-level ridging established to the north and east of the
hurricane. This steering pattern is expected to change during the
next couple of days as a deep-layer trough moves across the eastern
United States and produces a weakness in this ridge. As a result,
Lee is forecast to turn northward and gradually accelerate during
the middle and latter parts of this week. The track guidance
envelope shows little cross-track spread during the first 3 days of
the forecast period, and this portion of the NHC forecast is fairly
similar to the previous one. While the core of the hurricane is
forecast to pass west of Bermuda, the large wind field of the storm
is likely to bring wind impacts to the island on Thursday,
prompting the Bermuda Weather Service to issue a Tropical Storm
Watch.  The latest NHC track was a compromise between the 6z GEFS
and ECMWF ensembles in the days 4/5 time frame, as it is still too
early to know if any leftward bend will occur as Lee approaches
North America.
 
No significant change in strength is expected in the near-term with
Lee due to its current structure and large wind field.  Going
forward, the large hurricane appears likely to begin upwelling
cooler waters along its path, and in a few days it will encounter
the cool wake left behind by recent western Atlantic hurricanes.
Thus, gradual weakening is forecast through midweek. Later, the
aforementioned trough is expected to produce stronger deep-layer
shear over Lee, and the hurricane is forecast to move over
significantly cooler waters as it passes north of the Gulf Stream.
As a result, more significant weakening is shown at days 4-5, along
with completion of its extratropical transition. Despite the
forecast weakening, it is important to note that the expanding wind 
field of Lee will produce impacts well away from the storm center.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents will affect
portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto
Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas,
Bermuda, and most of the U.S East Coast through much of the week.
 
2. There is an increasing risk of strong winds, rainfall, and high
surf impacts to Bermuda later this week, and a Tropical Storm Watch
has been issued for the island.
 
3. It remains too soon to know what level of additional impacts Lee
might have along the northeastern U.S. coast and Atlantic Canada
late this week and this weekend.  However, since wind and rainfall
hazards will extend well away from the center as Lee grows in size,
users should continue to monitor updates to Lee's forecast during
the next several days.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Margot was located 
near latitude 31.7 North, longitude 39.6 West. Margot is moving 
toward the north near 14 mph (22 km/h). A turn toward the 
north-northwest at a slower forward speed is expected beginning 
tomorrow. A meandering northward motion is then expected on Thursday 
and Friday. Margot's track beyond Friday is unusually uncertain, but 
a slow meandering motion is generally expected into the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts. Slight fluctuations in intensity, up or down, are possible 
during the next several days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 265
miles (425 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 977 mb (28.85 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Margot will begin to affect the Azores on
Wednesday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM GMT.

<title>Hurricane Margot Forecast Discussion Number 22</title>

Hurricane Margot Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
900 PM GMT Tue Sep 12 2023

As quickly as it re-appeared earlier today, Margot's eye 
disappeared again this evening. Consequently, Dvorak-based 
intensity estimates have decreased a little, with a blend of Data-T 
and Current Intensity values supporting an intensity near 70 kt. 
Based on recent AMSR microwave imagery, Margot still has a double 
eyewall, and a SAR overpass earlier this morning indicated that the 
winds in the outer eyewall were just as high as the inner one.

Margot has continued moving northward today, and should turn 
north-northwestward tomorrow. Beyond about 60 h, there is a 
significant increase in model forecast spread, and therefore, 
forecast uncertainty. The ECMWF and GFS highlight this uncertainty, 
showing very different forecasts for a ridge that is supposed to 
build to the north of Margot over the next 3 days, which results in 
a very different track for the hurricane. However, ensemble 
forecasts from those models indicate that their deterministic model 
solutions are part of a wide spectrum of possible tracks for Margot. 
The ECMWF track ensemble, for instance, has approximately 27 degrees 
of latitude spread between members at 120 h. We don't have a clear 
reason to favor any one solution at this time, so the NHC forecast 
is near the multi-model consensus. It is possible that large track 
adjustments will be needed to future NHC forecasts.

For the next few days, Margot's intensity should stay relatively 
steady, and this is supported by nearly every normally-reliable 
intensity model. Beyond about 72 h, the track of Margot will have an 
influence on its intensity, which increases the uncertainty. 
Depending on the exact evolution and path of Margot, it could hold 
its intensity for a bit longer, or quickly begin a transition to a 
remnant low. The NHC forecast is in the middle of these solutions, 
showing steady weakening, but the uncertainty in the intensity 
forecast is also unusually high.
