Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Mon Sep 11 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Lee, located a few hundred miles north of the northern Leeward <br/>
Islands, and on recently upgraded Hurricane Margot, located over the <br/>
central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL97):<br/>
A weak area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands continues to produce <br/>
disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity primarily to the west <br/>
of its center. Development of this system is unlikely before it <br/>
merges with a another area of low pressure (AL98) to its east during <br/>
the next couple of days. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent. <br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic (AL98):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure has formed along a tropical wave <br/>
located over the eastern tropical Atlantic south of the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands. This system is currently producing disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms but environmental conditions appear conducive for <br/>
gradual development of this system, especially after is merges with <br/>
an area of low pressure to its west (AL97). A tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form from the combined system by this weekend as it moves <br/>
westward to west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the central <br/>
tropical Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent. <br/>

...HAZARDOUS SURF AND RIP CURRENT CONDITIONS EXPECTED AT BEACHES
ACROSS THE WESTERN ATLANTIC ALL WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...23.6N 64.2W
ABOUT 380 MI...610 KM N OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 600 MI...970 KM S OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...115 MPH...185 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...948 MB...28.00 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Lee.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 23.6 North, longitude 64.2 West. Lee is moving toward
the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A slow west-northwest to
northwest motion is expected during the next couple of days,
followed by turn toward the north by midweek. On the forecast track,
Lee is expected to pass near, but to the west, of Bermuda in a few
days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Lee is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in strength is forecast during
the next couple of days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 75 miles (120 km) from 
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 
miles (295 km). Saildrone 1064 located to the west of the Lee's 
center in the last few hours reported a sustained wind of 70 mph 
(113 km/h) and wind gust of 88 mph (142 km/h).   
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 948 mb (28.00 inches). 
Saildrone 1064 located to the west of the Lee's center recently a 
surface pressure of 974 mb (28.79 inches). 
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, and Bermuda.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Dangerous surf and rip currents have begun to
affect portions of the southeastern U.S. coast, and these conditions
are forecast to spread northward along much of the U.S. East Coast
during the next day or two. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
500 PM AST Mon Sep 11 2023
 
Lee continues to exhibit a double eyewall structure as reported by 
the Air Force Hurricane Hunters and seen in recent microwave images. 
The inner eyewall is open on the south side, but the outer eyewall 
is completely closed and has contracted slightly from the earlier 
NOAA P-3 aircraft mission.  The minimum pressure is the same as 
before, 948 mb, but the initial wind speed is nudged downward to 100 
kt based on the aircraft data.
 
The major hurricane has jogged a little to the left recently, and 
the initial motion is estimated to be 290/7 kt.  The models are 
similar to the previous runs, and no big changes were made to the 
NHC track forecast. A continued slow motion between west-northwest 
and northwest is expected during the next couple of days as Lee 
remains steered by a mid-level high to its north-northeast. Beyond a 
couple of days, the ridge is expected to shift eastward as a mid- to 
upper-level trough amplifies over the eastern U.S.  This pattern 
change should cause Lee to turn northward with an increase in 
forward speed.  Lee is likely to pass near, but to the west of 
Bermuda, late Thursday and Friday and then be situated offshore of 
the mid-Atlantic states and New England late Friday and Saturday.
 
Given the current concentric eyewall structure, it seems likely that 
Lee will fluctuate in strength in the short term.  However, since 
the hurricane will remain in generally conducive conditions during 
the next couple of days, it could restrengthen if the eyewall cycle 
completes.  Lee is likely to move over a cool SST wake left behind 
by Hurricanes Idalia and Franklin later this week, and cross over 
the north wall of the Gulf Stream by the end of the forecast period. 
The combination of cooler SSTs, an increase in shear, and dry air 
entrainment should cause a steady decay in strength late this week 
and over the weekend.  The NHC intensity forecast is an update of 
the previous one and near the middle of the guidance envelope.
 
Although Lee is expected to weaken later in the week, it is expected 
to significantly increase in size and hazards will extend well away 
from the storm center by the end of the forecast period.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents will affect
portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto
Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas,
Bermuda, and most of the U.S East Coast through much of the week.
 
2. Lee could bring strong winds, rainfall, and high surf impacts to 
Bermuda later this week. Interests there should continue to monitor 
updates to the forecast of Lee during the next several days.
 
3. It remains too soon to know what level of additional impacts Lee 
might have along the Northeast U.S. coast and Atlantic Canada late 
this week and this weekend.  However, wind and rainfall hazards will 
likely extend well away from the center as Lee grows in size. Users 
should continue to monitor updates to the forecast of Lee during the 
next several days.

Hurricane Margot Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
300 AM GMT Tue Sep 12 2023
 
Margot has continued to become better organized over the past
several hours.  The eye is becoming a little more distinct, and
inner-core convection has intensified somewhat, with cooling cloud
tops.  Convective banding features are evident, particularly over
the southeastern portion of the circulation.  Upper-level outflow
is well defined over the northern semicircle of the system.  The
current intensity estimate is now 70 kt which is a blend of
subjective Dvorak classification estimates from TAFB and SAB.
 
Recent center fixes show a slight rightward wobble in the track but
the longer-term motion estimate is generally northward or 010/10 kt. 
Margot is expected to move northward to north-northwestward between 
two subtropical high pressure areas over the next few days.  Later 
in the forecast period, a blocking mid-level high pressure system 
develops to the north of the tropical cyclone.  This will cause 
Margot to move rather slowly and perhaps erratically over the
subtropical Atlantic in the 4-5 day time frame.  The official track
forecast is fairly close to the previous NHC prediction and
generally follows the multi-model TVCN consensus solution.
 
Global models indicate that the upper-level tropospheric flow over
Margot should be conducive for some more strengthening during the
next 36 hours or so, with diffluent anticyclonic winds aloft over
the system.  The official intensity forecast is about the same as
the previous one and remains close to the model consensus.  The
statistical-dynamical guidance DSHIPS suggests that the hurricane
could become a little stronger than shown here.  Later in the
period, increasing shear and cooler ocean waters will likely cause
a weakening trend.
