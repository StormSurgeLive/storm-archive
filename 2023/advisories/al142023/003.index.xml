...LEE BECOMES A CATEGORY 5 HURRICANE...
...DANGEROUS BEACH CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP AROUND THE 
WESTERN ATLANTIC THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.3N 52.4W
ABOUT 705 MI...1135 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...160 MPH...260 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...928 MB...27.41 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 17.3 North, longitude 52.4 West. Lee is moving toward
the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h), and this motion is
expected to continue through early next week with a significant
decrease in forward speed.  On the forecast track, Lee is expected
to pass well to the north of the northern Leeward Islands, the
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico over the weekend and into early
next week.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate
that maximum sustained winds have increased to near 160 mph (260
km/h) with higher gusts.  Lee is a category 5 hurricane on the
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional strengthening is
forecast overnight.  Fluctuations in intensity are likely over the
next few days, but Lee is expected to remain a major hurricane
through early next week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data is 928 mb
(27.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are expected to reach portions of the
Lesser Antilles on Friday, and reach the British and U.S. Virgin
Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the
Bahamas, and Bermuda this weekend. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Dangerous surf and
rip currents are expected to begin along most of the U.S. East Coast
beginning Sunday.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
1100 PM AST Thu Sep 07 2023
 
The Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters have found that Lee has
skyrocketed to category 5 strength.  The aircraft measured peak
700-mb flight-level winds of 148 kt and trustworthy SFMR winds
slightly over 140 kt, and dropsonde data shows that the minimum
pressure has plummeted to 928 mb.  Based on these data, the initial
intensity is set at 140 kt, and Lee's maximum winds have increased
by an incredible 70 kt over the past 24 hours.  The hurricane has a
clear 15 n mi-wide eye, with an infrared eye temperature as warm
as 21 C surrounded by convective cloud tops as cold as -76 C.
 
Additional strengthening appears likely, as Lee remains in a
low-shear environment and over very warm waters near 30 degrees
Celsius, and there are no signs of an imminent eyewall replacement.
In fact, based on guidance from UW-CIMSS, the probability of a
secondary eyewall formation during the next 24 hours is well below
climatology.  There is some chance that moderate deep-layer
southwesterly shear could develop over the hurricane, but this
could be offset by strong upper-level divergence and thus have
little to no impact.  To account for the recent rate of
intensification, the NHC intensity forecast is slightly above the
IVCN and HCCA consensus aids and shows a peak intensity of 155 kt in
12 hours.  Amazingly, the 1800 UTC HAFS-A and -B runs show a peak
intensity between 170-180 kt, but that's getting into rarefied air.
The NHC forecast will be adjusted accordingly if those solutions
begin looking like a more distinct possibility.  Only very gradual
weakening is shown after 12-24 hours, and it is likely that Lee's
intensity will fluctuate for much of the forecast period.  Lee is
forecast to remain a dangerous category 4 or 5 hurricane for the
next 5 days.
 
For the next 5 days--through next Tuesday evening--Lee is expected
to maintain a steady west-northwestward track, passing well to the
north of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico.  The hurricane is currently moving at about 12 kt, but
it is expected to slow down considerably through early next week as
the steering ridge to its north builds southwestward, effectively
blocking Lee's progress.  The NHC track forecast remains of high
confidence through day 5, and again, no significant changes were
required from the previous forecast.  Although there are some
indications that Lee might begin a northward turn around the middle
of next week, it is still way to soon to focus on specific model
scenarios that far out into the future.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Lee has become a dangerous category 5 hurricane, and further
strengthening is forecast overnight.  Lee's core is expected to move
well north of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico this weekend and early next week.
 
2. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents are likely in
the northern Leeward Islands beginning Friday.  These conditions
will spread westward and northward, affecting Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, and Bermuda through
the weekend.
 
3. It is way too soon to know what level of impacts, if any, Lee 
might have along the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic Canada, or Bermuda 
late next week, particularly since the hurricane is expected to 
slow down considerably over the southwestern Atlantic.  Regardless, 
dangerous surf and rip currents are expected along most of the U.S. 
East Coast beginning Sunday.  Continue to monitor updates to Lee's 
forecast during the next several days.

Tropical Storm Margot Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
200 AM CVT Fri Sep 08 2023
 
The convective organization of Margot has changed little tonight. 
The storm is producing some sheared convection to the north of its 
center with modest signs of curvature. An earlier 37 GHz GMI 
microwave image of Margot suggested the low-level center was a bit 
south of previous estimates, and this is consistent with the now 
partially exposed center that has emerged in recent proxy-visible 
imagery. The satellite intensity estimates are unchanged from 
earlier today, and the intensity remains 35 kt for this advisory.  
 
The SSTs along Margot's track are plenty warm enough to support some 
intensification over the next few days. On the other hand, there is 
a good amount of dry air in the surrounding environment, and 
southwesterly deep-layer shear is forecast to increase over Margot 
during the next several days in association with an upper-level 
trough over the central Atlantic. Interestingly, the increased shear 
diagnosed from the SHIPS guidance occurs around the same time as 
increasing upper-level divergence over the cyclone. This seems to 
suggest that some of the intensification in the global models could 
be driven by positive interaction with the upper trough. Since most 
of the global and regional hurricane models show Margot becoming a 
hurricane during the next few days, the NHC forecast follows suit 
and shows slow strengthening throughout the period. This forecast 
lies between the latest HCCA and IVCN multi-model aids.  

Margot is moving west-northwestward at 295/14 kt around a ridge over 
the eastern Atlantic. This general motion should continue for the 
next couple of days, followed by a turn toward the northwest and 
north-northwest at a slightly slower forward speed at days 3-5 as a 
weakness develops in the subtropical ridge. The track model 
consensus this cycle has trended slower and to the left of the 
previous prediction. As a result, the updated NHC track forecast has 
been adjusted accordingly.
