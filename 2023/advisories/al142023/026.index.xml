A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within the
next 24 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.
 
Interests elsewhere in the northeastern United States and Atlantic
Canada should monitor the progress of Lee.  Additional watches will
likely be required for a portion of these areas tonight or Thursday.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 27.4 North, longitude 67.6 West. Lee is moving toward
the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A motion toward the
north and an increase in forward speed are expected through Friday.
On the forecast track, the center of Lee will pass west of Bermuda
Thursday and Thursday night and then approach the coast of New
England and Atlantic Canada Friday and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Slow weakening is forecast during the next few days, 
however, Lee is likely to remain a large and dangerous
hurricane into the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 265
miles (425 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 952 mb (28.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in Bermuda
starting early Thursday.  Hurricane conditions are possible in
portions of down-east Maine on Saturday.  Tropical storm conditions
are possible in portions of coastal New England within the Tropical
Storm Watch area beginning Friday night.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Chatham, MA to Sagamore Beach, MA...2-4 ft
Cape Cod Bay...2-4 ft
Nantucket...2-4 ft
Sagamore Beach, MA to Border of US/Canada...1-3 ft
Boston Harbor...1-3 ft
Flushing, NY to Chatham, MA...1-3 ft
Montauk Point, NY to Flushing, NY...1-3 ft
Long Island Sound...1-3 ft
Martha's Vineyard...1-3 ft
Rockaway Inlet, NY to Montauk Point, NY...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the
east coast of the United States and are beginning to reach Atlantic
Canada. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Outer rain bands from Lee could produce rainfall amounts
of 1 to 2 inches, or 25 to 50 millimeters, across Bermuda Thursday
into early Friday.
 
From Friday night through Saturday night, Lee is expected to produce
rainfall amounts of 1 to 4 inches, or 25 to 100 millimeters, across
portions of eastern New England into portions of New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia. This could produce localized urban and small stream
flooding.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  34
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
500 PM AST Wed Sep 13 2023
 
The Air Force Hurricane Hunters investigated Lee earlier this
afternoon and found that the hurricane has lost some strength.  The
initial intensity is lowered to 90 kt based on the aircraft data.
Although the core winds have decreased some, the wind field has
become quite expansive, with the hurricane-force winds now extending
roughly 100 n mi away from the center.  The satellite appearance of
Lee has been relatively steady state through the day and there is
still evidence of concentric eyewalls.
 
Lee's forward speed is beginning to increase, and it is now moving
north-northwestward at 9 kt.  A progressively faster motion to the
north on the west side of a subtropical ridge is forecast during the
next couple of days, taking the core of the system to the west of
Bermuda Thursday and Thursday night.  The combination of a shortwave
trough over the Mid-Atlantic States and a building ridge extending
into Atlantic Canada should cause Lee to turn slightly to the left
Friday night and Saturday, which will likely bring Lee close to
southeastern New England before it moves near or over Maine and 
Atlantic Canada later in the weekend.   The GFS and ECMWF models 
have converged, and are now near the previous NHC track forecast.  
The new NHC track forecast is again just an update of the previous 
one and near the various consensus models.
 
The environment ahead of Lee is expected to gradually become less 
conducive for the hurricane as it moves into a region of higher 
wind shear, drier air, and over progressively cooler SSTs.  These 
conditions favor weakening, but since the system is so large the 
weakening process should be slow.  The NHC intensity forecast is a 
little lower than the previous one, in part due to the initial lower 
wind speed, and remains near the HCCA and IVCN guidance.  
Regardless of the details, there is high confidence that Lee will be 
a large hurricane near the coast of New England Friday night and 
Saturday.
 
It should again be noted that the 34- and 50-kt wind speed
probabilities beyond 36 hours in the text and graphical products are
likely underestimating the risk of those winds occurring.  This is
because the forecast wind field of Lee is considerably larger than
average compared to the wind field used to derive the wind speed
probability product.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions, heavy rainfall, and high surf are
expected to impact Bermuda beginning early Thursday, and a Tropical
Storm Warning is in effect for the island.
 
2. Hurricane conditions, heavy rainfall, and coastal flooding are
possible in portions of eastern Maine on Saturday, and a Hurricane
Watch has been issued for that area.
 
3. There is the potential for life-threatening storm surge flooding
in portions of southeastern Massachusetts, including Cape Cod and
Nantucket, late Friday and Saturday, where a Storm Surge Watch has
been issued.
 
4. Tropical storm conditions are possible over a large portion of
coastal New England, including Cape Cod, Nantucket,  Martha's
Vineyard, and Block Island, where a Tropical Storm Watch has been
issued.

BULLETIN
Hurricane Margot Advisory Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
900 PM GMT Wed Sep 13 2023
 
...MARGOT FORECAST TO MEANDER OVER THE NORTH ATLANTIC DURING THE 
NEXT FEW DAYS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM GMT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...34.7N 40.6W
ABOUT 790 MI...1270 KM WSW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 360 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...971 MB...28.68 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Margot was located
near latitude 34.7 North, longitude 40.6 West. Margot is moving
toward the north near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this motion is expected 
to continue with a gradual decrease in forward speed through 
Thursday. Margot is then likely to meander within weak steering 
currents through this weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some weakening is forecast during the next 72 hours.
 
Satellite data indicates that Margot's hurricane-force winds extend  
outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 971 mb (28.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Margot will continue to affect the 
Azores for the next several days. These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM GMT.

Hurricane Margot Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
900 PM GMT Wed Sep 13 2023
 
Very little change is noted with Margot's convective structure 
since the last advisory. The cyclone continues to exhibit a double 
eyewall structure based on a 1527Z AMSR-2 pass, and Margot's eye 
still occasionally appears in conventional GOES-16 IR and VIS 
imagery. Given the lack of change with the hurricane's internal 
structure and appearance, the intensity will be maintained at 80 kt 
for this advisory. The motion has bent just slightly to the right 
since this morning and is now moving due north at 6 kt.
 
Margot continues to gradually slow down as it moves within the flow 
between a deep-layer ridge over the eastern Atlantic and a narrow 
upper trough to its west. A general northward motion should continue 
over the next day or so before the track forecast becomes very 
challenging. Margot will then become caught in weak steering 
currents, with the global models showing a blocking ridge developing 
to the north of the cyclone by late week into the weekend. There 
remain notable differences between the GFS and ECMWF with regards to 
the strength and position of this ridge, which has large 
implications in the longer-range track of Margot, but there has been 
some tightening of the model consensus since this morning. This 
supports the storm making a gradual clockwise loop between 36-72 hrs 
as the ridge initially builds north of the cyclone and then slides 
off to the east. By 120 hrs, the storm will likely begin 
accelerating off to the northeast as it gets picked up by the 
westerlies, but the overall track forecast confidence remains low 
given the model spread late in the forecast period.
 
Increasing deep-layer shear during the next 24 to 36 hrs, 
entrainment of drier air, and a likelihood of Margot upwelling 
cooler waters should result in a steady weakening of the cyclone 
going through the end of the week and into the weekend. The NHC 
intensity forecast is close to the previous one and shows a gradual 
decrease in strength through 72 hrs, in good agreement with the 
consensus of the intensity aids. Although this forecast keeps Margot 
a tropical cyclone through day 5, simulated satellite imagery from 
the global models suggests these increasingly hostile environmental 
factors could cause the system to lose organized convection and 
become post-tropical by early next week as the storm lingers west 
of the Azores.
