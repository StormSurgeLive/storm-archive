Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Mon Sep 11 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Lee, located a few hundred miles north of the northern Leeward <br/>
Islands, and on Tropical Storm Margot, located over the central <br/>
subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL97):<br/>
A weak area of low pressure located several hundred miles to the <br/>
west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands is producing limited and <br/>
disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity well to the west of <br/>
its center. Additional development of this system is becoming <br/>
increasingly unlikely before it merges with a tropical wave to its <br/>
east during the next couple of days. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent. <br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located over the far eastern tropical Atlantic <br/>
between the Cabo Verde Islands and the west coast of Africa is <br/>
producing some disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Environmental <br/>
conditions appear conducive for gradual development of this system <br/>
during the latter part of the week, and a tropical depression could <br/>
form by the weekend while it moves westward to west-northwestward at <br/>
15 to 20 mph over the central tropical Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent. <br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located 
near latitude 22.6 North, longitude 62.2 West. Lee is moving toward 
the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A slower west-northwestward 
motion is expected during the next few days. On the forecast track, 
Lee is expected to pass well north of the northern Leeward Islands, 
the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico during the next day or two.
 
NOAA aircraft data indicate that maximum sustained winds remain 
near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher gusts. Lee is a category 3 
hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Additional 
strengthening is forecast over the next day or so, followed by 
gradual weakening.
 
Lee has been growing in size, with hurricane-force winds now 
extending outward up to 75 miles (120 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extending outward up to 175 miles (280 
km).
 
The minimum central pressure measured by NOAA reconnaissance
aircraft is 950 mb (28.06 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser 
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, 
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, and Bermuda. 
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions. Dangerous surf and rip currents have begun to 
reach portions of the southeast U.S. coast and are forecast to 
worsen and spread northward along much of the U.S. East Coast during 
the next couple of days. Please consult products from your local 
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
1100 PM AST Sun Sep 10 2023
 
There has been a wealth of data to dig though this evening for 
Hurricane Lee. Observations from both satellite imagery and this 
evening's NOAA-P3 mission indicate the hurricane has become more 
symmetric in both its convective pattern and wind field. On 
satellite, Lee has once again become more impressive with a warming 
eye surrounded by cold -65 to -75C eyewall cloud tops. In response, 
the subjective Dvorak estimates have been increasing, both T6.0/115 
kt from TAFB and SAB. In addition, a single closed eyewall of 25 n 
mi in diameter was reported by the NOAA aircraft, which has also 
been observed by the TDR data and an earlier 2151 UTC SSMIS 
microwave pass. The surface pressure has also been dropping, with 
the most recent dropsonde in the eye reporting 950 mb. However, the 
winds have yet to respond to the decreasing pressure, with peak 
flight-level winds of 108 kt, SFMR at 103 kt, and surface reduced 
TDR data also in the 100-105 kt range. All of the in-situ aircraft 
data supports maintaining an initial intensity of 105 kt this 
advisory. A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) pass valid at 2213 UTC 
also showed a 105-kt peak wind, but with expanding 64-kt wind radii, 
which might explain why the winds have yet to respond to the 
pressure drop.
 
Track-wise, Lee continues to move west-northwestward, at 305/6 kt.
This motion is expected to generally continue with a further
slowdown in the forward motion now that the mid-level ridging
influencing the storms steering has shifted more northwest in front
of the hurricane. However, this ridge is expected to then become
eroded by an approaching deep-layer trough, allowing Lee to turn
northward into the weakness produced by the trough. The track
guidance this cycle is in fairly good agreement over the next 5
days, with the largest details still related to the forward motion
of Lee after it turns northward. The NHC track forecast is pretty
much on top of the prior one, continuing to favor the consensus
aids, and is roughly in between the leftward GFS and rightward
ECMWF model solutions. Users should be reminded to not focus on the
exact forecast track, especially given Lee's forecast size at the
longer range, and the average day 4 and 5 track errors are about
145 and 200 miles, respectively.
 
Data from an earlier NOAA G-IV mission sampling the environment 
around Lee indicated that the vertical wind shear that had been 
affecting the hurricane has mostly subsided, with the dropsonde data 
showing well-established outflow to the north, and a deep-layer of 
cyclonic flow to the south associated with Lee's broad and deep 
circulation. While it is difficult to predict the inner-core changes 
associated with the cyclone, most of the intensity guidance still 
suggests Lee will intensify further over the next day or so, with a 
120-kt peak predicted in 24 hours. Afterwards, as Lee continues to 
slow down, it may then begin to encounter its own cold wake due to 
its expanding wind field, and the hurricane is expected to begin 
gradually weakening. This weakening should be hastened by increasing 
southwesterly vertical wind shear after 72 h as the storm also 
traverses already cooled sea-surface temperatures by Franklin and 
Idalia last week. However, the model guidance also shows Lee's 34-kt 
and 50-kt wind field continuing to expand through the forecast 
period even as the hurricane gradually weakens.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents will affect
portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto
Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, and
Bermuda through much of this week.
 
2. Lee could bring wind, rainfall, and high surf impacts to
Bermuda later this week.  Although it is too soon to determine the
specific timing and level of those impacts, interests on Bermuda
should monitor the latest forecasts for Lee.
 
3. It remains too soon to know what level of impacts, if any,
Lee might have along the U.S. East Coast and Atlantic Canada late
this week, especially since the hurricane is expected to slow
down considerably over the southwestern Atlantic.  Regardless,
dangerous surf and rip currents are expected along most of the U.S.
East Coast this week as Lee grows in size. Users should continue to
monitor updates to the forecast of Lee during the next several days.

Tropical Storm Margot Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
900 AM GMT Mon Sep 11 2023
 
This morning's satellite presentation consists of an isolated area
of deep convection near Margot's surface center and a curved band
displaced about 160 mi to the northeast beneath upper-level 
southerly diffluent flow.  This distinctive cloud pattern is a 
result of very dry mid-tropospheric air intruding from the 
southwest and wrapping around and into the northeast sector of the 
cyclone.  The Dvorak satellite intensity estimates from TAFB and 
SAB haven't changed since last night, and the initial intensity is 
held at 55 kt for this advisory.
 
The latest GFS and ECMWF sounding analyses show modest northwesterly 
shear undercutting the diffluent southerly flow aloft while drying 
and stabilizing the mid-level portion of the atmosphere.  In fact, 
the statistical-dynamic SHIPS indicates 40 to 50% relative humidity 
in the surrounding environment.  The deterministic and SHIPS models 
still indicate, however, that the upper-level trough providing these 
inhibiting conditions will lift northeastward soon, allowing 
anticyclonic upper-tropospheric flow to develop over Margot.  As a 
result, the cyclone should strengthen, and the NHC intensity 
forecast follows suit and indicates the cyclone becoming a hurricane 
in less than 24 hours while intensifying further through mid-week.  
Weakening is predicted beyond day 3 as the thermodynamic environment 
in the mid-latitudes of the central Atlantic becomes even less 
favorable.  The official intensity forecast follows the HFIP HCCA 
corrected consensus intensity model through 48 hours, then is based 
on a blend of the HCCA, Decay SHIPS, and the IVCN intensity aids.
 
Margot's initial motion during the past 12 hours has been north, or 
360/7 kt.  A mid-tropospheric subtropical ridge extending from west 
Africa to the eastern subtropical Atlantic should steer the cyclone 
in a generally northward trajectory through an amplified weakness 
over the central Atlantic over the next 72 hours.  Through the 
remaining period, Margot is expected to slow in forward speed, and 
possibly meander, in response to high pressure building to the 
north of the cyclone over the central north Atlantic.  The NHC 
forecast track is adjusted slightly to the right beyond 48 hours, 
and lies between the previous forecast and the TVCA simple average 
multi-model consensus.
