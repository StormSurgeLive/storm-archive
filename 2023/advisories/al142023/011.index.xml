Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Sat Sep 9 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Lee, located a few hundred miles east-northeast of the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands, and on Tropical Storm Margot, located over the <br/>
eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL97):<br/>
A small area of low pressure is currently located a few hundred <br/>
miles to the southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands. This system is <br/>
currently producing a small but concentrated area of showers and <br/>
thunderstorms, and earlier satellite-derived winds suggested a <br/>
small circulation could exist. However, environmental conditions <br/>
appear to be only marginally favorable for additional development as <br/>
the system moves slowly westward, remaining over the eastern <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent. <br/>
<br/>
Near the West African Coastline:<br/>
A tropical wave currently located near the West African coastline is <br/>
forecast to emerge into the eastern Tropical Atlantic over the next <br/>
day or so. Thereafter, environmental conditions appear generally <br/>
conducive for some gradual development of this system as it moves <br/>
westward to west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the eastern <br/>
Tropical Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent. <br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located 
near latitude 21.0 North, longitude 59.9 West. Lee is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A slower west-northwestward 
motion is expected during the next few days. On the forecast track, 
Lee is expected to pass well north of the northern Leeward Islands, 
the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico into early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Restrengthening is anticipated over the next day or two.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles 
(295 km). NOAA buoy 40144 located about 90 miles east-northeast of 
the center of Lee reported a peak sustained wind of 52 mph (83 
km/h) with a gust to 60 mph (98 km/h) within the past couple of 
hours.
 
The minimum central pressure measured by the NOAA hurricane hunter 
aircraft is 962 mb (28.41 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, and are spreading westward to the British and U.S. Virgin
Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the
Bahamas, and Bermuda over the remainder of this weekend. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Dangerous surf and rip currents are expected to begin
along most of the U.S. East Coast tomorrow and worsen through next
week. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
500 PM AST Sat Sep 09 2023
 
Lee's satellite presentation has changed little today.  The center 
is embedded within an area of cloud tops below -75C, and the Air 
Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft that was in the storm earlier 
this afternoon continued to report that Lee has a small eye. 
However, the eye remains obscured in both visible and infrared 
satellite imagery. A blend of the flight-level and SFMR winds, as 
well as dropsonde data from the earlier mission, yields an intensity 
of around 100 kt, and the advisory intensity remains that value.  
Dropsonde data in the center just before 1700 UTC supported a 
minimum pressure of 958 mb. A NOAA P-3 aircraft is scheduled to be 
in the storm environment again this evening to provide additional 
information on the structure and strength of the hurricane.
 
Shear analysis from UW/CIMSS indicates that there is still about
15-20 kt of southwesterly shear over Lee.  The GFS continues to
suggest that the shear will lessen during the next couple of days,
creating a more favorable environment for Lee to strengthen.
However, the ECMWF and UKMET still favor the notion that the
upper-level wind pattern will not become quite as conducive for a 
couple of more days.  Most of the intensity guidance calls for 
gradual restrengthening and the NHC forecast follows suit.  The NHC 
intensity forecast is close to the consensus models, but not as 
high as some of the dynamical model guidance and the HFIP corrected 
consensus.
 
Satellite and aircraft fixes show that Lee is moving west- 
northwestward at about 9 kt. There has been no change to the track 
forecast philosophy.  A mid-level ridge to the north of Lee is 
foreast to shift west-southwestward during the next few days, 
causing Lee's forward speed to slow considerably through early next 
week.  By midweek, a mid-latitude trough moving across the Great 
Lakes region and into the eastern United States is expected to 
weaken the ridge and allow Lee to turn north-northwestward and 
northward on days 4 and 5.  There is still a significant amount of 
spread in the deterministic guidance and global model ensembles as 
to exactly when and where the northward turn takes place.  In fact, 
the GFS and ECMWF models are about 275 n mi apart at day 5, 
primarily due to along-track spread related to how fast Lee begins 
moving northward.  The NHC track forecast continues to lie near the 
latest consensus aids, and the new track is very similar to the 
previous forecast. 
 
The center of Lee passed about 75 n mi south of NOAA buoy 41044 this 
afternoon, and that buoy has reported peak 1-minute sustained winds 
of 47 kt with a gust to 58 kt.  That data along with a couple of 
earlier scatterometer overpass have shown that the tropical-storm 
force wind field has expanded outward over the eastern semicircle, 
and that has been reflected in the latest analysis and forecast.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Lee's core is expected to move well north of the northern
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico this weekend
and early next week.
 
2. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents are affecting
portions of the northern Leeward Islands.  These conditions are
spreading westward and northward and will affect Puerto Rico, 
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, and Bermuda during 
the next several days. 
 
3. It remains too soon to know what level of impacts, if any, Lee 
might have along the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic Canada, or Bermuda 
late next week, particularly since the hurricane is expected to slow 
down considerably over the southwestern Atlantic.  Regardless, 
dangerous surf and rip currents are expected along most of the U.S. 
East Coast beginning Sunday and Monday. Users should continue to 
monitor updates to the forecast of Lee during the next several days.

Tropical Storm Margot Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
1100 PM AST Sat Sep 09 2023
 
Although Margot has not become significantly better organized since 
earlier today, recent scatterometer data indicate that it has 
strengthened slightly with maximum winds around 45 kt.  The system 
continues to experience westerly shear that is at least partially 
associated with the upper-level outflow of Hurricane Lee.  In spite 
of the shear, the center appears to be embedded within the main 
area of deep convection.  However, the overall cloud pattern 
remains elongated from west-southwest to east-northeast and 
convective banding features are not well defined at this time.

Center fixes indicate that the cyclone continues moving 
northwestward, or at about 315/8 kt.  Over the next couple of days, 
Margot should turn north-northwestward to northward while passing 
through a break in the mid-level subtropical ridge.  Later in the 
forecast period, the system's forward progress could be blocked by a 
ridge building to its northwest.  Some of the track guidance models, 
notably the GFS, show Margot turning eastward around the end of the 
forecast period.  The official track forecast has been shifted 
somewhat to the right of the previous NHC prediction, but is not as 
far east as the new GFS solution.  This is between the simple and 
corrected dynamical consensus tracks.

The dynamical guidance indicates that the vertical wind shear 
over Margot should remain moderate to strong for the next 48 hours 
or so.  In 3 to 5 days the global models show an upper-level 
anticyclone developing over the system, which would favor 
intensification, although the mid-level humidities are forecast to 
be only marginally conducive by that time.  Gradual strengthening is 
predicted, at just a slightly faster pace than the previous NHC 
forecast, and in good agreement with the latest intensity model 
consensus.
