...TROPICAL STORM WARNING ISSUED FOR CAPE COD, MARTHA'S VINEYARD, 
AND NANTUCKET...
...DANGEROUS SURF AND RIP CURRENT CONDITIONS AFFECTING MUCH OF THE
EAST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...30.4N 68.3W
ABOUT 245 MI...395 KM WSW OF BERMUDA

before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours. For
a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.
 
Interests elsewhere in the northeastern United States and Atlantic
Canada should monitor the progress of Lee.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area
outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by
your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 30.4 North, longitude 68.3 West. Lee is moving toward
the north near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this general motion with an
increase in forward speed is expected through Saturday.  A turn
toward the north-northeast and then northeast is forecast Saturday
night and Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Lee will
pass west of Bermuda today and tonight, approach the coast of New
England and Atlantic Canada Friday and Saturday, and move across
Atlantic Canada Saturday night and Sunday.
 
Data from Air Force Reserve and NOAA reconnaissance aircraft 
indicate that the maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 
km/h) with higher gusts. Weakening is forecast, but Lee is expected 
to remain a large and dangerous hurricane for the next couple of 
days.
 
Lee is a large hurricane. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up 
to 90 miles (150 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds 
extend outward up to 310 miles (500 km). A wind gust of 48 mph (78
km/h) has recently been reported at the L.F. Wade International
Airport on Bermuda.  NOAA buoy 41048 located about 130 miles (210 
km) northwest of the center of Lee has recently reported a peak 
one-minute sustained wind of 54 mph (86 km/h) and a gust to 67 mph 
(107 km/h).
 
The latest minimum central pressure estimated from reconnaissance 
aircraft data is 956 mb (28.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue on Bermuda through
Friday.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch
areas in Down East Maine and in Atlantic Canada on Saturday. 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in Cape Cod, 
Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket on Friday afternoon. Tropical storm 
conditions are possible in the Tropical Storm Watch area elsewhere 
in coastal New England and Atlantic Canada late Friday into 
Saturday.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Chatham, MA to Sagamore Beach, MA...2-4 ft
Cape Cod Bay...2-4 ft
Nantucket...2-4 ft
Sagamore Beach, MA to Border of US/Canada...1-3 ft
Boston Harbor...1-3 ft
Flushing, NY to Chatham, MA...1-3 ft
Montauk Point, NY to Flushing, NY...1-3 ft
Long Island Sound...1-3 ft
Martha's Vineyard...1-3 ft
Rockaway Inlet, NY to Montauk Point, NY...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
A dangerous storm surge could produce coastal flooding within the
wind watch areas in Atlantic Canada in areas of onshore winds.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the
east coast of the United States, and are beginning to reach Atlantic
Canada.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Outer rain bands from Lee may produce rainfall amounts of 
1 to 2 inches, or 25 to 50 millimeters, across Bermuda today into 
early Friday.

Friday night through Saturday night, Lee is expected to produce 
rainfall amounts of 1 to 4 inches, or 25 to 100 millimeters, across 
portions of eastern New England into portions of New Brunswick and 
Nova Scotia. This may produce localized urban and small stream 
flooding.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  37
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
1100 AM AST Thu Sep 14 2023
 
The satellite presentation of Lee has degraded over the past day or 
so. An eye is no longer apparent but deep convection continues to 
wrap around the eastern and northern portions of the circulation. 
Deep convection has waned over the southwestern portions of the 
cyclone, likely due to an increase in southwesterly vertical wind 
shear and dry air entrainment. An Air Force Reserve reconnaissance 
aircraft that has been investigating Lee this morning has measured 
peak 700-mb flight-level winds of 96 kt, and the NOAA P-3 aircraft 
has found peak 8000 ft flight-level winds of 100 kt.  However, peak 
SFMR winds from both aircraft have been around 70 kt. Using a blend 
of the flight-level and SFMR data, the initial wind speed has been 
lowered to 80 kt, but this could be a little generous.
 
Lee is moving northward at a slightly faster forward speed of 12 kt. 
A faster northward to north-northeastward motion is expected during 
the next day or so around the western side of a mid-level ridge over 
the central Atlantic.  A slight bend to the north-northwest toward 
the Gulf of Maine is likely late Friday or early Saturday as the 
southern extent of mid-latitude trough moves off the Mid-Atlantic 
coast. After that time, Lee is forecast to turn northeastward over 
Atlantic Canada.  The dynamical model guidance is tightly clustered 
and only minor adjustments were made to the previous official 
forecast.  The NHC track is close to a blend of the typically 
reliable GFS and ECMWF models.
 
Southwesterly vertical wind shear is expected to increase over Lee 
during the next 24 to 36 hours, and this is likely to lead to 
gradual weakening during that time.  Sea surface temperatures will 
decrease significantly just after 36 hours when Lee moves north of 
the Gulf Stream.  The global model guidance suggests that Lee will 
begin extratropical transition Friday night and this is likely to be 
completed within 48 hours, if not a little sooner.  The NHC 
intensity forecast is a blend of the HFIP corrected consensus and 
and the IVCN consensus model.  It can't be stressed enough, that 
regardless of Lee's designation, it will remain a large and 
dangerous cyclone while it approaches eastern New England and 
Atlantic Canada.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions, heavy rainfall, and high surf will
continue to impact Bermuda through Friday morning, and a Tropical
Storm Warning is in effect for the island.
 
2. Hurricane conditions and coastal flooding are possible in
portions of eastern Maine, southern New Brunswick, and western Nova
Scotia on Saturday, and a Hurricane Watch is in effect for that
area. Tropical storm conditions are expected on Cape Cod, Martha's
Vineyard, and Nantucket where a Tropical Storm Warning is now in
effect. Tropical storm conditions are possible elsewhere across New
England and Atlantic Canada within the Tropical Storm Watch areas.
 
3. Heavy rainfall from Lee may produce localized urban and small
stream flooding across eastern New England and into portions of New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia from Friday night into Saturday night.
 
4. There is the potential for life-threatening storm surge flooding 
in portions of southeastern Massachusetts, including Cape Cod and 
Nantucket, late Friday and Saturday, where a Storm Surge Watch is in 
effect.

Hurricane Margot Advisory Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM GMT Thu Sep 14 2023
 
...MARGOT GROWING IN SIZE OVER THE NORTH-CENTRAL ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM GMT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...36.5N 39.8W
ABOUT 710 MI...1145 KM W OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...80 MPH...130 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 30 DEGREES AT 6 MPH...9 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...978 MB...28.88 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Margot was located
near latitude 36.5 North, longitude 39.8 West. Margot is moving
toward the north-northeast near 6 mph (9 km/h), and a slower
forward motion is expected today. Margot is forecast to meander
within weak steering currents on Friday and make a small clockwise
loop over the weekend.
 
Satellite-wind data indicate that the maximum sustained winds are 
near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher gusts.  Gradual weakening is 
forecast over the next few days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230
miles (370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 978 mb (28.88 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Margot will continue to affect the
Azores for the next several days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM GMT.

NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM GMT Thu Sep 14 2023

The double-eyewall structure of Margot has changed this morning,
with the inner-eye almost completely dissipated, and the outer
eyewall has taken over as the dominant feature.  This is confirmed 
by scatterometer data from ASCAT-B and a SAR pass around 9 UTC.  The
initial wind speed is set to 70 kt, a compromise between higher SAR
estimates and Dvorak values closer to 65 kt.  Note that the
hurricane- and storm-force wind radii have been changed/expanded
significantly due to the SAR/scatterometer data.
 
Margot has turned further to the right, or 030/5.  A blocking ridge 
over the north-central Atlantic should force Margot to slow down 
and execute a clockwise loop during the next few days.  After the 
ridge shifts eastward, the hurricane could gain some latitude and 
begin to move more to the northeast at the end of the forecast 
period.  Model guidance is coming into better agreement on this 
solution, although there is considerable spread at long range with 
the GFS faster and more to the northeast than the ECMWF-based 
guidance.  The new NHC forecast is shifted southward in the near 
term with the GFS coming more into line with the other guidance, 
and ends up in almost the same spot as the last forecast by day 5.

The hurricane should gradually weaken as the large system slows 
down and upwells cooler water, along with Margot crossing over its 
own path.  Additionally, there is plenty of mid-level dry air in 
the surrounding environment that could be mixed in the core 
eventually. The updated forecast is adjusted higher initially 
because of the current intensity, but is blended back with the 
previous forecast and consensus aids at longer term.  Margot could 
become a post-tropical cyclone without deep convection early next 
week, but it really depends on how it handles the more hostile 
conditions.  Given how resilient this season's tropical cyclones 
have been, it could be optimistic that Margot is post-tropical on 
day 5.
