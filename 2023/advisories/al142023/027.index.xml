WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Stonington, ME to the U.S./Canada border
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Watch Hill, RI to Stonington, ME
* Block Island
* Martha's Vineyard
* Nantucket
 
A Storm Surge Watch is in effect for...
* Cape Cod Bay
* Nantucket
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within the
next 24 hours.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.
 
Interests elsewhere in the northeastern United States and Atlantic
Canada should monitor the progress of Lee.  Additional watches will
likely be required for a portion of these areas tonight or Thursday.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Lee was located by 
NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 27.6 
North, longitude 67.7 West.  Lee is moving toward the 
north-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A motion toward the north
and an increase in forward speed are expected through Friday.  On 
the forecast track, the center of Lee will pass west of Bermuda 
Thursday and Thursday night and then approach the coast of New 
England and Atlantic Canada Friday and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Slow weakening is forecast during the next few days, 
however, Lee is likely to remain a very large and dangerous 
hurricane into the weekend.
 
Lee is a very large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend outward 
up to 115 miles (185 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force 
winds extend outward up to 265 miles (425 km).
 
The minimum central pressure reported by the Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft is 951 mb (28.08 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in Bermuda
starting early Thursday.  Hurricane conditions are possible in
portions of down-east Maine on Saturday.  Tropical storm conditions
are possible in portions of coastal New England within the Tropical
Storm Watch area beginning Friday night.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Chatham, MA to Sagamore Beach, MA...2-4 ft
Cape Cod Bay...2-4 ft
Nantucket...2-4 ft
Sagamore Beach, MA to Border of US/Canada...1-3 ft
Boston Harbor...1-3 ft
Flushing, NY to Chatham, MA...1-3 ft
Montauk Point, NY to Flushing, NY...1-3 ft
Long Island Sound...1-3 ft
Martha's Vineyard...1-3 ft
Rockaway Inlet, NY to Montauk Point, NY...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast where the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the
east coast of the United States and are beginning to reach Atlantic
Canada. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Outer rain bands from Lee could produce rainfall amounts
of 1 to 2 inches, or 25 to 50 millimeters, across Bermuda Thursday
into early Friday.
 
From Friday night through Saturday night, Lee is expected to produce
rainfall amounts of 1 to 4 inches, or 25 to 100 millimeters, across
portions of eastern New England into portions of New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia. This could produce localized urban and small stream
flooding.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  34
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
500 PM AST Wed Sep 13 2023
 
The Air Force Hurricane Hunters investigated Lee earlier this
afternoon and found that the hurricane has lost some strength.  The
initial intensity is lowered to 90 kt based on the aircraft data.
Although the core winds have decreased some, the wind field has
become quite expansive, with the hurricane-force winds now extending
roughly 100 n mi away from the center.  The satellite appearance of
Lee has been relatively steady state through the day and there is
still evidence of concentric eyewalls.
 
Lee's forward speed is beginning to increase, and it is now moving
north-northwestward at 9 kt.  A progressively faster motion to the
north on the west side of a subtropical ridge is forecast during the
next couple of days, taking the core of the system to the west of
Bermuda Thursday and Thursday night.  The combination of a shortwave
trough over the Mid-Atlantic States and a building ridge extending
into Atlantic Canada should cause Lee to turn slightly to the left
Friday night and Saturday, which will likely bring Lee close to
southeastern New England before it moves near or over Maine and 
Atlantic Canada later in the weekend.   The GFS and ECMWF models 
have converged, and are now near the previous NHC track forecast.  
The new NHC track forecast is again just an update of the previous 
one and near the various consensus models.
 
The environment ahead of Lee is expected to gradually become less 
conducive for the hurricane as it moves into a region of higher 
wind shear, drier air, and over progressively cooler SSTs.  These 
conditions favor weakening, but since the system is so large the 
weakening process should be slow.  The NHC intensity forecast is a 
little lower than the previous one, in part due to the initial lower 
wind speed, and remains near the HCCA and IVCN guidance.  
Regardless of the details, there is high confidence that Lee will be 
a large hurricane near the coast of New England Friday night and 
Saturday.
 
It should again be noted that the 34- and 50-kt wind speed
probabilities beyond 36 hours in the text and graphical products are
likely underestimating the risk of those winds occurring.  This is
because the forecast wind field of Lee is considerably larger than
average compared to the wind field used to derive the wind speed
probability product.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions, heavy rainfall, and high surf are
expected to impact Bermuda beginning early Thursday, and a Tropical
Storm Warning is in effect for the island.
 
2. Hurricane conditions, heavy rainfall, and coastal flooding are
possible in portions of eastern Maine on Saturday, and a Hurricane
Watch has been issued for that area.
 
3. There is the potential for life-threatening storm surge flooding
in portions of southeastern Massachusetts, including Cape Cod and
Nantucket, late Friday and Saturday, where a Storm Surge Watch has
been issued.
 
4. Tropical storm conditions are possible over a large portion of
coastal New England, including Cape Cod, Nantucket,  Martha's
Vineyard, and Block Island, where a Tropical Storm Watch has been
issued.

BULLETIN
Hurricane Margot Advisory Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
300 AM GMT Thu Sep 14 2023
 
...MARGOT TO MEANDER OVER THE NORTH ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM GMT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...35.2N 40.5W
ABOUT 770 MI...1245 KM W OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...85 MPH...140 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 10 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...972 MB...28.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM GMT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Margot was located 
near latitude 35.2 North, longitude 40.5 West. Margot is moving 
toward the north near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this motion is expected 
to continue with a gradual decrease in forward speed through 
Thursday. Margot is then likely to meander within weak steering 
currents through this weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Steady weakening is forecast over the next few 
days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230
miles (370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 972 mb (28.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Margot will continue to affect the
Azores for the next several days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM GMT.

Hurricane Margot Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
300 AM GMT Thu Sep 14 2023

Margot's satellite depiction has become more ragged during the last 
few hours. An earlier microwave pass showed that the center was 
partially opened on the northern and western sides of the system. 
Dry air is beginning to wrap into the center of the system, which 
has caused some of the banding features to become broken. The center 
has been cloud filled since the previous advisory, with overall 
warming cloud tops. Satellite Dvorak current intensity estimates 
were both 4.5 from TAFB and SAB. Given these estimates and the 
degraded satellite depiction, the initial intensity for this 
advisory is lowered to 75 kt.
 
Margot continues to gradually slow down as it moves within the flow 
between a deep-layer ridge over the eastern Atlantic and an upper 
trough to its west. A general northward motion should continue over 
the next day or so. The steering pattern becomes fairly weak with a 
blocking ridge to the north of the system, causing Margot to meander 
over the north Atlantic and make a gradual clockwise loop over the 
next 2 to 3 days. There are still some large differences in the 
guidance envelope in the long term, but slightly better agreement 
than 24 h ago. By the end of the period, the storm will likely 
begin accelerating off to the east-northeast as it gets picked up by 
the westerlies, but the overall track forecast confidence remains 
low given the model spread.
 
Margot's convective structure has degraded this evening. The system 
is entering a less favorable environment, with dry air entrainment 
beginning to erode some of the structure. Deep-layer shear is also 
forecast to increase, and upwelling of cooler waters due to the lack 
of forward motion should result in weakening of the system through 
the weekend. The NHC intensity forecast is similar to the previous 
advisory and lies near the corrected consensus aids, the HCCA and 
IVCN. Although the forecast keeps Margot a tropical cyclone through 
day 5, simulated satellite imagery from the global models suggests 
these increasingly hostile environmental factors could cause the 
system to lose organized convection and become post-tropical sooner.
