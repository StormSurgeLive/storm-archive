500 AM AST Sat Sep 09 2023
 
...LEE MAINTAINS MAJOR HURRICANE STATUS WHILE MOVING
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD...
...HAZARDOUS BEACH CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP AROUND THE WESTERN
ATLANTIC THROUGH NEXT WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.7N 57.4W
ABOUT 385 MI...620 KM ENE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...115 MPH...185 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...963 MB...28.44 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located 
near latitude 19.7 North, longitude 57.4 West. Lee is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this motion is 
expected to continue through early next week with a significant 
decrease in forward speed.  On the forecast track, Lee is expected 
to pass well to the north of the northern Leeward Islands, the 
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico into early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Lee is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Fluctuations in intensity are likely over the 
next few days, however Lee is expected to remain a powerful 
hurricane through early next week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 963 mb (28.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser 
Antilles, and will spread westward to the British and U.S. Virgin 
Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the 
Bahamas, and Bermuda through this weekend. These swells are likely 
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  
Dangerous surf and rip currents are expected to begin along most of 
the U.S. East Coast Sunday and Monday and worsen through the week.  
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
500 AM AST Sat Sep 09 2023
 
Lee seems to be recovering from the effects of the strong 
southwesterly shear.  The central dense overcast has expanded, with 
periodic bursts of deep convection and increased lightning activity 
near the center.  The most recent geostationary satellite infrared 
images even seem to be hinting a return of Lee's eye.  Overnight, 
there were multiple reports from NOAA and Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft of mesovorticies orbiting the closed, 
elliptical eyewall.  Due to safety considerations, the aircraft were 
unable, at times, to penetrate the eyewall and thus, we have no new 
in-situ information about the intensity or minimum central 
pressure.  The initial intensity is held at a somewhat uncertain 
100 kt and NOAA and Air Force Reserve missions are scheduled to 
investigate Lee later this morning.
 
Confidence in the intensity forecast remains low.  Global models 
suggest that Lee could be affected by strong-to-moderate 
southwesterly shear for at least the next day, though the European 
global model shows strong upper-level winds near the hurricane for 
the entire forecast period.  The statistical and consensus intensity 
aids predict Lee could briefly weaken in the short-term, before 
restrengthening in about 12-24 hours.  Only minor adjustments have 
been made to the latest NHC intensity forecast, which generally lies 
between the simple and corrected consensus intensity aids. 
Regardless of the details, it is likely that Lee will continue to be 
a dangerous hurricane through the entire forecast period.
 
Lee is moving west-northwestward at 295/10 kt.  The hurricane is 
situated to the south of a mid-level ridge that is predicted to 
build westward and southwestward during the next few days.  This 
steering pattern is expected to keep Lee on a west-northwestward 
trajectory with a slower forward speed.  By next Wednesday, the 
hurricane should gradually turn to the northwest and 
north-northwest in the flow between a trough over the eastern 
United States and the southwestern edge of the ridge.  While the 
model guidance is in good agreement about the general synoptic 
setup, there remain differences in how far west Lee will move 
before it makes the turn.  The latest NHC track forecast is very 
similar to the previous predictions and lies just to the south of 
the various track consensus aids.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Lee's core is expected to move well north of the northern
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico this weekend
and early next week.
 
2. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents are affecting
portions of the northern Leeward Islands.  These conditions
will spread westward and northward, affecting Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, and Bermuda
through the weekend.
 
3. It is way too soon to know what level of impacts, if any, Lee
might have along the U.S. East Coast, Atlantic Canada, or Bermuda
late next week, particularly since the hurricane is expected to
slow down considerably over the southwestern Atlantic.  Regardless,
dangerous surf and rip currents are expected along most of the U.S.
East Coast beginning Sunday and Monday.  Continue to monitor
updates to Lee's forecast during the next several days.

Tropical Storm Margot Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
500 AM AST Sat Sep 09 2023
 
Margot has become better organized this morning.  The earlier noted 
exposed surface center has become obscured with bursts of deep 
convection while the outflow pattern has become more diffluent in 
the northeast quadrant of the cyclone.  Therefore, the initial 
intensity is raised to 40 kt and is based on the TAFB and SAB Dvorak 
satellite intensity estimates.
 
Although some northerly shear and dry mid-level air intruding 
from the southwest has slowed the intensification rate, the 
intensity guidance indicates that Margot will become a hurricane 
next week.  In fact, the upper-level pattern becomes more favorable 
by mid-period, although the statistical SHIPS intensity guidance 
shows modest southerly shear at the time.  Therefore, the official 
forecast indicates gradual intensification through the entire 
forecast period.  The NHC intensity forecast favors the reliable 
multi-model consensus aids, which is just below the Decay SHIPS 
beyond day 3.
 
Margot is moving west-northwestward at 11 kt around the southwestern
periphery of a subtropical high over the eastern Atlantic.  A 
west-northwest to northwest motion is forecast through early 
Sunday, followed by a turn toward north-northwest to north by late 
Sunday with some reduction in forward speed.  A slight adjustment 
to the right of the previous forecast track was made to hedge 
closer to the HFIP HCCA corrected consensus aid and TVCA simple 
multi-model guidance.
