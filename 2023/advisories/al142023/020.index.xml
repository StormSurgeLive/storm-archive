Hurricane Lee Advisory Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
500 AM AST Tue Sep 12 2023
 
...LEE REMAINS A LARGE AND POWERFUL HURRICANE...
...HAZARDOUS SURF AND RIP CURRENT CONDITIONS EXPECTED AT BEACHES
ACROSS THE WESTERN ATLANTIC ALL WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.0N 65.4W
ABOUT 575 MI...925 KM S OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...115 MPH...185 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...948 MB...28.00 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Lee. Watches
could be required for Bermuda later today.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located 
near latitude 24.0 North, longitude 65.4 West. Lee is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h). A slow west-northwest to 
northwest motion is expected during the next day or two, followed by 
a turn toward the north by midweek. On the forecast track, Lee is 
expected to pass near but to the west of Bermuda in a few days.
 
Data from the Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters indicate that 
maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Lee is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane 
Wind Scale. Gradual weakening is forecast during the next few days.
 
Lee is a large hurricane. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up 
to 80 miles (130 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds 
extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 948 mb (28.00 inches) 
based on dropsonde data from the aircraft.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, and Bermuda.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Dangerous surf and rip currents are affecting
portions of the southeastern U.S. coast, and these conditions are
forecast to spread northward along much of the U.S. East Coast
during the next couple of days. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Hurricane Lee Forecast Discussion Number 27</title>

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
1100 PM AST Mon Sep 11 2023

This evening, Lee appears to be in the final stages of completing 
another eyewall replacement cycle (ERC). A GPM microwave pass at 
2201 UTC showed that the outer eyewall remains closed and, while it 
remains quite large, continues to contract slowly as the inner 
eyewall decays within. The initial intensity is held at 100 kt this 
advisory, blending the subjective and objective intensity estimates 
this evening. Another Air Force Reserve Reconnaissance mission is 
scheduled to investigate the storm overnight, and several saildrones 
along Lee's path are also likely to provide additional in-situ 
observations in the hurricane over the next day or so.

Lee continues to move slowly west-northwestward, with the motion 
estimated at 295/6 kt. Lee is expected to continue moving slowly 
west-northwest or northwest over the next 24-36 h while mid-level 
ridging remains in place centered northwest of the hurricane. 
However, the ridge should then become eroded and shift eastward as a 
mid- to upper-level trough swings into the northeastern United 
States. This pattern change should result in Lee turning northward 
and gradually accelerating. The biggest spread in the track 
guidance solutions remains in the along-track direction, with the 
GFS on the faster end, and ECMWF on the slower end. The NHC track 
forecast continues to favor a blend of the simple and corrected 
consensus aids, and is very close to the previous forecast track 
through 72 h, and is just a touch east of the prior track 
thereafter. On this track, Lee is likely to pass near, but west of, 
Bermuda late Thursday and Friday and then be situated offshore of 
the mid-Atlantic states and New England late Friday and Saturday.

With the pending completion of Lee's ERC, expected over the next 
6-12 hours, the NHC intensity forecast continues to show some modest 
re-intensification. This seems reasonable given that sea surface 
temperatures (SSTs) observed by a saildrone in Lee's south outer 
eyewall are still around 29 C. After the next day or so, however, 
coupled atmospheric-ocean models suggest the large wind field of Lee 
will begin to upwell cooler SSTs, and Lee is still forecast to move 
over a cool SST wake left behind by Hurricanes Idalia and Franklin 
later this week. In addition, the approaching mid-latitude trough 
should also result in an increase in shear, and dry air entrainment, 
which should result in more steady weakening later this week and 
over the weekend. This trough interaction will also ultimately lead 
to Lee transitioning to an extratropical cyclone by the end of the 
forecast period as it crosses the north wall of the Gulf Stream. The 
NHC intensity forecast is a bit lower than the prior cycle after 72 
h but remains close to the consensus intensity aids.
 
Although Lee is expected to weaken later in the week, it is still 
expected to significantly increase in size and hazards will extend 
well away from the storm center by the end of the forecast period.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents will affect
portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto
Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas,
Bermuda, and most of the U.S East Coast through much of the week.
 
2. Lee could bring strong winds, rainfall, and high surf impacts to
Bermuda later this week. Interests there should continue to monitor
updates to the forecast of Lee during the next several days.
 
3. It remains too soon to know what level of additional impacts Lee 
might have along the Northeast U.S. coast and Atlantic Canada late 
this week and this weekend.  However, because wind and rainfall 
hazards will likely extend well away from the center as Lee grows in 
size, users should continue to monitor updates to Lee's forecast 
during the next several days.

Hurricane Margot Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
900 AM GMT Tue Sep 12 2023
 
Margot's eye became obscured in infrared satellite imagery a couple 
of hours ago, but the hurricane still has a well-defined Central 
Dense Overcast surrounded by convective banding features.  A dry 
slot has become entrained into the eastern part of the circulation, 
between the CDO and the outermost banding.  Based on consensus 
Dvorak estimates of T4.5 from TAFB and SAB, the initial intensity 
is raised to 75 kt.

Margot is moving northward (360/11 kt) along the western periphery 
of a mid-level ridge emanating out of western Africa, and this 
steering mechanism should keep the hurricane on a general 
northward or north-northwestward trajectory for the next few 
days.  A blocking ridge is forecast to form in 2-3 days over the 
north Atlantic, which is likely to cause Margot to slow down during 
the middle to latter part of the forecast period.  However, the 
ridge may be relatively progressive, and by day 5 many of the track 
models show the storm picking up some speed again once the ridge 
gets out of the way.  The most notable change in the NHC track 
forecast is that it's faster than the previous prediction on days 4 
and 5 to better align with the latest guidance.

The hurricane is currently within a strongly diffluent environment 
to the east of an upper-level trough, but the environment is 
forecast to evolve to an anticyclone aloft and low shear within the 
next 12 hours.  Continued strengthening is therefore likely, but 
any intensification trend could be halted soon after 24 hours when 
the hurricane slows down and potentially upwells cooler waters.  
The NHC intensity forecast is above the intensity consensus during 
the first day or two and is closest to the statistical-dynamical 
guidance.  Weakening is likely to occur after 48 hours due to 
cooler waters and an increase in deep-layer shear.
