DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located 
near latitude 26.4 North, longitude 67.2 West. Lee is moving toward 
the north-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A turn toward the north is 
expected by tonight, followed by an increase in speed on Thursday 
and Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of Lee will pass west 
of Bermuda Thursday and Thursday night and then approach the coast 
of New England or Atlantic Canada Friday and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Lee is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Slow weakening is forecast during the next few 
days, however, Lee is likely to remain a large and dangerous 
hurricane into the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240
miles (390 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 948 mb (28.00 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in Bermuda
starting early Thursday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser 
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, 
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, and Bermuda. 
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions. Dangerous surf and rip currents are affecting 
portions of the southeastern and mid-Atlantic U.S. coast, and these 
conditions are forecast to spread northward across New England and 
Atlantic Canada later today. Please consult products from your local 
weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Outer rain bands from Lee may produce rainfall amounts of
1 to 2 inches, 25 to 50 millimeters, across Bermuda Thursday into
early Friday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
1100 AM AST Wed Sep 13 2023
 
Lee continues to exhibit concentric eyewalls, but there are some dry 
slots between those features.  An SSMIS microwave image around 10Z 
showed that both eyewalls were open, however, recent infrared 
satellite images indicate that the inner eyewall appears to be 
becoming better organized during the past few hours.  The initial 
wind speed is held at 100 kt, but this is near the high end of the 
latest satellite intensity estimates.  The Air Force Hurricane 
Hunters are scheduled to investigate Lee this afternoon, and the 
data they collect should provide a better assessment of the 
hurricane's intensity and structure.
 
Satellite images suggest that Lee seems to be beginning its 
northward turn on the western side of a subtropical ridge situated 
over the central Atlantic.  The latest initial motion estimate is 
345/6 kt.  Lee should gradually increase in forward speed while 
moving northward on the west side of the ridge during the next 
couple of days, taking the core of the system to the west of Bermuda 
Thursday and Thursday night.  The combination of a shortwave trough 
and a building ridge extending into Atlantic Canada could cause Lee 
to turn slightly to the left Friday night and Saturday, which will 
likely bring Lee close to southeastern New England before it reaches 
Maine and Atlantic Canada later in the weekend.  Confidence is 
increasing in the forecast track, and the model spread is mostly 
along-track, associated with the system's forward speed/timing.  
Overall, little change was made to the previous NHC track forecast, 
and it remains very near the various consensus models.
 
Lee is expected to gradually weaken as it moves into an environment 
of increasing vertical wind shear, slightly drier air, and over 
progressively cooler waters during the next few days.  However, the 
large size of the system suggests that the weakening process should 
be slow.  In addition, Lee is expected to grow in size as it gains 
latitude during the next few days.  The NHC intensity forecast is 
largely the same as the previous one and fairly close to the HCCA 
and IVCN models.  Regardless of the details, there is high 
confidence that Lee will be a large hurricane near the coast of New 
England Friday night and Saturday.

It should again be noted that the 34- and 50-kt wind speed 
probabilities beyond 36 hours in the text and graphical products are 
likely underestimating the risk of those winds occurring.  This is 
because the forecast wind field of Lee is considerably larger than 
average compared to the wind field used to derive the wind speed 
probability product.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents will affect
portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto
Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas,
Bermuda, the U.S East Coast, and Atlantic Canada into the weekend.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions, heavy rainfall, and high surf are
expected to impact Bermuda beginning early Thursday, and a Tropical 
Storm Warning is in effect for the island.
 
3. There is an increasing risk of wind, coastal flooding, and rain
impacts from Lee in portions of New England and Atlantic Canada
beginning on Friday and continuing through the weekend.  Watches 
will likely required for portions of these areas later today or 
tonight. Due to Lee's large size, hazards will extend well away 
from the center, and there will be little to no significance on 
exactly where the center reaches the coast.

Hurricane Margot Advisory Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM GMT Wed Sep 13 2023
 
...MARGOT NOT EXPECTED TO MOVE MUCH OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 PM GMT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...34.1N 40.4W
ABOUT 795 MI...1280 KM WSW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 345 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...970 MB...28.65 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM GMT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Margot was located
near latitude 34.1 North, longitude 40.4 West. Margot is moving
toward the north-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h) and this motion with 
a gradual decrease in forward speed is expected through early 
Thursday. Then, Margot is likely to stall or meander within weak 
steering currents into the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some weakening is forecast during the next 72 hours.
 
Satellite data indicated that Margot's hurricane-force winds 
extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 970 mb (28.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Margot will begin to affect the Azores
later today. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 PM GMT.

<title>Hurricane Margot Forecast Discussion Number 25</title>

Hurricane Margot Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM GMT Wed Sep 13 2023
 
Margot continues to exhibit a double eyewall structure based on
a recent SAR pass over the storm, with a well-defined inner core. 
GOES-16 IR data shows the inner-eye feature occasionally obscured by 
clouds, but overall the organization of Margot has changed little 
over the last several hours. The latest microwave data in 
conjunction with the SAR pass suggests the initial intensity may be 
just a tad stronger compared to continuity, and so it will be set at 
80 kt for this advisory.
 
Margot is slowing down as it moves within the flow between a 
deep-layer ridge over the eastern Atlantic and a narrow upper trough 
to its west. A general north to north-northwest motion should 
continue over the next day or so before the track forecast becomes 
very challenging. Margot is expected to become caught in weak 
steering currents, with the global models showing a blocking ridge 
developing to the north of the cyclone by late week into the 
weekend. There are significant differences between the GFS and ECMWF 
with regards to the strength and position of this ridge, which has 
large implications in the longer-range track of Margot. The overall 
consensus of the guidance suggests that Margot could make a 
clockwise loop as the ridge builds, and the latest NHC forecast 
shows little net motion between 36-72 hrs as the cyclone meanders 
over the central Atlantic. At days 4-5, most models (except for the 
ECMWF) show the ridge sliding eastward, allowing for Margot to 
gain latitude, and the overall track forecast confidence remains 
low.
 
The deep-layer shear is forecast to increase during the next 24 to 
36 hrs, and this coupled with a likelihood of the upwelling of 
cooler waters should result in a weakening trend. Drier air 
surrounding the storm will also be a factor in causing a weakening 
cyclone going into the weekend. The NHC intensity forecast is close 
to the previous forecast and shows gradual decrease in strength 
through 72 hrs, and in good agreement with the consensus of the 
intensity aids. Although this forecast keeps Margot a tropical 
cyclone through day 5, simulated satellite imagery from the global 
models suggests these environmental factors could cause the system 
to lose organized convection and become post-tropical early next 
week as the storm lingers west of the Azores.
