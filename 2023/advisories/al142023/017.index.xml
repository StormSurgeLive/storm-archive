Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Mon Sep 11 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Lee, located a few hundred miles north of the northern Leeward <br/>
Islands, and on Tropical Storm Margot, located over the central <br/>
subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL97):<br/>
A weak area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands is producing disorganized <br/>
shower and thunderstorm activity well to the west of its center. <br/>
Development of this system is unlikely before it merges with <br/>
a tropical wave to its east during the next couple of days. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...10 percent. <br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located over the far eastern tropical Atlantic <br/>
between the Cabo Verde Islands and the west coast of Africa is <br/>
producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Environmental <br/>
conditions appear conducive for gradual development of this system, <br/>
and a tropical depression could form by the weekend while it moves <br/>
westward to west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the central <br/>
tropical Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent. <br/>

...NOAA HURRICANE HUNTERS INDICATE THAT LEE REMAINS A MAJOR
HURRICANE...
...HAZARDOUS SURF AND RIP CURRENT CONDITIONS EXPECTED AT BEACHES
ACROSS THE WESTERN ATLANTIC ALL WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...23.5N 63.5W
ABOUT 365 MI...590 KM N OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 615 MI...985 KM S OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...120 MPH...195 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...948 MB...28.00 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Lee.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lee was located
near latitude 23.5 North, longitude 63.5 West. Lee is moving toward
the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A slow west-northwest to 
northwest motion is expected during the next couple of days, 
followed by turn toward the north by midweek. On the forecast track,
Lee is expected to pass near, but to the west, of Bermuda in a few 
days.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher
gusts. Lee is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Some strengthening is forecast over the next
day or so, followed by gradual weakening.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 75 miles (120 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185
miles (295 km).
 
The minimum central pressure based on data from the NOAA 
Hurricane Hunters is 948 mb (28.00 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Lee can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser
Antilles, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, and Bermuda.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Dangerous surf and rip currents have begun to
affect portions of the southeastern U.S. coast, and these conditions
are forecast to spread northward along much of the U.S. East Coast
during the next couple of days. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Lee Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132023
1100 AM AST Mon Sep 11 2023
 
Lee has been holding steady in strength this morning.  The NOAA 
Hurricane Hunters have been investigating Lee and found that the 
minimum pressure was around 948 mb while a combination of the 
measured flight-level and SFMR winds support holding the initial 
intensity at 105 kt.  The aircraft data have also shown a clear 
indication of concentric eyewalls, which will likely cause 
fluctuations, both up and down, in Lee's intensity over the next day 
or two.

The major hurricane is moving slowly toward the northwest at about 
7 kt.  A continued slow motion between west-northwest and northwest 
is expected during the next couple of days as Lee continues to be 
steered by a mid-level high to its north-northeast. Around the 
middle of the week, the ridge is expected to shift eastward as a 
mid- to upper-level trough amplifies over the eastern U.S.  This 
pattern change should cause Lee to turn northward with an increase 
in forward speed.  The models have generally changed little this 
cycle, and only small changes were made to the previous NHC track 
forecast.  Lee is likely to pass near, but to the west of Bermuda, 
late Thursday and Friday and be situated offshore of the 
mid-Atlantic states and New England by the end of the forecast 
period. 

As mentioned above, fluctuations in strength are likely in the 
short term due to eyewall replacement cycles, but there is an 
opportunity for some strengthening during that time since the 
system is expected to remain over very warm waters and in 
relatively low wind shear conditions.  Beyond a couple of days, 
however, progressively cooler waters and a notable increase in 
shear should cause Lee to gradually weaken.  Although the weakening 
is forecast later in the week, Lee is expected to significantly 
increase in size and hazards will extend well away from the center 
of the storm by the end of the forecast period. 


KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents will affect
portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto
Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, 
Bermuda, and most of the U.S East Coast through much of the week.
 
2. Lee could bring strong winds, rainfall, and high surf impacts to
Bermuda later this week. Interests there should monitor the latest
forecasts.
 
3. It remains too soon to know what level of additional impacts Lee 
might have along the Northeast U.S. coast and Atlantic Canada late 
this week and this weekend, however, wind and rainfall hazards will 
likely extend well away from the center as Lee grows in size. Users 
should continue to monitor updates to the forecast of Lee during the 
next several days.

Tropical Storm Margot Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142023
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM GMT Mon Sep 11 2023

Satellite images indicate that Margot is strengthening. A ragged 
eye has emerged from the central dense overcast pattern, although 
it is open on the east side.  Additionally, overnight microwave 
data showed the eye pattern on numerous passes, suggesting this is 
a real eye feature.  With the improvement in the satellite 
presentation, the initial wind speed is set to 60 kt, closest to 
the D-MINT intensity estimate from UW-CIMSS, but below recent 
Dvorak DT estimates of 65 kt. 

Margot is moving northward at about 9 kt, and that general motion 
should continue for the next few days, with a north-northwest bend 
expected by midweek as ridging builds to the east of the storm.  A 
large mid-latitude ridge is forecast to block Margot's path after 
that time, causing the cyclone to basically stall by the weekend.  
Guidance is in very good agreement for the first few days, then the 
uncertainty grows in unsteady steering currents beneath the ridge, 
with aids fanning out in all directions.  The new forecast is 
similar to the previous one, showing little motion at days 4-5 as a 
compromise between the various divergent model solutions.

The storm has a chance to strengthen further over the next couple 
of days while it moves over relatively warm waters up to 28 deg C 
and in lessening shear.  In a few days, an increase in shear and 
dry-air entrainment should gradually weaken Margot.  This is an 
interesting forecast because the dynamical model guidance is well 
below the statistical guidance, despite a seemingly conducive 
environment for intensification.  The new NHC forecast leans 
closer to the statistical models, adjusted a bit higher than the 
last NHC intensity prediction, similar to the Florida State 
Superensemble and NOAA corrected-consensus models.
