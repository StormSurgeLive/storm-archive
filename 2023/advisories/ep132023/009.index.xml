<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Kenneth, located a little more than 1000 miles west-southwest <br/>
of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Central East Pacific:<br/>
A low pressure trough located several hundred miles south-southwest <br/>
of the southwestern coast of Mexico is producing a broad area of <br/>
showers and thunderstorms.  Gradual development of this system is <br/>
possible over the next several days, and a tropical depression could <br/>
form by late this weekend or early next week while it moves <br/>
generally westward across the central and western part of the <br/>
eastern Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Kenneth Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP132023
800 AM PDT Thu Sep 21 2023
 
Microwave and proxy-visible satellite images of Kenneth indicate the 
center lies to the southwest of a small area of deep convection. 
This is likely the result of increasing southwesterly deep-layer 
shear over the tropical cyclone. These data supported a relocation 
of the center slightly to the southeast of the previous estimates. 
With the center becoming exposed, the objective and subjective 
satellite intensity estimates continue to decrease. Thus, the 
initial intensity is lowered to 40 kt for this advisory.  
 
Kenneth is moving northwestward (320/7 kt) between a mid- to 
upper-level low to the northwest and a subtropical ridge over 
Mexico. The track guidance continues to support a turn toward the 
north-northwest and north during the next day or so. Once again, the 
NHC forecast update has been adjusted slightly to the right in 
agreement with the latest track consensus aids. Environmental 
conditions are expected to become increasingly hostile as Kenneth 
encounters stronger shear, drier air, and cooler SSTs along its 
path. This will make it difficult for Kenneth to sustain organized 
convection, and this forecast shows post-tropical/remnant low status 
in 36 h based on the latest GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite 
imagery. The remnant low is forecast to open into a trough by early 
Sunday.
