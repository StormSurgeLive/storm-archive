<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Kenneth, located about 1100 miles west-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Central East Pacific:<br/>
A trough of low pressure located several hundred miles south of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula is producing a broad <br/>
area of showers and thunderstorms.  Gradual development of this <br/>
system is possible over the next several days, and a tropical <br/>
depression could form by late this weekend or early next week while <br/>
it moves generally westward across the central and western part of <br/>
the eastern Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Kenneth Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP132023
800 PM PDT Thu Sep 21 2023
 
Kenneth is barely clinging to tropical cyclone status.  Satellite 
imagery shows an exposed low-level center with a small burst of deep 
convection displaced over 100 miles to its north.  The intensity is 
held at 35 kt, closest to the latest TAFB Dvorak estimate.
 
The tropical storm is still moving to the north-northwest at 6 kt.  
Track guidance suggests Nigel should turn northward soon in the flow 
around a high pressure system centered over central Mexico.  The 
latest official track forecast is similar to the previous advisory 
prediction.  Atmospheric and oceanic conditions are expected to 
remain hostile and therefore, Nigel should gradually weaken.  Global 
model simulate satellite imagery indicates there could be occasional 
bursts of convection near the center, but the system is still 
forecast to become a post-tropical remnant low in a day or so.
