Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 PM PDT Wed Sep 20 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Kenneth, located a little more than 1000 miles west-southwest <br/>
of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Western East Pacific (EP96):<br/>
An area of low pressure located about 1200 miles east-southeast of <br/>
the Hawaiian Islands continues to produce disorganized shower <br/>
activity.  Some gradual development of this system is possible <br/>
during the next few days before environmental conditions become less <br/>
favorable.  The low is beginning to move into the Central Pacific <br/>
basin and future information on this system can be found in <br/>
Tropical Weather Outlooks issued by the Central Pacific Hurricane <br/>
Center.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Central East Pacific:<br/>
A trough of low pressure located several hundred miles south of the <br/>
southwestern coast of Mexico is producing disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms.  Gradual development of this system is possible over <br/>
the next several days, and a tropical depression could form by early <br/>
next week while it moves westward across the central and western <br/>
part of the eastern Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>

Tropical Storm Kenneth Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP132023
200 AM PDT Thu Sep 21 2023
 
Infrared satellite images indicate that deep convection associated
with Kenneth has been decreasing in intensity during the past
several hours, and accordingly, some of the Dvorak estimates have
been coming down.  The initial intensity is held at 45 kt, which is
still near a blend of all of the satellite intensity estimates.
 
Dry air is beginning to wrap into the western portion of the
circulation, and that stable air combined with a significant
increase in southwesterly vertical wind shear will likely cause
deep convection to strip away from the low-level center and result
in weakening that should commence later today.  Kenneth is expected
to degenerate into a remnant low in 36 to 48 hours, when it is
forecast to be over sub 26 degree C waters and in an environment of
more than 30 kt of wind shear.  The remnant low is now expected to
open into a trough by 72 hours, following most of the models.
 
Kenneth is moving northwestward at 9 kt in the flow between a mid-
to upper-level low to its northwest and a subtropical ridge
situated over central Mexico.  A turn to the north-northwest and
then the north is expected later today and early Friday as Kenneth
continues to move in the flow between the aforementioned features.
The new forecast is shifted a little to the right to be closer to
the GFS and ECMWF models, which are in good agreement.
