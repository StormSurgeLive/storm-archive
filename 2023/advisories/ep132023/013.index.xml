NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 AM PDT Fri Sep 22 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Kenneth, located about 1000 miles west of the southern tip of <br/>
the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Central East Pacific:<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a broad area of low <br/>
pressure located several hundred miles south of the southern tip of <br/>
the Baja California peninsula are beginning to show signs of <br/>
organization. Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive <br/>
for further development of this disturbance during the next several <br/>
days. A tropical depression is likely to form over the weekend or <br/>
early next week while the system moves generally westward across the <br/>
central and western parts of the eastern Pacific basin.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

Post-Tropical Cyclone Kenneth Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP132023
800 AM PDT Fri Sep 22 2023
 
Kenneth no longer has organized deep convection. First light visible 
imagery shows that Kenneth's circulation is no longer well defined. 
It is also located in an environment with high deep-layer shear, dry 
air, and cool SSTs. For these reasons, Kenneth has become a 
post-tropical remnant low. The 30-kt intensity estimate is based on 
overnight ASCAT data, but it is possible the winds have decreased 
further since then.

Kenneth is moving generally northward and should continue moving 
northward while weakening until it dissipates. This is the last NHC 
advisory. For additional information on the remnant low please see 
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under 
AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php.
