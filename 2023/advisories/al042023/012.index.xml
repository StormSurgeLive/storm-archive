Remnants Of Bret Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032023
500 PM EDT Sat Jun 24 2023
 
Satellite images, surface observations, and ASCAT data from a few 
hours ago indicate that Bret no longer has a well-defined low-level 
center.  The structure of the system more resembles an open wave or 
trough with a couple of embedded vorticity maximums.  Therefore, the 
system does not meet the criteria needed to be considered a tropical 
cyclone, and this is last advisory issued by NHC.  

The remnants of Bret are still producing 35-kt winds in areas of 
showers and thunderstorms just north of the northeastern portion of 
Colombia.  These winds are expected to decay as the system continues 
to move quickly westward.

This is the last advisory on Bret.  However, additional and future 
information on this system can be found in High Seas Forecasts 
issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header 
NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php

SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.8N 54.7W
ABOUT 465 MI...750 KM ENE OF THE LESSER ANTILLES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H

MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1005 MB...29.68 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Cindy was 
located near latitude 17.8 North, longitude 54.7 West. Cindy is 
moving quickly toward the northwest near 21 mph (33 km/h) and this 
motion is expected to continue, with a gradual slowdown. On the 
forecast track, Cindy should pass well to the northeast of the 
northernmost Leeward Islands. 
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Weakening is forecast over the next several days, and Cindy 
could degenerate into a trough of low pressure by the middle portion 
of this week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure recently measured by the Air Force 
Reserve Hurricane Hunters is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).

Tropical Storm Cindy Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042023
500 PM AST Sat Jun 24 2023

The satellite presentation of Cindy this afternoon is fairly 
unimpressive, with an exposed low-level swirl ejecting quickly 
northwestward away from the pulsing convection present to its east. 
Earlier, an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance mission measured 
Cindy's surface pressure, which was higher than estimated earlier, 
at 1005 mb. However, the fast motion of the storm this afternoon has 
still enabled strong winds to exist on the east side of the 
circulation. The aircraft found peak 850-mb flight-level winds of 59 
kt, with the highest SFMR obs up to 50 kt. Thus, despite the rather 
disheveled appearance , Cindy remains a 50-kt tropical storm for 
this advisory. However, most of these winds are concentrated in the 
northeast quadrant, with much lighter winds on its western side. 

Aircraft fixes indicate that the tropical storm is still moving 
quickly to the northwest, estimated at 310/18 kt. This quick 
northwestward motion is forecast to continue for the next 12-18 h, 
though the track model guidance suggest the system should slow down 
its forward motion thereafter. There continues to be large 
divergence in the track guidance after about 24 hours, with the GFS, 
HWRF, and HAFS guidance on the east side of the track envelope 
(related to some degree of center reformation or relocation to the 
northeast), with the CMC, ECMWF, & COAMPS-TC on the west side. The 
NHC track forecast ops to continue taking a blend between the ECMWF 
and TVCA consensus aid. Cindy should pass well northeast of the 
northernmost Leeward Islands tomorrow into Monday. 

Even though Cindy remains a 50-kt tropical storm, this is as much of 
a reflection of its quick forward motion than its current 
organization, which has gone downhill this afternoon, supported by 
the higher central pressure measured by aircraft observations. 
Vertical wind shear is forecast to quickly increase to around 30-kt 
over the next day or so, and that combined with a fairly dry 
mid-level environment should result in weakening over the next 
several days. Given the fragile nature of Cindy's circulation 
currently, it seems likely the tropical cyclone will succumb to the 
unfavorable environment. In fact, the latest ECMWF forecast shows 
the tropical cyclone opening up into a trough as soon as in the next 
48 hours. While the latest NHC intensity forecast does not show 
dissipation quite that soon, it has been moved up to 72-h in best 
agreement with the latest ECMWF and CMC solutions. It should be 
noted, however, that there remains a significant portion of the 
guidance that, even if Cindy dissipates, could attempt to 
regenerate by the end of the forecast period as the shear lowers.  
However, that is not reflected in the NHC intensity forecast at this 
time.
