DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the remnants of Cindy were located near
latitude 22.8 North, longitude 60.0 West. The remnants are moving
toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h) and a northwestward 
motion with a gradual decrease in forward speed is expected during 
the next day or so.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast, and winds should drop below tropical-storm 
force later tonight.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
to the northeast of the remnants of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1011 mb (29.86 inches).

<title>Remnants of Cindy Forecast Discussion Number 16</title>

Remnants Of Cindy Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042023
1100 PM AST Sun Jun 25 2023

Satellite imagery this evening shows that the low-cloud swirl 
associated with Cindy has again become void of deep convection.  In 
addition, imagery animation and scatterometer data indicates that 
the system no longer has a closed circulation.  Thus, the cyclone 
has degenerated to a tropical wave or trough and this will be the 
last advisory.  The initial intensity is set to 35 kt based on the 
scatterometer data and satellite intensity estimates from TAFB and 
SAB, and it is anticipated that the maximum winds will drop below 
tropical-storm force during the next several hours.

The initial motion is 315/12.  The remnants of Cindy should 
continue a general northwestward motion for the next couple of 
days, and then turn northward on the eastern side of a deep-layer 
baroclinic trough over the eastern United States and the western 
Atlantic.

In the short term, there is little chance of any regeneration due 
to continued southwesterly vertical shear.  However, after 48 h or 
so, the shear should diminish, and there is a chance that Cindy 
could regenerate after that time near or north of Bermuda.  
However, the model support for this has decreased over the last 24 
h, and currently there is not enough confidence in regeneration to 
explicitly show it in the forecast.

This is the last advisory on Cindy by the National Hurricane 
Center. Additional information on this system can be found in High 
Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
