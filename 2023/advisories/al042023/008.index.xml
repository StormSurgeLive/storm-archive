Tropical Storm Bret Advisory Number  18

500 PM AST Fri Jun 23 2023
 
...BRET LOSING STRENGTH OVER THE EASTERN CARIBBEAN SEA...
...RAIN AND GUSTY WINDS STILL LINGERING IN THE WINDWARD ISLANDS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...13.1N 66.6W
ABOUT 170 MI...275 KM ENE OF CURACAO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 270 DEGREES AT 21 MPH...33 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1004 MB...29.65 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests the ABC Islands should monitor the progress of Bret.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bret was
located near latitude 13.1 North, longitude 66.6 West. Bret is
moving toward the west near 21 mph (33 km/h) and this general
motion is expected to continue through the weekend.  On the forecast
track, the center of Bret will continue to move across the eastern 
and central Caribbean Sea north of the ABC Islands during the next 
couple of days.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Weakening is forecast during the next couple of 
days, and Bret is expected to dissipate over the central Caribbean 
Sea by Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
north of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Rainfall associated with Bret is expected to continue to
diminish across the Lesser Antilles  this evening as the storm moves
westward across the eastern to central Caribbean.  Additional
rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are possible across southern
portions of the  Lesser Antilles from St Lucia, south to Grenada.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Bret are expected to gradually subside
along the Lesser Antilles through the day.  Swells are likely
to increase in areas adjacent to the central Caribbean Sea
through Saturday.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Tropical Storm Bret Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032023
500 PM AST Fri Jun 23 2023
 
The intensity of Bret is decreasing as the system moves across the
eastern Caribbean Sea.  The low-level center is now fully exposed
and deep convection is minimal.  However, there is a relatively
large area of showers well to the east of the center that is
lingering over portions of the Lesser Antilles.  An ASCAT pass from
earlier today showed peak winds between 40-45 kt, and the initial
intensity is lowered to 45 kt for this advisory.  This estimate is
also in agreement with a Dvorak classification from TAFB.

Bret is currently experiencing about 20 kt of vertical wind shear, 
and since the shear is anticipated to increase, continued weakening 
is expected.  All of the models show a steady decline in Bret's 
strength, and the new forecast is similar to the previous one.  
Dissipation is expected to occur on Sunday.
 
The tropical storm continues to move quickly westward at 17 kt on 
the south side of a low- to mid-level ridge.  This motion should 
continue during the next couple of days taking Bret across the 
eastern and central Caribbean Sea just north of the ABC Islands.  
The NHC track forecast is again a touch to the south of the previous 
one and remains on the fast side of the model guidance.

<title>Tropical Storm Cindy Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Tropical Storm Cindy Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042023
500 PM AST Fri Jun 23 2023

Since the previous advisory, the convective structure of Cindy has 
become more anemic, with the earlier banding structure degrading 
into more scattered convection distributed around the low-level 
circulation. It is possible some nearby dry air has been entrained 
into the circulation, limiting more organized convection this 
afternoon. The lackluster convective structure was also observed on 
a recent 1852 UTC SSMIS pass. Dvorak T-numbers have either held 
steady or decreased slightly, and the initial intensity will remain 
45 kt for this advisory. 

While the shear has not yet increased over Cindy and sea surface 
temperatures underneath remain sufficently warm, the apparent 
dry-air entrainment might be a limiting factor on more robust 
intensification in the short term. After 24 h, Cindy is forecast to 
encounter higher shear from the northwest which should induce a 
weakening trend. The intensity guidance is a bit lower than the 
previous cycle, and the NHC forecast also shows a slightly lower 
peak intensity than earlier. Under continued shear from an 
upper-level trough, Cindy is still forecast to become a remnant low 
and dissipate by the end of the forecast period. However, one thing 
worth mentioning beyond the forecast period is that some of the 
guidance (most notably the GFS) shows the possibility of Cindy 
regenerating near Bermuda, though that is beyond the scope of the 
current forecast.

Cindy continues to move to the west-northwest, perhaps a bit more 
poleward than before at 295/14 kt. Not much has changed with the 
forecast track philosophy with a similar west-northwestward motion 
expected to continue as the system is steered by a low- to mid-level 
ridge to its east-northeast. As the system weakens, it is more 
likely to be steered by the low-level ridging which should maintain 
this motion through the end of the forecast period. The track 
guidance made another small shift to the northeast, and the latest 
NHC track forecast was similarly adjusted a bit in that direction, 
but remains notably on the south side of the guidance envelope, 
fairly close to the latest ECMWF forecast. This track forecast 
remains well to the northeast of the northern Leeward Islands.
