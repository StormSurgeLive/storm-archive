DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Bret was
located near latitude 13.8 North, longitude 57.7 West.  Bret is
moving toward the west near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this general
motion with an increase in forward speed is expected during the next
few days.  On the forecast track, the center of Bret is expected to
move across the Lesser Antilles this evening and tonight, and then 
move westward across the eastern and central Caribbean Sea Friday 
and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast today while Bret
approaches the Lesser Antilles.  Weakening is anticipated to begin
tonight or Friday after Bret passes the Lesser Antilles, and the
system is likely to dissipate over the central Caribbean Sea by
Saturday night or early Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Bret can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3, WMO header WTNT43 KNHC and
on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area
this evening or tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are expected
within the tropical storm warning areas and possible within the
watch areas later today and tonight.
 
RAINFALL:  Storm total rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches with
maximum amounts of 10 inches are possible across portions of the
Lesser Antilles from Guadeloupe south to St Vincent and the
Grenadines, including Barbados.  The heavy rainfall could lead to
flash flooding, especially across areas of higher terrain. Urban
flooding is also possible.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Bret are expected to affect portions of
the Lesser Antilles through Friday.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Bret Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL032023
1100 AM AST Thu Jun 22 2023
 
Bret is nearing the Lesser Antilles and remains close to hurricane 
strength.  The Air Force Hurricane Hunters have been investigating 
the storm this morning and found winds to support maintaining the 
initial intensity at 60 kt.  Bret remains very titled in the 
vertical, with the low-level center located near the southwestern 
edge of the main area of deep convection.  The aircraft found the 
strongest winds on the north side of the circulation, with generally 
light winds on the southwest side of Bret.
 
The tropical storm continues to move westward at 12 kt on the south 
side of a subtropical ridge.  Since the ridge is expected to remain 
in place, Bret should continue its westward motion but at a faster 
pace.  This should take the storm across the Lesser Antilles this 
evening and overnight and then across the eastern and central 
Caribbean Sea Friday and Saturday.  Although the models are in fair 
agreement, there is some spread in the forward speed among the model 
solutions.  The NHC track forecast is similar to the previous one 
and remains on the fast side of the guidance envelope, in best 
agreement with the GFS and ECMWF models.
 
Bret is expected to maintain its intensity when it moves across the 
Lesser Antilles tonight.  However, weakening should begin shortly 
after that due to a pronounced increase in westerly shear and dry 
air intrusions.  The NHC intensity forecast is the same as the 
previous one and in line with the HCCA and IVCN solutions.  Bret is 
still expected to degenerate into an open wave Saturday night or 
early Sunday before reaching the western Caribbean Sea.
 
There is a risk of strong winds and heavy rainfall for several 
islands within the Lesser Antilles regardless of exactly where the 
center crosses the island chain.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Bret is forecast to move across the Lesser Antilles this evening
and tonight as a strong tropical storm.
 
2. A Hurricane Watch and a Tropical Storm Warning are in effect
for St. Lucia, and a Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for
Martinique and Dominica.  There is a risk of flooding from heavy
rainfall, strong winds, and dangerous waves along the coast within
the warning area.  A Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect for
Barbados and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  Additional watches or
warnings are possible for some islands in the Lesser Antilles later
today.

expected to remain well east of the northern Leeward Islands 
through early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast during the few days, and the 
depression is expected to become a tropical storm soon.  A 
weakening trend is forecast to commence over the weekend.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).

Tropical Depression Four Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL042023
1100 AM AST Thu Jun 22 2023
 
This morning's satellite presentation consists of a sheared cloud
pattern with the center of an elongated surface circulation located 
near the northeastern edge of the deep convective mass.  Multiple 
low cloud swirls have emerged from the convection about 50 nm 
east-southeast of the previously noted primary surface center.  A 
recent METOP-A/B scatterometer pass showed the strongest winds 
(30-32 kt) situated over the northeast quadrant.  Therefore, the 
initial intensity is held at 30 kt for this advisory.
 
The depression is expected to remain in marginally favorable
atmospheric conditions and over warmer-than-normal oceanic 
temperatures during the next 3 days.  Through the remainder 
of the forecast, vertical shear is forecast to increase
significantly as the depression approaches a deep-layer
mid-Atlantic trough extending from the central Atlantic to the 
Greater Antilles.  Accordingly, a weakening trend should be 
underway by 72 hours.  The official intensity forecast is an update 
of the first advisory and consists of a blend of the consensus and 
deterministic models beyond day 3.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be 285/13 kt and a
west-northwestward motion with a gradual increase in forward speed 
is forecast during the next 4 days.  Near the end of the period, a 
northwestward motion is expected as the depression rounds the 
southwestern periphery of a deep-layer subtropical ridge and enters 
a growing weakness over the western Atlantic.  The NHC forecast 
reflects no significant change from the previous one and is based 
on the tightly clustered, highly reliable multi-model consensus 
aids.
