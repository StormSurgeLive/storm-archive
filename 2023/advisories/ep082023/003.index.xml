<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Fernanda, located several hundred miles southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula. The National Hurricane Center <br/>
has issued its last advisory on Tropical Storm Greg, which has <br/>
moved into the central Pacific Basin. Future advisories on Greg <br/>
will be issued by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center.<br/>
<br/>
Off the Coast of Southern Mexico:<br/>
A tropical wave continues to produce a broad area of disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms off the southern coasts of Mexico, <br/>
Guatemala, and El Salvador. Environmental conditions appear <br/>
conducive for development, and a tropical depression is expected to <br/>
form within the next few days, while the system moves <br/>
west-northwestward, roughly parallel to the coast of southern and <br/>
southwestern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
Future information on Greg can be found in Public Advisories issued <br/>

Hurricane Fernanda Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072023
1100 PM HST Sun Aug 13 2023
 
Fernanda continues to rapidly intensify this evening. The
well-defined eye has warmed and continues to be surrounded by a
solid core of cold cloud tops around -70C. Microwave imagery from
earlier this evening showed a thick closed eyewall and a well
defined structure. Satellite intensity estimates have continued to
increase this evening as well, with subjective estimates from TAFB
and SAB T5.5/T6.0, respectively. CIMMS ADT/AiDT objective satellite
estimates are in a similar range. Using a blend of these estimates
the initial intensity for this advisory is set at 110 kt.
 
The hurricane continues to move generally westward to
west-northwestward at 280/7 kt.  Fernanda is being steered by a weak
mid-level ridge with a generally west to west-northwest motion
expected throughout the period. As the ridge begins to re-strengthen
in the next day or so, the hurricane will begin to move faster, 
with a gradually accelerating forward speed over the next several 
days. The official track forecast is quite similar to the prior 
one, with just a slight adjustment northward in the short term.
 
Fernanda is now a major hurricane and is in an environment that will 
continue to allow for further intensification.  Vertical wind shear 
is forecast to remain under 10 kt and with warm sea surface 
temperatures. Thereafter, Fernanda will move into an increasingly 
dry and stable environment, with mid-level relative humidity levels 
dropping below 40 percent in about 48 hrs. This will occur at the 
same time the SSTs also begin to drop off along the forecast track. 
These factors should lead to initially gradual, and then more rapid 
weakening. The latest NHC intensity forecast is above most of the 
guidance over the next 24 hours, but is closer to the consensus aids 
in days 2-4. However, there is some guidance that show an even 
faster decay than what is currently forecast, with the system 
becoming void of convection due to the very dry airmass.
