Hurricane Fernanda Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072023
1100 PM HST Sun Aug 13 2023
 
Fernanda continues to rapidly intensify this evening. The
well-defined eye has warmed and continues to be surrounded by a
solid core of cold cloud tops around -70C. Microwave imagery from
earlier this evening showed a thick closed eyewall and a well
defined structure. Satellite intensity estimates have continued to
increase this evening as well, with subjective estimates from TAFB
and SAB T5.5/T6.0, respectively. CIMMS ADT/AiDT objective satellite
estimates are in a similar range. Using a blend of these estimates
the initial intensity for this advisory is set at 110 kt.
 
The hurricane continues to move generally westward to
west-northwestward at 280/7 kt.  Fernanda is being steered by a weak
mid-level ridge with a generally west to west-northwest motion
expected throughout the period. As the ridge begins to re-strengthen
in the next day or so, the hurricane will begin to move faster, 
with a gradually accelerating forward speed over the next several 
days. The official track forecast is quite similar to the prior 
one, with just a slight adjustment northward in the short term.
 
Fernanda is now a major hurricane and is in an environment that will 
continue to allow for further intensification.  Vertical wind shear 
is forecast to remain under 10 kt and with warm sea surface 
temperatures. Thereafter, Fernanda will move into an increasingly 
dry and stable environment, with mid-level relative humidity levels 
dropping below 40 percent in about 48 hrs. This will occur at the 
same time the SSTs also begin to drop off along the forecast track. 
These factors should lead to initially gradual, and then more rapid 
weakening. The latest NHC intensity forecast is above most of the 
guidance over the next 24 hours, but is closer to the consensus aids 
in days 2-4. However, there is some guidance that show an even 
faster decay than what is currently forecast, with the system 
becoming void of convection due to the very dry airmass.

Tropical Storm Greg Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082023
1100 PM HST Sun Aug 13 2023
 
After the release of the previous advisory a burst of deep
convection developed closer to the center of the cyclone.  However, 
easterly shear has caused the area of convection to propagate 
westward away from the center, leaving it exposed.  Recently 
arriving ASCAT overpasses show that the depression has 
strengthened into a tropical storm. Both ASCAT-B and ASCAT-C 
revealed peak winds of 34-35 kt to the north-northwest of the 
center. 
 
Greg is moving westward or 275 degrees at 11 kt. A narrow
mid-level ridge to the north of the cyclone should continue to
steer it westward to west-northwestward during the next 2 to 3 days.
After that time, the tropical storm is forecast to gradually 
weaken and come under the influence of the low-level trade wind 
flow.  That should cause the cyclone to turn westward or 
west-southwestward late in the period.  The track model envelope 
shifted southward this cycle so the NHC forecast was adjusted 
accordingly.  The new forecast track is near the HFIP corrected 
consensus aid, but it is not as far south as the typically reliable 
GFS and ECMWF models.
 
The tropical storm is located over SSTs of around 28 degrees 
Celsius, but within an area of light to moderate easterly shear. 
These conditions are expected to allow for some modest 
strengthening during the next couple of days.   After that time, 
slightly cool waters, the continuation of easterly shear, and a 
drier mid-level air mass are likely to cause gradual weakening.  
Much of the intensity guidance predict a lower peak intensity 
this cycle, and the official forecast has been adjusted 
slightly downward.  It should be noted that the ECMWF and GFS show 
the system degenerating into a trough of low pressure by day 5.  
This scenario is certainly possible, but not reflected in the 
latest official forecast.
 
The depression will cross into the central Pacific basin by 1200
UTC today.  Therefore, the next advisory on this system will be
issued by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center at 1500 UTC or
500 AM HST.  Information about this system will continue to be
available on the web at hurricanes.gov
