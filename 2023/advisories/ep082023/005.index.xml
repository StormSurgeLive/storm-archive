500 PM PDT Mon Aug 14 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Fernanda, located several hundred miles southwest of the southern <br/>
tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Off the Coast of Southern and Southwestern Mexico (EP90):<br/>
A broad area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave is <br/>
producing widespread showers and thunderstorms off the southern <br/>
coasts of Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Environmental <br/>
conditions appear conducive for development, and a tropical <br/>
depression is expected to form within the next two to three days, <br/>
while the system moves west-northwestward, roughly parallel to the <br/>
coast of southern and southwestern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Central America and Southern Mexico:<br/>
Another area of low pressure could form south of the Gulf of <br/>
Tehuantepec over the weekend. Some gradual development of this <br/>
system is possible thereafter while it moves generally westward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Fernanda Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072023
500 PM HST Mon Aug 14 2023
 
This evening, Fernanda's inner-core structure is beginning to show 
signs of decay, with its well-defined eye becoming cloud filled on 
both visible and infrared satellite images. Earlier, a 2144 UTC 
AMSR2 microwave pass suggested the hurricane might be undergoing an 
eyewall replacement cycle, which could be partially responsible for 
its recent structural degradation. 0000 UTC subjective Dvorak 
intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were 115 kt and 102 kt, 
respectively. Objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS have 
either leveled off or have begun to decline, with the most recent 
D-MINT estimate at 107 kt associated with the aforementioned AMSR2 
pass above. The initial intensity has been lowered to 105 kt this 
advisory given the continued decline since that time.
 
Fernanda has been moving a bit more poleward over the last 6 to 12
hours, with the latest estimated motion at 290/8 kt. The mid-level
ridging has been taking its time building back in to the north over
the past 24 hours, but is still forecast to do so over the next few
days, leading to Fernanda gradually accelerating to the
west-northwest. Beyond 48 hours, a weakening Fernanda should quickly
become more vertically shallow, resulting in the cyclone turning
more westward as it comes under the influence of the more extensive
North Pacific low-level subtropical ridge. The official forecast
continues to be very close to the prior forecast, other than a
short-term nudge further north given the initial motion. This track
remains close to both the simple and corrected consensus model
guidance.
 
In addition to a possible eyewall replacement cycle, Fernanda might
also be feeling the effects of some higher (15-20 kt) mid-level
vertical wind shear out of the south. Very dry mid-level
environmental air could also be attempting to wrap around the
southwest quadrant of the cyclone. Given these factors, it now seems
more likely Fernanda will continue weakening in the short-term, with
the rate of weakening increasing after it crosses the 26-C isotherm
in about 24-36 hours. Both the global and regional-hurricane models
now show Fernanda losing its organized convection in about 3 days,
with the latest NHC intensity forecast showing the system becoming a
post-tropical remnant low at that time.
