Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 AM PDT Wed Aug 16 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Fernanda, located about 1100 miles west-southwest of the <br/>
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Off the Coast of Southwestern Mexico (EP90):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms are continuing to show signs of <br/>
organization in association with a broad area of low pressure <br/>
located several hundred miles south-southeast of Manzanillo, Mexico. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear conducive for continued development, <br/>
and a tropical depression or tropical storm is likely to form within <br/>
the next day or so. The system is expected to move <br/>
west-northwestward to northwestward, roughly parallel to the coast <br/>
of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula during the <br/>
next several days.  Additional information on this system, including <br/>
gale warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the <br/>
National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
South of Central America and Southern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure could form south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec <br/>
over the weekend. Some gradual development of this system is <br/>
possible thereafter while it moves generally west-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>

Hurricane Fernanda Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072023
1100 PM HST Tue Aug 15 2023
 
Fernanda's structure is becoming more ragged and less organized this 
evening, as it moves into a drier and more stable airmass. Infrared 
satellite trends since the previous advisory have drastically 
deteriorated, with convection dissipating, particularly on the 
northern side of the system. Cloud tops have been warming over the 
last few hours as well. Subjective Dvorak final-T estimates were 
lower for this cycle as well with SAB and TAFB at T3.5 and 4.0, 
respectively.  Although, some of the objective intensity estimates 
from UW-CIMSS are still a bit higher.  Using a blend of satellite 
estimates and assuming a lag in the spin down of Fernanda's winds, 
the initial intensity for this advisory is set at 65 kt.

Fernanda continues to weaken, barely holding on to hurricane 
strength. Vertical wind shear continues to effect the system, as 
well as rapidly cooling sea-surface temperatures, and mid-level 
relative humidity levels below 40 percent. This combination will 
continue to cause rapid weakening, and Fernanda is expected to 
become a tropical storm within very soon, and a post-tropical 
cyclone in about 36 h. There is good agreement from global model 
simulated infrared satellite images that the cyclone will be void 
of deep convection in about 36 h.  The remnant low is now expected 
to open up into a trough by day 5.
 
The motion of Fernanda remains generally westward, with a mid-level 
ridge expected to continue to steer the cyclone generally westward 
throughout the forecast period. The track guidance this cycle once 
again shifted a bit south, possibly in response to the storm quickly 
weakening and becoming more steered by the low-level flow. Thus, 
the latest NHC track forecast has been shifted a bit to the south of 
the prior one, but not quite as far as south as the HCCA corrected 
consensus.
