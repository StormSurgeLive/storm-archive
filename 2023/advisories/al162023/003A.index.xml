DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the low pressure system was centered near
latitude 29.7 North, longitude 75.0 West.  The low is moving toward
the north-northeast near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A faster northward or
north-northwestward motion is expected later this morning through 
Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of the low will approach 
the coast of North Carolina through tonight, and then move across 
eastern North Carolina, southeastern Virginia, and the Delmarva 
Peninsula Saturday and Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Additional strengthening is forecast during the next day or so, and 
the low is expected to become a tropical storm before it reaches 
the coast of North Carolina.  Regardless of whether it becomes a 
tropical storm, the system is expected to bring tropical-storm 
conditions to portions of the southeast and mid-Atlantic coasts.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high... 70 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.  

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km)
to the north of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for this system can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Neuse and Bay Rivers...3-5 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...3-5 ft
Chesapeake Bay south of Colonial Beach...2-4 ft
Surf City NC, NC to Chincoteague, VA...2-4 ft
Albemarle Sound...2-4 ft
South Santee River, SC to Surf City NC, NC...1-3 ft
Chincoteague, VA to Manasquan Inlet, NJ...1-3 ft
Upper Chesapeake Bay...1-3 ft
Delaware Bay...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by dangerous
waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the
surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area in North Carolina later this morning, 
and spread northward into Saturday.
 
RAINFALL:  The system is forecast to produce 3 to 5 inches of 
rainfall, with localized amounts of 7 inches, across eastern North 
Carolina into southeast Virginia into Saturday.  Across remaining 
portions of the Mid-Atlantic into southern New England, 2 to 4 
inches of rainfall are forecast from late today into Sunday. This 
rainfall may produce isolated urban and small stream flooding 
impacts.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by this system will be affecting much of
the east coast of the United States through this weekend.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible beginning tonight through 
Saturday for portions of the Mid-Atlantic Coast.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen Forecast Discussion Number 3</title>

WTNT41 KNHC 220252
TCDAT1
 
Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162023
1100 PM EDT Thu Sep 21 2023
 
Nighttime proxy-visible satellite imagery suggests that the center
of the low pressure system off the southeastern U.S. coast has
become better defined this evening.  Nearly all of the associated
deep convection remains oriented in a curved band extending around
the northern and eastern sides of the circulation, although a few
convective elements are beginning to fill in on the back side of
the system as well.  Based on 1-minute wind observations from NOAA
buoy 41002 and ship reports, the initial intensity is raised to 35
kt, with all tropical-storm-force winds currently north of the
center on the north side of an attached warm front.
 
The center does not appear to have moved much since the time it 
became better defined.  Based on previous fixes, the current motion 
is estimated to be north-northeastward (015 degrees) at 3 kt.
The dynamical guidance indicates that the center should begin moving
northward--or re-form to the north--overnight, with a northward or
north-northwestward motion continuing through Sunday morning.  This
forecast track brings the center of the low inland across eastern
North Carolina on Saturday, and then across the southern Chesapeake
Bay and the Delmarva Peninsula Saturday night and Sunday.  Except
for the errant HWRF (which appears too far west), the rest of the
guidance is tightly clustered, and the NHC forecast is near the
middle of the envelope.  This new forecast is a bit east of the
previous prediction, mainly for the portion of the track over land.
 
Baroclinic processes associated with a sharp upper-level trough to
the west of the low are expected induce strengthening, and the NHC
intensity forecast is close to the GFS, ECMWF, and HCCA solutions,
bringing the maximum winds to 50 kt in 24-36 hours before the
center reaches the North Carolina coast.  In addition, simulated
satellite imagery suggests there could be an increase of deep
convection near the low's center by Friday evening, and phase-space
diagrams show the system just barely entering the deep warm core
regime.  Therefore, transition to a tropical cyclone is shown by 24
hours, although there still is some uncertainty on that occurrence
due to frontal boundaries still in the area.  Weakening is forecast
after the center moves onshore, and the system is expected to
become extratropical again by 60 hours.  An official forecast is
only provided out through 72 hours since global model fields
show the low becoming absorbed by the associated frontal boundary
off the New Jersey coast by 96 hours.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Low pressure off the southeastern U.S. coast is producing
tropical-storm-force winds and is forecast to strengthen further
before it reaches the coast of North Carolina on Saturday.  Tropical
storm conditions are expected along portions of the southeastern and
mid-Atlantic U.S. coasts within the Tropical Storm Warning area
beginning on Friday and continuing into Saturday night.
 
2. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation
over portions of eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia,
including Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds, and the lower Chesapeake
Bay, where Storm Surge Warnings are in place.  Residents in these
areas should follow advice given by local officials.
 
3. Heavy rainfall from this system could produce localized urban
and small stream flooding impacts across the eastern mid-Atlantic
states from North Carolina to New Jersey Friday through Sunday.
 
4.  Swells generated by this system will affect much of the U.S.
east coast through the weekend, likely causing life-threatening
surf and rip currents.

Hurricane Nigel Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
300 AM GMT Fri Sep 22 2023

Nigel has not quite completed its transition to a post-tropical 
cyclone.  A burst of deep convection formed near the center a few 
hours ago, and it is therefore still considered a tropical system.  
Based on a partial ASCAT pass and the latest satellite intensity 
estimates, the initial intensity is lowered to 65 kt for this 
advisory.

Cold ocean waters and significant vertical wind shear should cause 
Nigel to weaken further.  The hurricane should become a powerful 
extratropical cyclone within about 12 hours.  As noted previously, 
Nigel continues to grow in size and an expansion of the 34-kt wind
field is expected during the next couple of days.
 
The hurricane is moving east-northeastward at 32 kt.  An east- 
northeastward to northeastward motion along the southeastern side of 
a deep-layer mid-latitude trough is expected during the next day or 
so.  Beyond a day, Nigel should rotate around the eastern side of a 
large extratropical cyclone over the North Atlantic.  The two 
features should merge in about 60 h and the official forecast now 
shows dissipation at the time.  The model guidance remains tightly 
clustered, and the NHC forecast lies near the center of the 
envelope.
