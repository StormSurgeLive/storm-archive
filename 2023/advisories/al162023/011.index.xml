CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
Coastal flood warnings, as well as flood watches and flash flood
warnings, remain in effect for portions of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Ophelia was located near latitude 37.1 North, longitude 77.6 West.
Ophelia is moving toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h).  The 
center of Ophelia is expected to turn toward the north-northeast 
and northeast, moving across eastern Virginia and the Delmarva 
Peninsula through Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next day or so.  
The post-tropical low is expected to become absorbed by a frontal 
boundary Sunday night or early Monday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ophelia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1, WMO header WTNT41 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  Water levels remain elevated within portions of
Chesapeake Bay and its tidal rivers but should gradually recede
overnight and into Sunday.  For information specific to your area,
please see products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office.
 
RAINFALL:  Ophelia is expected to produce the following additional
rainfall through Sunday night:
 
Portions of the Mid-Atlantic from Virginia through New Jersey...1
to 3 inches with isolated higher totals up to 5 inches.
 
Across southeastern New York through southern New England...1 to 3
inches.
 
This rainfall may produce localized flash, urban, and small stream
flooding impacts, particularly across the Mid-Atlantic region from
Virginia to New Jersey. Isolated river flooding is possible in areas
of heavier rainfall.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ophelia will continue to affect much of
the east coast of the United States through the weekend.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on Ophelia.  Future information on this system can be 
found in Public Advisories issued by the Weather Prediction Center 
beginning at 500 AM EDT, under AWIPS header TCPAT1, WMO header 
WTNT31 KWNH, and on the web at www.hurricanes.gov.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Ophelia Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162023
1100 PM EDT Sat Sep 23 2023
 
Ophelia appears to have lost its tropical characteristics.  Surface 
observations show a well-defined wind shift associated with a 
frontal boundary extending across eastern Virginia, and the heaviest 
precipitation is now well north of the center, oriented along and 
to the north of the front.  In addition, phase space diagrams based 
on global model fields indicate that the system has entered the 
asymmetric cold-core regime.  Therefore, Ophelia is being declared a 
post-tropical cyclone.  Surface observations indicate that maximum 
winds have decreased to 30 kt, mainly over the ocean well east of 
the center.

With the last bit of convection having been sheared off to the 
north, the center appears to have slowed down since the last 
advisory, and the current estimate is northward at 360/7 kt.  The 
circulation is expected to turn northeastward on Sunday, but also 
become more diffuse while it moves across eastern Virginia and the 
Delmarva Peninsula.  The NHC forecast now shows the low becoming 
absorbed by the nearby frontal boundary by 36 hours.  Maximum winds 
are likely to remain around 30 kt until dissipation, mainly in 
a band to the north of the front off the coast of Long Island.

This is the last tropical cyclone discussion issued by the National 
Hurricane Center on Ophelia.  Future information on Ophelia can be 
found in discussions issued by the Weather Prediction Center 
beginning at 500 AM EDT, under AWIPS header TCDAT1, WMO header 
WTNT41 KWNH, and on the web at www.hurricanes.gov.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Coastal flooding will continue along portions of Chesapeake Bay 
and its tidal rivers through Sunday.  Refer to statements from your 
local National Weather Service Forecast Office for additional 
information.
 
2. Heavy rainfall from Ophelia may produce localized flash and 
urban flooding impacts across portions of the Mid-Atlantic states 
from Virginia to New Jersey through Sunday.
 
3. Swells generated by Ophelia will affect much of the U.S. east 
coast through the weekend, likely causing life-threatening surf and 
rip currents.

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
500 PM AST Sat Sep 23 2023
 
Overall, the structure of the cyclone hasn't changed significantly 
since this morning. Its low-level center is still displaced west of 
most of the associated deep convection. That said, satellite 
intensity estimates are generally a little higher than they were 
about 6 hours ago, ranging from about 30 to 35 kt. The intensity is 
set at 35 kt, in best agreement with the latest subjective TAFB 
Dvorak estimate and the objective UW-CIMSS DMINT and SATCON, making 
the system Tropical Storm Philippe.
 
Philippe is expected to maintain its general structure for the next 
couple of days, which should prevent it from substantially 
strengthening. While the intensity guidance is generally slightly 
higher than 6 h ago, the dynamical models remain in generally good 
agreement on the intensity forecast for the next few days. Beyond 72 
h, Philippe will approach a mid- to upper-level trough, which could 
result in an increase of both upper-level difluence and deep-layer 
shear. Slight additional intensification is possible at that point, 
but no periods of significant strengthening are expected during the 
next 5 days. The official intensity forecast remains near the IVCN 
and HCCA intensity consensus aids.
 
The tropical storm continues to move westward, near 12 kt. This 
should generally continue for the next couple of days until Philippe 
approaches the aforementioned trough. At that point, as long as the 
tropical storm has strengthened slightly as expected, it should 
begin to turn northwestward, and then northward, influenced by the 
deeper-layer steering flow imparted by the trough. The official 
track forecast has been shifted slightly northeastward and slower 
compared to the previous one, and is close to the latest HCCA 
forecast.
