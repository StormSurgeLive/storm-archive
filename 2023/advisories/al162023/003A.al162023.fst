DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the low pressure system was centered near
latitude 29.7 North, longitude 75.0 West.  The low is moving toward
the north-northeast near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A faster northward or
north-northwestward motion is expected later this morning through 
Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of the low will approach 
the coast of North Carolina through tonight, and then move across 
eastern North Carolina, southeastern Virginia, and the Delmarva 
Peninsula Saturday and Sunday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Additional strengthening is forecast during the next day or so, and 
the low is expected to become a tropical storm before it reaches 
the coast of North Carolina.  Regardless of whether it becomes a 
tropical storm, the system is expected to bring tropical-storm 
conditions to portions of the southeast and mid-Atlantic coasts.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high... 70 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.  

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km)
to the north of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for this system can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Neuse and Bay Rivers...3-5 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...3-5 ft
Chesapeake Bay south of Colonial Beach...2-4 ft
Surf City NC, NC to Chincoteague, VA...2-4 ft
Albemarle Sound...2-4 ft
South Santee River, SC to Surf City NC, NC...1-3 ft
Chincoteague, VA to Manasquan Inlet, NJ...1-3 ft
Upper Chesapeake Bay...1-3 ft
Delaware Bay...1-3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by dangerous
waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the
surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area in North Carolina later this morning, 
and spread northward into Saturday.

RAINFALL:  The system is forecast to produce 3 to 5 inches of 
rainfall, with localized amounts of 7 inches, across eastern North 
Carolina into southeast Virginia into Saturday.  Across remaining 
portions of the Mid-Atlantic into southern New England, 2 to 4 
inches of rainfall are forecast from late today into Sunday. This 
rainfall may produce isolated urban and small stream flooding 
impacts.

SURF:  Swells generated by this system will be affecting much of
the east coast of the United States through this weekend.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible beginning tonight through 
Saturday for portions of the Mid-Atlantic Coast.
