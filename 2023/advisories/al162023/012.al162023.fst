please see products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office.


RAINFALL:  Ophelia is expected to produce the following additional
rainfall through late this coming night:

Portions of the Mid-Atlantic to southern New Englandâ€¦1 to 3 inches

southern New England.  Isolated river flooding is possible in areas
of heavier rainfall.


SURF:  Swells generated by Ophelia will continue to affect much of
the east coast of the United States through today.  These swells are
