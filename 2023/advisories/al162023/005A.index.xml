DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ophelia was 
located near latitude 32.7 North, longitude 76.0 West. Ophelia is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). This 
general motion is expected to continue during the next day or so, 
followed by a slight turn toward the north. On the forecast track, 
the center of Ophelia will approach the coast of North Carolina 
tonight, and then move across eastern North Carolina, southeastern 
Virginia, and the Delmarva Peninsula Saturday and Sunday.
 
Data from the Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters and satellite wind 
data indicate that maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 
mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. Some slight strengthening is 
possible before landfall along the coast of North Carolina.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275 miles (445 km) 
from the center. NOAA buoy 41025 at Diamond Shoals, North Carolina, 
recently reported a sustained wind of 47 mph (76 km/h) and a gust of 
60 mph (97 km/h). A NOAA C-MAN station at Cape Lookout, North 
Carolina, recently reported a sustained wind of 45 mph (72 km/h) and 
a gust of 52 mph (83 km/h).  
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.29 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ophelia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1, WMO header WTNT41 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Neuse and Bay Rivers...3-5 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...3-5 ft
Chesapeake Bay south of Colonial Beach...2-4 ft
Surf City, NC to Chincoteague, VA...2-4 ft
Albemarle Sound...2-4 ft
South Santee River, SC to Surf City, NC...1-3 ft
Chincoteague, VA to Manasquan Inlet, NJ...1-3 ft
Upper Chesapeake Bay...1-3 ft
Delaware Bay...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by dangerous
waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the
surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are affecting portions of the North 
Carolina coast within the warning area and will continue spreading 
northward through Saturday.
 
RAINFALL:  Ophelia is forecast to produce 3 to 5 inches of rainfall, 
with localized amounts of 7 inches across portions of eastern North 
Carolina and southeast Virginia from today into Saturday. Across 
remaining portions of the Mid-Atlantic into southern New England, 2 
to 4 inches of rainfall are forecast from later today into Sunday.  
This rainfall may produce flash, urban, and small stream flooding 
impacts.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ophelia will affect much of the east
coast of the United States through this weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible beginning tonight through
Saturday for portions of the mid-Atlantic Coast.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 500 PM EDT.

Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162023
1100 AM EDT Fri Sep 22 2023
 
Surface observations indicate the low pressure system off the 
southeast U.S. coast is deepening this morning. Recent pressure and 
wind data from NOAA buoy 41002 suggest the pressure has fallen to 
around 996 mb. While surface analyses indicate there is still a 
front in close proximity to the low, deep convection has become more 
concentrated to the north of the center. In fact, GOES-16 1-min 
visible imagery suggests the low-level center is re-forming closer 
to the convection. The broad wind field is asymmetric, with the 
strongest observed winds occurring to the north and west of the 
frontal feature. A NOAA Saildrone sampling the system reported a 
sustained wind of 40 kt and a gust around 50 kt earlier this 
morning. Based on the available observations, the initial intensity 
is held at 45 kt. An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 
scheduled to investigate the system this afternoon.

The initial motion of the cyclone is just west of due north (350/10 
kt). The system is forecast to move north-northwestward to northward 
through Saturday along the west side of a subtropical ridge over the 
western and central Atlantic. This motion will take the center of 
the cyclone inland over eastern North Carolina on Saturday morning 
and over the Mid-Atlantic region Saturday night and Sunday. The 
track guidance is in good agreement for this forecast. Based on the 
slight northward adjustment to the initial position, the updated NHC 
forecast is slightly faster than the previous one, showing the 
cyclone center just inland in 24 h.

Based on recent satellite and observational trends, the cyclone 
appears likely to strengthen during the next 12 h over the warm Gulf 
Stream waters. The more organized convective structure should also 
facilitate its transition to a tropical storm during the next 6-12 h 
as it starts to become separated from its frontal features and 
develops a smaller inner core. The near-term intensity forecast has 
been bumped up slightly (55 kt) before the system moves inland early 
Saturday. After landfall, the system is expected to weaken due to 
the negative influences of land interaction, drier air, and strong 
upper-level winds. This forecast shows extratropical transition by 
48 h with dissipation by 72 h, in good agreement with the GFS and 
ECMWF models. 

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the 
southeastern and mid-Atlantic U.S. coasts within the Tropical Storm 
Warning area today into Saturday night.
 
2. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation
over portions of eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia,
including Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds, the Neuse and Pamlico 
Rivers, the lower James River, and the lower Chesapeake Bay, where 
Storm Surge Warnings are in place.  Residents in these areas should 
follow advice given by local officials.
 
3. Heavy rainfall from this system could produce flash, urban, and 
small stream flooding impacts across portions of the Mid-Atlantic 
states from North Carolina to New Jersey through Sunday.
 
4. Swells generated by this system will affect much of the U.S.
east coast through the weekend, likely causing life-threatening
surf and rip currents.
