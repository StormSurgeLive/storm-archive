<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Special outlook issued to raise probabilities and update discussion <br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Nigel, located over the central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Off the Southeastern United States Coast (AL99):<br/>
Updated...A trough of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
east of the Florida peninsula continues to produce a large area of <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms. A non-tropical low pressure <br/>
system is expected to form within this area by early Friday, and <br/>
there are increasing chances that this system could acquire some <br/>
tropical or subtropical characteristics on Friday or early Saturday <br/>
while it moves generally northward toward the coast of North <br/>
Carolina. Regardless of tropical or subtropical development, this <br/>
low is likely to bring tropical storm force winds, heavy rain, <br/>
coastal flooding, and high surf to portions of the southeast and <br/>
mid-Atlantic United States coastline on Friday and into the <br/>
weekend. Tropical Storm watches or warnings could be required for <br/>
this system as soon as later this morning. Additional information on <br/>
this system, including storm and gale warnings, can be found in High <br/>
Seas Forecasts and products from your local National Weather Service <br/>
office.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave located just west of the Cabo Verde Islands is <br/>
producing some disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity. <br/>
Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive for gradual <br/>
development of this system, and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form this weekend or early next week while the system moves <br/>
generally westward at 10 to 15 mph across the eastern and central <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for this system can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header 
WTNT41 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT!.shtml

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Surf City NC to Chincoteague VA...2-4 ft
Chesapeake Bay south of Smith Point...2-4 ft
Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds...2-4 ft
South Santee River SC to Surf City NC 1-3 ft
Chincoteague VA to Fenwick Island DE...1-3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding 
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, 
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area in North Carolina on Friday, and 
spread northward Friday night and Saturday.

RAINFALL:  The system is forecast to produce 2 to 4 inches of 
rainfall, with localized amounts of 6 inches, across the eastern 
Mid-Atlantic states from North Carolina to New Jersey, Friday 
through Sunday. This rainfall may produce localized urban and small 
stream flooding impacts.

SURF:  Swells generated by this system will be affecting much of 
the east coast of the United States through this weekend.  These 
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Nigel Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
1100 AM AST Thu Sep 21 2023

Nigel is still maintaining some deep convection, with cloud tops 
in bands to near -70 deg C.  However, increasing southwesterly 
vertical wind shear is beginning to cause an elongation of the cloud 
pattern toward the northeast.  Subjective Dvorak satellite 
classifications from TAFB and SAB continue to give Current 
Intensity numbers corresponding to 77 kt, and objective ADT 
estimates from UW-CIMSS are a little lower than that value.  The 
advisory intensity is held at 75 kt.

The current motion is quickly northeastward, or about 050/26 kt.  
Nigel is embedded in the flow on the southeastern side of a strong 
deep-layer mid-latitude trough.  This steering pattern should 
continue to carry the cyclone rapidly toward the northeast through 
tonight.  On Friday, Nigel should rotate around the eastern side of 
a large extratropical cyclone over the North Atlantic.

Vertical wind shear over Nigel should become very high within the 
next 24 hours, and the cyclone will be moving over significantly 
cooler waters later today.  Therefore weakening should occur, and 
global model guidance indicates that the system will become 
embedded in a frontal zone by early Friday.  In 2 to 3 days, Nigel 
is expected to merge with the large cyclone over the North 
Atlantic, and dissipate.
