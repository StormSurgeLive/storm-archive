during the next 36 hours in the indicated locations. For a depiction
of areas at risk, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov.  This is a

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ophelia was 
located near latitude 36.2 North, longitude 77.3 West. Ophelia is 
moving toward the north near 13 mph (20 km/h). A continued northward 
motion is expected today, followed by a gradual turn toward the 
northeast by Sunday. On the forecast track, the center of Ophelia 
will soon enter southeastern Virginia this evening, and then move 
over the Delmarva Peninsula tonight into Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (70 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Additional weakening is expected through the remainder 
of the weekend, and Ophelia is likely to become a post-tropical 
cyclone by Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 320 miles (520 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 993 mb (29.32 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ophelia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1, WMO header WTNT41 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Neuse and Bay Rivers...1-3 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...3-5 ft
Chesapeake Bay south of Colonial Beach...2-4 ft
Ocracoke Inlet, NC to Chincoteague, VA...2-4 ft
Albemarle and Pamlico Sound...2-4 ft
Chincoteague, VA to Manasquan Inlet, NJ...1-3 ft
Upper Chesapeake Bay...1-3 ft
Delaware Bay...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by dangerous
waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the
surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are affecting portions of the coast
of North Carolina and southeastern Virginia within the warning area
and will continue spreading northward this afternoon.
 
RAINFALL:
Ophelia is expected to produce the following storm total rainfall:
 
Portions of eastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia...3 to 5
inches with isolated higher totals of 8 inches through tonight.
 
Across the remaining portions of the Mid Atlantic...2 to 4 inches
through Sunday.
 
Across southern New York through southern New England...1 to 3
inches through Monday morning.
 
This rainfall may produce locally considerable flash, urban, and
small stream flooding impacts, particularly across the Mid Atlantic
region from North Carolina to New Jersey. Isolated river flooding is
possible in areas of heavier rainfall.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ophelia will affect much of the east
coast of the United States through this weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two may occur today over parts of the
Mid-Atlantic Coast.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM EDT.

Tropical Storm Ophelia Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162023
1100 AM EDT Sat Sep 23 2023
 
Since Ophelia made landfall earlier this morning, the tropical storm 
has maintained a healthy appearance in radar reflectivity from both 
the Morehead City and Raleigh radars, though the Doppler wind 
velocities have steadily decreased as it moves further inland. 
1-minute GOES-16 visible imagery depicts curved banding near the 
center of Ophelia, though the coldest cloud tops on infrared imagery 
have warmed from last night. The Doppler velocity data and surface 
observations suggest that maximum sustained winds are down to 45 kt 
this advisory, though this could be somewhat generous. However, 
Ophelia continues to produce a large swath of heavy rainfall both 
near and north of the current storm position, where a large region 
of Flood Watches and Warnings remain in effect.
 
The tropical storm appears to have accelerated this morning, with 
the latest estimated motion at 355/11 kt. Over the next 12-24 hours, 
Ophelia is expected to begin turning northeastward as it moves into 
southeastern Virginia by this evening. This motion should slow a bit 
as it becomes tangled up in a frontal boundary moving into the 
Delmarva Peninsula and off the mid-Atlantic coastline on Sunday. The 
track forecast this cycle is quite similar to the prior advisory, in 
best agreement with the simple and corrected track guidance.
 
Continued weakening is expected as Ophelia continues to move inland
across eastern North Carolina and then southeastern Virginia. On
Sunday, Ophelia's circulation is forecast to become increasingly
elongated as interacts with a pre-existing frontal boundary offshore
of the Mid-Atlantic coastline. Most of the model guidance shows
Ophelia merging with the baroclinic zone in about 24 hours, marking
its transition to an extratropical cyclone, with the low ultimately
being absorbed by the frontal zone in 48-60 h, though this could
occur sooner.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions will continue along portions of the
southeastern and mid-Atlantic U.S. coasts within the Tropical Storm
Warning area today.
 
2. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation
over portions of eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia,
including Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds, the Neuse and Pamlico
Rivers, the lower James River, and the lower Chesapeake Bay, where
Storm Surge Warnings are in place.  Residents in these areas should
follow advice given by local officials.
 
3. Heavy rainfall from Ophelia may produce locally considerable 
flash, and urban flooding impacts across portions of the 
Mid-Atlantic states from North Carolina to New Jersey through 
Sunday.
 
4. Swells generated by this system will affect much of the U.S.
east coast through the weekend, likely causing life-threatening
surf and rip currents.

Tropical Depression Seventeen Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 AM AST Sat Sep 23 2023
 
Visible imagery since sunrise revealed that a small well-defined 
center has formed on the western edge of an area of disturbed 
weather located several hundred miles west of the Cabo Verde 
Islands. Deep convection associated with the system is also 
sufficiently organized to classify it as a tropical cyclone. 
Therefore, advisories have been initiated on Tropical Depression 
Seventeen.
 
ASCAT data valid around 1200 UTC indicated that maximum winds 
associated with the depression are near 30 kt, and that is the basis 
for the initial intensity. Since the cyclone's deep convection and 
formative mid-level circulation are displaced well east of its 
surface center, no significant change in strength is anticipated in 
the short term. Deep-layer shear appears to be very weak, but model 
soundings suggest some mid-layer shear may be responsible for the 
current structure. This shear could lessen by early next week, 
allowing for slow intensification to begin in an environment that 
should otherwise support strengthening. The NHC forecast is very 
near the intensity model consensus, with the statistical-dynamical 
models generally showing a faster rate of strengthening than the 
dynamical ones.
 
The depression is moving westward, with an initial forward speed 
near 13 kt. The depression should continue westward for the next 
several days, slowing down slightly as the subtropical ridge to its 
north weakens and moves eastward. After about 3 days, a mid- to 
upper-level trough over the central Atlantic should begin to turn 
the cyclone northwestward, and then northward by day 5, as long as 
Seventeen intensifies as forecasted. The NHC track forecast is 
heavily based on HCCA through the full forecast period. Confidence 
in the track forecast is somewhat lower than normal based on the 
model spread and uncertainty as to when the system will be 
vertically deep enough to begin gaining more latitude, but nearly 
all available ensemble guidance shows the same general evolution.
