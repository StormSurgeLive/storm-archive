DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ophelia was 
located near latitude 35.0 North, longitude 77.0 West. Ophelia is 
moving toward the north near 13 mph (21 km/h). A continued 
northward motion is expected today, followed by a turn toward the 
northeast on Sunday. On the forecast track, the center of Ophelia 
will move across eastern North Carolina this morning, and then move 
into southeastern Virginia, and the Delmarva Peninsula by the end of 
 today into and Sunday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph (105 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Further weakening is expected through the rest of 
the weekend, and Ophelia is likely to become a post-tropical
cyclone tonight or Sunday morning.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310 miles (500 km) 
from the center. An observation in Cape Lookout, North Carolina, 
recently reported sustained winds of 47 mph (75 km/h) with a gust to 
71 mph (115 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 983 mb (29.03 inches) 
based on nearby surface observations.


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ophelia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1, WMO header WTNT41 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Neuse and Bay Rivers...3-5 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...3-5 ft
Chesapeake Bay south of Colonial Beach...2-4 ft
Surf City, NC to Chincoteague, VA...2-4 ft
Albemarle Sound...2-4 ft
South Santee River, SC to Surf City, NC...1-3 ft
Chincoteague, VA to Manasquan Inlet, NJ...1-3 ft
Upper Chesapeake Bay...1-3 ft
Delaware Bay...1-3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by dangerous
waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the
surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are affecting portions of the coast
of North Carolina and southeastern Virginia within the warning area
and will continue spreading northward today.

RAINFALL:  Ophelia is expected to produce the following rainfall:

Across portions of eastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia...3
to 5 inches with isolated higher totals around 8 inches into Sunday
morning.

Across the remaining portions of the Mid Atlantic...2 to 4 inches 
tonight through Sunday.

Across southern New York through southern New England...1 to 3 
inches Saturday into Monday.

This rainfall may produce locally considerable flash, urban, and
small stream flooding impacts, particularly across the Mid Atlantic
region from North Carolina to New Jersey. Isolated river flooding is
possible in areas of heavier rainfall.

SURF:  Swells generated by Ophelia will affect much of the east
coast of the United States through this weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

TORNADOES:  A tornado or two may occur today over parts of the
Mid-Atlantic Coast.
