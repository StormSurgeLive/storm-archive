threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the disturbance was centered near latitude
29.0 North, longitude 75.9 West.  The system is moving toward the
north near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion is expected to
continue through early Friday.  A north-northwestward to northward
motion is forecast by late Friday and that motion should continue 
into the weekend.  On the forecast track, the center of the cyclone 
is expected to approach the coast of North Carolina within the 
warning area Friday night and early Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is expected during the next day or two, and 
the system is forecast to become a tropical storm as it approaches 
the coast of North Carolina.  Regardless of whether the system 
become a tropical storm, the system is expected to bring 
tropical-storm conditions to portions of the southeast and 
mid-Atlantic coasts. 
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.  

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1012 mb (29.89 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for this system can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header
WTNT41 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT!.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Surf City NC to Chincoteague VA...2-4 ft
Chesapeake Bay south of Smith Point...2-4 ft
Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds...2-4 ft
South Santee River SC to Surf City NC 1-3 ft
Chincoteague VA to Fenwick Island DE...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area in North Carolina on Friday, and
spread northward Friday night and Saturday.
 
RAINFALL:  The system is forecast to produce 2 to 4 inches of
rainfall, with localized amounts of 6 inches, across the eastern
Mid-Atlantic states from North Carolina to New Jersey, Friday
through Sunday. This rainfall may produce localized urban and small
stream flooding impacts.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by this system will be affecting much of
the east coast of the United States through this weekend.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162023
1100 AM EDT Thu Sep 21 2023
 
A broad non-tropical area of low pressure has formed well east of 
the east coast of Florida this morning.  Although this system is 
forecast to remain non-tropical during the next 12-24 hours, the 
dynamical model guidance indicates that it will likely acquire 
tropical characteristics late Friday and early Saturday as it 
approaches the coast of North Carolina.  Although it is unclear as 
to whether the cyclone detaches from a front that is forecast to 
extend northeastward from the center, the guidance suggests a 
tropical-cyclone like core and structure when it nears the coast.  
As a result, advisories are being initiated on Potential Tropical 
Cyclone Sixteen to issue Tropical Storm Warnings and Storm Surge 
Watches for portions of the coasts of North Carolina, Virginia and 
Maryland. Winds associated with the front farther north are being 
covered by non-tropical products issued by local National Weather 
Service offices and the Ocean Prediction Center.  Additional 
tropical watches and warnings could be issued for other portions of 
the Chesapeake Bay later today. 
 
Since the low is still in its formative stage, the initial motion
estimate is a highly uncertain 360/8 kt.  The model guidance
suggests that center reformations are likely to occur during the
next day or so, but the overall motion of the system is expected to
be a little east of due north. As the system interacts with a 
mid-latitude trough that it becomes embedded within, a bend toward
the north-northwest is forecast.  That motion should bring the 
center over eastern North Carolina within the warning area Saturday 
morning.  The NHC track forecast follows a blend of the various 
global models that are in good agreement. 

The system is forecast to gradually strengthen during the next 24 
hours. After that time, the guidance suggests it is likely to form 
a smaller inner core with additional strengthening expected until 
the center reaches the coast.  The NHC intensity forecast follows 
the ECMWF and GFS models trends. 

Key Messages:

1. An area of low pressure is forecast to develop off the 
southeastern U.S. coast later today and will bring 
tropical-storm-force winds, storm surge, heavy rain, and high surf 
to large portions of the southeast and mid-Atlantic United States 
coast beginning Friday and continuing into the weekend. 
 
2. There is the potential for life-threatening storm surge 
inundation from Surf City, North Carolina to Chincoteague, Virginia, 
the Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds, and the lower Chesapeake Bay. 
Residents in these areas should follow advice given by local 
officials. 

3. Tropical storm conditions are expected within portions of the 
southeast and mid-Atlantic coasts within the Tropical Storm Warning 
area beginning on Friday and continuing into Saturday. 

4. Heavy rainfall from this system could produce localized urban 
and small stream flooding impacts across the eastern mid-Atlantic 
states from North Carolina to New Jersey Friday through Sunday.

Hurricane Nigel Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
1100 AM AST Thu Sep 21 2023

Nigel is still maintaining some deep convection, with cloud tops 
in bands to near -70 deg C.  However, increasing southwesterly 
vertical wind shear is beginning to cause an elongation of the cloud 
pattern toward the northeast.  Subjective Dvorak satellite 
classifications from TAFB and SAB continue to give Current 
Intensity numbers corresponding to 77 kt, and objective ADT 
estimates from UW-CIMSS are a little lower than that value.  The 
advisory intensity is held at 75 kt.

The current motion is quickly northeastward, or about 050/26 kt.  
Nigel is embedded in the flow on the southeastern side of a strong 
deep-layer mid-latitude trough.  This steering pattern should 
continue to carry the cyclone rapidly toward the northeast through 
tonight.  On Friday, Nigel should rotate around the eastern side of 
a large extratropical cyclone over the North Atlantic.

Vertical wind shear over Nigel should become very high within the 
next 24 hours, and the cyclone will be moving over significantly 
cooler waters later today.  Therefore weakening should occur, and 
global model guidance indicates that the system will become 
embedded in a frontal zone by early Friday.  In 2 to 3 days, Nigel 
is expected to merge with the large cyclone over the North 
Atlantic, and dissipate.
