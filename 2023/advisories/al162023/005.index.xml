For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the disturbance was centered near
latitude 32.3 North, longitude 75.6 West. The system is moving
toward the north near 12 mph (19 km/h). A north to north-northwest
motion is expected during the next couple of days. On the forecast
track, the center of the low will approach the coast of North
Carolina tonight, and then move across eastern North Carolina,
southeastern Virginia, and the Delmarva Peninsula Saturday and
Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some strengthening is forecast before landfall, and the low is 
expected to become a tropical storm before it reaches the coast of 
North Carolina. Regardless of whether it becomes a tropical storm, 
the system is expected to bring tropical storm conditions to 
portions of the southeast and mid-Atlantic coasts.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275 miles (445 km)
from the center. NOAA buoy 41025 at Diamond Shoals, North Carolina, 
recently reported a sustained wind of 40 mph (65 km/h) and a gust 
of 51 mph (83 km/h). 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface observations 
is 996 mb (29.42 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for this system can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1, WMO header WTNT41 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Neuse and Bay Rivers...3-5 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...3-5 ft
Chesapeake Bay south of Colonial Beach...2-4 ft
Surf City, NC to Chincoteague, VA...2-4 ft
Albemarle Sound...2-4 ft
South Santee River, SC to Surf City, NC...1-3 ft
Chincoteague, VA to Manasquan Inlet, NJ...1-3 ft
Upper Chesapeake Bay...1-3 ft
Delaware Bay...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by dangerous
waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the
surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are reaching portions of the North 
Carolina coast within the warning area and will spread northward 
through Saturday.
 
RAINFALL:  The system is forecast to produce 3 to 5 inches of
rainfall, with localized amounts of 7 inches across portions of
eastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia from today into
Saturday. Across remaining portions of the Mid-Atlantic into
southern New England, 2 to 4 inches of rainfall are forecast from
later today into Sunday.  This rainfall may produce flash, urban,
and small stream flooding impacts.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by this system will affect much of the east
coast of the United States through this weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible beginning tonight through
Saturday for portions of the mid-Atlantic Coast.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 500 PM EDT.

Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162023
500 AM EDT Fri Sep 22 2023
 
The low pressure system off the southeast U.S. coast is gradually 
organizing and strengthening this morning.  The cyclone is 
developing subtropical characteristics with deep convection 
consolidating on the system's north side and the center gaining 
definition, but there are still some frontal features associated 
with it.  NOAA buoy 41002 well off the coast of Cape Hatteras has 
seen a significant pressure drop during the past several hours, and 
the latest report was down to 1002 mb with 30-kt winds.  A 
saildrone measured winds of 32 kt well northeast of the center 
several hours ago.  Based on these pressure and wind observations as 
well as satellite intensity estimates, the initial intensity is 
increased to 45 kt.  Based on recent trends, it seems likely that 
the low will become a subtropical or tropical cyclone later today.
 
The system has been moving erratically overnight, but recent
satellite images suggest that it is now moving northward at about 7
kt.  A northward to northwestward motion is expected during the next
couple of days as the system moves on the west side of a subtropical
high, taking the cyclone inland over eastern North Carolina early
Saturday and over portions of the Mid-Atlantic Saturday night
and Sunday. The NHC track forecast is quite similar to the previous
one and not far from the GFS and ECMWF models.
 
The notable strengthening that has occurred overnight is due to a
combination of baroclinic influences from the mid- to upper-level
trough just to the west of the system and the warm Gulf Stream
waters.  The system will likely strengthen a little more before it
reaches the coast of North Carolina.  After landfall, land
interaction, dry air, and strong shear should lead to weakening and
cause the system to transition back to an extratropical low in a
couple of days.
 
It should be noted that the cyclone has a large wind field, and
tropical-storm-force winds will begin well ahead of the center.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Low pressure off the southeastern U.S. coast is producing
a large area of tropical-storm-force winds and is forecast to
strengthen further before it reaches the coast of North Carolina
early Saturday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected along
portions of the southeastern and mid-Atlantic U.S. coasts within
the Tropical Storm Warning area beginning later this morning and
continuing into Saturday night.
 
2. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation
over portions of eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia,
including Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds, and the lower Chesapeake
Bay, where Storm Surge Warnings are in place.  Residents in these
areas should follow advice given by local officials.
 
3. Heavy rainfall from this system could produce localized urban
and small stream flooding impacts across the eastern mid-Atlantic
states from North Carolina to New Jersey through Sunday.
 
4.  Swells generated by this system will affect much of the U.S.
east coast through the weekend, likely causing life-threatening
surf and rip currents.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Nigel Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
900 AM GMT Fri Sep 22 2023
 
Nigel has completed its transition to an extra-tropical cyclone this 
morning. Convection from earlier has waned, and is well displaced 
from the exposed low-level center. Based on a blend of an earlier 
partial ASCAT pass and subjective Dvorak satellite intensity 
estimates, the initial intensity is lowered to 60 kt for this 
advisory.
 
The system is encountering very strong vertical wind shear and ocean 
temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius. The system is forecast to 
continue to gradually weaken over the next couple of days. However, 
the system will remain a strong extra-tropical cyclone with an 
expanding wind field. The NHC intensity forecast is similar to the 
previous advisory and lies near the model consensus.
 
Nigel continues to race northeastward at 32 kt. A northeastward 
motion is forecast to continue the next day or so, as it remains in 
the flow along the southern edge of a deep mid-latitude trough. 
Afterwards, Nigel should rotate around the eastern side of a large 
extratropical cyclone over the North Atlantic, with the two 
extratropical systems merging in about 48 h.  The model guidance 
remains in fairly good agreement, and the NHC forecast lies in the 
center of the guidance envelope.
