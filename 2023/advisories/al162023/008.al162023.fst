DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ophelia was
located near latitude 34.3 North, longitude 76.9 West. Ophelia is
moving toward the north-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A turn
toward the north is forecast later today, followed by a turn toward
the northeast on Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of
Ophelia will reach the coast of North Carolina within the next
couple of hours, and then move across eastern North Carolina,
southeastern Virginia, and the Delmarva Peninsula the rest of today
and Sunday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast before landfall along
the coast of North Carolina.  Weakening is expected after landfall
through the rest of the weekend, and Ophelia is likely to become an
extratropical cyclone tonight or Sunday morning.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310 miles (500 km)
from the center. NOAA buoy 41037 at Wrightsville Beach Offshore
recently reported a sustained wind of 54 mph (87 km/h) and a gust
to 83 mph (134 km/h). A sustained wind of 43 mph (68 km/h) and a
gust of 53 mph (85 km/h) was recently reported near Morehead City,
North Carolina.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 981 mb (28.97 inches) 
based on aircraft reconnaissance data.


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ophelia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1, WMO header WTNT41 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Neuse and Bay Rivers...4-6 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...4-6 ft
Chesapeake Bay south of Colonial Beach...2-4 ft
Surf City, NC to Chincoteague, VA...2-4 ft
Albemarle Sound...2-4 ft
South Santee River, SC to Surf City, NC...1-3 ft
Chincoteague, VA to Manasquan Inlet, NJ...1-3 ft
Upper Chesapeake Bay...1-3 ft
Delaware Bay...1-3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by dangerous
waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the
surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are affecting portions of the coast
of North Carolina and southeastern Virginia within the warning area
and will continue spreading northward today. Hurricane conditions
are possible within the watch area early this morning.

RAINFALL:  Ophelia is expected to produce the following rainfall:

Across portions of eastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia…3
to 5 inches with isolated higher totals around 8 inches into Sunday
morning.

Across the remaining portions of the Mid Atlantic…2 to 4 inches
tonight through Sunday.

Across southern New York through southern New England…1 to 3 inches
Saturday into Monday.

This rainfall may produce locally considerable flash, urban, and
small stream flooding impacts, particularly across the Mid Atlantic
region from North Carolina to New Jersey. Isolated river flooding is
possible in areas of heavier rainfall.

SURF:  Swells generated by Ophelia will affect much of the east
coast of the United States through this weekend.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

TORNADOES:  A tornado or two may occur today over parts of the
Mid-Atlantic Coast.
