800 PM EDT Sat Sep 23 2023
 
...OPHELIA NOW A TROPICAL DEPRESSION...
...ALL STORM SURGE AND TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS DISCONTINUED...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 PM EDT...0000 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...37.0N 77.6W
ABOUT 40 MI...60 KM SSW OF RICHMOND VIRGINIA
ABOUT 165 MI...265 KM WSW OF OCEAN CITY MARYLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 355 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1000 MB...29.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
All Storm Surge and Tropical Storm Warnings have been discontinued.

 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
Coastal flooding warnings and wind advisories remain in effect for 
portions of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic.  For storm information specific 
to your area, please monitor products issued by your local National 
Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ophelia was
located near latitude 37.0 North, longitude 77.6 West. Ophelia is
moving toward the north near 9 mph (15 km/h). A gradual turn toward
the northeast is expected by tomorrow. On the forecast track, the
center of Ophelia is expected to continue moving over southeastern
Virginia through tonight, and then over the Delmarva Peninsula by
tomorrow.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is expected, and Ophelia 
is likely to become a post-tropical cyclone tomorrow.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ophelia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1, WMO header WTNT41 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause 
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters 
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the 
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if 
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Hatteras Inlet, NC to Manasquan Inlet, NJ...1-3 ft
Chesapeake Bay and Tidal Rivers...1-3 ft
Delaware Bay...1-3 ft
Beaufort Inlet, NC to Hatteras Inlet, NC...1-2 ft
Neuse, Bay, Pamlico, and Pungo Rivers...1-2 ft
Albemarle and Pamlico Sound...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by dangerous
waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the
surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Gusty winds to tropical storm force are still possible near 
the coasts of North Carolina and Virginia during the next few hours.
 
RAINFALL:  Ophelia is expected to produce the following additional
rainfall through Sunday night:
 
Portions of the Mid-Atlantic from north central North Carolina
through New Jersey...1 to 3 inches with isolated higher totals up
to 5 inches.
 
Across southeastern New York through southern New England...1 to 3
inches.
 
This rainfall may produce locally considerable flash, urban, and
small stream flooding impacts, particularly across the Mid Atlantic
region from North Carolina to New Jersey. Isolated river flooding is
possible in areas of heavier rainfall.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ophelia will continue to affect much of
the east coast of the United States through the weekend.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two may occur through tonight across parts
of the Mid-Atlantic Coast.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM EDT.

<title>Tropical Depression Ophelia Forecast Discussion Number 10</title>

Tropical Storm Ophelia Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162023
500 PM EDT Sat Sep 23 2023

Ophelia continues to weaken as it crosses into southeastern 
Virginia. The radar presentation has been gradually degrading as the 
Doppler velocities continue to decrease. However, there remains a 
WeatherFlow station in Pamlico Sound reporting surface winds between 
30-35 kt. In addition, an earlier scatterometer pass also showed 
tropical-storm-force winds well to the northeast in association with 
an offshore frontal boundary. Thus, Ophelia will remain a tropical 
storm with maximum sustained winds of 35 kt for this advisory.

Ophelia is still moving northward at 360/10 kt. Little has changed 
with the forecast reasoning, as Ophelia should gradually turn 
northeastward over the next 12-24 hours, with the center gradually 
losing definition as it begins to merge with the aforementioned 
frontal boundary off the mid-Atlantic coastline. The latest track 
guidance remains in good agreement on this scenario, and the latest 
NHC track forecast is quite similar, if just a touch north, of the 
prior forecast. Ophelia should continue to gradually spin down 
inland, though higher winds may still continue to be observed with 
the frontal boundary to the system's northeast. By tomorrow, Ophelia 
is expected to merge with this frontal boundary, marking its 
transition to post-tropical status, with the system expected to 
become fully absorbed by early next week.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions will continue through this evening 
along portions of the Outer Banks of North Carolina northward along 
the Mid-Atlantic U.S. coastline within the Tropical Storm Warning 
area.
 
2. Storm surge inundation will continue through this evening over 
portions of the Outer Banks of North Carolina and southeastern 
Virginia, including Pamlico Sound and the tidal rivers of the lower 
Chesapeake Bay, where Storm Surge Warnings are in place.  Residents 
in these areas should follow advice given by local officials.
 
3. Heavy rainfall from Ophelia may produce locally considerable 
flash and urban flooding impacts across portions of the 
Mid-Atlantic states from North Carolina to New Jersey through 
Sunday.
 
4. Swells generated by this system will affect much of the U.S.
east coast through the weekend, likely causing life-threatening
surf and rip currents.

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
500 PM AST Sat Sep 23 2023
 
Overall, the structure of the cyclone hasn't changed significantly 
since this morning. Its low-level center is still displaced west of 
most of the associated deep convection. That said, satellite 
intensity estimates are generally a little higher than they were 
about 6 hours ago, ranging from about 30 to 35 kt. The intensity is 
set at 35 kt, in best agreement with the latest subjective TAFB 
Dvorak estimate and the objective UW-CIMSS DMINT and SATCON, making 
the system Tropical Storm Philippe.
 
Philippe is expected to maintain its general structure for the next 
couple of days, which should prevent it from substantially 
strengthening. While the intensity guidance is generally slightly 
higher than 6 h ago, the dynamical models remain in generally good 
agreement on the intensity forecast for the next few days. Beyond 72 
h, Philippe will approach a mid- to upper-level trough, which could 
result in an increase of both upper-level difluence and deep-layer 
shear. Slight additional intensification is possible at that point, 
but no periods of significant strengthening are expected during the 
next 5 days. The official intensity forecast remains near the IVCN 
and HCCA intensity consensus aids.
 
The tropical storm continues to move westward, near 12 kt. This 
should generally continue for the next couple of days until Philippe 
approaches the aforementioned trough. At that point, as long as the 
tropical storm has strengthened slightly as expected, it should 
begin to turn northwestward, and then northward, influenced by the 
deeper-layer steering flow imparted by the trough. The official 
track forecast has been shifted slightly northeastward and slower 
compared to the previous one, and is close to the latest HCCA 
forecast.
