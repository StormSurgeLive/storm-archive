during the next 36 hours in the indicated locations. For a
depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at

instructions from local officials. 
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.
For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the disturbance was centered near latitude
29.2 North, longitude 75.9 West.  The system is moving toward the
north near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general motion is expected to
continue through early Friday.  A north-northwestward to northward
motion is forecast by late Friday, and that motion should continue
into the weekend.  On the forecast track, the center of the cyclone
is expected to approach the coast of North Carolina within the
warning area Friday night and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is expected during the next day or two, and the system
is forecast to become a tropical storm while it approaches the 
coast of North Carolina.  Regardless of whether it becomes a 
tropical storm, the system is expected to bring tropical-storm 
conditions to portions of the southeast and mid-Atlantic coasts.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1012 mb (29.89 inches).
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for this system can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header
WTNT41 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT!.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Neuse and Bay Rivers...3-5 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...3-5 ft
Chesapeake Bay south of Colonial Beach...2-4 ft
Surf City NC, NC to Chincoteague, VA...2-4 ft
Albemarle Sound...2-4 ft
South Santee River, SC to Surf City NC, NC...1-3 ft
Chincoteague, VA to Manasquan Inlet, NJ...1-3 ft
Upper Chesapeake Bay...1-3 ft
Delaware Bay...1-3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area in North Carolina on Friday, and
spread northward Friday night and Saturday.
 
RAINFALL:  The system is forecast to produce 3 to 5 inches of
rainfall, with localized amounts of 7 inches, across eastern North
Carolina into southeast Virginia Friday into Saturday.  Across
remaining portions of the Mid-Atlantic into southern New England, 2
to 4 inches of rainfall are forecast from late Friday into Sunday.
This rainfall may produce isolated urban and small stream flooding
impacts.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by this system will be affecting much of
the east coast of the United States through this weekend.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible beginning Friday night
through Saturday for portions of the Mid-Atlantic Coast.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM EDT.

Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162023
500 PM EDT Thu Sep 21 2023
 
High-resolution visible satellite imagery and surface synoptic
observations indicate that the disturbance has not yet acquired a
well-defined center of circulation.  There is a distinct
comma-shaped curved band of convection over the eastern portion of
the system, with moderate southwesterly vertical wind shear over 
the area.  The current intensity is set at 30 kt based on surface 
observations.

Since there is still no distinct center the initial motion, 360/7 
kt, is an educated guess.  The dynamical model guidance suggests 
that there may be some center re-formations during the next day or 
two.  However, the system should move generally northward to 
north-northwestward over the next couple of days while embedded on 
the eastern side of a deep-layer trough over the eastern United 
States.  The official forecast is close to the previous one and is 
also close to the corrected dynamical model consensus.

Strong vertical wind shear is likely to persist over the system, 
but the global models show strengthening before landfall.  This 
intensification is probably at least partially due to baroclinic 
energy sources.  In fact the ECMWF forecast suggests that the 
system will retain at least some frontal cyclone characteristics 
through landfall.  Nonetheless, the system is likely to cause 
tropical-storm-force winds, locally heavy rainfall, and dangerous 
storm surges over the warned areas in the southeastern and 
mid-Atlantic United States.  Interests should be aware that 
hazardous conditions will extend well away from the forecast center 
locations.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. An area of low pressure is forecast to strengthen off the
southeastern U.S. coast and bring tropical-storm-force winds, storm 
surge, heavy rain, and high surf to large portions of the southeast 
and mid-Atlantic United States coast beginning Friday and continuing 
into the weekend.
 
2. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation 
over portions of eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia, 
including the Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds, and the lower 
Chesapeake Bay, where Storm Surge Warnings are in place.  Residents 
in these areas should follow advice given by local officials.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected within portions of the
southeast and mid-Atlantic coasts within the Tropical Storm Warning
area beginning on Friday and continuing into Saturday.
 
4. Heavy rainfall from this system could produce localized urban
and small stream flooding impacts across the eastern mid-Atlantic
states from North Carolina to New Jersey Friday through Sunday.

Hurricane Nigel Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152023
900 PM GMT Thu Sep 21 2023

Nigel's satellite presentation has begun to degrade as increasing 
southwesterly vertical wind shear has caused the deep convection to 
become displaced to the northeast of the low-level center.  A blend 
of the latest Dvorak Current Intensity (CI) numbers and the 
objective estimates yields an initial intensity estimate of 70 kt. 

A continued increase in vertical wind shear and cooler waters along 
the track of Nigel should cause additional weakening.  Nigel is 
expected to quickly complete its extratropical transition by 12 
hours, and only gradual weakening is forecast after that time.  The 
storm has grown in size, and a continue expansion of the 34-kt wind 
field is expected during the next couple of days. 

Nigel is moving east-northeastward or 060/32 kt.  An east- 
northeastward to northeastward motion along the southeastern 
side of a strong deep-layer mid-latitude trough is expected during 
the next 12 to 24 hours.  After that time, Nigel should rotate 
around the eastern side of a large extratropical cyclone over the 
North Atlantic.  The dynamical model guidance is tightly clustered, 
and the NHC forecast is near a blend of the GFS and ECMWF models.
