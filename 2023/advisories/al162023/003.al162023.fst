DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the low pressure system was centered near
latitude 29.5 North, longitude 75.3 West.  The low is moving toward 
the north-northeast near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A northward or 
north-northwestward motion is expected to begin early Friday and
continue through Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of the
low will approach the coast of North Carolina through Friday night,
and then move across eastern North Carolina, southeastern Virginia,
and the Delmarva Peninsula Saturday and Sunday.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast during the
next day or so, and the low is expected to become a tropical storm
before it reaches the coast of North Carolina.  Regardless of
whether it becomes a tropical storm, the system is expected to bring
tropical-storm conditions to portions of the southeast and
mid-Atlantic coasts.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...60 percent.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km)
to the north of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for this system can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Neuse and Bay Rivers...3-5 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...3-5 ft
Chesapeake Bay south of Colonial Beach...2-4 ft
Surf City NC, NC to Chincoteague, VA...2-4 ft
Albemarle Sound...2-4 ft
South Santee River, SC to Surf City NC, NC...1-3 ft
Chincoteague, VA to Manasquan Inlet, NJ...1-3 ft
Upper Chesapeake Bay...1-3 ft
Delaware Bay...1-3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by dangerous
waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the
surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area in North Carolina Friday morning, and
spread northward Friday into Saturday.

RAINFALL:  The system is forecast to produce 3 to 5 inches of
rainfall, with localized amounts of 7 inches, across eastern North
Carolina into southeast Virginia Friday into Saturday.  Across
remaining portions of the Mid-Atlantic into southern New England, 2
to 4 inches of rainfall are forecast from late Friday into Sunday.
This rainfall may produce isolated urban and small stream flooding
impacts.

SURF:  Swells generated by this system will be affecting much of
the east coast of the United States through this weekend.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible beginning Friday night
through Saturday for portions of the Mid-Atlantic Coast.
