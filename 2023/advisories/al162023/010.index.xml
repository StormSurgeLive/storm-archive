DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ophelia was 
located near latitude 36.8 North, longitude 77.3 West. Ophelia is 
moving toward the north near 12 mph (19 km/h). A gradual turn toward 
the northeast is expected by tomorrow. On the forecast track, the 
center of Ophelia is expected to continue moving over southeastern 
Virginia through tonight, and then over the Delmarva Peninsula by 
tomorrow.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Additional weakening is expected, and Ophelia is likely to become a 
post-tropical cyclone tomorrow.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310 miles (500 km) 
from the center. A WeatherFlow station in Pamlico Sound recently 
reported a sustained wind of 37 mph (59 km/h), with a gust up to 43 
mph (69 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ophelia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1, WMO header WTNT41 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Hatteras Inlet, NC to Duck, NC...2-4 ft
James and York Rivers...2-4 ft
Rappahannock River...2-4 ft
Lower Potomac River...2-4 ft
Duck, NC to Manasquan Inlet, NJ...1-3 ft
Upper Chesapeake Bay...1-3 ft
Delaware Bay...1-3 ft
Surf City NC, NC to Hatteras Inlet, NC...1-2 ft
Neuse and Bay Rivers...1-2 ft
Pamlico and Pungo Rivers...1-2 ft
Albemarle and Pamlico Sound...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by dangerous
waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the
surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short
distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue to affect portions 
of the coast of North Carolina and southeastern Virginia within the 
warning area through this evening.
 
RAINFALL:  Ophelia is expected to produce the following additional 
rainfall through Sunday night:
 
Portions of the Mid-Atlantic from north central North Carolina
through New Jersey...1 to 3 inches with isolated higher totals up
to 5 inches.
 
Across southeastern New York through southern New England...1 to 3
inches.
 
This rainfall may produce locally considerable flash, urban, and
small stream flooding impacts, particularly across the Mid Atlantic
region from North Carolina to New Jersey. Isolated river flooding is
possible in areas of heavier rainfall.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ophelia will continue to affect much of 
the east coast of the United States through the weekend.  These 
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two may occur through tonight across parts 
of the Mid-Atlantic Coast.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM EDT.

Tropical Storm Ophelia Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162023
1100 AM EDT Sat Sep 23 2023
 
Since Ophelia made landfall earlier this morning, the tropical storm 
has maintained a healthy appearance in radar reflectivity from both 
the Morehead City and Raleigh radars, though the Doppler wind 
velocities have steadily decreased as it moves further inland. 
1-minute GOES-16 visible imagery depicts curved banding near the 
center of Ophelia, though the coldest cloud tops on infrared imagery 
have warmed from last night. The Doppler velocity data and surface 
observations suggest that maximum sustained winds are down to 45 kt 
this advisory, though this could be somewhat generous. However, 
Ophelia continues to produce a large swath of heavy rainfall both 
near and north of the current storm position, where a large region 
of Flood Watches and Warnings remain in effect.
 
The tropical storm appears to have accelerated this morning, with 
the latest estimated motion at 355/11 kt. Over the next 12-24 hours, 
Ophelia is expected to begin turning northeastward as it moves into 
southeastern Virginia by this evening. This motion should slow a bit 
as it becomes tangled up in a frontal boundary moving into the 
Delmarva Peninsula and off the mid-Atlantic coastline on Sunday. The 
track forecast this cycle is quite similar to the prior advisory, in 
best agreement with the simple and corrected track guidance.
 
Continued weakening is expected as Ophelia continues to move inland
across eastern North Carolina and then southeastern Virginia. On
Sunday, Ophelia's circulation is forecast to become increasingly
elongated as interacts with a pre-existing frontal boundary offshore
of the Mid-Atlantic coastline. Most of the model guidance shows
Ophelia merging with the baroclinic zone in about 24 hours, marking
its transition to an extratropical cyclone, with the low ultimately
being absorbed by the frontal zone in 48-60 h, though this could
occur sooner.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions will continue along portions of the
southeastern and mid-Atlantic U.S. coasts within the Tropical Storm
Warning area today.
 
2. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation
over portions of eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia,
including Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds, the Neuse and Pamlico
Rivers, the lower James River, and the lower Chesapeake Bay, where
Storm Surge Warnings are in place.  Residents in these areas should
follow advice given by local officials.
 
3. Heavy rainfall from Ophelia may produce locally considerable 
flash, and urban flooding impacts across portions of the 
Mid-Atlantic states from North Carolina to New Jersey through 
Sunday.
 
4. Swells generated by this system will affect much of the U.S.
east coast through the weekend, likely causing life-threatening
surf and rip currents.

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
500 PM AST Sat Sep 23 2023
 
Overall, the structure of the cyclone hasn't changed significantly 
since this morning. Its low-level center is still displaced west of 
most of the associated deep convection. That said, satellite 
intensity estimates are generally a little higher than they were 
about 6 hours ago, ranging from about 30 to 35 kt. The intensity is 
set at 35 kt, in best agreement with the latest subjective TAFB 
Dvorak estimate and the objective UW-CIMSS DMINT and SATCON, making 
the system Tropical Storm Philippe.
 
Philippe is expected to maintain its general structure for the next 
couple of days, which should prevent it from substantially 
strengthening. While the intensity guidance is generally slightly 
higher than 6 h ago, the dynamical models remain in generally good 
agreement on the intensity forecast for the next few days. Beyond 72 
h, Philippe will approach a mid- to upper-level trough, which could 
result in an increase of both upper-level difluence and deep-layer 
shear. Slight additional intensification is possible at that point, 
but no periods of significant strengthening are expected during the 
next 5 days. The official intensity forecast remains near the IVCN 
and HCCA intensity consensus aids.
 
The tropical storm continues to move westward, near 12 kt. This 
should generally continue for the next couple of days until Philippe 
approaches the aforementioned trough. At that point, as long as the 
tropical storm has strengthened slightly as expected, it should 
begin to turn northwestward, and then northward, influenced by the 
deeper-layer steering flow imparted by the trough. The official 
track forecast has been shifted slightly northeastward and slower 
compared to the previous one, and is close to the latest HCCA 
forecast.
