Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Mon Sep 4 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gert, located over the central subtropical Atlantic, and on <br/>
recently downgraded Tropical Depression Katia, located over the <br/>
eastern subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
 <br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL95):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to show signs of organization <br/>
in association with a tropical wave located several hundred miles <br/>
southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to be conducive for further development, and this system is <br/>
expected to become a tropical depression in two or three days. <br/>
Additional strengthening is likely late this week while the system <br/>
moves westward to west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the <br/>
central and western portions of the tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is forecast to move off the African coast in a <br/>
couple of days.  Environmental conditions could support some slow <br/>
development starting midweek while the wave moves to the west- <br/>
northwest at about 15 mph over the far eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Gert Discussion Number  26
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
500 AM AST Mon Sep 04 2023

A small area of disorganized deep convection has been persisting to 
the southeast of the estimated center position.  The intensity 
estimate of 45 kt is based on continuity from earlier scatterometer 
data and a Dvorak CI-number from TAFB.  However, the low-level 
circulation of Gert is becoming increasingly disrupted by the much 
larger post-tropical cyclone Idalia.  In fact, Gert may no longer 
have a closed circulation, and it is likely that the system will 
become absorbed by Idalia, and dissipate, later today.

Gert is moving northward at a faster forward speed of around 21 kt.
The cyclone should gradually turn northwestward with additional 
acceleration while it rotates around Idalia, before dissipating. 
The official track forecast is similar to the previous one.

Tropical Depression Katia Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122023
900 AM GMT Mon Sep 04 2023
 
Katia barely qualifies as a tropical cyclone at this time.  The 
system is producing a few puffs of deep convection over the 
northern portion of its circulation.  Earlier scatterometer data 
indicated that the cyclone had weakened to a tropical depression 
and the current intensity estimate is kept at 30 kt.  This is in 
good agreement with various objective estimates from UW-CIMSS.

The depression is moving northwestward, or at about 310/6 kt.  
Katia's northwestward progress will soon be blocked by a high 
pressure area ahead of it.  Then, the flow on the southwestern side 
of a large cyclone over the eastern Atlantic is likely to cause the 
system to make a U-Turn and move slowly southeastward to 
south-southeastward in 24 to 72 hours.  The official forecast is a 
blend of the GFS and ECMWF solutions and is similar to the previous 
NHC track.

Katia should remain in an environment of very dry low- to mid-level 
air with moderate vertical shear.  Therefore, the cyclone is likely 
to degenerate into a remnant low by tonight, and dissipate in a few 
days.  This is also consistent with various global model 
predictions.
