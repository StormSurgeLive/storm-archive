NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Sat Sep 2 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Post-Tropical <br/>
Cyclone Idalia, located just to the east-southeast of Bermuda, on <br/>
Tropical Storm Gert, located about 700 miles east-southeast of <br/>
Bermuda, and on Tropical Storm Katia, located about 700 miles <br/>
north-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands. <br/>
 <br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic (AL95):<br/>
A tropical wave located over the far eastern tropical Atlantic is <br/>
producing disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity to the <br/>
south of the Cabo Verde Islands.  Environmental conditions appear <br/>
conducive for some gradual development of this system by the middle <br/>
part of next week, and a tropical depression is likely to form while <br/>
it moves westward to west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the <br/>
eastern and central portions of the tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Gert Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
500 PM AST Sat Sep 02 2023
 
Satellite images indicate that Gert has become less organized since
this morning.  The low-level center is now exposed, with decreasing
deep convection.  Intensity estimates support keeping Gert at 45 kt
for now, which remains near the UW-CIMSS SATCON value.
 
The storm is finally moving at a more substantial pace, north-
northeast at 8 kt, as it gets caught up in flow around Idalia to
the west-northwest.  Gert should continue to accelerate north-
northeastward tonight and northward tomorrow around the eastern 
side of Idalia's large circulation.  The global models remain 
consistent in showing the small circulation of Gert getting
torn apart by Idalia on Monday, reminiscent of the way that
Franklin took care of Jose yesterday.  No substantial changes in
intensity are expected as any decrease in organization should be
roughly compensated by the large increase in forward.  The new NHC
track and intensity forecast are basically unchanged from the
previous ones.

<title>Tropical Storm Katia Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Katia Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122023
500 PM AST Sat Sep 02 2023

Deep convection continues near and north of the center of Katia, 
with microwave data showing a tilted vortex due to the southerly 
shear.  Overall, the system is showing more internal structure than 
this morning, which is confirmed by increasing satellite estimates 
from many sources which mostly lie between 45-55 kt.  The initial 
wind speed is raised to 50 kt as a blend of this data.
 
Katia has turned northwestward at about 11 kt.  The storm should 
move between a large middle- to upper-level low to the west
and a narrow mid-latitude ridge over the eastern Atlantic for the 
next couple of days.  The biggest changes from this morning are 
that uncertainty is increasing in a few days when Katia, or the 
remnants, reaches a col point between a mid-latitude ridge building 
over the central Atlantic and deep trough over the northeastern 
Atlantic. The guidance suite literally has motions in all cardinal 
directions after that point, indicating a very low confidence 
situation, and the GEFS ensemble lows show the proverbial squashed 
spider pattern. Thus, the new forecast stalls the system before 
dissipating, but it will require some time to sort out the 
long-range details.

The earlier microwave data was showing a growing distance between 
the mid-level and low-level centers of the cyclone, suggesting that
southerly shear could be winning the battle soon (also indicated 
by the latest infrared satellite data).  A continuation of that 
shear plus a slow increase in dry air is likely to cause Katia to 
slowly weaken for the next few days.  The global models show no 
significant deep convection after 36 h, and remnant low status is 
indicated for 48 h.  Little change was made to the previous 
forecast, similar to the NOAA corrected consensus guidance.

...TROPICAL STORM WARNING DISCONTINUED FOR BERMUDA, THIS IS THE
LAST NHC ADVISORY...
...DANGEROUS SURF AND RIP CURRENTS FROM IDALIA EXPECTED TO
CONTINUE ALONG THE U.S. EAST COAST THROUGH LABOR DAY WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...32.0N 62.7W
ABOUT 125 MI...200 KM E OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 75 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...997 MB...29.44 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Bermuda Weather Service has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warning for Bermuda.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia
was located near latitude 32.0 North, longitude 62.7 West.  Idalia 
is moving toward the east-northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue through tonight.  A turn 
toward the northeast and then north at a faster forward speed is 
expected through early next week.  Idalia will continue moving away 
from Bermuda tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Gusts to tropical storm force are likely to continue on
Bermuda through tonight.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia will affect the southeastern U.S.
coast and Bermuda during the next couple of days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system.  Additional information on this system can be 
found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service,

Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
500 PM AST Sat Sep 02 2023
 
Winds on Bermuda have been gradually decreasing since earlier this 
morning, and weather stations on the island are no longer measuring 
sustained tropical-storm-force winds (at standard elevation).  
Gusts to tropical storm force will likely continue on Bermuda into 
tonight while Idalia pulls away from the island, but the Bermuda 
Weather Service has elected to discontinue the Tropical Storm 
Warning in favor of local warnings.  Therefore, this will be the 
last NHC advisory on Idalia.

Earlier ASCAT showed that maximum winds remain 50 kt on the 
northwestern side of the attached frontal boundary.  Little change 
in strength is expected during the next few days.  The 
extratropical cyclone is likely to occlude again in about 3 days 
and begin to fill, at which point weakening is expected.  The NHC 
intensity forecast is between the HCCA and IVCN consensus aids.

Idalia appears to have turned toward the east-northeast, or 075/6 
kt.  A shortwave trough is expected to move off the coast of New 
England on Sunday, causing the cyclone to turn northeastward and 
the northward and speed up over the next 2-3 days.  Once it 
occludes, it is expected to slow down and meander to the southeast 
of Nova Scotia on days 4 and 5.

Additional information on this system can be found in High Seas
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Swells from Idalia are forecast to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions along portions of the east coast of the
United States through Labor Day weekend.

2. Gusts to tropical storm force are likely to continue on Bermuda 
through tonight.
