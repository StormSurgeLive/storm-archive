NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Sun Sep 3 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gert, located over the central subtropical Atlantic, and <br/>
Tropical Storm Katia, located over the eastern subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
 <br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL95):<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave located <br/>
several hundred miles southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands have <br/>
become better organized since yesterday.  Environmental conditions <br/>
are forecast to be conducive for further development, and this <br/>
system is expected to become a tropical depression around midweek.  <br/>
Additional strengthening is likely late this week while the system <br/>
moves westward to west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the <br/>
central and western portions of the tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave over western Africa is forecast to move offshore in <br/>
a few days.  Environmental conditions could support some slow <br/>
development starting midweek while the wave moves to the west- <br/>
northwestward at about 15 mph over the far eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Gert Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
1100 AM AST Sun Sep 03 2023
 
Gert may finally be on the verge of weakening. Its low-level center
has become exposed to the northeast of a shrinking area of
convection. That said, Dvorak-based satellite intensity estimates
have not started to decrease quite yet, so the intensity estimate
remains 50 kt for this advisory. A drifting buoy just south of
Gert's center reported a minimum pressure of 999 mb at 1200 UTC,
which also supports a minimum pressure similar to previous NHC
estimates. Partial ASCAT or SAR data may be available later today to
provide additional information on Gert's wind field.
 
Gert is accelerating north-northeastward. Additional acceleration is 
expected as Gert begins its anticipated rotation around the much 
larger circulation of Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia, located to the 
northwest of Gert. As Gert quickly rotates northward around the 
eastern side of Idalia, all available dynamical guidance indicates 
Gert will weaken slightly and open into a trough. The NHC forecast 
maintains Gert as a tropical cyclone a little longer than the models 
since most of them seem to be having trouble initializing the small 
tropical storm appropriately. The NHC track, intensity, and wind 
radii forecasts are all very similar to the previous advisory.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Katia was
located near latitude 27.1 North, longitude 32.9 West. Katia is
moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general
motion with a gradual reduction in forward speed should continue
through Monday. Katia is forecast to drift through Wednesday over 
the eastern subtropical Atlantic.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Katia should weaken to a tropical depression overnight and 
degenerate into a remnant low on Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).

Tropical Storm Katia Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122023
900 PM GMT Sun Sep 03 2023

The center of Katia remains exposed on the latest satellite 
imagery, with a large convective burst in the northern semicircle 
noted this evening.  The intensity estimates are a split decision, 
with about half of data points suggesting tropical depression, and 
the other half still a tropical storm.  With the burst in 
convection, the initial wind speed is held at 35 kt, and there 
could be further clarity from partial scatterometer data this 
evening. A combination of southerly shear and very dry mid-level air 
should extinguish the thunderstorm activity early Monday and cause 
gradual weakening. The global models continue to show no organized 
thunderstorm activity by tomorrow, and Katia is likely to become a 
remnant low in 12-24 h.
 
The storm is holding steady on a northwest course at 6 kt. Katia 
is expected to be steered between a large middle- to upper- 
tropospheric cut-off low to the west over the central subtropical
Atlantic and a mid-level ridge to the east during the next 36 hours 
or so.  As Katia weakens, it should get trapped within the 
low-level subtropical ridge, causing little motion by Tuesday, and 
a southward drift by Wednesday. No significant changes were made to 
the NHC track or intensity forecasts.
