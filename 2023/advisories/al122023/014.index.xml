Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Mon Sep 4 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Katia, located over the eastern subtropical <br/>
Atlantic, and has issued the last advisory on the remnants of Gert, <br/>
located over the central subtropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Central Tropical Atlantic (AL95):<br/>
Satellite imagery indicates that an area of low pressure has formed <br/>
from the tropical wave centered about 700 miles west-southwest of <br/>
the Cabo Verde Islands. The low-level circulation has become better <br/>
defined since yesterday, with increasing organization in the shower <br/>
and thunderstorm activity. Environmental conditions are forecast to <br/>
be conducive for further development, and this system is expected to <br/>
become a tropical depression or a tropical storm in a day or two. <br/>
Additional strengthening is likely late this week while the system <br/>
moves westward to west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the <br/>
central and western portions of the tropical Atlantic. For <br/>
additional information on this system, including gale warnings, see <br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...near 100 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A strong tropical wave over western Africa is forecast to move off <br/>
the African coast in a couple of days. Environmental conditions <br/>
should support some slow development, and a tropical depression <br/>
could form over the far eastern tropical Atlantic around the latter <br/>
part of the week or the weekend while the wave moves to the <br/>
west-northwest at about 15 mph.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Northeastern Atlantic (ex-Franklin):<br/>
Post-Tropical Cyclone Franklin is located several hundred miles <br/>
north of the Azores and is forecast to move quickly southeastward <br/>
towards warmer waters east of Azores. This system could acquire some <br/>
subtropical or tropical characteristics late this week or this <br/>
weekend while it moves erratically between the Azores and Portugal. <br/>
For additional information on this system, including gale warnings, <br/>
see High Seas Forecasts issued by Meteo France.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Remnants Of Gert Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
1100 AM AST Mon Sep 04 2023
 
Visible satellite imagery indicates that Gert has dissipated. It is 
also no longer producing organized deep convection. Therefore, this 
is the final NHC advisory on Gert. 

SAR data around 0930 UTC indicated that the remnants of Gert were 
still producing winds near 45 kt, and that is the basis for the max 
wind analysis. The remnants of Gert will continue to move quickly 
around the circulation of Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia today. Gert 
will likely be fully absorbed by Idalia by tomorrow, so there does 
not appear to be any potential for another regeneration of Gert.

<title>Post-Tropical Cyclone Katia Forecast Discussion Number 14</title>

Post-Tropical Cyclone Katia Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122023
900 PM GMT Mon Sep 04 2023

The convection clock has run out on Katia with no organized 
thunderstorm activity for most of the day.  No additional organized 
convection is expected either due to very dry air aloft and 
continued shear. Thus, the system is declared post-tropical, and 
this is the last NHC advisory. The winds are set to 30 kt in 
accordance with an earlier scatterometer pass.

Katia isn't moving much now, and it is forecast to drift in a small 
clockwise loop over the next day or two within the subtropical 
ridge.  The remnants of the system should move a bit faster 
southward on Wednesday, gradually weakening due to the unfavorable 
environment, and open up into a trough within 3 days.

Additional information on this system can be found in High Seas
Forecasts issued by Meteo France under WMO header FQNT50 LFPW and
available on the web at
