Tropical Storm Gert Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
500 AM AST Sat Sep 02 2023
 
This morning's conventional satellite imagery and a recent AMSR2
microwave overpass indicate some improvement in the cloud pattern
overnight, although Gert's surface center remains near the 
northern edge of the convective canopy where the colder cloud top 
temperatures are evident.  The subjective and objective satellite 
intensity estimates have increased a bit during the past 6 hours, 
and the initial intensity is bumped up to 40 kt for this advisory.
 
Gert's intensity shouldn't change much during the next few days 
while the cyclone continues moving in a harsh northerly wind shear 
environment. Gert is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone 
during the next couple of days as indicated in the global 
models fields and their simulated infrared imagery forecasts.  
Afterwards, Gert is expected to become absorbed by Post-Tropical 
Idalia.  The official intensity forecast follows the IVCN intensity 
consensus aid through the period and indicates dissipation in 60 
hours.
 
Gert should commence a northward track later today while the
southerly peripheral steering flow of larger Idalia captures the
cyclone and a subtropical ridge builds westward over the central
tropical Atlantic.  There is quite a bit of along-track spread of 
the models, however, so the best solution for the NHC forecast 
track is to side with the consensus models, HCCA and TVCA through 
dissipation early this week.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM CVT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Katia was
located near latitude 23.9 North, longitude 29.7 West. Katia is
moving toward the north-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). A turn
to the northwest is expected today, and this general motion with a
decrease in forward speed is expected through Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Weakening is expected to begin by early Sunday, and the 
system could degenerate into a remnant low on Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).

<title>Tropical Storm Katia Forecast Discussion Number 5</title>

Tropical Storm Katia Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122023
200 PM CVT Sat Sep 02 2023

Satellite images indicate the center of Katia is on the southern 
side of a large central dense overcast.  Scatterometer data from 
this morning indicated maximum winds were at least 40-45 kt, and 
the latest TAFB Dvorak estimate was 45 kt.  The initial wind speed 
is raised to 45 kt from the last full advisory, similar to the 
morning update statement.

Katia continues moving north-northwestward, or 330/10 kt.  The 
motion should gradually bend toward the northwest today due to the 
storm moving between a large middle- to upper-level low to the west 
and a narrow mid-latitude ridge over the eastern Atlantic.  The 
northwestward motion is likely to continue until about Monday, when 
the system becomes weaker and Katia gets stuck in the low-level 
subtropical ridge.  The only notable change to the track forecast is 
that it has been adjusted to the east in the short-term due to the 
initial position and is very close to the previous one at the end.

The storm is probably near its peak intensity with all models 
showing an increase in dry mid-level air near the center later 
today.  Combined with moderate southerly shear, this should be 
enough to choke off deep convection in Katia's core and cause 
gradual weakening.  In about 2 days, the environment becomes quite 
dry, which should finish off any remaining thunderstorm activity, 
and Katia is forecast to degenerate into a remnant low at that time. 
The NHC intensity forecast is raised early on to reflect the higher 
initial wind speed and is blended back with the guidance by the end 
of the forecast period.

LOCATION...31.6N 64.4W
ABOUT 55 MI...85 KM SSE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ESE OR 105 DEGREES AT 6 MPH...9 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia
was located near latitude 31.6 North, longitude 64.4 West.  Idalia 
is moving toward the east-southeast near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected through today.  A faster northeastward 
motion is forecast to begin on Sunday, and this motion should
continue into Monday.  On the forecast track, Idalia will remain
near Bermuda today, and then begin to move away from the island
tonight and Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast during the next few
days. Idalia could transition to a subtropical storm later today.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles (350 km)
from the center.  A sustained wind of 46 mph (74 km/h) and a gust 
to 56 mph (91 km/h) were reported at St. George's Pier on Bermuda.  
An elevated observing site at the National Museum of Bermuda 
recently reported sustained winds of 64 mph (104 km/h) with a gust 
to 79 mph (128 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda through
early Sunday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 1 to 3
inches, or 25 to 75 millimeters, across Bermuda through the weekend.
The heavy rainfall may cause areas of flash and urban flooding on
the island.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia will affect the southeastern U.S.
coast and Bermuda during the next couple of days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
500 AM AST Sat Sep 02 2023
 
Although there has been an increase in convective activity 
associated with Idalia overnight, the cyclone remains attached to
a frontal boundary, and is therefore still analyzed as an
extratropical low.  The cyclone appears to have deepened slightly 
with the minimum pressure estimated to be around 999 mb, based on 
surface observations from Bermuda.  With the slight deepening, 
the initial wind speed has been increased to 50 kt.   Winds across 
Bermuda have increased overnight with the official observing site 
at the LF Wade International Airport reporting wind gusts as high 
as 43 kt.  Some of the elevated weather stations on the island 
have reported sustained tropical-storm-force winds.  

The global models indicate that little change in strength will 
occur during the next day or so.  The guidance also suggests that 
Idalia may not completely shed its frontal structure despite the 
presence of deep convection to the northeast of its center today. 
As a result, the official forecast now shows Idalia potentially 
becoming a subtropical cyclone for a fairly short period of time 
this weekend, but confidence in that is low.  Regardless of 
Idalia's status, tropical-storm-force winds will continue over 
Bermuda through tonight.  Later in the period, the cyclone should 
gradually weaken while it moves northward over the central 
Atlantic. 

The forward speed of Idalia has slowed considerably overnight, with 
the initial motion estimate of eastward or 090/5 kt.  A slow 
eastward motion is expected today, but a shortwave trough moving 
off the coast of the northeastern United States tonight should 
cause Idalia to begin moving northeastward on Sunday.  By late 
Monday the cyclone is expected to turn northward around the eastern 
side of a developing cut-off low south of Nova Scotia. The track 
guidance is in somewhat better agreement than it was a day ago, and 
the latest NHC track prediction is near the center of the model 
envelope. 

KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions will continue in Bermuda into tonight. 
Heavy rainfall may cause areas of flash and urban flooding on the 
island.
