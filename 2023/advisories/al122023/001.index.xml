Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Fri Sep 1 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Franklin, located several hundred miles northeast of Bermuda, on <br/>
Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia, located a few hundred miles west of <br/>
Bermuda, on Tropical Storm Jose, located several hundred miles <br/>
east-northeast of Bermuda, and has resumed advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Gert, located several hundred miles east-southeast of <br/>
Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Tropical Atlantic (AL94):<br/>
Recent microwave satellite images indicate the circulation of a low <br/>
pressure system located west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands has <br/>
become better defined since yesterday. In addition, the associated <br/>
shower and thunderstorm activity continues to show signs of <br/>
organization. Based on these trends, advisories are likely to be <br/>
initiated on a tropical depression or tropical storm later this <br/>
morning. The system is moving northwestward at 10 to 15 mph across <br/>
the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...near 100 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...near 100 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic:<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa <br/>
this weekend. Environmental conditions appear conducive for some <br/>
gradual development of this system during the early and middle <br/>
parts of next week, and a tropical depression could form while it <br/>
moves westward to west-northwestward over the eastern and central <br/>
portions of the tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>

Tropical Storm Jose Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL112023
1100 AM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
Deep convection is waning and becoming more asymmetric near the 
center of Jose on satellite imagery as northerly shear from 
Franklin's outflow increases. The low-level center is starting to 
become exposed. Jose's initial intensity is conservatively lowered 
to 45 kt for this advisory based on the automated Dvorak intensity 
estimate from UW-CIMSS and the degraded satellite structure of Jose. 
This lies near the average of the upper uncertainty bound from the 
CIMSS DMINT intensity estimate (which incorporated the overnight 
SSMIS microwave overpass) and the Dvorak estimates of 35 kt from 
TAFB and SAB. 

Jose is accelerating and the forward motion is currently estimated 
to be north-northeastward (15 degrees) at 20 kt. The increase in 
forward speed and interaction with Franklin could lead to a slight 
expansion of the tropical-storm-force winds on the east side of 
Jose. The tropical storm is expected to dissipate sometime tonight 
as it is absorbed by Franklin. The track forecast is slightly 
faster than the consensus aids based on the global model wind 
fields. Little intensity change is forecast as the fast forward 
speed of the system is likely to maintain stronger winds in the 
eastern semicircle, despite diminished convection.

Tropical Depression Gert Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
1100 AM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
Gert's structure hasn't changed much since it regenerated, and it
remains strongly sheared from the north. ASCAT is not expected to
sample Gert this morning, so the 30-kt intensity is based entirely
on a blend of Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB.
 
The tropical depression appears to have continued its eastward 
track this morning. For the next day or so, a continued eastward 
track is likely. After that, the uncertainty is quite large. Over 
the weekend, Gert will likely begin to gain latitude as its steering 
is influenced by the much larger Idalia to its northwest, and a 
ridge to its east. However, the models have pretty large differences 
in how fast Gert may move once it begins to turn. Regardless of its
exact track, by day 4, Gert should either become a poorly defined
post-tropical cyclone or be absorbed into the circulation of Idalia.
The NHC forecast is slower and farther south than the previous
advisory to remain near the multi-model consensus.
 
The shear currently affecting Gert will likely remain in place for
the next few days, which covers about the entirety that Gert is
expected to last as a tropical cyclone. Nonetheless, Gert is
already very near the threshold to become a tropical storm again,
and it would not take much increase in convection or organization
for that to happen. Later in the forecast period, Gert is forecast
to weaken and dissipate. Though there is a chance it could become
post-tropical without being absorbed into Idalia, if that happens
its low-level center will likely become poorly defined in the
process, still resulting in dissipation for the purposes of this
forecast.

Hurricane Franklin Discussion Number  48

1100 AM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
The latest satellite images of Franklin indicate the system is
gradually losing tropical characteristics. The inner circulation of
the system is exposed, with a curved band of deep convection
displaced to the east of its center by strong westerly shear. The
low-level center is also losing definition and appears more
elongated than yesterday. A cold front is racing southeastward
toward Franklin, with rope clouds evident in visible satellite
imagery over the northern Atlantic. Recent scatterometer data shows
peak winds of 55-60 kt to the west of the center, with a larger area
of 34-kt winds in the northwest quadrant due to the approaching
front. Based on these data, the initial intensity is set at 65 kt.
 
In the short term, Franklin appears likely to remain at or near
hurricane-force intensity due to baroclinic forcing while it merges
with a frontal system over the northern Atlantic. This scenario is
supported by all the global models, which show a narrow band of
strong winds persisting within the western portion of the
circulation during the next 12-24 h (consistent with the
aforementioned ASCAT data). Soon thereafter, the extratropical
cyclone is forecast to weaken as the low moves deeper into the
mid-latitudes and gradually fills. The updated NHC intensity
forecast lies between the GFS and ECMWF in the near term, and then
trends toward the multi-model consensus later in the period.
 
Franklin is moving northeastward (50 degrees/16 kt) within the flow
between a deep-layer trough over the northwestern Atlantic and a
subtropical ridge over the central Atlantic. A somewhat faster
motion to the northeast is anticipated during the next day or so,
followed by a continued northeastward to east-northeastward motion
into early next week. Through 72 h, the updated NHC forecast lies
close to the previous prediction. As discussed with prior forecasts,
track uncertainty grows beyond day 3 regarding how much interaction
will occur between Franklin and a larger cut-off low meandering over
the eastern Atlantic. The latest NHC track has been adjusted south
of the previous forecast at days 4-5, but future adjustments could
be necessary as it still lies north of the TVCA and HCCA aids.

At 200 PM CVT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Twelve
was located near latitude 19.6 North, longitude 28.3 West.  The
depression is moving toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 
km/h).  A motion toward the north-northwest and northwest at a 
faster forward speed is expected through Sunday.  A turn toward the 
west-northwest is forecast later on Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is expected, and the depression is forecast to 
become a tropical storm later today or this evening.  The system is 
likely to weaken early Sunday and degenerate to a remnant low by 
late Sunday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).

Tropical Depression Twelve Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122023
200 PM CVT Fri Sep 01 2023
 
The area of low pressure over the far eastern Atlantic to the 
northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands has developed a well-defined 
surface circulation with sufficiently organized deep convection to 
be classified as a tropical cyclone.  Dvorak classifications from 
TAFB and SAB are a consensus T2.5, but since the convection is 
loosely organized around the center, the initial intensity is 
started at 30 kt.

Sea surface temperatures of 27-28 degrees Celsius and low vertical 
shear during the next day or so should allow the depression to 
strengthen to a tropical storm later today or on Saturday.  However, 
the cyclone will be reaching marginally warm waters in 24-48 hours, 
and southerly shear is forecast to increase at about that same time. 
 The NHC forecast therefore shows weakening beginning in 48 hours, 
and the system is likely to degenerate into a remnant low by 60 
hours due to a loss of organized deep convection.  The remnant low 
is shown dissipating by day 4, following the majority of the global 
model fields.

The depression is moving toward the north-northwest (340 degrees) at 
7 kt between a mid-level ridge over western Africa and a mid- to 
upper-level low located over the eastern Atlantic.  The steering 
environment changes little during the next couple of days, and the 
depression is therefore expected to move toward the north-northwest 
or northwest, at a slightly faster speed, through 48 hours.  After 
the cyclone becomes a shallower remnant low, lower-level flow is 
expected to turn the system toward the west-northwest until it 
dissipates.  The track guidance is tightly clustered for the next 4 
days, and the NHC track forecast is very close to the HCCA consensus 
aid.

Watch for Bermuda to a Tropical Storm Warning.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Idalia was located near latitude 31.9 North, longitude 67.9 West.
Idalia is moving toward the east-southeast near 17 mph (28 km/h), 
and this general trajectory at a slower forward speed is expected 
through Saturday.  A turn toward the east and then northeast is 
forecast late Saturday and Sunday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Idalia will move near or to the south of Bermuda on 
Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual weakening is forecast through early Saturday.
Restrengthening is possible over the weekend, and Idalia is expected
to transition back to a tropical storm on Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda by
Saturday.
 
RAINFALL:  Idalia is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 3 to 5
inches, or 75 to 125 millimeters, across Bermuda through Sunday
night. The heavy rainfall will likely cause areas of flash and urban
flooding on the island.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia will affect the southeastern U.S.
coast and Bermuda during the next couple of days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia Discussion Number  24
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
1100 AM AST Fri Sep 01 2023
 
Idalia is not producing deep convection and remains an extratropical 
cyclone, with the strongest winds located along the northwestern 
side of the attached frontal boundary.  The initial intensity 
remains 50 kt based on continuity from the previous advisory.  
Scatterometer should hit the area of strongest winds later this 
morning and give us a better idea on the intensity.

The cyclone may be finally slowing down a bit, and the initial 
motion estimate is east-southeastward (110 degrees) at 15 kt.  
Additional deceleration is expected during the next 36 hours while 
the center turns eastward and moves near or to the south of 
Bermuda.  A shortwave trough is forecast to move off the coast of 
New England by early Sunday (about 48 hours), and that feature 
should turn Idalia toward the northeast at a faster speed by day 3. 
Even then, there is disagreement among the models whether this 
trough will pull Idalia quickly northward (e.g., the ECMWF) or if 
it will leave Idalia behind (e.g, the GFS).  The NHC track forecast 
therefore shows a slower north or north-northeast motion on days 4 
and 5, leaning toward the various consensus aids.
 
There remains significant uncertainty on what type of cyclone 
Idalia will be during the next 3 days.  On one hand, simulated 
satellite imagery from the GFS and ECMWF models shows deep 
convection redeveloping near Idalia's center on Saturday once the 
cyclone reaches warmer waters.  On the other hand, global model 
fields show the thickness gradient near the front weakening, but 
they don't necessarily show Idalia shedding all of its frontal 
features.  To maintain continuity from previous forecasts, the NHC 
forecast shows Idalia regaining tropical storm status in about 24 
hours while it is near Bermuda, and some reintensification is 
possible after that time.  Model fields show the temperature 
gradient tightening again as Idalia goes through a possible 
occlusion in 3-4 days, and the forecast therefore shows an 
extratropical cyclone again on day 4.  
 
Based on the updated forecast, the Bermuda Weather Service has 
issued a Tropical Storm Warning for the island.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected in Bermuda by Saturday.
Heavy rainfall will likely cause areas of flash and urban flooding 
on the island.
