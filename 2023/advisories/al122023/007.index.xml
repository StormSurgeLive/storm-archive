NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Sat Sep 2 2023<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Active Systems:<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Gert, located about 700 miles east-southeast of Bermuda, <br/>
Tropical Storm Katia, located about 750 miles north-northwest of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands, and has issued the last advisory on <br/>
Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia, located over 100 miles east of <br/>
Bermuda. <br/>
 <br/>
Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic (AL95):<br/>
A tropical wave located over the far eastern tropical Atlantic is <br/>
producing disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity to the <br/>
south of the Cabo Verde Islands.  Environmental conditions appear <br/>
conducive for some gradual development of this system by the middle <br/>
part of next week, and a tropical depression is likely to form while <br/>
it moves westward to west-northwestward at 15 to 20 mph over the <br/>
eastern and central portions of the tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Gert Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL062023
1100 PM AST Sat Sep 02 2023
 
Gert remains a resilient compact tropical storm in strong wind
shear conditions and has even managed to strengthen a little more.
The low-level center is partially exposed on the northeast side of
the main area of deep convection.  An ASCAT pass from around 00Z
showed peak winds in the 45-50 kt range in the southeast quadrant,
and based on that data, the initial wind speed is increased to 50
kt.  This value is above the latest satellite intensity estimates.
 
The tropical storm is moving north-northeastward at 5 kt.  This
motion with a gradual increase in forward speed is expected during
the next day or so as the system gets swept up by the much larger
circulation of Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia.  Most of the models
show Gert dissipating in a day or so, and the NHC forecast has now
moved up dissipation to 36 hours based on that guidance.

moving toward the north-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h).  A turn to
the northwest is expected shortly, and this general motion with a
decrease in forward speed is expected through Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Gradual weakening is expected, and the system could
degenerate into a remnant low on Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.

<title>Tropical Storm Katia Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Tropical Storm Katia Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122023
300 AM GMT Sun Sep 03 2023
 
Katia has noticeably weakened since the previous advisory.  Remnants
of convection appear to be separating from the low-level circulation
and no new bursts have formed in the past few hours.  Geostationary
satellite imagery suggests dry air likely has made its way into the
core of the storm.  Final T-numbers from TAFB and SAB were T3.0/45
and T1.5/25 .  The initial intensity has therefore been lowered to
40 kt.  Scatterometer data missed the center of the storm, but
measured the winds on the eastern half, revealing the radii of
tropical-storm-force winds had decreased.
 
Katia is once again moving north-northwestward at about 14 kt.  The
storm should turn back to the northwest shortly as it moves between
an upper-level low to the west and a narrow mid-latitude ridge over
the eastern Atlantic.  Model guidance suggests it should maintain
this heading at a decreased forward speed during the next couple of
days.  However, the cyclone has been moving to the east of the track
guidance envelope for the past several advisory cycles.  Beyond day
2, there is still considerable uncertainty in the motion, and
therefore location, of Katia or its remnants.  The latest NHC track
forecast has been shifted northward, largely due to the initial
storm position.
 
Model guidance still suggests Katia may have another burst of 
convection later today or Monday.  Environmental conditions are 
expected to become increasingly unfavorable, with strong-to-moderate 
vertical wind shear and dry mid-level humidities.  The official 
intensity forecast still shows gradual weakening through the 
forecast period and shows Katia becoming a remnant low in a couple 
of days, though this may occur sooner.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia Advisory Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
500 PM AST Sat Sep 02 2023
 
...TROPICAL STORM WARNING DISCONTINUED FOR BERMUDA, THIS IS THE
LAST NHC ADVISORY...
...DANGEROUS SURF AND RIP CURRENTS FROM IDALIA EXPECTED TO
CONTINUE ALONG THE U.S. EAST COAST THROUGH LABOR DAY WEEKEND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...32.0N 62.7W
ABOUT 125 MI...200 KM E OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 75 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...997 MB...29.44 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Bermuda Weather Service has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warning for Bermuda.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia
was located near latitude 32.0 North, longitude 62.7 West.  Idalia 
is moving toward the east-northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue through tonight.  A turn 
toward the northeast and then north at a faster forward speed is 
expected through early next week.  Idalia will continue moving away 
from Bermuda tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Idalia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml
 
WIND:  Gusts to tropical storm force are likely to continue on
Bermuda through tonight.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Idalia will affect the southeastern U.S.
coast and Bermuda during the next couple of days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system.  Additional information on this system can be 
found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, 
under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at

Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102023
500 PM AST Sat Sep 02 2023
 
Winds on Bermuda have been gradually decreasing since earlier this 
morning, and weather stations on the island are no longer measuring 
sustained tropical-storm-force winds (at standard elevation).  
Gusts to tropical storm force will likely continue on Bermuda into 
tonight while Idalia pulls away from the island, but the Bermuda 
Weather Service has elected to discontinue the Tropical Storm 
Warning in favor of local warnings.  Therefore, this will be the 
last NHC advisory on Idalia.

Earlier ASCAT showed that maximum winds remain 50 kt on the 
northwestern side of the attached frontal boundary.  Little change 
in strength is expected during the next few days.  The 
extratropical cyclone is likely to occlude again in about 3 days 
and begin to fill, at which point weakening is expected.  The NHC 
intensity forecast is between the HCCA and IVCN consensus aids.

Idalia appears to have turned toward the east-northeast, or 075/6 
kt.  A shortwave trough is expected to move off the coast of New 
England on Sunday, causing the cyclone to turn northeastward and 
the northward and speed up over the next 2-3 days.  Once it 
occludes, it is expected to slow down and meander to the southeast 
of Nova Scotia on days 4 and 5.

Additional information on this system can be found in High Seas
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Swells from Idalia are forecast to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions along portions of the east coast of the
United States through Labor Day weekend.

2. Gusts to tropical storm force are likely to continue on Bermuda 
through tonight.
