CHARLEY IS JUST BARELY A TROPICAL STORM...WITH ABOUT THE ONLY
EVIDENCE OF TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS REMAINING BEING THE RELATIVELY
SMALL WIND CORE THAT THE CYCLONE HAS POSSESSED SINCE IT FIRST
FORMED.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY OF 35 KT AND CENTRAL PRESSURE OF
1012 MB ARE BASED ON SURFACE OBSERVATIONS.  CHARLEY SHOULD BECOME
COMPLETELY EXTRATROPICAL IN 12 HR OR LESS.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 040/26.  CHARLEY SHOULD CONTINUE GENERALLY
NORTHEASTWARD UNTIL THE EXTRATROPICAL REMNANT LOSES ITS IDENTITY IN
A FRONTAL ZONE IN 72-96 HR.
