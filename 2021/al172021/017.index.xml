Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Thu Sep 23 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Rose, located about 1200 miles west-northwest of the Cabo <br/>
Verde Islands, and on Tropical Depression Eighteen, located about <br/>
2000 miles east-southeast of the northern Leeward Islands.<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center has issued the last advisory on the <br/>
remnants of Peter, located a few hundred miles north of Puerto Rico.<br/>
<br/>
A gale-force, non-tropical low pressure system, the remnants of <br/>
Odette, is located about 600 miles west-northwest of the westernmost <br/>
Azores.  Showers and thunderstorms have increased a little near the <br/>
low, and it could become a subtropical or tropical cyclone while it <br/>
moves generally southward over marginally warmer waters during the <br/>
next couple of days.  Strong upper-level winds are expected to <br/>
develop over the system this weekend, which should limit its <br/>
development.  Additional information on this system, including gale <br/>
warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National <br/>
Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the remnants of Peter were located near

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Peter will affect the Virgin Islands,
Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and portions of the Bahamas during the
next day or so.  These swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Remnants Of Peter Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 22 2021
 
Although a low-level swirl can still be seen in infrared satellite
imagery, this feature has continued to lose definition.  A recently 
arriving partial ASCAT-A overpass shows that the circulation has 
become more elongated, and Peter lacks a well-defined center.  In 
addition, the system has not produced any organized deep convection 
in quite some time.  The cloudiness and convective activity that has 
been occuring over the western Atlantic has been located along a 
trough axis well northeast of the decaying circulation center.  As a 
result, Peter no longer meets the definition of a tropical cyclone, 
and this will be the final NHC advisory on this system.  The initial 
intensity is set at 25 kt in accordance with the ASCAT data.  The 
remnants of Peter are expected to remain within an area of strong 
upper-level westerly winds, and further weakening should occur over 
the next day or two. 

The system has been moving slowly north-northwestward or 335/4 kt.  
A weakness in the low-level ridge should allow the remnants to turn 
northward tomorrow, and this general motion should continue through 
the end of the week. 

This is the last NHC advisory on this system. Additional information 
on the remnants of Peter can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued 
by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO 
header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php

Post-Tropical Cyclone Rose Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172021
900 AM GMT Thu Sep 23 2021
 
Rose has withered away.  The cyclone has not produced organized deep 
convection for nearly 24 hours now, and therefore, the system no 
longer meets the definition of a tropical cyclone. The initial 
intensity of the remnant low is held at 30 kt based on the earlier 
ASCAT data.
 
Rose is moving northwestward at 9 kt.  A turn to the north is
expected by tonight, followed by a northeast to east motion as the
shallow system moves in the low-level flow ahead of a deep-layer
trough.  The remnant low is expected to persist for a couple of
days and could produce intermittent bursts of deep convection.
However, west-northwesterly shear of 25-30 kt and dry mid-level air
should prevent the convection from organizing.
 
Additional information on Post-Tropical Cyclone Rose can be found in
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under
AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at

Tropical Depression Eighteen Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 22 2021
 
The depression's organization has not improved since earlier this 
afternoon.  An analysis of the ambiguities from 0000 UTC ASCAT-B 
data suggests that the surface circulation is just barely closed, 
with the center still attached to the northern end of a trough.  
Peak wind retrievals from the scatterometer pass were 25-30 kt, so 
the initial intensity remains 30 kt.

Based on the ASCAT data, the depression appears to be moving just 
north of due west, or 275/13 kt.  Low- to mid-level ridging to the 
north is expected to maintain the cyclone on a westward heading for 
the next 36 hours, followed by a path toward the west-northwest 
from day 2 through day 5.  The more notable part of the forecast is 
the forward speed.  Global models are showing anomalously strong 
500-mb ridging developing over the eastern and central Caribbean 
Sea in 2 to 3 days, which is likely to block the depression's 
forward progress toward the end of the forecast period.  In fact, 
the current NHC forecast has the system moving west-northwestward 
at only 7 or 8 kt well east of the Lesser Antilles on days 3 through 
5.  All this means that it will probably be a few more days before 
we have a better idea if and how the system might potentially 
threaten areas farther west.  For the 5-day forecast period, there 
is a normal amount of spread among the track guidance, and the 
updated NHC forecast is very close to a blend of the TVCA and HCCA 
consensus aids.  This solution is not too different from the 
previous forecast.
 
Overall, an environment of low shear, warm sea surface 
temperatures, and a moist, unstable atmosphere appears conducive 
for strengthening.  However, there is some sort of signal being 
conveyed by the global models (e.g., the GFS, ECMWF, and UKMET) 
whereby the cyclone's surface circulation does not really tighten 
up for another 24 to 48 hours.  Given the system's current 
structure, this scenario seems plausible.  Therefore, the updated 
NHC intensity forecast shows a slower rate of strengthening during 
the first 48 hours, just a bit below the intensity consensus in 
deference to the global model solutions.  After 48 hours, the 
official forecast converges on top of the previous NHC forecast and
