Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Mon Sep 20 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Peter, located a few hundred miles east of the northernmost <br/>
Leeward Islands, and on Tropical Storm Rose, located several hundred <br/>
miles west of the southernmost Cabo Verde Islands.<br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave located over the far eastern tropical Atlantic <br/>
several hundred miles southeast of the Cabo Verde Islands is <br/>
producing an area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  <br/>
Environmental conditions appear conducive for gradual development <br/>
over the next several days, and a tropical depression could form <br/>
later this week while the system moves westward at 10 to 15 mph <br/>
across the eastern and central tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A storm-force, non-tropical low pressure system, the remnants <br/>
of Odette, is located a couple of hundred miles southeast of <br/>
Newfoundland.  This low could acquire some subtropical <br/>
characteristics by the middle of this week as it moves slowly <br/>
eastward and then southeastward over warmer waters across the <br/>
north-central Atlantic Ocean.  Additional information on this <br/>
system, including storm warnings, can be found in High Seas <br/>
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

...RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT FINDS PETER HAS CHANGED LITTLE...
...TROPICAL STORM EXPECTED TO PASS NORTH OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS
EARLY THIS WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.1N 59.5W
ABOUT 245 MI...390 KM ENE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1005 MB...29.68 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Peter was
located near latitude 19.1 North, longitude 59.5 West. Peter is
moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). This
general motion is expected to continue during the next couple of
days, followed by a turn to the northwest with a decrease in
forward speed on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Slow weakening is forecast during the next several days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km),
primarily to the northeast of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Rainfall around the southern periphery of Tropical Storm 
Peter could produce rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches, with locally 
higher amounts possible, across portions of the Northern Leeward 
Islands, including the Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico 
through Tuesday. This rainfall may lead to areas of urban and small 
stream flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Peter are expected to affect the northern
Leeward Islands early this week, and then reach the Bahamas by
midweek.  These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Tropical Storm Peter Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
500 AM AST Mon Sep 20 2021
 
Peter is a strongly sheared tropical storm. Reconnaissance wind 
data, conventional satellite imagery, and passive microwave 
satellite data indicate that Rose's center is located just to the 
west of the deep convection. Data from the aircraft support holding 
the intensity at 45 kt for now based on 925-mb flight-level and SFMR 
winds of 53 kt and 41 kt, respectively, on their last leg when the 
aircraft came in from the northeast. The central pressure had 
also increased only slightly to 1006 mb.

Peter has continued to move west-northwestward, or 295/12 kt. There 
are no significant changes to the previous track forecast or 
reasoning. Rose is expected to move around the southwestern and 
western periphery of a subtropical ridge for the next couple of 
days, followed by a slow northward motion on days 3-5 as the 
cyclone moves through a weakness in the ridge induced by the 
southward-moving former Tropical Storm Odette. The new NHC track 
forecast is very similar to the previous advisory track, and lies 
just to the east of the tightly packed consensus track models. 
 
Some fluctuations in intensity will be possible during the next 
24-36 hours owing to 5-10 kt fluctuations in the magnitude and also 
the direction of the deep-layer vertical wind shear. However, by 48 
hours and beyond, a slow weakening trend is expected due to the 
shear increasing from the southwest and west-southwest of near 30 
kt. The new official intensity forecast is essentially just an 
update of the previous advisory, and closely follows the IVCN and 
HCCA intensity consensus models.
 
Based on the latest track, intensity, and wind radii forecasts, no
tropical storm watches or warnings are required for the northern
Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, or Puerto Rico at this time.
However, locally heavy rain is possible on Monday and Tuesday when
Peter is expected to pass to the north of these locations.
 
 
Key Messages:

Rainfall around the southern periphery of Tropical Storm Peter may 
lead to areas of urban and small stream flooding through Tuesday 
across Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Northern Leeward 
Islands.

<title>Tropical Storm Rose Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>

Tropical Storm Rose Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172021
1100 PM AST Sun Sep 19 2021
 
The center of Rose has been very difficult to locate in infrared 
satellite imagery this evening. However, an earlier ASCAT-A overpass 
as well as an SSMIS microwave image from around of the time of the 
previous advisory were both helpful in establishing the initial 
position, motion, and intensity of the tropical cyclone.  Rose's 
center is located on the eastern edge of the main convective mass 
due to some southeasterly shear.  The ASCAT ambiguity data revealed 
an area of 30-35 kt winds around the southeastern portion of the 
circulation, so the wind speed remains 35 kt for this advisory.  
This is also in agreement with subjective Dvorak T-numbers of T2.5 
form both SAB and TAFB.
 
The ASCAT data indicated that Rose is located slightly west of the
earlier estimates, and the initial motion estimate is now
northwestward or 320/14 kt.  The cyclone is forecast to move
generally northwestward during the next several days around the
southwestern and western portions of a subtropical ridge located
over the far eastern Atlantic. After day 4, a strong mid- to
upper-level trough over the north-central Atlantic should cause
Rose to turn northward.  The dynamical models are in reasonably 
good agreement through about 60-72 hours, but there is growing
east-to-west (cross-track) spread after that time. The NHC track 
forecast is not too different from the previous advisory, and lies 
close to the various consensus models in deference to the 
increasing model spread late in the period.
 
Rose has about 24 hours over warm waters and in low vertical wind 
shear conditions in which to strengthen, and the new NHC intensity 
forecast for that time is unchanged from before. After 24 hours, 
increasing westerly shear is likely to result in some gradual 
weakening.  A further increase in shear is anticipated by day 3 as 
Rose approaches the aforementioned trough.  This is likely to result 
in additional weakening, and Rose is forecast to weaken to a 
tropical depression by day 4.  Some of the global model guidance 
suggests that weakening could occur faster than indicated below, and 
it is possible that Rose will degenerate into a remnant low by the 
end of the forecast period.
