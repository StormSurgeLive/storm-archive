Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Mon Sep 20 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Peter, located about 150 miles northeast of the northern<br/>
Leeward Islands, and on Tropical Storm Rose, located over the <br/>
eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave located <br/>
several hundred miles south of the Cabo Verde Islands continue to <br/>
show some signs of organization, although recent satellite wind data <br/>
indicate that the system lacks a surface circulation. Upper-level <br/>
winds, however, are expected to become conducive for further <br/>
development during the next day or two, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form by Thursday or Friday while the system moves westward <br/>
at 10 to 15 mph across the eastern and central tropical Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A storm-force, non-tropical low pressure system, the remnants of <br/>
Odette, is located several hundred miles southeast of Newfoundland.  <br/>
This low could acquire some subtropical characteristics by the <br/>
middle of this week as it moves slowly southeastward over warmer <br/>
waters across the north-central Atlantic Ocean, before it moves <br/>
northward over cooler waters over the weekend.  Additional <br/>
information on this system, including storm warnings, can be found <br/>
in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and <br/>
online at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php<br/>

Tropical Storm Peter Advisory Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
500 PM AST Mon Sep 20 2021
 
...PETER REFUSES TO SUCCUMB TO STRONG WIND SHEAR...
...STORM EXPECTED TO PASS NORTH OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS EARLY THIS 
WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.0N 61.8W
ABOUT 150 MI...240 KM NE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1007 MB...29.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Peter was 
located near latitude 20.0 North, longitude 61.8 West. Peter is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). This general 
motion is expected to continue during the next day or so, followed 
by a turn to the northwest with a decrease in forward speed on 
Wednesday, and then a turn to the north by Wednesday night. On the 
forecast track, the center of Peter will pass north of the northern 
Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico through Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Slow weakening is forecast during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Rainfall around the southern periphery of Tropical Storm
Peter could produce rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches, with locally
higher amounts possible across portions of the Northern Leeward
Islands, including the Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico and
the northern portions of Hispaniola through Tuesday. This rainfall
may lead to areas of urban and small stream flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Peter are expected to affect the northern
Leeward Islands early this week, and then reach the Bahamas by
midweek.  These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Peter Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Tropical Storm Peter Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
500 PM AST Mon Sep 20 2021
 
Peter's evolution on satellite today is nearly a repeat of 
yesterday, with the deep convection having been stripped well east 
of the center in the morning and then redeveloping over and east of 
the center by the afternoon. An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft investigating Peter this morning and early afternoon 
provided data during a few different passes through the northeast 
quadrant that supported peak surface winds of 40-45 kt. Since the 
convection has returned it is reasonable to assume that no weakening 
has occurred since the aircraft departed the cyclone, and the 
initial advisory intensity remains 45 kt.
 
Vertical wind shear is forecast to remain near 30 kt for the next 
few days as Peter interacts with an upper trough to its west, so 
some weakening is anticipated during that time. By late in the 
forecast period, the shear should lessen somewhat as the cyclone 
lifts north of the upper trough. Therefore, slow strengthening is 
indicated by late this week. There remains a possibility that Peter 
does not survive the shear over the next few days. However, the 
storm thus far has shown some resiliency to the hostile environment. 
The latest NHC intensity forecast is little changed from the 
previous one and remains near the various intensity consensus 
solutions. 
 
Peter continues to move west-northwest but at a slightly slower pace 
of around 12 kt. The forecast track reasoning for the cyclone 
remains the same. The west-northwestward motion is forecast to 
continue for the next two days as the system remains to the 
southwest of a subtropical ridge. By Wednesday, Peter should slow 
down and turn northwest then north as it reaches a developing 
weakness in the ridge carved out by a mid-latitude trough moving 
across the northeastern United States. There were no significant 
changes to the track or the track guidance from the previous 
advisory, and the latest NHC track is closest to the TVCN and GFEX 
consensus tracks. 
 
Based on the latest track, intensity, and wind radii forecasts, no
tropical storm watches or warnings are required for the northern
Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, or Puerto Rico at this time.
However, locally heavy rain is possible today and Tuesday when
Peter is expected to pass to the north of these locations.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Rainfall around the southern periphery of Tropical Storm Peter
may lead to areas of urban and small stream flooding through
Tuesday across northern Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, the Virgin
Islands, and the Northern Leeward Islands.

<title>Tropical Storm Rose Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Tropical Storm Rose Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172021
1100 PM AST Mon Sep 20 2021
 
Although Rose's convective pattern does not appear to be as 
organized as it was earlier today, a couple of ASCAT overpasses this 
evening indicated that the tropical cyclone has strengthened since 
this morning. Both ASCAT-A and -B instruments detected 40-45 kt 
winds around the southeastern portion of the circulation, and the 
initial intensity was raised to 45 kt around 0000 UTC with the 
issuance of a Tropical Cyclone Update.  That intensity is maintained 
for this advisory, and it is also in agreement with subjective 
Dvorak data T-numbers of 3.0 from TAFB and SAB. 

The ASCAT data also indicated that the center of Rose is located to 
the west of the previous estimates, near the northwestern edge of 
the convective mass noted in satellite imagery.  As a result of the 
center re-location, the initial motion is a somewhat uncertain 
320/13 kt.  Although the short-term portion of the track forecast 
has been adjusted westward due to the more westward initial 
position, there has been no overall change in forecast track 
reasoning for this advisory.  Rose should continue northwestward 
around the western portion of a strong subtropical ridge during the 
next couple of days.  Beyond that time, a mid- to upper-level trough 
over the north-central Atlantic should cause Rose to recurve 
northward, then northeastward, and finally east-northeastward by the 
end of the forecast period.  The dynamical models are in general  
agreement on this scenario but there are some differences in how 
sharp Rose will turn, and how fast it will move northeastward late 
in the period.  The new NHC track forecast shows a somewhat sharper 
turn than the previous advisory to be closer to the latest consensus 
aids. 

Rose has likely reached its peak intensity as increasing shear and 
the entrainment of drier mid-level air are likely to cause weakening 
by this time tomorrow. Additional weakening is expected after that 
time as a further increase in shear is anticipated when Rose nears 
the aforementioned trough in 2 to 3 days. The updated NHC wind speed 
forecast is slightly stronger at 12 and 24 hours due to the higher 
initial intensity, but is unchanged after that time. Given the 
expected hostile environmental conditions, it would not be 
surprising to see Rose wither more quickly and degenerate into a 
remnant low sooner than indicated below.  That is indicated by at 
least some of the global model guidance.
