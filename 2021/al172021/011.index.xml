Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Tue Sep 21 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Peter, located more than 100 miles northeast of Puerto Rico, <br/>
and on Tropical Storm Rose, located over the eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
A small but concentrated area of showers and thunderstorms is <br/>
redeveloping along a tropical wave located a few hundred miles <br/>
southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands. Environmental conditions are <br/>
expected to become more conducive for development, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form by Thursday or Friday while the system <br/>
moves westward at 10 to 15 mph across the eastern and central <br/>
tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A gale-force, non-tropical low pressure system, the remnants of <br/>
Odette, is located about 700 miles west-northwest of the westernmost <br/>
Azores. This low could acquire some subtropical characteristics over <br/>
marginally warm waters during the next few days while it executes a <br/>
small cyclonic loop over the north-central Atlantic Ocean. However, <br/>
by the end of the week, this system is expected to encounter more <br/>
hostile environmental conditions. Additional information on this <br/>
system, including gale warnings, can be found in High Seas <br/>
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and <br/>

...PETER WEAKENING AS IT PASSES BY NORTH OF PUERTO RICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.9N 64.7W
ABOUT 155 MI...255 KM NW OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 140 MI...220 KM NE OF SAN JUAN PUERTO RICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1008 MB...29.77 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Peter was 
located near latitude 19.9 North, longitude 64.7 West. Peter is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A 
west-northwest motion is expected to continue today.  A turn to the 
north with a decrease in forward speed is expected beginning 
tomorrow.  On the forecast track, the center of Peter is currently 
passing north of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico today and 
should move well east of the southeastern Bahamas during the next 
few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with
higher gusts. Additional weakening is forecast over the next several
days. Peter is expected to weaken to a tropical depression by
tonight and then degenerate to a remnant low by Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Rainfall around the southern periphery of Tropical Storm
Peter could produce additional rainfall totals of 1 to 4 inches,
with storm total accumulations up to 6 inches, across portions of
the Northern Leeward Islands, including portions of the Virgin
Islands, as well as Puerto Rico and the northern portions of
Hispaniola through Thursday morning. This rainfall may lead to areas
of urban and small stream flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Peter are affecting the northern Leeward
Islands and Puerto Rico, and will continue spreading westward to
Hispaniola later today and the Bahamas on Wednesday.  These swells
could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Peter Forecast Discussion Number 12</title>

Tropical Storm Peter Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
1100 AM AST Tue Sep 21 2021
 
Like the last several days, this morning's visible satellite
imagery indicates that Peter has become increasingly detached
from the remaining fragmented convection that is firing more than
100 n mi east of the center. An Air Force Reserve Reconnaissance
aircraft has been sampling the storm this morning and so far has
yet to find any flight level (925 mb) or SFMR winds above tropical
storm force, although they weren't able to fly the full pattern in
the northeastern quadrant. The initial intensity has been lowered
to 35 kt for this advisory, though the data so far suggests this
estimate is generous.
 
After taking a jog to the west overnight, Peter appears to have
resumed a slower west-northwest motion at 290/8 kt. Over the next
several days, Peter is expected to continue to slow down as it
gradually turns to the north and then north-northeast as a
deep-layer cyclone to the north is forecast to create a weakness in
the current low-level ridging. The track guidance is in general
agreement with this scenario, but differences remain in how sharp
this rightward turn will be. The latest NHC track forecast has
elected to stay close to the track consensus models TVCN and HCCA,
and is a bit right of the previous track.
 
After holding its own against a fairly hostile upper-level wind
environment during the last 24-48 hours, Peter appears to finally
be succumbing to the combination of 25-30 kt of deep-layer vertical
wind shear helping to import sub-50 percent mid-level relative
humidity over the center. This shear is not forecast to abate for
the next 36-48 hours, and it now appears likely Peter will not be
able to survive this unfavorable environment. The latest NHC
intensity forecast now weakens Peter to a tropical depression in 12
hours, and degenerates it to a remnant low in 48 hours. However,
given the current fragile state of the low-level circulation, it is
distinctly possible that Peter may open up into a trough even sooner
in the next 24-48 hours.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Rainfall around the southern periphery of Tropical Storm Peter
could lead to areas of urban and small stream flooding through
today across northern Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, portions of the
Virgin Islands, and the Northern Leeward Islands.

Tropical Storm Rose Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172021
500 PM AST Tue Sep 21 2021

Shear continues to disrupt Rose's deep convection, with only a 
small cluster remaining in the eastern quadrant of the storm.  
Dvorak estimates support holding the intensity at 35 kt for one 
more advisory, and hopefully the evening scatterometer passes will 
get a good look at the cyclone's wind field.
 
Rose is moving more slowly to the northwest, now about 10 kt.  The 
storm should gradually turn northward during the next couple of 
days around the southwestern side of a subtropical ridge. Somewhat 
surprisingly, guidance has shifted westward during this time, 
perhaps due to a weaker Rose not feeling as much of the 
southwesterly flow aloft.  This westward shift in the track also 
puts Rose in a position to either get shunted east like the ECMWF 
solution, or uprooted more to the northeast at long range similar to 
the GFS.  Given the recent and large model changes since the last 
cycle, this forecast conservatively moves westward toward the model 
mean at most time ranges, not too far from a 50/50 blend of the 
GFS/ECMWF models (GFEX).

The cyclone has a difficult environment ahead, with persistent 
moderate westerly or northwesterly shear, plentiful dry air aloft 
and only marginally warm waters.  All of the guidance shows Rose 
decaying into a tropical depression fairly soon, and it could even 
wither into a remnant low tomorrow or Thursday in the harsh 
conditions.  However, the shear could let up just enough, along with 
some upper divergence from an upcoming trough interaction, to 
continue to produce deep convection for a few days.  This isn't an 
easy forecast because some of the guidance actually re-intensifies 
Rose due to the trough, while other guidance completely dissipates 
the tropical cyclone.  Given the considerable uncertainty, I've kept 
the previous forecast the same at long range until more clarity 
emerges in the model suite.
