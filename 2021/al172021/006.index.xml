Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Mon Sep 20 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Peter, located east-northeast of the northernmost Leeward <br/>
Islands, and on Tropical Storm Rose, located over the eastern <br/>
tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave located over the far eastern tropical Atlantic <br/>
several hundred miles south-southeast of the Cabo Verde Islands <br/>
is producing an area of showers and thunderstorms that are showing <br/>
some signs of organization.  Upper-level winds are expected to <br/>
become more conducive for further development by midweek, and a <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form by Friday while the system <br/>
moves westward at 10 to 15 mph across the eastern and central <br/>
tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A storm-force, non-tropical low pressure system, the remnants <br/>
of Odette, is located a couple of hundred miles southeast of <br/>
Newfoundland.  This low could acquire some subtropical <br/>
characteristics by the middle of this week as it moves slowly <br/>
southeastward over warmer waters across the north-central Atlantic <br/>
Ocean before moving northward out of the area over the weekend.  <br/>
Additional information on this system, including storm warnings, can <br/>
be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather <br/>
Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and <br/>
online at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php<br/>

Tropical Storm Peter Advisory Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
500 AM AST Mon Sep 20 2021
 
...RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT FINDS PETER HAS CHANGED LITTLE...
...TROPICAL STORM EXPECTED TO PASS NORTH OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS
EARLY THIS WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.1N 59.5W
ABOUT 245 MI...390 KM ENE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1005 MB...29.68 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Peter was
located near latitude 19.1 North, longitude 59.5 West. Peter is
moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). This
general motion is expected to continue during the next couple of
days, followed by a turn to the northwest with a decrease in
forward speed on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Slow weakening is forecast during the next several days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km),
primarily to the northeast of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Rainfall around the southern periphery of Tropical Storm 
Peter could produce rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches, with locally 
higher amounts possible, across portions of the Northern Leeward 
Islands, including the Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico 
through Tuesday. This rainfall may lead to areas of urban and small 
stream flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Peter are expected to affect the northern
Leeward Islands early this week, and then reach the Bahamas by
midweek.  These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Tropical Storm Peter Discussion Number   7...Corrected
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
500 AM AST Mon Sep 20 2021

Corrected name of storm in first and second paragraphs
 
Peter is a strongly sheared tropical storm. Reconnaissance wind 
data, conventional satellite imagery, and passive microwave 
satellite data indicate that Peter's center is located just to the 
west of the deep convection. Data from the aircraft support holding 
the intensity at 45 kt for now based on 925-mb flight-level and 
SFMR winds of 53 kt and 41 kt, respectively, on their last leg when 
the aircraft came in from the northeast. The central pressure had 
also increased only slightly to 1006 mb.

Peter has continued to move west-northwestward, or 295/12 kt. There 
are no significant changes to the previous track forecast or 
reasoning. Peter is expected to move around the southwestern and 
western periphery of a subtropical ridge for the next couple of 
days, followed by a slow northward motion on days 3-5 as the 
cyclone moves through a weakness in the ridge induced by the 
southward-moving former Tropical Storm Odette. The new NHC track 
forecast is very similar to the previous advisory track, and lies 
just to the east of the tightly packed consensus track models. 
 
Some fluctuations in intensity will be possible during the next 
24-36 hours owing to 5-10 kt fluctuations in the magnitude and also 
the direction of the deep-layer vertical wind shear. However, by 48 
hours and beyond, a slow weakening trend is expected due to the 
shear increasing from the southwest and west-southwest of near 30 
kt. The new official intensity forecast is essentially just an 
update of the previous advisory, and closely follows the IVCN and 
HCCA intensity consensus models.
 
Based on the latest track, intensity, and wind radii forecasts, no
tropical storm watches or warnings are required for the northern
Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, or Puerto Rico at this time.
However, locally heavy rain is possible on Monday and Tuesday when
Peter is expected to pass to the north of these locations.
 
 
Key Messages:

Rainfall around the southern periphery of Tropical Storm Peter may 
lead to areas of urban and small stream flooding through Tuesday 
across Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Northern Leeward 
Islands.

Tropical Storm Rose Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172021
500 AM AST Mon Sep 20 2021
 
Rose remains a sheared tropical storm with the low-level center 
located near the eastern edge of the convective cloud mass based on 
an earlier 0359Z AMSR2 microwave overpass. These same data also 
revealed that a well-defined mid-level circulation center was 
located about 80-90 nmi west of the low-level center, an indication 
of the magnitude and effect of the mid-level shear impinging on the 
cyclone. The intensity of 35 kt is being maintained for this 
advisory based on subjective Dvorak satellite intensity estimates of 
35 from both TAFB and SAB. Objective estimates from UW-CIMSS are 
higher at 45-55 kt, which are considered to be unrepresentative due 
to the severe westward tilt of Rose's vortex column.
 
The initial motion estimate is northwestward or 315/13 kt.  Rose is 
expected to move generally northwestward around the southwestern and 
western periphery of a strong subtropical ridge during the next few 
days.  By day 4 and beyond, a mid- to upper-level trough over the 
north-central Atlantic is forecast to dig southeastward, causing the 
cyclone to turn northward.  The latest NHC model guidance remains in 
excellent agreement on this track scenario through 72 hours, but 
then diverge significantly thereafter owing to whether Rose weakens 
to shallow system or remains a little stringer and deeper. The 
weaker solutions go more toward the northwest and the stronger 
solutions take Rose northeastward. The NHC forecast track on days 4 
and 5 is a blend of these two extremes. 
 
Rose only has about 24 hours over warm waters and in a weak vertical 
wind shear regime that will allow for some addition strengthening to 
occur. On days 2-5, however, increasing westerly shear is expected 
to induce some gradual weakening.  Rose is forecast to weaken to a 
tropical depression by 96 hours, although some of the models suggest 
that weakening could occur faster than indicated below, and that 
Rose could degenerate into a remnant low by the end of the forecast 
period.
