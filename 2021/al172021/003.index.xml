Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Sun Sep 19 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Peter, located several hundred miles east of the northernmost <br/>
Leeward Islands, and on Tropical Depression Seventeen, located a few <br/>
hundred miles west-southwest of the southernmost Cabo Verde Islands.<br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave located along the west coast of Africa is forecast <br/>
to emerge offshore this evening.  Environmental conditions appear <br/>
conducive for gradual development over the next several days, and a <br/>
tropical depression could form late this week as it moves westward <br/>
at 10 to 15 mph across the eastern and central tropical Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A gale force non-tropical low pressure system, the remnants of <br/>
Odette, is located a few hundred miles south of Newfoundland.  This <br/>
system could acquire some subtropical or tropical characteristics <br/>
by the middle of this week as it moves slowly eastward and then <br/>
southeastward over warmer waters across the north-central Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.  Additional information on this system, including storm <br/>
warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the <br/>
National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Peter was
located near latitude 17.6 North, longitude 56.5 West. Peter is
moving toward the west-northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h), and this 
general motion along with a gradual decrease in forward speed is 
is expected through Tuesday. A turn to the northwest is expected 
to occur by Wednesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Peter 
is expected to pass well north of the Leeward Islands on Monday and 
Tuesday.
 
Based on data from a Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft, 
maximum sustained winds remain near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast through today. Some 
slight weakening is expected tonight into Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km), 
primarily northeast of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on the aircraft data 
is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  The outer bands south of the tropical storm could produce
rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches with locally higher amounts
possible across portions of the Northern Leeward Islands, including
the Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico late today through
Tuesday. This rainfall may lead to areas of urban and small stream
flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tropical Storm Peter are expected to
reach the northern Leeward Islands tonight and Monday.  These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Tropical Storm Peter Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>

Tropical Storm Peter Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
1100 AM AST Sun Sep 19 2021
 
Earlier this morning, Peter began to encounter increasing 
southwesterly shear emanating from flow around an upper-level 
trough to its northwest. This shear caused the low-level center of 
the storm to separate from the deep convection and as of now is 
located over 100 n mi from the edge of that band of convection. An 
Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft has been investigating 
the cyclone for the past few hours and has provided helpful data on 
the structure and intensity of Peter. Based on the aircraft data, 
tropical-storm-force winds extend at least 100 n mi to the northeast 
of the center, while there are no tropical-storm-force winds in the 
southern semicircle. The initial intensity of 40 kt is based on 
aircraft passes through the northeastern quadrant that measured 
peak 925 mb flight-level winds of 56 and 54 kt. 

The initial motion is 290/15 kt. Peter is forecast to continue to 
move in this west-northwestward direction for the next couple of 
days as it is steered to the south of a subtropical ridge. This 
ridge is expected to weaken in a few days which should cause the 
cyclone to turn northwestward. Late in the forecast period a turn to 
the north and possibly northeast is expected to occur as Peter gets 
caught in the flow around a large trough to its north. As mentioned 
in the special advisory discussion a couple hours ago, a shift to 
the west-southwest of the track was required to accommodate a 
initial position adjustment. Some additional southward adjustments 
were made to the official NHC track for this advisory to come into 
better agreement with a blend of the GFS/ECMWF solutions that also 
indicate a shallower system. 

The UW-CIMSS shear analysis suggests about 20 kt of southwesterly 
shear is impacting Peter. Just to its west and northwest, where the 
cyclone is heading, the shear is analyzed as 30 kt or greater. 
Given that Peter is already exhibiting the structure of a highly 
sheared tropical cyclone, some slight weakening is now forecast 
tonight into tomorrow. There is quite a bit of spread in the 
environmental forecast between the GFS and ECMWF beyond day 3, as 
the GFS shows shear increasing to 40 kt, while the ECMWF indicates 
a less hostile environment with 20 kt of shear. Assuming Peter 
survives its interaction with the upper trough to its northwest 
over the next few days, additional weakening is indicated 
due to the ongoing shear. It should be noted that quite a few GFS 
ensemble members open Peter into a trough by the end of the 
forecast period. The latest NHC intensity forecast is near the 
various consensus solutions. However, due to the possibility the 
cyclone may not survive the next few days, the confidence in this 
forecast is lower than normal. 

Based on the track, intensity, and wind radii forecast, no tropical
storm watches or warnings are required for the northern Leeward
Islands, Virgin Islands or Puerto Rico.  However, interests there
should monitor the progress of the system as locally heavy rain is
possible on Monday and Tuesday when it is expected to pass to the
north of the area.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Rainfall around the southern periphery of Tropical Storm Peter 
may lead to areas of urban and small stream flooding from late today 
into Tuesday across Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the 
Northern Leeward Islands.

Tropical Depression Seventeen Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172021
200 PM CVT Sun Sep 19 2021

The low-level center of the depression was exposed on visible 
satellite imagery this morning but recently a new burst has formed. 
Since the morning scatterometer passes missed the depression, the 
intensity is held at 30 kt based on consensus T-2.0 values from TAFB 
and SAB. 

The initial motion estimate is 330/12.  The cyclone is forecast to 
move in a general northwestward direction throughout the remainder 
of the forecast period as the system moves along the southwestern 
and western periphery of a subtropical ridge that extends westward 
from Africa across the Cabo Verde Islands.  No significant changes 
were made to the previous NHC forecast track, and the new 
prediction lies near the middle of the tightly clustered track 
models.

Environmental conditions are conducive for strengthening during the 
next day or so, with wind shear forecast to drop off later today.  
Thus, the official forecast calls for strengthening during the next 
24 hours, and is close to the lower half of the intensity guidance 
envelope, near the weaker global models.  This forecast could be 
conservative, since SSTs will be near 27C and mid-level atmospheric 
moisture will be enough to support intensification.  By 36-48 hours, 
the southwesterly shear will increase, which should end the 
opportunity for strengthening, and will likely cause slow weakening. 
The models hold onto this system through the 5 day period, but it is 
possible that the cyclone could become a remnant low in 4-5 days if 
the shear is too much for the system to handle.
