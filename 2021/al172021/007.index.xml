Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Mon Sep 20 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Peter, located northeast of the northernmost Leeward <br/>
Islands, and on Tropical Storm Rose, located over the eastern <br/>
tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave located<br/>
several hundred miles south of the Cabo Verde Islands are <br/>
still showing some signs of organization, although there does not <br/>
appear to be a surface circulation at this time.  Upper-level <br/>
winds, however, are expected to become conducive for further <br/>
development by midweek, and a tropical depression is likely to form <br/>
by Thursday or Friday while the system moves westward at 10 to 15 <br/>
mph across the eastern and central tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A storm-force, non-tropical low pressure system, the remnants <br/>
of Odette, is located a few hundred miles southeast of <br/>
Newfoundland.  This low could acquire some subtropical <br/>
characteristics by the middle of this week as it moves slowly <br/>
southeastward over warmer waters across the north-central Atlantic <br/>
Ocean before moving northward over cooler waters over the weekend.  <br/>
Additional information on this system, including storm warnings, can <br/>
be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather <br/>
Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and <br/>
online at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php<br/>

Tropical Storm Peter Advisory Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
1100 AM AST Mon Sep 20 2021
 
...PETER BATTLING INCREASINGLY HOSTILE WIND SHEAR...
...TROPICAL STORM EXPECTED TO PASS NORTH OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS
EARLY THIS WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.5N 60.9W
ABOUT 170 MI...275 KM ENE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1007 MB...29.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Peter was
located near latitude 19.5 North, longitude 60.9 West. Peter is
moving toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h). This
general motion is expected to continue during the next couple of
days, followed by a turn to the northwest with a decrease in
forward speed on Wednesday. On the forecast track, the center of 
Peter will pass north of the northern Leeward Islands and Puerto 
Rico through Tuesday. 
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that the maximum sustained remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Slow weakening is forecast during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on aircraft data is 
1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Rainfall around the southern periphery of Tropical Storm
Peter could produce rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches, with locally
higher amounts possible, across portions of the Northern Leeward
Islands, including the Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico and
the northern portions of Hispaniola through Tuesday. This rainfall
may lead to areas of urban and small stream flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Peter are expected to affect the northern
Leeward Islands early this week, and then reach the Bahamas by
midweek.  These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Tropical Storm Peter Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
1100 AM AST Mon Sep 20 2021
 
West-southwesterly vertical wind shear on the order of 30 kt is 
pummeling Peter this morning. Just like yesterday morning, the 
low-level center of the storm is pulling away from the deep 
convection and is now displaced greater than 80 n mi. An Air Force 
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft has been investigating Peter this 
morning and has measured peak 925-mb flight-level winds of 54 kt 
and several SFMR values of 40-45 kt, supporting keeping the initial 
intensity at 45 kt for this advisory.  

Peter refuses to slow down, and for the past several hours has been 
moving 290/14 kt. This west-northwestward motion is forecast to 
continue for the next two days as the system remains to the 
southwest of a subtropical ridge. By Wednesday, Peter should slow 
down and turn northwest then north as it reaches a developing 
weakness in the ridge carved out by a mid-latitude trough 
moving across the northeastern United States later this week. The 
model track guidance has shifted slightly left for the 24-72 h time 
frames, and the NHC forecast track was nudged in that direction as 
well. Otherwise, the latest NHC forecast track is little changed 
from the previous one. 

An upper-level trough to the west of Peter is forecast to remain 
near the cyclone for the next few days, keeping the storm in a 
high-shear environment. Therefore, despite being over warm waters 
the storm is forecast to slowly weaken. If Peter survives the next 
72 h, there could be a window of opportunity late in the forecast 
period for some modest strengthening as the cyclone would have 
lifted to the north of the upper trough. It should be noted that a 
vast majority of the GFS ensembles show Peter dissipating later this 
week as the system opens into a wave. This scenario is plausible, 
especially if deep convection fails to persist near the center of 
the cyclone. The latest NHC intensity forecast assumes Peter 
survives, and closely follows the various intensity consensus 
solutions.
 
Based on the latest track, intensity, and wind radii forecasts, no
tropical storm watches or warnings are required for the northern
Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, or Puerto Rico at this time.
However, locally heavy rain is possible today and Tuesday when
Peter is expected to pass to the north of these locations.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Rainfall around the southern periphery of Tropical Storm Peter 
may lead to areas of urban and small stream flooding through 
Tuesday across northern Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, the Virgin 
Islands, and the Northern Leeward Islands.

<title>Tropical Storm Rose Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Rose Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172021
1100 AM AST Mon Sep 20 2021

While a cursory look at visible satellite images would suggest Rose 
is intensifying, other data show that it remains a sheared storm.  
The low- and mid-level centers remain roughly 90 n mi apart 
according to SSMIS microwave, and a 1038Z ASCAT-A scatterometer 
pass showed no significant change in intensity overnight.  The 
current wind speed is kept at 35 kt, with a much heavier weight on 
the 30-kt scatterometer pass than Dvorak estimates near 55 kt.  This 
is a good example of the value of the scatterometer which can tell 
the forecaster much more about the surface winds that conventional 
satellite estimates can miss (even if the data is possibly too low 
with all the thunderstorm activity).

There are a lot of thorns in the way of Rose blossoming into a 
stronger storm.  Increasing shear and drier mid-level air are on 
the way for tonight, competing against the somewhat warm SSTs.  
Thus Rose has about a day to flower into a moderate tropical storm, 
and no significant change was made to the short term forecast.  At 
longer range, stronger shear and dry air should pull the petals off 
Rose one-by-one, causing the cyclone to slowly weaken.  The new 
forecast is similar to the previous one, with some small 5-kt 
downward adjustments.  Rose could even shrivel up into a remnant 
low by day 5, but that's not shown yet in the forecast.

The initial motion remains northwestward at about 14 kt.  Rose is 
still expected to move generally northwestward around the 
southwestern and western periphery of a strong subtropical ridge 
during the next few days.  Around day 3, however, a mid- to 
upper-level trough over the north-central Atlantic is forecast to 
dig southeastward, causing the cyclone to turn northward and 
eventually northeastward by the weekend.  Guidance is in much 
better agreement on this scenario than the last cycle (though 
there are still some westward model solutions), and the new NHC 
track forecast is shifted northeastward at long range.
