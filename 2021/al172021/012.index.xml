Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Tue Sep 21 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Peter, located a couple of hundred miles northeast <br/>
of Puerto Rico, and on Tropical Storm Rose, located about 1000 <br/>
miles west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands. <br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave located <br/>
several hundred miles southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands have <br/>
increased since this morning and are beginning to show signs of <br/>
organization. Recent satellite wind data also indicate that a broad <br/>
area of low pressure has formed, but the system lacks a well-defined <br/>
center. Environmental conditions are expected to remain conducive <br/>
for additional development, and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form within the next day or two while the system moves westward at <br/>
10 to 15 mph across the eastern and central tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A gale-force, non-tropical low pressure system, the remnants of <br/>
Odette, is located about 500 miles west of the westernmost Azores. <br/>
This low could acquire some subtropical characteristics over <br/>
marginally warm waters during the next few days while it executes a <br/>
small counter-clockwise loop over the north-central Atlantic Ocean. <br/>
However, by the end of the week, this system is expected to <br/>
encounter more hostile environmental conditions.  Additional <br/>
information on this system, including gale warnings, can be found in <br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and <br/>

...PETER NOW A TROPICAL DEPRESSION...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.5N 65.0W
ABOUT 160 MI...260 KM NNE OF SAN JUAN PUERTO RICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1009 MB...29.80 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Peter 
was located near latitude 20.5 North, longitude 65.0 West. The 
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). 
A turn to the north with a decrease in forward speed is expected 
beginning tomorrow.  On the forecast track, the center of Peter will 
remain well north of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico tonight and 
should move well east of the southeastern Bahamas during the next 
few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Additional gradual weakening is forecast over the next 
several days, and Peter could degenerate into a remnant low by 
Thursday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1009 mb (29.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Rainfall around the southern periphery of Tropical 
Depression Peter could produce additional rainfall totals of 1 to 4 
inches, with storm total accumulations up to 6 inches, across 
portions of the Northern Leeward Islands, including portions of the 
Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico and the northern portions of 
Hispaniola through Thursday morning. This rainfall may lead to areas 
of urban and small stream flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Peter are affecting the northern Leeward
Islands and Puerto Rico, and will continue spreading westward to
Hispaniola this evening and the Bahamas on Wednesday.  These swells
could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Tropical Depression Peter Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
500 PM AST Tue Sep 21 2021
 
Like clockwork compared to prior days, deep convection has reignited 
closer to the increasingly elongated low-level circulation of Peter. 
Despite this increase in convective coverage, there does not appear 
to be much if any organization to this activity, with the 
upper-level cirrus taking on the appearance of a shapeless blob. In 
addition, an earlier 1157 UTC ASCAT-A pass received just after the 
prior advisory showed a peak wind retrieval of only 29 kt, well to 
the north of the low-level circulation. Furthermore, NOAA buoy 
41043, located north of the center of Peter, has been observing peak 
1-minute sustained winds between 20-25 kt over the last 6 hours. 
These lower winds, in combination with the lack of tropical storm 
force winds observed by the earlier Air Force Reserve Reconnaissance 
mission provide enough justification to downgrade Peter to a 
tropical depression this advisory with maximum sustained winds of 30 
kt.
 
The ongoing afternoon convection appears to have slowed down the 
forward motion of Peter a bit this afternoon, but the heading 
remains off to the west-northwest at 300/7 kt. Peter is still 
expected to gradually move to the west-northwest in the short term, 
followed by a somewhat sharp turn to the north and north-northeast 
as a weakness in the low-level flow develops from a deep-layer 
trough positioned near Bermuda. Similar to this morning, the 
guidance is in general agreement on this solution, with some cross- 
and along-track spread. The latest NHC track forecast is just a bit 
more right compared to the previous advisory, leaning a bit closer 
to the consensus aids which have also shifted a bit right this 
advisory. 
 
Peter's convective activity is unlikely to help improve the 
increasingly elongated vortex, mainly because the convection is 
likely to entrain dry mid-level air that often results in cool 
downdrafts disrupting the low-level cyclonic circulation more than 
helping. With deep-layer shear between 25-35 kt expected to persist 
for the next 36 hours in both the GFS- and ECMWF-SHIPS guidance, 
gradual weakening is likely to continue. By 36 hours, while 
intermittent bursts of deep convection will remain possible over 
warm sea-surface temperatures, both the GFS and ECMWF forecast 
simulated IR brightness temperatures show the convection becoming 
increasingly disorganized and unlikely to sustain Peter's status as 
a tropical cyclone. Thus, the cyclone is now forecast to become a 
remnant low in 36 hours. However, given that Peter's circulation is 
becoming increasingly elongated, it is also possible the system may 
open up into a trough even before this time period.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Rainfall around the southern periphery of Tropical Depression 
Peter could lead to areas of urban and small stream flooding through 
the evening across northern Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, portions of the 
Virgin Islands, and the Northern Leeward Islands.

Tropical Depression Rose Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172021
1100 PM AST Tue Sep 21 2021
 
Strong northwesterly shear has continued to take a toll on Rose 
this evening with the remaining deep convection becoming further 
separated from the low-level center.  Unfortunately Rose fell 
within the gaps of the ASCAT satellite instruments this evening, so 
there has been no recent scatterometer data.  Dvorak T-numbers from 
TAFB and SAB have continued to decline, and these subjective 
estimates support lowering Rose's initial intensity to 30 kt. The 
environment ahead of the cyclone is expected to remain quite 
hostile with moderate westerly to northwesterly shear and a dry 
mid-level atmosphere.  Simulated satellite imagery from the global 
models suggest Rose will continue to produce bursts of convection 
over the eastern portion of its circulation during the next few days 
which could allow it remain a tropical cyclone during that time. 
Alternatively, the shear and dry air could cause the system to 
degenerate into a remnant low much sooner.  The latest NHC intensity 
forecast is similar to the previous advisory and calls for little 
overall change in strength during the next couple of days, followed 
by degeneration into a remnant low by day 3. 

Rose continues to decelerate, now moving northwestward at about 
9 kt. The depression should remain on a slow northwestward heading 
around the western portion of a subtropical ridge during the next 
24 to 36 hours.  After that time, the cyclone is forecast to turn
northward, and then recurve northeastward ahead of a mid- to 
upper-level trough over the central Atlantic.  The dynamical 
guidance envelope remained fairly steady this cycle and no 
significant change was made to the previous official forecast.
