Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Tue Sep 21 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Peter, located about 100 miles north of the northern Leeward <br/>
Islands, and on Tropical Storm Rose, located over the eastern <br/>
tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave located a <br/>
few hundred miles south-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands continue <br/>
to show some signs of organization. Environmental conditions are <br/>
expected to become more conducive for development, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form later this week while the system moves <br/>
westward at 10 to 15 mph across the eastern and central tropical <br/>
Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A storm-force, non-tropical low pressure system, the remnants of <br/>
Odette, is located several hundred miles southeast of Newfoundland.  <br/>
This low could acquire some subtropical characteristics during the <br/>
next few days while it moves slowly southeastward over warmer waters <br/>
across the north-central Atlantic Ocean.  However, the system is <br/>
expected to turn northward back over cooler waters this weekend, <br/>
which should end its chances of becoming a subtropical storm. <br/>
Additional information on this system, including storm warnings, can <br/>
be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather <br/>
Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and <br/>

Tropical Storm Peter Advisory Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
500 AM AST Tue Sep 21 2021
 
...DISORGANIZED PETER PASSING TO THE NORTH OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.6N 63.8W
ABOUT 105 MI...170 KM NNW OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 265 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1007 MB...29.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Peter was
located near latitude 19.6 North, longitude 63.8 West. Peter is
moving toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A west-northwest
motion is expected to resume later today and continue for the next
day or two.  A turn to the north with a decrease in forward speed 
is expected later this week.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Peter will pass north of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico today.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Slow weakening is forecast during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Rainfall around the southern periphery of Tropical Storm 
Peter could produce additional rainfall totals of 1 to 4 inches, 
with storm total accumulations up to 6 inches, across portions of 
the Northern Leeward Islands, including portions of the Virgin 
Islands, as well as Puerto Rico and the northern portions of 
Hispaniola through Thursday morning. This rainfall may lead to areas 
of urban and small stream flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Peter are affecting the northern Leeward
Islands and Puerto Rico, and will continue spreading westward to
Hispaniola later today and the Bahamas on Wednesday.  These swells
could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Peter Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Tropical Storm Peter Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
500 AM AST Tue Sep 21 2021
 
Peter is a ragged and strongly sheared tropical storm.  Satellite 
images and surface observations indicate that the low-level center 
is fully exposed and located about 100 miles west-southwest of the 
edge of the main area of deep convection.  This very asymmetric 
structure is due to strong west-southwesterly shear associated with 
an upper-level low to the northwest of Peter.  The initial intensity 
is held at 45 kt based on the Dvorak CI-numbers from TAFB and SAB, 
but this could be a little generous.  An Air Force Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft is scheduled to investigate the storm later this morning.
 
Since the storm has decoupled, the low-level center has been moving 
just south of due west at 265/10 kt.  This motion has brought the 
storm to the southwest of the previous track.  The models insist 
that Peter will turn back to the west-northwest soon and continue 
moving in that direction during the next couple of days as the storm 
moves in the flow on the southwest side of a mid-level ridge.  After 
that time, a turn to the north and then northeast is expected as 
Peter moves toward broad troughing over the north Atlantic.  The 
latest run of the ECMWF has come into line with the remainder of the 
guidance, and the new forecast is to the west of, and slower than, 
the previous one.  This prediction lies on the south side of the 
guidance envelope during the first 24 hours of the forecast.
 
Peter is expected to remain in fairly hostile conditions during the 
next few days with strong westerly shear continuing and dry air 
likely entraining into the circulation.  These negative factors for 
the storm should cause a slow decay, and that is reflected in the 
NHC forecast.  In fact, some of the guidance suggests that Peter 
could succumb to the hostile conditions and open into a trough later 
this week.  The NHC intensity forecast is the same as the previous 
one and in line with the majority of the guidance.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Rainfall around the southern periphery of Tropical Storm Peter 
could lead to areas of urban and small stream flooding through 
Tuesday across northern Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, portions of the 
Virgin Islands, and the Northern Leeward Islands.

Tropical Storm Rose Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172021
500 AM AST Tue Sep 21 2021
 
Rose has lost organization over the past several hours.  Satellite
images show a fully exposed low-level center with only a small area
of deep convection lingering in the southeastern quadrant.  The
Dvorak classifications have decreased, and the initial intensity is
nudged downward to 40 kt.
 
Rose is moving northwestward at 17 kt.  This general heading but
with a decrease in forward speed is expected during the next couple
of days as the storm is steered by the flow on the southwest side of
a low- to mid-level ridge.  By late this week and over the weekend,
a sharp turn to the north and then the northeast is expected as
Rose becomes embedded in the flow on the south side of a broad
deep-layer trough. Although there is some spread in the guidance,
the models all show the same general theme.  The NHC track forecast
lies near the middle of the guidance envelope.
 
The environment is expected to become increasingly unfavorable for
Rose during the next several days with westerly shear increasing and
dry air expected to wrap into the circulation.  These conditions
should promote a weakening trend, and the cyclone is forecast to
become a remnant low by the weekend when it should be over cooler
waters and in an environment of more than 30 kt of shear.  Some of
the models suggest that Rose could become a remnant low or open into
a trough sooner than that, and if the current trend continues that
is a distinct possibility.  The new forecast is largely an update of
the previous one, but does show the storm becoming a remnant low a
day earlier.
