NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Wed Sep 29 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Sam, located several hundred miles east-northeast of the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands, and on newly formed Tropical Depression Twenty, <br/>
located over the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms remain disorganized in association with a <br/>
trough of low pressure located several hundred miles southwest of <br/>
the Cabo Verde Islands.  Some slow development of this system is <br/>
possible during the next couple of days while it drifts <br/>
west-northwestward across the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
An area of low pressure associated with the remnants of Peter  <br/>
located several hundred miles south of the coast of Newfoundland <br/>
continues to produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms. This <br/>
system is moving northeastward over cooler waters and into a region <br/>
of very strong upper-level winds, and significant development is <br/>
not anticipated.  Additional information on this system can be found <br/>
in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Sam Advisory Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 AM AST Wed Sep 29 2021
 
...POWERFUL SAM CONTINUES MOVING SLOWLY NORTHWESTWARD...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.4N 57.0W
ABOUT 405 MI...655 KM ENE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...130 MPH...215 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...949 MB...28.03 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 19.4 North, longitude 57.0 West.  Sam is moving toward
the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion with an
increase in forward speed is expected during the next couple of
days.  A turn toward the north is forecast by Friday.  On the
forecast track, Sam will pass well to the east-northeast of the 
northern Leeward Islands through tonight.

Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are expected
during the next couple of days, but Sam is forecast to remain a
major hurricane through late this week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft observations is 949 mb (28.03 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the Lesser Antilles
during the next several days.  Swells are expected to reach Bermuda
and the Bahamas in a day or so, and then spread to the United
States east coast by this weekend.  These swells could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 AM AST Wed Sep 29 2021

Sam has a well-organized cloud pattern on satellite imagery, with a 
90 n mi-wide Central Dense Overcast surrounded by numerous 
convective banding features.  Upper-level outflow has now become 
better established to the southeast of the hurricane.  A NOAA 
Hurricane Hunter mission from a couple of hours ago reported a 20 n 
mi-wide diameter circular eye.  The current intensity is held at 115 
kt for this advisory, which is a little higher than the maximum 
winds observed in the earlier aircraft mission.  However, since the 
estimated minimum central pressure of 949 is a little lower than it 
was earlier this morning and Sam's intensity has been fluctuating, 
it is considered prudent not to lower the winds at this time.  An 
Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate the 
hurricane soon and will provide another intensity estimate.

Sam continues its slow northwestward trek with the current motion 
remaining near 310/8 kt.  Sam should move northwestward and then 
northward around the western portion of the subtropical ridge over 
the eastern Atlantic during the next few days, and turn toward 
the north-northeast and northeast later in the forecast period.  
The track guidance models are in very good agreement through 72 
hours or so, with some increase in model spread thereafter.  This
increase in spread is largely due to how Sam will interact with a 
strong mid-latitude trough moving through Atlantic Canada.  Some 
of the guidance suggests that this trough could partially bypass 
the hurricane around the end of the period and beyond, but this 
is not yet clear.  The current NHC forecast track is not much 
different from the previous one and is in good agreement with the 
dynamical model consensus, TVCA.

The hurricane will continue to move over warm waters and in an 
environment of low vertical shear and diffluent upper-level flow 
for the next 1-2 days.  Thus, it would not be surprising to soon 
see some restrengthening.  The official intensity forecast is 
essentially a blend of the latest Decay-SHIPS and LGEM predictions, 
and is very similar to the previous NHC forecast.  Sam is likely to 
remain a major hurricane into this weekend.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Sam are affecting the Leeward Islands
and will spread to portions of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Bahamas, and Bermuda by Thursday or Friday.
Significant swells will likely reach the east coast of the United
States and Atlantic Canada by the weekend.  These swells will likely
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and
beachgoers and other interests along these coasts are urged to
follow the advice of lifeguards and local officials through the
upcoming weekend.

Tropical Storm Victor Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
800 PM CVT Wed Sep 29 2021
 
The cloud pattern continues to exhibit a large circulation with 
numerous curved bands surrounding the center.  The strongest 
thunderstorms remain on the system's west side. The latest Dvorak 
estimates from TAFB and SAB have both increased to 2.5/35 kt, and on 
that basis, the cyclone has been upgraded to a 35-kt tropical storm.
 
Victor is still on a west-northwest course at about 11 kt. There has 
been little change to the track forecast reasoning.  The cyclone is 
expected to continue west-northwestward during the next couple of 
days as it remains steered by the flow on the south side of a 
deep-layer ridge.  By late Friday, however, the models show the 
western periphery of the ridge being eroded due to a mid- to 
upper-level low over the subtropical central Atlantic.  As a result, 
the cyclone should turn northwestward by Friday night and then 
northward late this weekend or early next week.  There remains a 
fair amount of spread in the timing and location of the northward 
turn with the GFS and HWRF still on the right side of the guidance 
envelope and the ECMWF showing the slowest and westernmost solution. 
Overall, the consensus models have not changed much and neither has 
the official track forecast.
 
The storm is expected to remain in conducive environmental 
conditions for strengthening during the next couple of days.  During 
that time period, Victor is forecast to move over 28-29 deg C 
waters while embedded within a moist airmass with very low wind 
shear (less than 10 kt).  Rapid intensification sometimes occurs 
when conditions are this favorable, however, since the storm is 
broad and does not yet have an inner core, gradual strengthening 
seems more reasonable. The NHC forecast brings Victor to hurricane 
intensity in 36 hours. In a few days, however, the models show a 
pronounced increase in southwesterly shear and a notably drier 
atmosphere. These unfavorable conditions should end the opportunity 
for strengthening and promote a weakening trend.  The NHC intensity 
forecast is similar to the previous one and remains near a blend of 
the HCCA, IVCN, and IVDR consensus models.
