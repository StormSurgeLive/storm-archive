Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Sun Oct 3 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Sam, located more than 600 miles south-southwest of Cape Race, <br/>
Newfoundland, and on Tropical Depression Victor, located over the <br/>
central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
A large area of disorganized cloudiness and showers over the <br/>
southeastern Bahamas and adjacent southwestern Atlantic waters is <br/>
associated with a surface trough.  Upper-level winds are expected <br/>
to be only marginally conducive, and any development of this system <br/>
should be slow to occur while it moves west-northwestward at around <br/>
10 mph through Monday, followed by a slow northwestward motion <br/>
through the end of the week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

OPEN NORTH ATLANTIC...
...EXPECTED TO BECOME A LARGE AND POWERFUL POST-TROPICAL LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEM ON MONDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...37.3N 55.9W
ABOUT 665 MI...1070 KM SSW OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...105 MPH...165 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 45 DEGREES AT 17 MPH...28 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...960 MB...28.35 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 37.3 North, longitude 55.9 West.  Sam is moving toward
the northeast near 17 mph (28 km/h).  This general motion with an
increase in forward speed is expected during the next few days.  On
the forecast track, Sam will move over the far North Atlantic well 
to southeast and east of Newfoundland.
 
Maximum sustained winds decreased to near 105 mph (165 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Further weakening is forecast during the next few 
days, and Sam is expected transition into a powerful post-tropical 
cyclone on Monday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles
(390 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 960 mb (28.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, the eastern United
States and Atlantic Canada for the next couple of days.  These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  43
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 AM AST Sun Oct 03 2021
 
Sam has continued to weaken since the previous advisory, with cloud 
tops in the central dense overcast (CDO) having warmed to -60 to -65 
deg C near the center. However, the upper-level outflow pattern 
remains impressive  The initial intensity has been lowered to 90 kt 
based on an  average of the current data-T number of 4.5/77 kt and 
current intensity (CI) estimate of 5.5/102 kt from TAFB, and a 0530 
UTC UW-CIMSS SATCON intensity estimate of 89 kt. Further weakening 
during the is expected as Sam moves over progressively cooler water 
and southwesterly vertical wind shear of 20-25 kt continues. By 
18-24 hours, Sam will be moving north of the north wall of the 
Gulfstream, resulting in extratropical transition due to the cyclone 
moving over sub-20-deg-C sea-surface temperatures. However, 
favorable interaction with a strong mid-tropospheric trough will 
result in Sam becoming a large and powerful extratropical low with 
hurricane-force winds in 36-48 hours. Thereafter, Sam's wind field 
is expected gradually spin down over the far north Atlantic when 
baroclinic forcing will cease.  he new intensity forecast is similar 
to but slightly lower than the previous intensity forecast.

The initial motion is northeastward, or 045/15 kt. The latest NHC 
model guidance is tightly clustered around the previous track 
forecast, and thus, no significant changes were made to the previous 
advisory track.  A faster northeastward motion is expected during 
the next couple of days, followed by a slow down in the forward 
motion as Sam becomes entangled with an upper-level cutoff low. The 
new track forecast is essentially down the middle of the tightly 
packed simple and corrected-consensus models.

Recent ASCAT-A surface wind data indicate that no significant 
adjustments to the 34- and 50-kt wind radii were needed, but that 
the size of the 64-kt wind radii had to be decreased somewhat.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward Islands,
the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the eastern United
States and Atlantic Canada for the next couple of days.  These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Depression Victor Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
500 AM AST Sun Oct 03 2021
 
Victor remains a sheared tropical cyclone with intense deep 
convection having developed closer to the center in the northeastern 
quadrant since the previous advisory. Satellite intensity estimates 
remain at T2.0/30 kt, so the advisory intensity remains at 30 kt. It 
is possible that Victor could have regained tropical storm status 
based on the robust convective shear pattern. For now, however, 
Victor will remain a depression until new ASCAT surface wind data 
arrive later this morning. Some fluctuations in intensity could 
occur this morning due to the aforementioned better defined shear 
pattern. By tonight, however, weakening is anticipated as Victor 
encounters southwesterly vertical wind shear in excess of 25 kt and 
moves into a drier air mass, which will act to decrease both the 
depth and amount of inner-core deep convection. Victor is expected 
to gradually spin down tonight and Monday, with the circulation 
opening up into a trough on Tuesday.
 
Victor continues to move northwestward, or 315/14 kt. A motion 
toward the northwest is forecast to continue as Victor remains 
embedded within the southeasterly flow around a deep-layer 
subtropical ridge. The new NHC track forecast is essentially just 
an update of the previous advisory track, and lies near the tightly 
clustered consensus track models.
