expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located 
near latitude 28.4 North, longitude 61.8 West. Sam is moving toward 
the north near 21 mph (33 km/h).  A turn toward the north-northeast, 
at a slightly slower forward speed, is expected by tonight, followed 
by a northeastward motion Saturday night through Monday.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Sam will pass well to the east of 
Bermuda tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 150 mph (240 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Although fluctuations in intensity are still
possible today, weakening is forecast during the next couple of
days.  However, Sam is expected to remain a major hurricane through
at least Saturday night.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles
(335 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 936 mb (27.64 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning
tonight or early Saturday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands and the Greater Antilles, including Puerto Rico, during the
next couple of days.  Swells are expected to reach Bermuda and the
Bahamas this afternoon, and then spread to the United States east
coast and Atlantic Canada on Saturday.  These swells could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  36
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 AM AST Fri Oct 01 2021
 
Sam remains a powerful category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale over the subtropical central Atlantic. 
Satellite images show that the hurricane still has a circular and 
quite distinct eye and closed eyewall.  However, an 0827 UTC SSMIS 
pass indicated that a dry slot was present on the eastern side of 
the circulation between the eyewall and rainbands.  The latest 
Dvorak classifications from TAFB, SAB, and CIMSS at the University 
of Wisconsin range from 102-115 kt.  However, Air Force 
reconnaissance data from earlier this morning showed that the winds 
were much higher, and in fact, the Dvorak estimates have had a low 
bias compared to the Hurricane Hunter data for the past 24-36 hours. 
Therefore, the initial intensity is held at 130 kt for now.  Another 
Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate Sam 
this afternoon.  An ASCAT-A pass from around 12Z indicated that 
Sam's tropical-storm-force wind radii have expanded, and the initial 
wind radii were adjusted based on that data.  In addition, the eye 
of Sam passed about 60 n mi east of NOAA buoy 41049 earlier this 
morning.  The buoy reported a minimum pressure of 998 mb, maximum 
winds of around 45 kt, gusts to 62 kt, and maximum seas of about 22 
ft.
 
The major hurricane has turned to the north and is now moving 
faster.  The latest initial motion estimate is 355/18 kt.  The
large-scale pattern consists of a deep-layer ridge to the northeast
of Sam and a large low pressure system centered over Atlantic
Canada.  The steering flow between these features should cause Sam
to move northeastward at a sightly slower pace this weekend.  By
early next week, the deep-layer low is expected to retreat
northward, which should cause Sam to turn a little more to the
right.  The models are in fairly good agreement, but there are some
notable speed differences with the UKMET model being a fast outlier.
The new NHC track forecast is slightly to the right of the previous
one at 60 and 72 h, but is otherwise very similar.  This forecast
lies near the middle of the guidance envelope.
 
Sam is expected to slowly weaken during the next several days as it
moves over progressively cooler waters and into an environment of
stronger shear.  The hurricane will likely begin extratropical
transition in a couple of days when it crosses the 26 degree C
isotherm, and this transition is expected to be completed by 96
hours.  All of the model guidance shows steady weakening through the
forecast period, and so does the NHC forecast.  This prediction is
close to the IVCN, IVDR, and HCCA models in the short term and near
the GFS model during the extratropical portion of the forecast.
Even though Sam is likely to weaken, it is still expected to be a
significant storm over the next several days.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward Islands 
and the Greater Antilles, including Puerto Rico, during the next 
couple of days.  Swells are expected to reach Bermuda and the 
Bahamas this afternoon, and then spread to the United States east 
coast and Atlantic Canada on Saturday.  These swells could cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning
tonight or early Saturday, and a Tropical Storm Warning is in effect
for the island.

Tropical Storm Victor Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
1100 AM AST Fri Oct 01 2021
 
Since the last advisory, Victor's deep convection has become limited 
to the northern portion of its circulation. Convective outflow is 
limited to the south, which indicates that the changes in the 
structure of the tropical storm are due at least in part to 
southerly wind shear. Microwave and ASCAT data between 0800 and 1200 
UTC also indicate that the center of Victor has become elongated, 
and may be trying to reform to the north, closer to the convection. 
Even with that reformation, an 1128 ASCAT-B overpass revealed that 
the center of Victor is located substantially south of previous 
estimates, which has necessitated a significant change to the track 
forecast. 

With the new position, the initial motion estimate is now 295/13 kt. 
The tropical storm is still generally expected to turn northwestward 
over the weekend and then continue on that heading through early 
next week, steered by the southwest periphery of a mid-level ridge 
centered over the eastern Atlantic. Nearly all of the dynamical 
models are showing this turn occuring slightly later than earlier 
forecasts, which results in a track well to the west of the previous 
NHC forecast. Combined with the updated analysis of Victor's 
position, the new NHC forecast has been shifted over 100 n mi to the 
southwest by day 4. However, this is still on the far east side of 
the guidance envelope so additional changes to the track forecast 
might be needed this afternoon.

The aforementioned ASCAT data showed peak winds near 50 kt, which 
supports an intensity of 55 kt, assuming a little undersampling due 
to the resolution of the instrument. The intensity analysis is also 
supported by the latest TAFB Dvorak estimate. Despite the 
large changes to the track forecast, no change of note was made to 
the intensity forecast.  Increasing shear and a dry surrounding 
environment should cause Victor to weaken during the next few days. 
Some models even indicate it could dissipate before the end of the 
forecast period. The NHC forecast is based on the intensity model 
consensus.
