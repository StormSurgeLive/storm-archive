expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Sam was located near 
latitude 24.3 North, longitude 61.0 West.  Sam is moving toward the 
north-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h), and this continued motion 
with an additional increase in forward speed is expected tonight.  A 
turn toward the north is anticipated on Friday, and a northeastward 
motion is forecast to begin on Saturday. On the forecast track, the 
core of Sam will pass to the east of Bermuda early Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are expected 
during the next couple of days, but Sam is forecast to remain a 
major hurricane into Saturday, with more significant weakening 
anticipated later in the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150
miles (240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 938 mb (27.70 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
Friday night or early Saturday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands and the Greater Antilles, including Puerto Rico, during the
next few days.  Swells are expected to reach Bermuda and the Bahamas
by Friday, and then spread to the United States east coast by this
weekend.  These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 PM AST Thu Sep 30 2021
 
Sam remains a formidable hurricane, with a well-organized 
cloud pattern on satellite imagery.  The 25 n mi wide eye is 
surrounded by a fairly symmetric pattern of deep convective cloud 
tops, and the upper-level outflow pattern is very well defined.  An 
Air Force Reserve Unit Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated the 
system and found peak 700-mb flight level winds of 133 kt, and a
highest unflagged SFMR-observed surface wind of 125 kt.  Based on 
these observations, the advisory intensity is kept at 125 kt.  
Measurements from the aircraft also showed that the central 
pressure remains quite low, near 938 mb.

Sam will continue to traverse waters of high oceanic heat content 
for another 12-18 hours, and the shear should remain fairly low for 
the next few days.  Therefore, some intensification could still 
occur overnight.  In any event, the system is expected to maintain 
major hurricane status for the next 36-48 hours.  Over the weekend, 
a gradual weakening trend should commence due to cooler SSTs.  
However, Sam will likely remain a powerful cyclone with hurricane- 
force winds until the end of the forecast period.  By 120 hours, 
simulated satellite imagery from the ECMWF and GFS models forecast 
the system's cloud pattern to resemble that of an extratropical low, 
and this is reflected in the official forecast, which shows 
extratropical status at that time.  The official intensity forecast 
remains close to the HCCA corrected consensus model solution.

Center fixes continue to show a gradual increase in forward speed, 
and the hurricane is moving northwestward, or about 320/12 kt.  
During the next 24-36 hours, Sam should turn toward the north as it 
moves around the western periphery of a large subtropical high over 
the eastern and central Atlantic.  Then, the cyclone is expected  to 
move generally northeastward in the flow between the anticyclone and 
a trough near Atlantic Canada.  There is fairly close agreement in 
the track models through 60 hours or so.  However, there are some 
significant differences in the model-predicted track of Sam at 
higher latitudes, probably due to variations in how the system 
interacts with the trough in the various guidance.  The NHC track 
forecast follows the latest model consensus, TVCN.  
 
Although the core of Sam is predicted to pass east of Bermuda early
Saturday, the tropical-storm-force wind field is forecast to expand
and could pass very close to the island beginning late Friday night
or early Saturday. Therefore, a Tropical Storm Warning has been 
issued for Bermuda.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the Northern Leeward Islands
and the Greater Antilles, including Puerto Rico, during the next
few days.  Swells are expected to reach Bermuda and the Bahamas by
Friday, and then spread to the United States east coast by this
weekend.  These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
Friday night or early Saturday, and a Tropical Storm Warning has
been issued for that island.

Tropical Storm Victor Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
1100 PM AST Thu Sep 30 2021

Satellite imagery shows that Victor has become a little better 
organized since the last advisory, with the convective banding 
becoming better defined near the center in the northeastern 
semicircle.  Recent ASCAT data showed winds of 45-47 kt about 70 n 
mi north of the center, and based on the likelihood of some 
undersampling the initial intensity is increased to 50 kt.  Although 
the scatterometer showed a stronger storm, the data suggested the 
system has not yet formed a well-defined inner core.

The initial motion is now 300/10 kt.  Victor is expected to continue 
west-northwestward for another 24 h or so on the south side of a 
deep-layer ridge over the subtropical eastern Atlantic.  After that 
time, a developing mid- to upper-level low over the central Atlantic 
is expected to erode the western portion of the ridge.  As a result, 
Victor is expected to turn northwestward by the weekend and then 
northward by early next week when it is forecast to move in the flow 
between the ridge and the low.  The guidance has changed little 
since the previous advisory, with the HWRF remaining a significant 
outlier to the east.  Thus, the new forecast track is a little to 
the west of the various consensus aids that include the HWRF.  The 
new forecast is basically an update of the previous forecast.

Victor should remain in a favorable environment for the next 24 h or 
so, and the intensity forecast shows more strengthening during that 
time,  After that, the upper-level low should cause moderate to 
strong southwesterly shear over the storm, and by the end of the 
forecast period it will be moving into a drier air mass.  This 
combination should cause Victor to steadily weaken after 24 h.  The 
new NHC forecast has some adjustments from the previous forecast, 
and it now calls for the cyclone to decay to a remnant low by 120 h. 
 The intensity forecast lies near the upper edge of the intensity 
guidance through 48-60 h, and thereafter is close to the intensity 
consensus.
