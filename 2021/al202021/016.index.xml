Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Sun Oct 3 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Sam, located more than 600 miles south-southwest of Cape Race, <br/>
Newfoundland, and on Tropical Depression Victor, located over the <br/>
central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
A surface trough located about 100 miles east of the southeastern <br/>
Bahamas is producing a large area of cloudiness and shower activity <br/>
along and to the east of the trough axis.  Upper-level winds are <br/>
expected to be marginally conducive for slow development of this <br/>
system while it moves west-northwestward at around 10 mph through <br/>
Monday, followed by a slow northwestward motion through the end of <br/>
the week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

...SAM GRADUALLY WEAKENING AS IT MOVES NORTHEASTWARD OVER THE
OPEN ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...36.4N 57.1W
ABOUT 520 MI...840 KM NE OF BERMUDA
ABOUT 740 MI...1190 KM SSW OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...115 MPH...185 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 40 DEGREES AT 16 MPH...26 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...955 MB...28.20 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 36.4 North, longitude 57.1 West. Sam is moving toward
the northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h). This general track with an
increase in forward speed is expected for the next few days.  On 
the forecast track, Sam will move well southeast and east of 
Newfoundland over the North Atlantic.
 
Maximum sustained winds are now near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Further slow weakening is anticipated during 
the next few days, and Sam could transition into a powerful 
post-tropical cyclone on Monday night.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240
miles (390 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 955 mb (28.20 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, the eastern United
States and Atlantic Canada for the next couple of days.  These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  42
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 PM AST Sat Oct 02 2021

Sam continues to gradually weaken.  Conventional satellite imagery 
indicates that the eye has disappeared and that the cloud tops near 
the center are gradually warming.  Various objective and subjective 
satellite intensity estimates are in the 90-102 kt range, while 
scatterometer and experimental synthetic aperture radar data 
suggest lower winds than that.  The initial intensity is reduced to 
a possibly generous 100 kt.

The initial motion is northeastward or 040/14 kt.  A faster motion 
toward the northeast is expected during the next couple of days as 
Sam is steered by southwesterly flow between a deep-layer ridge to 
the east and a large mid- to upper-level low over Atlantic Canada. 
After Sam completes extratropical transition in about 48 h, a 
wobbly motion generally toward the northeast is expected as Sam 
interacts with one or more mid-latitude shortwave troughs.  The 
new forecast track is similar to the previous track and lies close 
to the various consensus models.

The hurricane is moving toward colder water, and it is approaching 
a frontal zone over the north Atlantic.  The cyclone should undergo 
extratropical transition during the next couple of days, and due to 
a favorable interaction with a mid-latitude trough it should weaken 
only slowly as it becomes a large and powerful extratropical low by 
48 h.  After that time, the baroclinic forcing ends and the low 
should gradually spin down over the far north Atlantic.  The new 
intensity forecast has only minor adjustments from the previous 
forecast.


Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward Islands,
the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the eastern United
States and Atlantic Canada for the next couple of days.  These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

...VICTOR STILL A TROPICAL DEPRESSION...
...FORECAST TO BECOME A REMNANT LOW IN THE NEXT DAY OR SO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.8N 38.9W
ABOUT 995 MI...1600 KM W OF THE CABO VERDE ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1005 MB...29.68 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Victor
was located near latitude 14.8 North, longitude 38.9 West. The
depression is moving toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h) and
this general motion is expected to continue over the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Gradual weakening is forecast over the next couple of days, and 
Victor could become a remnant low during that time. The system is 
then forecast to dissipate by Tuesday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches). 
NOAA moored ocean buoy 13008 recently reported a sea level pressure 
of 1006.7 mb (29.73 inches).  
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Tropical Depression Victor Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
1100 PM AST Sat Oct 02 2021
 
Victor remains a tropical cyclone this evening, with pulsing deep 
convection occuring primarily north of the well-defined low-level 
center. However, this convection lacks much organization and is 
continually being stripped away by around 20 kt of 
south-southwesterly vertical wind shear. Earlier this evening, there 
was an ASCAT-A pass valid at 2238 UTC which had peak wind retrievals 
of 25-30 kt to the northeast of the center. There was also a nearby 
moored ocean buoy that at 0000 UTC reported sustained winds of 28 kt 
with a pressure of 1006.7 mb also just northeast of Victor. The 
latest advisory intensity is thus being maintained at 30 kt but the 
minimum pressure was lowered a bit due to this in-situ buoy data. 
The 30 kt intensity also agrees with most recent TAFB Dvorak CI 
estimate from 0000 UTC.
 
Ultimately the combination of southwesterly vertical wind shear and
the associated entrainment of dry air will prove victorious against
Victor, with the depression forecast to gradually weaken during the
forecast period. The latest NHC intensity forecast still shows
Victor becoming a remnant low by tomorrow evening, though 27 to
28 C sea surface temperatures could still support sheared
convective bursts to the north of the low center into early next
week. Victor's low-level wind field will also continue to spin down
over the subsequent days, and the circulation is forecast to open
up into a trough by Tuesday. The latest forecast is essentially
unchanged from the previous one and is in good agreement with the
consensus aids and deterministic model output.
 
The depression continues to move to the northwest at 310/12 kt
though with the occasional tug poleward by the convection on its
northern side. This northwestward motion is expected to continue as
Victor remains embedded in the flow around a low-level subtropical
anticyclone to its northeast. The NHC track forecast continues to be
in general agreement with the track guidance consensus, maintaining
Victor on a similar forward motion until the system opens up into a
trough in 2-3 days.
