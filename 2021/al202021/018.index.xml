Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Sun Oct 3 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Sam, located about 600 miles south of Cape Race, Newfoundland, and <br/>
on Tropical Depression Victor, located over the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
A large area of disorganized cloudiness and showers over the <br/>
southeastern Bahamas and adjacent southwestern Atlantic waters is <br/>
associated with a surface trough.  Upper-level winds are expected <br/>
to be only marginally conducive, and any development of this system <br/>
should be slow to occur while it moves west-northwestward at around <br/>
10 mph through Monday, followed by a slow northwestward motion <br/>
through the end of the week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

...SAM EXPANDING OVER THE OPEN NORTH ATLANTIC...
...EXPECTED TO BECOME A LARGE AND POWERFUL POST-TROPICAL LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEM ON MONDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...38.6N 52.8W
ABOUT 560 MI...900 KM S OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...100 MPH...155 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 60 DEGREES AT 16 MPH...26 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...964 MB...28.47 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located 
near latitude 38.6 North, longitude 52.8 West. Sam is moving toward 
the east-northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h). A northeastward motion at 
a faster forward speed is expected over the next couple of days. The 
cyclone is forecast to slow down over the north Atlantic around 
midweek.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next few days, and
Sam is expected to transition into a powerful post-tropical cyclone
by late Monday.
 
Sam is a large tropical cyclone. Hurricane-force winds extend 
outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 964 mb (28.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, the eastern United
States and Atlantic Canada for the next couple of days.  These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  45
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 PM AST Sun Oct 03 2021
 
Sam is a resilient hurricane despite having just crossed the 26 
degrees C isotherm. An eye remains readily apparent in satellite 
imagery, while microwave images show a symmetrical concentric 
eyewall structure. Recent scatterometer data revealed that the 
tropical-storm-force wind field continues to expand, with these 
winds now extending 200 n mi or greater in all quadrants. A blend 
of the latest Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB, SAB, and the 
UW-CIMMS ADT supports maintaining an initial advisory intensity of 
85 kt. 

Gradual weakening is expected over the next 36 h as Sam moves over 
progressively cooler waters. However, the wind field is forecast to 
continue expanding. On Monday, the cyclone is expected to interact 
with a strong mid-level trough moving off the coast of Newfoundland 
which should cause Sam to transition into a powerful extratropical 
cyclone. With a lack of baroclinic forcing once Sam becomes 
vertically stacked with the trough in 48 h, the extratropical 
cyclone is expected to steadily weaken over the northern Atlantic 
through late this week. The latest NHC intensity forecast is little 
changed from the previous one, and is near the various model 
consensus solutions.

Sam has begun to accelerate and is now moving 060/14 kt. A 
northwestward motion and continued acceleration is forecast through 
Monday as the cyclone gets caught in southwesterly flow ahead of the 
mid-level trough. Just before Sam merges with the trough in a couple 
of days, the cyclone should slow down as it pivots around the 
eastern flank of the trough. Thereafter, the merged system should 
continue northeastward then northward in the flow around a larger 
mid- to upper-level trough over the far northern Atlantic. The model 
guidance is in very good agreement on this track scenario, and the 
latest NHC track forecast remains near the previous one.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward Islands,
the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the eastern United
States and Atlantic Canada for the next couple of days.  These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Depression Victor Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
500 PM AST Sun Oct 03 2021
 
The convective structure of Victor has deteriorated this afternoon. 
Only small pulses of convection have been observed north of the 
center over the past several hours. Victor's exposed low-level 
circulation is also becoming more diffuse, with multiple cloud 
swirls noted in visible satellite imagery. Hopefully, scatterometer 
data this evening will provide more information about whether Victor 
still possesses a closed and well-defined surface center. For now, 
Victor is held as a 30-kt tropical depression, which is consistent 
with earlier scatterometer winds and a blend of the data-T and 
current intensity Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB.
 
Victor is unlikely to remain a tropical cyclone for much longer. The 
dry mid-level environment and 20-25 kt of southwesterly vertical 
wind shear are expected to limit Victor's ability to sustain deep, 
organized convection going forward. Even if another diurnal 
convective pulse occurs tonight, it should be quickly stripped away 
from the center by the moderate to strong shear. The official NHC 
forecast shows Victor becoming a remnant low on Monday, then opening 
up into a trough and dissipating soon thereafter. Victor is moving 
northwestward, or 315/11 kt. A northwestward or west-northwestward 
motion is expected to continue through dissipation as the depression 
is steered by a subtropical ridge to its northeast. The official NHC 
track forecast is essentially an update of the previous one.
