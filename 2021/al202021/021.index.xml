Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Mon Oct 4 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Sam, located over the far North Atlantic, and on Tropical <br/>
Depression Victor, located over the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
A large area of disorganized cloudiness and showers continues over <br/>
the southeastern Bahamas and adjacent southwestern Atlantic waters <br/>
in association with a surface trough.  Upper-level winds are not <br/>
expected to be especially conducive, and any development of this <br/>
system should be slow to occur while it moves slowly northwestward <br/>
through the end of this week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

...SAM MOVING QUICKLY NORTHEASTWARD...
...FORECAST TO BECOME A POWERFUL POST-TROPICAL CYCLONE TONIGHT OR
EARLY TUESDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...42.6N 45.7W
ABOUT 460 MI...740 KM SE OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...100 MPH...155 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 45 DEGREES AT 32 MPH...52 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...960 MB...28.35 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 42.6 North, longitude 45.7 West. Sam is moving toward
the northeast near 32 mph (52 km/h). A faster northeastward motion 
is expected through tonight. A slower east-northeastward motion is 
forecast to begin on Tuesday and continue through midweek. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next few days, and
Sam is expected to transition into a powerful post-tropical cyclone
over the north Atlantic tonight or early Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275 miles
(445 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 960 mb (28.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands, the Greater Antilles, portions of the Bahamas, and
southeastern Newfoundland for the next day or so.  These swells
could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  47
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 AM AST Mon Oct 04 2021
 
A 0255Z GPM microwave pass indicated that Sam had continued to go 
through an eyewall replacement cycle, consisting of a 20-nmi-wide 
inner eye and an 85-nmi-wide outer eye. The inner eye was rapidly 
eroding on the northwest side compared to microwave data from just a 
few hours earlier. Additionally, late-arriving ASCAT surface wind 
data from 0000-0100Z indicated that the inner-core wind field had 
contracted or weakened, while the outer wind field (34-kt radii) had 
continued to expand in all quadrants. Satellite intensity estimates 
have decreased to around 80 kt. However, the advisory intensity has 
been maintained at 90 kt based on the 10-kt increase in forward 
speed, which should offset any weakening of the tangential winds. 
Gradual weakening is expected now that Sam has passed north of the 
warm Gulf Stream and is moving over sub-25-deg-C sea-surface 
temperatures (SST), with much colder SSTs lying ahead of the 
hurricane. Vertical wind shear is forecast to increase to more than 
30 kt by 18 h, which should cause further weakening. By 24 h and 
beyond, interaction with a strong upper-level trough/low should 
cause Sam to transition into a powerful extratropical cyclone by 
early Tuesday to the east of Newfoundland.  This baroclinic 
interaction is expected to cause extratropical-Sam to maintain 
hurricane-force winds until early Wednesday.  Slow weakening is 
forecast thereafter as the very large cyclone slowly spins down as 
an occluded low pressure system.  No significant changes were made 
to the previous intensity forecast.
 
Sam has continued to accelerate and is now moving at 045/26 kt. A 
northeastward motion along with continued acceleration is forecast 
through today as Sam moves into stronger southwesterly flow ahead of 
an approaching mid-latitude trough. The large cyclone is expected to 
remain the primary surface low center as it merges with the trough 
in a couple days. A gradual turn toward the north and northwest is 
expected on days 4 and 5 when extratropical-Sam moves around another 
high-latitude trough.  The new NHC forecast track is essentially 
just an update of the previous advisory track, and lies close to 
the tightly packed consensus track models.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward Islands,
the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the eastern United
States and Atlantic Canada for the next couple of days.  These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Depression Victor Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
500 AM AST Mon Oct 04 2021
 
Strong southerly vertical wind shear in excess of 25 kt along with 
entrainment of very dry mid-level air (less than 40 percent relative
humidity) has continued to take its toll on Victor. Deep convection 
has been weakening during the past couple of hours and is now 
displaced more than 100 nmi north and northeast of the elongated 
low-level center. The shear is forecast by the global models to 
increase to more than 30 kt in the next 6-12 hours, while the 
surrounding environment becomes drier and more stable. As a result, 
the cyclone is forecast to degenerate into a remnant low later today 
and likely dissipate by Tuesday, if not sooner. 
 
Victor is moving west-northwestward or 300/12 kt, and this general 
motion is expected to continue through today based on the latest 
NHC model guidance. As a result, no significant changes were made 
to the previous track forecast.
