A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 30.0 North, longitude 61.8 West. Sam is moving toward
the north near 20 mph (31 km/h).  A turn toward the north-northeast,
at a slightly slower forward speed, is expected by tonight, followed
by a northeastward motion Saturday night through Monday.  On the
forecast track, the center of Sam will pass well to the east of
Bermuda tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 150 mph (240 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Although fluctuations in intensity are still 
possible, weakening is forecast during the next couple of days.  
However, Sam is expected to remain a major hurricane through at 
least Saturday night.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles
(335 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 937 mb (27.67 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning
tonight or early Saturday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, and Bermuda during the
next couple of days.  Swells are expected to reach the United States
east coast and Atlantic Canada on Saturday.  These swells could
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  37
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 PM AST Fri Oct 01 2021
 
Sam remains a powerful hurricane.  The eye is still very distinct
and there are several mesovorticies evident in satellite imagery.
In addition, microwave images show a closed and symmetric eyewall.
Data from the Air Force Hurricane Hunters indicate that Sam has been
maintaining its category 4 intensity.  The aircraft measured peak
flight-level winds at 700 mb of 152 kt, which corresponds to a
135-140 kt surface wind. However, the peak SFMR winds are around 115
kt.  Dropsonde data from the aircraft show a sharp decrease in winds
around the 925 mb level, which could mean that the strongest winds
are not reaching the surface.  The minimum pressure in the eye
remains very low though at 937 mb.  Based on all of this data, the
initial intensity is held at 130 kt, but there is some uncertainty
in that estimate.
 
The major hurricane continues northward and the latest initial 
motion estimate is 355/17 kt.  The large-scale pattern consists of a 
deep-layer ridge to the northeast of Sam and a large low pressure 
system centered over Atlantic Canada.  The steering flow between 
these features should cause Sam to move northeastward at a sightly 
slower pace this weekend.  By early next week, the deep-layer low is 
expected to retreat northward, which should cause Sam to turn a 
little more to the right.  The models are in fairly good agreement, 
but there are some notable speed differences with the UKMET on the 
faster side and the GFS on the slower side of the guidance envelope. 
No major changes were made to the NHC track forecast, and it remains 
near the consensus aids.
 
Sam is expected to slowly weaken during the next several days as it
moves over progressively cooler waters and into an environment of
stronger shear.  The hurricane will likely begin extratropical
transition in a couple of days when it crosses the 26 degree C
isotherm, and this transition is expected to be completed shortly
after 72 hours.  All of the model guidance shows steady weakening
through the forecast period, and so does the NHC forecast.  This
prediction is close to the IVCN, IVDR, and HCCA models in the short
term and near the GFS model during the extratropical portion of the
forecast. Even though Sam is likely to weaken, it is still expected
to be a significant storm over the next several days.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward Islands
the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, and Bermuda during the next
couple of days.  Swells are expected to reach the United States
east coast and Atlantic Canada on Saturday.  These swells could
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning
tonight or early Saturday, and a Tropical Storm Warning is in effect
for the island.

<title>Tropical Storm Victor Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Tropical Storm Victor Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
1100 AM AST Fri Oct 01 2021
 
Since the last advisory, Victor's deep convection has become limited 
to the northern portion of its circulation. Convective outflow is 
limited to the south, which indicates that the changes in the 
structure of the tropical storm are due at least in part to 
southerly wind shear. Microwave and ASCAT data between 0800 and 1200 
UTC also indicate that the center of Victor has become elongated, 
and may be trying to reform to the north, closer to the convection. 
Even with that reformation, an 1128 ASCAT-B overpass revealed that 
the center of Victor is located substantially south of previous 
estimates, which has necessitated a significant change to the track 
forecast. 

With the new position, the initial motion estimate is now 295/13 kt. 
The tropical storm is still generally expected to turn northwestward 
over the weekend and then continue on that heading through early 
next week, steered by the southwest periphery of a mid-level ridge 
centered over the eastern Atlantic. Nearly all of the dynamical 
models are showing this turn occuring slightly later than earlier 
forecasts, which results in a track well to the west of the previous 
NHC forecast. Combined with the updated analysis of Victor's 
position, the new NHC forecast has been shifted over 100 n mi to the 
southwest by day 4. However, this is still on the far east side of 
the guidance envelope so additional changes to the track forecast 
might be needed this afternoon.

The aforementioned ASCAT data showed peak winds near 50 kt, which 
supports an intensity of 55 kt, assuming a little undersampling due 
to the resolution of the instrument. The intensity analysis is also 
supported by the latest TAFB Dvorak estimate. Despite the 
large changes to the track forecast, no change of note was made to 
the intensity forecast.  Increasing shear and a dry surrounding 
environment should cause Victor to weaken during the next few days. 
Some models even indicate it could dissipate before the end of the 
forecast period. The NHC forecast is based on the intensity model 
consensus.
