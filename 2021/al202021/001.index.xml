Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Wed Sep 29 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Sam, located several hundred miles east of the northern Leeward <br/>
Islands.<br/>
<br/>
Satellite images indicate that showers and thunderstorms continue <br/>
to become better organized in association with an area of low <br/>
pressure located several hundred miles south of the Cabo<br/>
Verde Islands.  If the current trends continue, advisories will <br/>
likely be initiated on a tropical depression or tropical storm <br/>
later today.  This system is expected to move west-northwestward at <br/>
10 to 15 mph over the eastern Atlantic during the next several <br/>
days.  Additional information on this system, including gale <br/>
warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by Meteo <br/>
France. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms remain disorganized in association with a <br/>
a trough of low pressure located several hundred miles southwest of <br/>
the Cabo Verde Islands.  Development of this system appears less <br/>
likely due to the interaction with the larger low pressure area <br/>
located to its east. The system is forecast to drift <br/>
west-northwestward over the tropical central Atlantic during the <br/>
next few days.  <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
An area of low pressure associated with the remnants of Peter  <br/>
located several hundred miles south of the coast of Newfoundland <br/>
is producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms. This system <br/>
is moving northeastward into a region of very strong upper-level <br/>
winds, and significant development is not anticipated.  Additional <br/>
information on this system can be found in High Seas Forecasts <br/>
issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

...POWERFUL SAM CONTINUES MOVING SLOWLY NORTHWESTWARD...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.4N 57.0W
ABOUT 405 MI...655 KM ENE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...130 MPH...215 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...949 MB...28.03 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 19.4 North, longitude 57.0 West.  Sam is moving toward
the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion with an
increase in forward speed is expected during the next couple of
days.  A turn toward the north is forecast by Friday.  On the
forecast track, Sam will pass well to the east-northeast of the 
northern Leeward Islands through tonight.

Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are expected
during the next couple of days, but Sam is forecast to remain a
major hurricane through late this week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft observations is 949 mb (28.03 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the Lesser Antilles
during the next several days.  Swells are expected to reach Bermuda
and the Bahamas in a day or so, and then spread to the United
States east coast by this weekend.  These swells could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 AM AST Wed Sep 29 2021

Sam has a well-organized cloud pattern on satellite imagery, with a 
90 n mi-wide Central Dense Overcast surrounded by numerous 
convective banding features.  Upper-level outflow has now become 
better established to the southeast of the hurricane.  A NOAA 
Hurricane Hunter mission from a couple of hours ago reported a 20 n 
mi-wide diameter circular eye.  The current intensity is held at 115 
kt for this advisory, which is a little higher than the maximum 
winds observed in the earlier aircraft mission.  However, since the 
estimated minimum central pressure of 949 is a little lower than it 
was earlier this morning and Sam's intensity has been fluctuating, 
it is considered prudent not to lower the winds at this time.  An 
Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate the 
hurricane soon and will provide another intensity estimate.

Sam continues its slow northwestward trek with the current motion 
remaining near 310/8 kt.  Sam should move northwestward and then 
northward around the western portion of the subtropical ridge over 
the eastern Atlantic during the next few days, and turn toward 
the north-northeast and northeast later in the forecast period.  
The track guidance models are in very good agreement through 72 
hours or so, with some increase in model spread thereafter.  This
increase in spread is largely due to how Sam will interact with a 
strong mid-latitude trough moving through Atlantic Canada.  Some 
of the guidance suggests that this trough could partially bypass 
the hurricane around the end of the period and beyond, but this 
is not yet clear.  The current NHC forecast track is not much 
different from the previous one and is in good agreement with the 
dynamical model consensus, TVCA.

The hurricane will continue to move over warm waters and in an 
environment of low vertical shear and diffluent upper-level flow 
for the next 1-2 days.  Thus, it would not be surprising to soon 
see some restrengthening.  The official intensity forecast is 
essentially a blend of the latest Decay-SHIPS and LGEM predictions, 
and is very similar to the previous NHC forecast.  Sam is likely to 
remain a major hurricane into this weekend.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Sam are affecting the Leeward Islands
and will spread to portions of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Bahamas, and Bermuda by Thursday or Friday.
Significant swells will likely reach the east coast of the United
States and Atlantic Canada by the weekend.  These swells will likely
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and
beachgoers and other interests along these coasts are urged to
follow the advice of lifeguards and local officials through the
upcoming weekend.

Tropical Depression Twenty Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
200 PM CVT Wed Sep 29 2021

The area of low pressure located over the far eastern tropical 
Atlantic that NHC has been monitoring has now become a tropical 
depression, the twentieth tropical cyclone of the 2021 Atlantic 
hurricane season. Satellite images indicate that the system is 
producing a large area of showers and thunderstorms that have become 
fairly well organized around the center.  An ASCAT-A pass from a  
few hours ago indicated that the system now has a well-defined 
circulation and that the radius of maximum wind is 30-40 n mi north 
of the center.  The initial intensity is set at 30 kt based on the 
ASCAT data and the T2.0/30 kt Dvorak classifications from TAFB and 
SAB.  The minimum pressure of 1007 mb is partially based on data 
from a ship report that passed near the depression.

Based on satellite fixes, the depression appears to be moving 
west-northwestward at about 12 kt.  The system is currently located 
on the south side of a deep-layer ridge, and that feature should 
keep the cyclone on a west-northwest track during the next couple of 
days.  After that time, the models show a mid- to upper-level low 
developing over the central tropical Atlantic, which erodes the 
western portion of the ridge.  This change in the steering flow 
should cause the system to turn northwestward on Friday and then 
northward toward the end of the forecast period.  Although the 
models generally agree on the evolution of the large-scale pattern, 
there are notable differences in the details, which leads to a fair 
amount of spread concerning when and where the turn to the north 
occurs.  The GFS is farthest east while the ECMWF shows the 
westernmost solution.  The NHC track forecast lies between those 
models and is near the TVCA multi-model consensus.  

The depression is expected to remain in conducive environmental 
conditions for strengthening during the next 2 or 3 days.  During 
that time period, the storm is forecast to move over 28-29 deg C 
waters while embedded within an airmass of high mid-level moisture 
and very low wind shear (less than 10 kt).  Therefore, steady 
strengthening seems likely, and the NHC forecast brings the system 
to a tropical storm by tonight and a hurricane in a couple of days.  
Beyond a few days, however, the models show a pronounced increase 
in southwesterly shear and a notably drier atmosphere. These 
unfavorable conditions should end the opportunity for strengthening 
and promote a weakening trend.  The NHC intensity forecast is a near 
a blend of the HCCA, IVCN, and IVDR consensus models.
