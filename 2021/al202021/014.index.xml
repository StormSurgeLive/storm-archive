MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...130 MPH...215 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 35 DEGREES AT 17 MPH...28 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...945 MB...27.91 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 33.9 North, longitude 59.3 West. Sam is moving toward
the northeast near 17 mph (28 km/h).  This general track with an
increase in forward speed is expected for the next few days.  On
the forecast track, Sam will continue to move away from Bermuda.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some slow weakening is forecast during the
next 36 hours, followed by more significant weakening early next
week.  Sam could become a powerful post-tropical cyclone on Tuesday.
 
Sam is becoming a large tropical cyclone.  Hurricane-force winds 
extend outward up to 65 miles (100 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 945 mb (27.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, the eastern United
States and Atlantic Canada for the next couple of days.  These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  40
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 AM AST Sat Oct 02 2021

Sam has been an impressive hurricane during the past several days.  
The latest satellite imagery shows it remains a powerful system, 
with a well-defined eye and symmetric cloud pattern.  In fact, 
since the plane left overnight, the eye has actually warmed, with 
little change in the eyewall convection.  Thus the initial intensity 
will stay 115 kt, above the latest satellite classifications, but 
consistent with the earlier aircraft data and low bias of the 
Dvorak technique for much of the this storm.  Sam is now in the top 
10 for consecutive days as a category 4 hurricane or greater in 
the historical record, about the same as Matthew 2016.

The hurricane is forecast to gradually lose strength during the 
next 36 hours or so while it remains over marginally warm waters, 
but in fairly light shear.  In fact, some of the guidance decrease 
the shear overnight, which should allow Sam to keep much of its 
strength, provided it doesn't undertake an eyewall cycle.  The new 
intensity forecast is higher in the first day or so, consistent 
with the latest model solutions.  In about 2 days, Sam will cross 
the north wall of the Gulf Stream, and in 3 days is expected to 
spectacularly transition into a large hurricane-force post-tropical 
cyclone over the far north Atlantic.  No changes were made to the 
end of the intensity forecast.

Sam has turned northeastward at about 15 kt.  The hurricane should 
accelerate later this weekend due to increasing flow between a 
deep-layer ridge to the east and a large mid- to upper-level low 
over Atlantic Canada.  By midweek the system is forecast to turn 
more to the north-northeast as it becomes a spoke in a very large 
extratropical low over the far North Atlantic.  The new forecast has 
shifted somewhat eastward during the first couple of days but ends 
up very near the last advisory by day 5. 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward Islands,
the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the eastern United 
States coast and Atlantic Canada for the next couple of days.  
These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

...VICTOR BARELY HOLDING ON AS A TROPICAL CYCLONE...
...COULD BECOME A REMNANT LOW BY TONIGHT...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...13.1N 37.2W
ABOUT 905 MI...1455 KM W OF THE CABO VERDE ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1005 MB...29.68 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Victor was 
located near latitude 13.1 North, longitude 37.2 West. Victor is 
moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue over the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual weakening is forecast over the next couple of days, and 
Victor could become a remnant low by tonight. The system is then 
forecast to dissipate by Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Tropical Storm Victor Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
1100 AM AST Sat Oct 02 2021
 
Strong southwesterly shear and entrainment of dry air have taken 
their toll on Victor. The deep convection and the remnant mid-level 
core has been stripped away from the cyclone's low-level 
circulation, and is now more than 250 n mi northeast of Victor's 
center. The most recent UW-CIMMS shear analysis indicates the shear 
magnitude is about 30 kt over the center of the cyclone, and nearly 
50 kt just to its north. The initial intensity is being lowered to 
35 kt for this advisory based on the latest subjective Dvorak 
intensity estimate from TAFB. However, this value could be generous.
 
Victor's vector is 305/10 kt. This motion is expected to continue 
until the system dissipates, as the cyclone is steered in the flow 
to the southwest of a subtropical ridge. The latest NHC track 
forecast is just slightly to the left of the previous one, and lies 
on the western side of the guidance envelope to accommodate the 
shallow nature of the circulation. 
 
The strong shear is not forecast to abate over the cyclone for the 
foreseeable future and very dry, African dust-laden air lies in 
the path of Victor. Therefore, it is unlikely that organized deep 
convection will redevelop near the center of the cyclone. Because of 
this, Victor is now expected to become a remnant low by tonight. The 
remnant low is forecast by the global models to open into a trough 
in 60 h. Due to the quick weakening that has been observed, the 
latest NHC intensity forecast was lowered through the first 12 h, 
and then remains the same as the previous forecast beyond that time 
frame.
