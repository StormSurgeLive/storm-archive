Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Mon Sep 20 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Peter, located about 150 miles northeast of the northern<br/>
Leeward Islands, and on Tropical Storm Rose, located over the <br/>
eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave located <br/>
several hundred miles south of the Cabo Verde Islands continue to <br/>
show some signs of organization, although recent satellite wind data <br/>
indicate that the system lacks a surface circulation. Upper-level <br/>
winds, however, are expected to become conducive for further <br/>
development during the next day or two, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form by Thursday or Friday while the system moves westward <br/>
at 10 to 15 mph across the eastern and central tropical Atlantic <br/>
Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A storm-force, non-tropical low pressure system, the remnants of <br/>
Odette, is located several hundred miles southeast of Newfoundland.  <br/>
This low could acquire some subtropical characteristics by the <br/>
middle of this week as it moves slowly southeastward over warmer <br/>
waters across the north-central Atlantic Ocean, before it moves <br/>
northward over cooler waters over the weekend.  Additional <br/>
information on this system, including storm warnings, can be found <br/>
in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and <br/>

...RESILIENT PETER MAINTAINS ITS STRENGTH DESPITE STRONG SHEAR...
...EXPECTED TO PASS NORTH OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS AND PUERTO RICO ON
TUESDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.8N 62.8W
ABOUT 110 MI...180 KM N OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 285 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1008 MB...29.77 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Peter was 
located near latitude 19.8 North, longitude 62.8 West.  Peter is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  This 
general motion is expected to continue for the next day or so, 
followed by a turn to the northwest with a decrease in forward speed 
on Wednesday, and then a turn to the north by Wednesday night.  On 
the forecast track, the center of Peter will pass north of the 
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Tuesday.
 
Recent satellite-derived wind data indicate that maximum sustained 
winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.  Slow 
weakening is forecast during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km) 
from the center, primarily in the northeastern quadrant.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Rainfall around the southern periphery of Tropical Storm
Peter could produce rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches, with locally
higher amounts possible, across portions of the Northern Leeward
Islands, including the Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico and
the northern portions of Hispaniola through Tuesday. This rainfall
may lead to areas of urban and small stream flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Peter are affecting the northern Leeward
Islands and Puerto Rico, and will continue spreading westward to
Hispaniola on Tuesday and the Bahamas on Wednesday.  These swells
could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Tropical Storm Peter Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
1100 PM AST Mon Sep 20 2021
 
Peter has proven to be a resilient tropical cyclone, despite strong 
upper-level wind shear that continues to displace its deep 
convection well east of its now exposed low-level center. Data from 
an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigating Peter 
tonight, as well as recent scatterometer data, indicate that the 
cyclone has maintained its tropical storm intensity. An ASCAT-A pass 
shows several 40-kt wind vectors, with tropical-storm-force winds 
extending outward up to 150 n mi from the center in the northeastern 
quadrant. The aircraft has found peak 925-mb flight-level winds of 
47 kt and SFMR winds of around 35 kt, although it did not sample the 
area where ASCAT depicted the strongest winds. The initial intensity 
is held at a possibly generous 45 kt for this advisory based on the 
scatterometer data.
 
An upper-level trough to the northwest of Peter should maintain 20 
to 30 kt of vertical wind shear over the cyclone for the next 2-3 
days. Thus, intensification seems unlikely during this period, 
despite 29 deg C SSTs along Peter's forecast track. If the tropical 
cyclone can endure these hostile upper-level winds, it could survive 
through the entire forecast period, although the drier mid-level 
environment at higher latitudes will also work against Peter later 
this week. However, an alternative scenario that has been favored by 
the GFS is that Peter weakens sooner due to a lack of sustained 
convection and opens up into a trough late this week. The long-range 
forecast is further complicated by the potential development of 
another non-tropical low to the north of Peter later this week, 
which could interact with or absorb Peter. The official NHC 
intensity forecast is similar to the previous one and only shows 
gradual weakening over the next several days, which is in good 
agreement with the HCCA and IVDR consensus aids.
 
Data from the aircraft indicate that the center has moved westward 
and slowed down a bit over the past several hours, and Peter's 
initial motion is estimated to be 285/10 kt. Peter is expected 
to continue moving generally west-northwestward through Tuesday, as 
it is steered around the southern extent of a low- to mid-level 
ridge over the central and western Atlantic. By Wednesday, a 
mid-level cutoff low is forecast to develop to the north of Peter 
over the western Atlantic, which will induce a weakness in the 
steering ridge. Therefore, the cyclone is forecast to slow down and 
turn northward and then north-northeastward through the latter part 
of the week and into the weekend. There are some larger along-track 
differences noted in the guidance at days 4-5, with the ECMWF moving 
or re-forming the center much farther north than the rest of the 
track guidance. The official NHC track forecast is shifted slightly 
to the right at 48 h and beyond, based on the latest TVCA and HCCA 
consensus aids. At longer ranges, the forecast is of much lower 
confidence and trends a bit slower than the consensus aids, which 
are heavily influenced by the outlying ECMWF solution.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Rainfall around the southern periphery of Tropical Storm Peter
may lead to areas of urban and small stream flooding through Tuesday
across northern Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the
Northern Leeward Islands.

<title>Tropical Storm Rose Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Tropical Storm Rose Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172021
1100 PM AST Mon Sep 20 2021
 
Although Rose's convective pattern does not appear to be as 
organized as it was earlier today, a couple of ASCAT overpasses this 
evening indicated that the tropical cyclone has strengthened since 
this morning. Both ASCAT-A and -B instruments detected 40-45 kt 
winds around the southeastern portion of the circulation, and the 
initial intensity was raised to 45 kt around 0000 UTC with the 
issuance of a Tropical Cyclone Update.  That intensity is maintained 
for this advisory, and it is also in agreement with subjective 
Dvorak data T-numbers of 3.0 from TAFB and SAB. 

The ASCAT data also indicated that the center of Rose is located to 
the west of the previous estimates, near the northwestern edge of 
the convective mass noted in satellite imagery.  As a result of the 
center re-location, the initial motion is a somewhat uncertain 
320/13 kt.  Although the short-term portion of the track forecast 
has been adjusted westward due to the more westward initial 
position, there has been no overall change in forecast track 
reasoning for this advisory.  Rose should continue northwestward 
around the western portion of a strong subtropical ridge during the 
next couple of days.  Beyond that time, a mid- to upper-level trough 
over the north-central Atlantic should cause Rose to recurve 
northward, then northeastward, and finally east-northeastward by the 
end of the forecast period.  The dynamical models are in general  
agreement on this scenario but there are some differences in how 
sharp Rose will turn, and how fast it will move northeastward late 
in the period.  The new NHC track forecast shows a somewhat sharper 
turn than the previous advisory to be closer to the latest consensus 
aids. 

Rose has likely reached its peak intensity as increasing shear and 
the entrainment of drier mid-level air are likely to cause weakening 
by this time tomorrow. Additional weakening is expected after that 
time as a further increase in shear is anticipated when Rose nears 
the aforementioned trough in 2 to 3 days. The updated NHC wind speed 
forecast is slightly stronger at 12 and 24 hours due to the higher 
initial intensity, but is unchanged after that time. Given the 
expected hostile environmental conditions, it would not be 
surprising to see Rose wither more quickly and degenerate into a 
remnant low sooner than indicated below.  That is indicated by at 
least some of the global model guidance.
