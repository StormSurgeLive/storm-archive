Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Tue Sep 21 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Peter, located a couple of hundred miles northeast <br/>
of Puerto Rico, and on Tropical Storm Rose, located about 1000 <br/>
miles west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands. <br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave located <br/>
several hundred miles southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands have <br/>
increased since this morning and are beginning to show signs of <br/>
organization. Recent satellite wind data also indicate that a broad <br/>
area of low pressure has formed, but the system lacks a well-defined <br/>
center. Environmental conditions are expected to remain conducive <br/>
for additional development, and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form within the next day or two while the system moves westward at <br/>
10 to 15 mph across the eastern and central tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A gale-force, non-tropical low pressure system, the remnants of <br/>
Odette, is located about 500 miles west of the westernmost Azores. <br/>
This low could acquire some subtropical characteristics over <br/>
marginally warm waters during the next few days while it executes a <br/>
small counter-clockwise loop over the north-central Atlantic Ocean. <br/>
However, by the end of the week, this system is expected to <br/>
encounter more hostile environmental conditions.  Additional <br/>
information on this system, including gale warnings, can be found in <br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>

High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and <br/>

Tropical Depression Peter Advisory Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
1100 PM AST Tue Sep 21 2021
 
...DEPRESSION CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE WITH STRONG SHEAR...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.8N 65.3W
ABOUT 175 MI...280 KM NNE OF SAN JUAN PUERTO RICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1009 MB...29.80 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Peter 
was located near latitude 20.8 North, longitude 65.3 West.  The 
depression is moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A 
turn to the north is expected by late tomorrow, followed by a 
north-northeastward or northeastward motion through the end of the 
week.  On the forecast track, the center of Peter will continue 
moving away from the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico through early 
Wednesday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some gradual weakening is expected during the next couple of days, 
and Peter is forecast to degenerate into a remnant low by Thursday.
 
Nearby NOAA buoy observations indicate the estimated minimum central 
pressure is 1009 mb (29.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Rainfall around the southern periphery of Peter could 
produce additional rainfall totals of 1 to 4 inches, with storm 
total accumulations up to 6 inches, across portions of the Virgin 
Islands, Puerto Rico, and northern portions of Hispaniola through 
Thursday morning. This rainfall may lead to areas of urban and small 
stream flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Peter are affecting the Virgin Islands,
Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola, and will continue spreading westward to
the Bahamas on Wednesday.  These swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

<title>Tropical Depression Peter Forecast Discussion Number 14</title>

Tropical Depression Peter Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
1100 PM AST Tue Sep 21 2021
 
The last visible satellite images of Peter this evening indicated 
that its low-level center was losing definition and becoming even 
more elongated. Earlier, new bursts of convection associated with 
Peter had become oriented along a northeast to southwest axis, a 
possible sign that Peter may no longer have a well-defined center 
and could be opening up into a trough. But the estimated center 
position is now obscured by convective debris, and without recent 
scatterometer data to prove otherwise, Peter is maintained as a 
sheared tropical depression for this advisory. The initial intensity 
of 30 kt is consistent with a UW-CIMSS ADT objective 30-kt estimate 
and a T2.0/30 kt Dvorak classification from SAB.
 
It is estimated that Peter is moving northwestward, or 310/6 kt, 
although this is somewhat uncertain given the degraded low-level 
structure of the cyclone. The track reasoning remains consistent 
with previous advisories. Peter is forecast to turn more northward 
on Wednesday, and then move north-northeastward to northeastward 
through the end of the week as a trough to the north and northeast 
of Peter erodes the southern portion of the low-level steering 
ridge. The track consensus aids have shifted slightly to the right 
this cycle, and so the latest NHC track forecast has been adjusted a 
little to the right of the previous one.
 
Environmental conditions are expected to remain hostile for Peter 
over the next couple of days. Strong vertical wind shear of 25-30 kt 
will persist for the next 24-36 h, and GFS and ECMWF model simulated 
satellite imagery suggest that Peter will be unable to sustain 
enough deep, organized convection to maintain its status as a 
tropical cyclone for much longer. Thus, the NHC forecast shows Peter 
becoming a remnant low in 36 h, with some additional weakening 
expected before dissipation by this weekend. Of course, without 
sufficient convection to sustain the low-level vortex, it would not 
be surprising if the depression degenerated into a trough even 
sooner than forecast.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Rainfall around the southern periphery of Peter may lead to areas 
of urban and small stream flooding through early Wednesday across 
northern Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and portions of the Virgin 
Islands.

Tropical Depression Rose Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172021
1100 PM AST Tue Sep 21 2021
 
Strong northwesterly shear has continued to take a toll on Rose 
this evening with the remaining deep convection becoming further 
separated from the low-level center.  Unfortunately Rose fell 
within the gaps of the ASCAT satellite instruments this evening, so 
there has been no recent scatterometer data.  Dvorak T-numbers from 
TAFB and SAB have continued to decline, and these subjective 
estimates support lowering Rose's initial intensity to 30 kt. The 
environment ahead of the cyclone is expected to remain quite 
hostile with moderate westerly to northwesterly shear and a dry 
mid-level atmosphere.  Simulated satellite imagery from the global 
models suggest Rose will continue to produce bursts of convection 
over the eastern portion of its circulation during the next few days 
which could allow it remain a tropical cyclone during that time. 
Alternatively, the shear and dry air could cause the system to 
degenerate into a remnant low much sooner.  The latest NHC intensity 
forecast is similar to the previous advisory and calls for little 
overall change in strength during the next couple of days, followed 
by degeneration into a remnant low by day 3. 

Rose continues to decelerate, now moving northwestward at about 
9 kt. The depression should remain on a slow northwestward heading 
around the western portion of a subtropical ridge during the next 
24 to 36 hours.  After that time, the cyclone is forecast to turn
northward, and then recurve northeastward ahead of a mid- to 
upper-level trough over the central Atlantic.  The dynamical 
guidance envelope remained fairly steady this cycle and no 
significant change was made to the previous official forecast.
