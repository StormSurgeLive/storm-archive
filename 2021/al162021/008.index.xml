Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Mon Sep 20 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Peter, located east-northeast of the northernmost Leeward <br/>
Islands, and on Tropical Storm Rose, located over the eastern <br/>
tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave located over the far eastern tropical Atlantic <br/>
several hundred miles south-southeast of the Cabo Verde Islands <br/>
is producing an area of showers and thunderstorms that are showing <br/>
some signs of organization.  Upper-level winds are expected to <br/>
become more conducive for further development by midweek, and a <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form by Friday while the system <br/>
moves westward at 10 to 15 mph across the eastern and central <br/>
tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A storm-force, non-tropical low pressure system, the remnants <br/>
of Odette, is located a couple of hundred miles southeast of <br/>
Newfoundland.  This low could acquire some subtropical <br/>
characteristics by the middle of this week as it moves slowly <br/>
southeastward over warmer waters across the north-central Atlantic <br/>
Ocean before moving northward out of the area over the weekend.  <br/>
Additional information on this system, including storm warnings, can <br/>
be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather <br/>
Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and <br/>
online at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php<br/>

Tropical Storm Peter Advisory Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
1100 AM AST Mon Sep 20 2021
 
...PETER BATTLING INCREASINGLY HOSTILE WIND SHEAR...
...TROPICAL STORM EXPECTED TO PASS NORTH OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS
EARLY THIS WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.5N 60.9W
ABOUT 170 MI...275 KM ENE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1007 MB...29.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Peter was
located near latitude 19.5 North, longitude 60.9 West. Peter is
moving toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h). This
general motion is expected to continue during the next couple of
days, followed by a turn to the northwest with a decrease in
forward speed on Wednesday. On the forecast track, the center of 
Peter will pass north of the northern Leeward Islands and Puerto 
Rico through Tuesday. 
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that the maximum sustained remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Slow weakening is forecast during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on aircraft data is 
1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Rainfall around the southern periphery of Tropical Storm
Peter could produce rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches, with locally
higher amounts possible, across portions of the Northern Leeward
Islands, including the Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico and
the northern portions of Hispaniola through Tuesday. This rainfall
may lead to areas of urban and small stream flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Peter are expected to affect the northern
Leeward Islands early this week, and then reach the Bahamas by
midweek.  These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Peter Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Tropical Storm Peter Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
1100 AM AST Mon Sep 20 2021
 
West-southwesterly vertical wind shear on the order of 30 kt is 
pummeling Peter this morning. Just like yesterday morning, the 
low-level center of the storm is pulling away from the deep 
convection and is now displaced greater than 80 n mi. An Air Force 
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft has been investigating Peter this 
morning and has measured peak 925-mb flight-level winds of 54 kt 
and several SFMR values of 40-45 kt, supporting keeping the initial 
intensity at 45 kt for this advisory.  

Peter refuses to slow down, and for the past several hours has been 
moving 290/14 kt. This west-northwestward motion is forecast to 
continue for the next two days as the system remains to the 
southwest of a subtropical ridge. By Wednesday, Peter should slow 
down and turn northwest then north as it reaches a developing 
weakness in the ridge carved out by a mid-latitude trough 
moving across the northeastern United States later this week. The 
model track guidance has shifted slightly left for the 24-72 h time 
frames, and the NHC forecast track was nudged in that direction as 
well. Otherwise, the latest NHC forecast track is little changed 
from the previous one. 

An upper-level trough to the west of Peter is forecast to remain 
near the cyclone for the next few days, keeping the storm in a 
high-shear environment. Therefore, despite being over warm waters 
the storm is forecast to slowly weaken. If Peter survives the next 
72 h, there could be a window of opportunity late in the forecast 
period for some modest strengthening as the cyclone would have 
lifted to the north of the upper trough. It should be noted that a 
vast majority of the GFS ensembles show Peter dissipating later this 
week as the system opens into a wave. This scenario is plausible, 
especially if deep convection fails to persist near the center of 
the cyclone. The latest NHC intensity forecast assumes Peter 
survives, and closely follows the various intensity consensus 
solutions.
 
Based on the latest track, intensity, and wind radii forecasts, no
tropical storm watches or warnings are required for the northern
Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, or Puerto Rico at this time.
However, locally heavy rain is possible today and Tuesday when
Peter is expected to pass to the north of these locations.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Rainfall around the southern periphery of Tropical Storm Peter 
may lead to areas of urban and small stream flooding through 
Tuesday across northern Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, the Virgin 
Islands, and the Northern Leeward Islands.

Tropical Storm Rose Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172021
500 AM AST Mon Sep 20 2021
 
Rose remains a sheared tropical storm with the low-level center 
located near the eastern edge of the convective cloud mass based on 
an earlier 0359Z AMSR2 microwave overpass. These same data also 
revealed that a well-defined mid-level circulation center was 
located about 80-90 nmi west of the low-level center, an indication 
of the magnitude and effect of the mid-level shear impinging on the 
cyclone. The intensity of 35 kt is being maintained for this 
advisory based on subjective Dvorak satellite intensity estimates of 
35 from both TAFB and SAB. Objective estimates from UW-CIMSS are 
higher at 45-55 kt, which are considered to be unrepresentative due 
to the severe westward tilt of Rose's vortex column.
 
The initial motion estimate is northwestward or 315/13 kt.  Rose is 
expected to move generally northwestward around the southwestern and 
western periphery of a strong subtropical ridge during the next few 
days.  By day 4 and beyond, a mid- to upper-level trough over the 
north-central Atlantic is forecast to dig southeastward, causing the 
cyclone to turn northward.  The latest NHC model guidance remains in 
excellent agreement on this track scenario through 72 hours, but 
then diverge significantly thereafter owing to whether Rose weakens 
to shallow system or remains a little stringer and deeper. The 
weaker solutions go more toward the northwest and the stronger 
solutions take Rose northeastward. The NHC forecast track on days 4 
and 5 is a blend of these two extremes. 
 
Rose only has about 24 hours over warm waters and in a weak vertical 
wind shear regime that will allow for some addition strengthening to 
occur. On days 2-5, however, increasing westerly shear is expected 
to induce some gradual weakening.  Rose is forecast to weaken to a 
tropical depression by 96 hours, although some of the models suggest 
that weakening could occur faster than indicated below, and that 
Rose could degenerate into a remnant low by the end of the forecast 
period.
