Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Mon Sep 20 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Peter, located northeast of the northernmost Leeward <br/>
Islands, and on Tropical Storm Rose, located over the eastern <br/>
tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave located<br/>
several hundred miles south of the Cabo Verde Islands are <br/>
still showing some signs of organization, although there does not <br/>
appear to be a surface circulation at this time.  Upper-level <br/>
winds, however, are expected to become conducive for further <br/>
development by midweek, and a tropical depression is likely to form <br/>
by Thursday or Friday while the system moves westward at 10 to 15 <br/>
mph across the eastern and central tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A storm-force, non-tropical low pressure system, the remnants <br/>
of Odette, is located a few hundred miles southeast of <br/>
Newfoundland.  This low could acquire some subtropical <br/>
characteristics by the middle of this week as it moves slowly <br/>
southeastward over warmer waters across the north-central Atlantic <br/>
Ocean before moving northward over cooler waters over the weekend.  <br/>
Additional information on this system, including storm warnings, can <br/>
be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather <br/>
Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and <br/>
online at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php<br/>

Tropical Storm Peter Advisory Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
500 PM AST Mon Sep 20 2021
 
...PETER REFUSES TO SUCCUMB TO STRONG WIND SHEAR...
...STORM EXPECTED TO PASS NORTH OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS EARLY THIS 
WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.0N 61.8W
ABOUT 150 MI...240 KM NE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...50 MPH...85 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1007 MB...29.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Peter was 
located near latitude 20.0 North, longitude 61.8 West. Peter is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). This general 
motion is expected to continue during the next day or so, followed 
by a turn to the northwest with a decrease in forward speed on 
Wednesday, and then a turn to the north by Wednesday night. On the 
forecast track, the center of Peter will pass north of the northern 
Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico through Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Slow weakening is forecast during the next few days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Rainfall around the southern periphery of Tropical Storm
Peter could produce rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches, with locally
higher amounts possible across portions of the Northern Leeward
Islands, including the Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico and
the northern portions of Hispaniola through Tuesday. This rainfall
may lead to areas of urban and small stream flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Peter are expected to affect the northern
Leeward Islands early this week, and then reach the Bahamas by
midweek.  These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Peter Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Tropical Storm Peter Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
500 PM AST Mon Sep 20 2021
 
Peter's evolution on satellite today is nearly a repeat of 
yesterday, with the deep convection having been stripped well east 
of the center in the morning and then redeveloping over and east of 
the center by the afternoon. An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft investigating Peter this morning and early afternoon 
provided data during a few different passes through the northeast 
quadrant that supported peak surface winds of 40-45 kt. Since the 
convection has returned it is reasonable to assume that no weakening 
has occurred since the aircraft departed the cyclone, and the 
initial advisory intensity remains 45 kt.
 
Vertical wind shear is forecast to remain near 30 kt for the next 
few days as Peter interacts with an upper trough to its west, so 
some weakening is anticipated during that time. By late in the 
forecast period, the shear should lessen somewhat as the cyclone 
lifts north of the upper trough. Therefore, slow strengthening is 
indicated by late this week. There remains a possibility that Peter 
does not survive the shear over the next few days. However, the 
storm thus far has shown some resiliency to the hostile environment. 
The latest NHC intensity forecast is little changed from the 
previous one and remains near the various intensity consensus 
solutions. 
 
Peter continues to move west-northwest but at a slightly slower pace 
of around 12 kt. The forecast track reasoning for the cyclone 
remains the same. The west-northwestward motion is forecast to 
continue for the next two days as the system remains to the 
southwest of a subtropical ridge. By Wednesday, Peter should slow 
down and turn northwest then north as it reaches a developing 
weakness in the ridge carved out by a mid-latitude trough moving 
across the northeastern United States. There were no significant 
changes to the track or the track guidance from the previous 
advisory, and the latest NHC track is closest to the TVCN and GFEX 
consensus tracks. 
 
Based on the latest track, intensity, and wind radii forecasts, no
tropical storm watches or warnings are required for the northern
Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, or Puerto Rico at this time.
However, locally heavy rain is possible today and Tuesday when
Peter is expected to pass to the north of these locations.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Rainfall around the southern periphery of Tropical Storm Peter
may lead to areas of urban and small stream flooding through
Tuesday across northern Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, the Virgin
Islands, and the Northern Leeward Islands.

Tropical Storm Rose Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172021
500 PM AST Mon Sep 20 2021
 
Satellite images show that Rose hasn't changed much during the past 
several hours, with the center on the northern side of the cloud 
shield.  The last microwave pass from a few hours ago showed that 
the mid- and low-level centers of the cyclone remained 60-90 n mi 
apart, which is probably a sign that it isn't strengthening.  The 
initial wind speed remains 35 kt based on continuity, and hopefully 
scatterometer data will be available for the next advisory due to 
the recent high bias of the conventional satellite estimates.
 
The window for strengthening of the tropical cyclone is closing soon 
due to increasing shear and likely intrusions of dry mid-level air. 
These factors should cause the storm to start a weakening trend 
sometime tomorrow.  The long-term future of Rose doesn't look golden 
either due to further increasing shear from an incoming upper- level 
trough.  The new forecast is just a shade lower than the previous 
one, near the model consensus, with Rose likely sinking to a 
depression in a few days and degenerating to a remnant low by day 5.
 
The initial motion remains northwestward at about 14 kt.  Rose is
is likely to continue moving in that general direction during 
the next couple of days around the southwestern and western 
periphery of a strong subtropical ridge.  Beyond that time, 
guidance is coming into good agreement on a mid- to upper-level 
trough over the north-central Atlantic causing the cyclone to 
recurve to the north, northeast and even east-northeastward by 
the weekend.  While the models don't agree on how sharp of a 
turn will occur, they are at least consistent that this trough 
will take the storm into a hostile environment and decay. The new 
forecast is again adjusted well to northeast at long range, and 
still might not be far enough to the east.
