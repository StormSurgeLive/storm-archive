BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Peter Advisory Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
500 AM AST Sun Sep 19 2021
 
...DEPRESSION BECOMES THE SIXTEENTH NAMED STORM OF THE SEASON
OVER THE OPEN ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.0N 53.5W
ABOUT 630 MI...1015 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1005 MB...29.68 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Peter was
located near latitude 18.0 North, longitude 53.5 West. Peter is
moving toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue this morning. A turn back toward the 
west-northwest is forecast to occur by this afternoon, with that 
motion continuing into Wednesday.  On the forecast track, Peter
is expected to pass well to the north of the northern Leeward 
Islands on Monday and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some additional strengthening is forecast during the next day or 
so, followed by a slow weakening trend by late Monday and on 
Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) 
from the center, mainly to the northeast and southeast of the 
center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  The outer bands south of the Tropical Storm Peter could
produce rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches across portions of the
Northern Leeward Islands, including the Virgin Islands, as well as
Puerto Rico late Sunday into Tuesday. This rainfall may lead to
areas of urban and small stream flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tropical Storm Peter are expected to
reach the northern Leeward Islands Sunday night and Monday.  These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
 Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Tropical Storm Peter Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
500 AM AST Sun Sep 19 2021
 
Deep convection has increased since the previous advisory, with the 
convective cloud pattern having taken on a more curved-band 
configuration compared to the earlier shear pattern. Satellite 
intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB support increasing the 
intensity to 35 kt. In addition, earlier ASCAT passes, which missed 
the center of circulation, did reveal 30-kt winds west of the center 
in convection-free areas. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that 
stronger winds are occurring within the deep convection east of the 
center, which further supports upgrading the system to Tropical 
Storm Peter with a 35-kt intensity.
 
The initial estimate is an uncertain 305/13 kt. Peter has made a 
slight jog to the north-northwest since the previous advisory, but 
this is likely a short-term motion owing to the center redeveloping 
farther to the north and east into the deep convection. However, a 
west-northwestward motion is expected to resume later today. 
Thereafter, the cyclone is forecast to maintain a west-northwestward 
motion through Wednesday as Peter moves around the southwestern 
periphery of a strong deep-layer subtropical ridge. On Thursday and 
Friday, Peter is forecast to turn northward into a weakness in the 
ridge induced by the large Post-Tropical Cyclone Odette.  The new 
forecast track has been shifted slightly to the right or north of 
the previous advisory track, mainly due to the more northward 
initial position, and lies close to the consensus track models TVCA 
and HCCA.
 
Some strengthening is forecast during the next 24 hours or so as 
Peter moves over warmer sea-surface temperatures of about 29 deg C. 
However, proximity to very dry mid-level air and moderate 
deep-layer southwesterly vertical wind shear are expected to prevent 
any significant or rapid strengthening. By early Tuesday and 
beyond, slow weakening is expected to begin due to increasing wind 
shear.  The new official NHC intensity forecast is very similar to 
the previous advisory, and closely follows a blend of the IVCN and 
HCCA intensity consensus models.
 
Based on the track, intensity, and wind radii forecast, no tropical
storm watches or warnings are required for the northern Leeward
Islands, Virgin Islands or Puerto Rico.  However, interests there
should monitor the progress of the system as locally heavy rain is
possible on Monday and Tuesday when it is expected to pass to the
north of the area.

Key Messages:

1. Rainfall around the southern periphery of Tropical Storm Peter 
may lead to areas of urban and small stream flooding from late 
Sunday into Tuesday across Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the 
Northern Leeward Islands.

----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...11.8N 28.2W
ABOUT 330 MI...530 KM SW OF THE SOUTHERNMOST CABO VERDE ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 330 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1007 MB...29.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM CVT (0900 UTC), the center of newly formed Tropical 
Depression Seventeen was located near latitude 11.8 North, longitude 
28.2 West. The depression is moving toward the north-northwest near 
14 mph (22 km/h), and this general motion is expected to continue 
today.  A motion toward northwest is forecast to begin by tonight 
and continue through Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some strengthening is expected for the next couple of days, and the 
depression could become a tropical storm later today or on Monday. 
By Tuesday, environmental conditions are is expected to become less 
conducive for development, and the system is forecast to begin a 
slow weakening trend.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Tropical Depression Seventeen Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172021
800 AM CVT Sun Sep 19 2021
 
The small low pressure system that the NHC has been tracking the 
past few days has acquired a well-defined circulation and enough 
organized deep convection to be classified as a tropical depression. 
The initial intensity of 30 kt is based on 0000 UTC ASCAT wind data 
of about 30 kt. This intensity is also supported by consensus Dvorak 
satellite classifications of T2.0/30 kt from TAFB and SAB.

The initial motion estimate is north-northwestward or 330/12 kt. 
The small cyclone is forecast to move in a general northwestward 
direction throughout the remainder of the forecast period as the 
system moves along the southwestern and western periphery of a 
subtropical ridge that extends westward from Africa across the Cabo 
Verde Islands. The NHC forecast track lies down the middle of the 
tightly packed track models.

Only modest strengthening is expected during the next 48 hour so 
while the small cyclone remains over 27-28 deg C sea-surface 
temperatures and the vertical wind shear decreases to near 5 kt 
during that time. However, proximity to dry air is expected 
prevent any significant strengthening from occurring. By late 
Tuesday, a slow weakening trend is forecast to begin as the system 
moves over cooler water and the shear increases from the southwest. 
The NHC intensity forecast closely follows a blend of the IVCN and 
HCCA intensity consensus models through 72 hours, and then is lower 
than the HCCA model on days 4 and 5.
