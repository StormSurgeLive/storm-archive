Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Sun Sep 19 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on newly formed<br/>
Tropical Depression Sixteen, located a several hundred miles east of <br/>
the northern Leeward Island.<br/>
<br/>
Recent satellite-derived wind data indicate that the small low <br/>
pressure system located over the far eastern tropical Atlantic a few <br/>
hundred miles south-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands has become <br/>
better defined.  Associated thunderstorm activity has also become <br/>
more concentrated near the center, and environmental conditions are <br/>
conducive for a tropical depression to form later this morning while <br/>
the low moves generally northwestward at 10 to 15 mph, well to the <br/>
west of the Cabo Verde Islands.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>

Public Advisories on Tropical Depression Sixteen are issued under <br/>

BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Peter Advisory Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
500 AM AST Sun Sep 19 2021
 
...DEPRESSION BECOMES THE SIXTEENTH NAMED STORM OF THE SEASON
OVER THE OPEN ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.0N 53.5W
ABOUT 630 MI...1015 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1005 MB...29.68 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Peter was
located near latitude 18.0 North, longitude 53.5 West. Peter is
moving toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue this morning. A turn back toward the 
west-northwest is forecast to occur by this afternoon, with that 
motion continuing into Wednesday.  On the forecast track, Peter
is expected to pass well to the north of the northern Leeward 
Islands on Monday and Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some additional strengthening is forecast during the next day or 
so, followed by a slow weakening trend by late Monday and on 
Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) 
from the center, mainly to the northeast and southeast of the 
center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  The outer bands south of the Tropical Storm Peter could
produce rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches across portions of the
Northern Leeward Islands, including the Virgin Islands, as well as
Puerto Rico late Sunday into Tuesday. This rainfall may lead to
areas of urban and small stream flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tropical Storm Peter are expected to
reach the northern Leeward Islands Sunday night and Monday.  These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
 Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Tropical Depression Sixteen Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
1100 PM AST Sat Sep 18 2021
 
Satellite images and surface observations indicate that the area of 
low pressure that NHC has been monitoring to the east of the 
northern Leeward Islands now has a well-defined center and 
sufficiently organized deep convection to be classified a tropical 
depression.  The depression has a small area of deep convection near 
its center and curved bands on its north and east sides.  The 
initial intensity is estimated to be 30 kt, but this is a little 
below the latest Dvorak classifications and could be conservative.

The depression is moving west-northwestward at 12 kt.  The cyclone 
should continue west-northwestward at about the same pace during the 
next few days as it moves in the flow on the southwest side of a 
mid-level ridge.  After that time, the ridge is expected to break 
down and the steering currents are forecast to become weak.  Not 
surprisingly, the spread in the models increases around that time, 
but most of the solutions show a slow turn toward the north toward 
broad troughing associated with Post-Tropical Cyclone Odette.  The 
GFS is on the southern side of the guidance envelope and the ECMWF 
on the northern side. The NHC track forecast lies between those 
models near the consensus aids.

Some strengthening seems possible during the next 12 to 24 hours and 
the system is expected to become a tropical storm during that time 
frame.  However, an increase in southerly and then southwesterly 
vertical wind shear should cause the system to level off in strength 
from 24 hours through the end of the forecast period.  The models 
are in fairly good agreement on this overall scenario, and the NHC 
intensity forecast is in line with the majority of the guidance. 

Based on the track, intensity, and wind radii forecast, no tropical 
storm watches or warnings are required for the northern Leeward 
Islands, Virgin Islands or Puerto Rico.  However, interests there 
should monitor the progress of the system as locally heavy rain is 
possible on Monday and Tuesday when it is expected to pass to the 
north of the area.
