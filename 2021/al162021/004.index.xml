Tropical Storm Peter Advisory Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
1100 AM AST Sun Sep 19 2021
 
...DISHEVELED PETER HEADING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD...
...EXPECTED TO PASS NORTH OF THE LESSER ANTILLES EARLY THIS WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.6N 56.5W
ABOUT 435 MI...700 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 17 MPH...28 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1007 MB...29.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of this system.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Peter was
located near latitude 17.6 North, longitude 56.5 West. Peter is
moving toward the west-northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h), and this 
general motion along with a gradual decrease in forward speed is 
is expected through Tuesday. A turn to the northwest is expected 
to occur by Wednesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Peter 
is expected to pass well north of the Leeward Islands on Monday and 
Tuesday.
 
Based on data from a Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft, 
maximum sustained winds remain near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast through today. Some 
slight weakening is expected tonight into Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km), 
primarily northeast of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on the aircraft data 
is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  The outer bands south of the tropical storm could produce
rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches with locally higher amounts
possible across portions of the Northern Leeward Islands, including
the Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico late today through
Tuesday. This rainfall may lead to areas of urban and small stream
flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Tropical Storm Peter are expected to
reach the northern Leeward Islands tonight and Monday.  These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Peter Forecast Discussion Number 3</title>

Tropical Storm Peter Special Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
900 AM AST Sun Sep 19 2021
 
Satellite imagery as well as data from a Air Force Reserve Hurricane
Hunter aircraft indicate that the center of Peter is over 100 n mi
west-southwest of its forecast position. Therefore, a special
advisory for track is being issued. The forecast track has been
adjusted through the first 60 h, resulting in a slight southward
adjustment of the track through the first couple of days. The
aircraft also measured 925 mb flight-level winds of 56 kt, which
supports an initial intensity of 40 kt. No adjustments were made
to the intensity forecast. The next full advisory will be issued at
1500 UTC.
 
Based on the track, intensity, and wind radii forecast, no tropical
storm watches or warnings are required for the northern Leeward
Islands, Virgin Islands or Puerto Rico.  However, interests there
should monitor the progress of the system as locally heavy rain is
possible on Monday and Tuesday when it is expected to pass to the
north of the area.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Rainfall around the southern periphery of Tropical Storm Peter
may lead to areas of urban and small stream flooding from late
Sunday into Tuesday across Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the
Northern Leeward Islands.

SUMMARY OF 200 PM CVT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...13.2N 28.8W
ABOUT 315 MI...505 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERNMOST CABO VERDE ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 330 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1007 MB...29.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM CVT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression
Seventeen was located near latitude 13.2 North, longitude 28.8 West.
The depression is moving toward the north-northwest near 14 mph (22
km/h), and this motion is expected to continue today.  A motion 
toward the northwest is forecast to begin by tonight and continue 
through Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is expected for the next couple of days, and the
depression is likely to become a tropical storm tonight or Monday.  
By Tuesday, environmental conditions are expected to become less 
conducive for development, and the system is forecast to begin
a slow weakening trend.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Depression Seventeen Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172021
200 PM CVT Sun Sep 19 2021

The low-level center of the depression was exposed on visible 
satellite imagery this morning but recently a new burst has formed. 
Since the morning scatterometer passes missed the depression, the 
intensity is held at 30 kt based on consensus T-2.0 values from TAFB 
and SAB. 

The initial motion estimate is 330/12.  The cyclone is forecast to 
move in a general northwestward direction throughout the remainder 
of the forecast period as the system moves along the southwestern 
and western periphery of a subtropical ridge that extends westward 
from Africa across the Cabo Verde Islands.  No significant changes 
were made to the previous NHC forecast track, and the new 
prediction lies near the middle of the tightly clustered track 
models.

Environmental conditions are conducive for strengthening during the 
next day or so, with wind shear forecast to drop off later today.  
Thus, the official forecast calls for strengthening during the next 
24 hours, and is close to the lower half of the intensity guidance 
envelope, near the weaker global models.  This forecast could be 
conservative, since SSTs will be near 27C and mid-level atmospheric 
moisture will be enough to support intensification.  By 36-48 hours, 
the southwesterly shear will increase, which should end the 
opportunity for strengthening, and will likely cause slow weakening. 
The models hold onto this system through the 5 day period, but it is 
possible that the cyclone could become a remnant low in 4-5 days if 
the shear is too much for the system to handle.
