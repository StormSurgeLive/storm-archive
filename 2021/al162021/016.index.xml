Tropical Weather Outlook...Corrected<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Wed Sep 22 2021<br/>
<br/>
Corrected location of Peter relative to Puerto Rico.<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Peter, located a few hundred miles north of Puerto Rico, <br/>
and on Tropical Depression Rose, located about 1000 miles <br/>
west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands. <br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to become better organized in <br/>
association with a tropical wave located several hundred miles <br/>
southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands. Environmental conditions are <br/>
expected to remain conducive for additional development, and a <br/>
tropical depression is expected to form within a day or two while <br/>
the system moves westward at 10 to 15 mph across the eastern and <br/>
central tropical Atlantic Ocean. Additional information on this <br/>
system, including gale warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts <br/>
issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A gale-force, non-tropical low pressure system, the remnants of <br/>
Odette, is located a little less than 500 miles west-northwest of <br/>
the westernmost Azores. This low could acquire some subtropical <br/>
characteristics over marginally warm waters during the next few days <br/>
while it makes a counter-clockwise loop over the north-central <br/>
Atlantic Ocean. However, by the weekend, this system is expected to <br/>
move into an environment of strong upper-level winds.  Additional <br/>
information on this system, including gale warnings, can be found in <br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and <br/>

...PETER BARELY HANGING ON AS A TROPICAL CYCLONE...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.6N 66.9W
ABOUT 225 MI...365 KM NNW OF SAN JUAN PUERTO RICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNW OR 330 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1008 MB...29.77 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Peter
was located near latitude 21.6 North, longitude 66.9 West. The
depression is moving toward the north-northwest near 7 mph (11
km/h). A turn to the north is expected by tonight, followed by a
north-northeastward or northeastward motion through the end of the
week.  On the forecast track, the center of Peter will continue
moving away from the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual weakening is expected during the next couple of days,
and Peter is forecast to degenerate into a remnant low on Thursday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Peter are affecting the Virgin Islands,
Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola, and will continue spreading westward to
the Bahamas later today.  These swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Tropical Depression Peter Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
500 AM AST Wed Sep 22 2021
 
Peter is a disorganized tropical depression.  The low-level center 
is fully exposed and currently located a couple of hundred miles 
north of Puerto Rico.  Most of the associated thunderstorm activity 
remains displaced well east of the center due to about 30 kt of 
westerly shear.  The initial intensity is held at 30 kt based on a 
0206 UTC ASCAT-B pass that showed a swath of 25-30 kt winds about 60 
n mi north of the center. The ASCAT data also showed that the 
circulation has become quite elongated.  Since the hostile 
conditions of strong westerly shear and dry air entrainment are not 
expected to let up, a continued gradual decay of Peter is forecast.  
The system is still predicted to become a remnant low in 36 hours 
and dissipate in a few days, but both of these could occur sooner.
 
The depression is moving northwestward, with the latest initial 
motion estimated to be 310/10 kt.  The cyclone is expected to turn 
northward by tonight and then northeastward by the end of the week 
as the system moves in the flow on the east side of a deep-layer 
trough.  The NHC track forecast is a little to the east of the 
previous one and close to an average of the GFS and ECMWF models.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Rainfall around the southern periphery of Peter may lead to areas 
of urban and small stream flooding through Thursday morning across 
northern Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and portions of the Virgin 
Islands.

At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Rose
was located near latitude 23.6 North, longitude 39.2 West. The
depression is moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h) and
this general motion should continue through tonight. A turn toward
the north is expected on Thursday, followed by a northeastward
motion by Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little overall change in intensity is expected during the next
couple of days, however, Rose is forecast to degenerate into a
remnant low by Friday night or Saturday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1009 mb (29.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Tropical Depression Rose Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172021
1100 AM AST Wed Sep 22 2021

Rose is currently comprised of a swirl of low-level clouds with no 
significant convection, with an earlier burst dissipating during the 
last few hours.  Recently received scatterometer data show 25-30 kt 
winds in the northeastern quadrant, so the initial intensity is held 
at 30 kt.  The cyclone remains in an environment of northwesterly 
shear and upper-level convergence, and dry mid-level air has been 
entraining into the circulation.  Since the shear is expected to 
increase during the next 2-3 days, the cyclone is expected to 
gradually weaken during this time.  However, confidence in the 
timing of when the system will stop producing organized convection 
is still low.  The new intensity forecast calls for Rose to 
degenerate into a remnant low between 60-72 h, but it is possible 
this could happen earlier.

The initial motion is now 305/8 kt. The depression is expected to 
turn northward in 24-36 hours as it moves on the west side of a low- 
to mid-level ridge over the eastern Atlantic.  By 48-60 h,  a turn 
to the northeast is expected as Rose gets caught in the flow on the 
southeast side of a deep-layer trough over the north Atlantic.  
Based on the initial position and motion, the first 36 h of the 
forecast track are shifted a little to the west of the previous 
track.  After that time, the new forecast track is similar to the 
previous track.
