Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Sat Sep 18 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center has issued the last advisory on <br/>
Post-Tropical Cyclone Odette, located a few hundred miles <br/>
east-southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure <br/>
located about 600 miles east-southeast of the northern Leeward <br/>
Islands continue to show signs of organization.  In addition, <br/>
satellite images and surface observations indicate that the <br/>
circulation is gradually becoming better defined.  If the current <br/>
trend continues, advisories would likely be initiated on a tropical <br/>
depression or tropical storm later tonight or early Sunday. This <br/>
system is expected to be near the northern Leeward Islands on Monday <br/>
and Tuesday, and interests there should monitor its progress. <br/>
Upper-level winds are likely to become less conducive for <br/>
development when the system reaches the southwestern Atlantic by the <br/>
early to middle part of next week.  Additional information on this <br/>
system, including gale warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts <br/>
issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms are also showing signs of organization in <br/>
association with a low pressure system located over the far eastern <br/>
Atlantic a few hundred miles south-southwest of the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands.  Environmental conditions appear conducive for further <br/>
development of this system, and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form during the next day or two while moving toward the northwest at <br/>
10 to 15 mph to the west of the Cabo Verde Islands.  This system is <br/>
expected to reach cooler waters and an area of stronger upper-level <br/>
winds early next week, which should limit its development.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>

----------------------
RAINFALL:  The outer bands of the depression could produce rainfall 
totals of 1 to 3 inches across portions of the northern Leeward 
Islands, including the Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico later 
Sunday through Tuesday. This rainfall may lead to areas of urban and 
small stream flooding.

SURF:  Swells generated by the depression are expected to reach the 
northern Leeward Islands Sunday night and Monday.  These swells 
could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Depression Sixteen Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
1100 PM AST Sat Sep 18 2021
 
Satellite images and surface observations indicate that the area of 
low pressure that NHC has been monitoring to the east of the 
northern Leeward Islands now has a well-defined center and 
sufficiently organized deep convection to be classified a tropical 
depression.  The depression has a small area of deep convection near 
its center and curved bands on its north and east sides.  The 
initial intensity is estimated to be 30 kt, but this is a little 
below the latest Dvorak classifications and could be conservative.

The depression is moving west-northwestward at 12 kt.  The cyclone 
should continue west-northwestward at about the same pace during the 
next few days as it moves in the flow on the southwest side of a 
mid-level ridge.  After that time, the ridge is expected to break 
down and the steering currents are forecast to become weak.  Not 
surprisingly, the spread in the models increases around that time, 
but most of the solutions show a slow turn toward the north toward 
broad troughing associated with Post-Tropical Cyclone Odette.  The 
GFS is on the southern side of the guidance envelope and the ECMWF 
on the northern side. The NHC track forecast lies between those 
models near the consensus aids.

Some strengthening seems possible during the next 12 to 24 hours and 
the system is expected to become a tropical storm during that time 
frame.  However, an increase in southerly and then southwesterly 
vertical wind shear should cause the system to level off in strength 
from 24 hours through the end of the forecast period.  The models 
are in fairly good agreement on this overall scenario, and the NHC 
intensity forecast is in line with the majority of the guidance. 

Based on the track, intensity, and wind radii forecast, no tropical 
storm watches or warnings are required for the northern Leeward 
Islands, Virgin Islands or Puerto Rico.  However, interests there 
should monitor the progress of the system as locally heavy rain is 
possible on Monday and Tuesday when it is expected to pass to the 
north of the area.

...THIS IS THE LAST NHC ADVISORY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...39.1N 65.1W
ABOUT 295 MI...475 KM ESE OF NANTUCKET MASSACHUSETTS
ABOUT 385 MI...625 KM SSW OF HALIFAX NOVA SCOTIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 60 DEGREES AT 18 MPH...30 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Please refer to products issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre
for Odette's potential impacts to Newfoundland as a post-tropical
cyclone.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Odette
was located near latitude 39.1 North, longitude 65.1 West.  Odette 
is moving toward the east-northeast near 18 mph (30 km/h), and this 
general motion with an increase in forward speed is expected 
through Sunday.  A turn toward the east and east-southeast with a 
decrease in forward speed is expected on Monday and Tuesday.  On 
the forecast track, the center of Odette will pass well south of 
Atlantic Canada tonight through Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast during the next day or two.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Odette are affecting portions of the
United States Mid-Atlantic coast and are expected to spread
northward to portions of the U.S. Northeast and Atlantic Canada
coasts during the weekend.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Post-Tropical Cyclone Odette Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152021
500 PM AST Sat Sep 18 2021
 
Odette appears to have completed extratropical transition, perhaps 
a little earlier than the global models want to admit.  The cyclone 
has developed a frontal structure similar to that of a bent back 
occlusion, with cold-air stratocumulus clouds advecting eastward 
to the south of the center behind the trailing cold front.  In 
addition, the remaining deep convection is closer to the system's 
triple point than multiple-swirled center of circulation.  The 
initial intensity is highly uncertain since all three ASCAT 
instruments completely missed the area where the strongest winds 
were likely to have been occurring, and it is held at 40 kt based on 
continuity.

The post-tropical cyclone has turned to the east-northeast and is 
moving a little faster--now with a motion of 060/16 kt.  Additional 
acceleration is expected during the next 24 hours while Odette is 
embedded in the mid-latitude westerlies.  After 24 hours, Odette is 
expected to detach from the prevailing flow, which will cause the 
cyclone to slow down and meander southeast of Newfoundland by days 
3 through 5.  The track guidance has shifted slightly southward on 
this cycle, and the NHC forecast follows that trend and continues 
to hedge toward a consensus of the GFS and ECMWF models.

Now that Odette is extratropical, global models indicate that 
baroclinic forcing should support strengthening and expanding of 
the gale-force wind field during the next couple of days.  During 
this evolution, the strongest winds will also migrate to the 
northern and western side of the circulation.  The frontal low is 
expected to occlude in about 3 days, coincident with the beginning 
of its meandering motion, and that occlusion process should cause a 
slow weakening of the winds through the end of the forecast period. 
One caveat is that some of the models have been hinting that the 
occluded low could redevelop deep convection near the center and 
transition to a tropical or subtropical cyclone, but there has not 
been enough consistency among the guidance to explicitly make that 
forecast.  If the system's forecast track continues to shift 
southward toward warmer waters on days 3 through 5, that scenario 
could become a stronger possibility.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Odette is forecast to affect portions
of Newfoundland with strong winds and heavy rainfall Sunday and
Monday.  Please refer to products from the Canadian Hurricane
Centre for additional information on potential impacts in
Newfoundland.
 
This is the last advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center 
on Odette.  Additional information on this system can be found in 
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under 
AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at
