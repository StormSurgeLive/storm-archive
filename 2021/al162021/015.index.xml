Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Wed Sep 22 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Peter, located a couple of hundred miles north-northeast <br/>
of Puerto Rico, and on recently downgraded Tropical Depression <br/>
Rose, located about 1000 miles west-northwest of the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands. <br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms are becoming better organized in <br/>
association with a tropical wave located several hundred miles <br/>
southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands.  However, satellite wind data <br/>
indicate that the system still lacks a well-defined center. <br/>
Environmental conditions are expected to remain conducive for <br/>
additional development, and a tropical depression is likely to form <br/>
in a day or two while the system moves westward at 10 to 15 mph <br/>
across the eastern and central tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A gale-force, non-tropical low pressure system, the remnants of <br/>
Odette, is located about 500 miles west of the westernmost Azores. <br/>
This low could acquire some subtropical characteristics over <br/>
marginally warm waters during the next few days while it makes a <br/>
counter-clockwise loop over the north-central Atlantic Ocean. <br/>
However, by the weekend, this system is expected to move into an <br/>
environment of strong upper-level winds.  Additional information on <br/>
this system, including gale warnings, can be found in High Seas <br/>
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and <br/>
online at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php<br/>

...POORLY ORGANIZED PETER EXPECTED TO TURN NORTHWARD TONIGHT...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.5N 66.1W
ABOUT 215 MI...345 KM N OF SAN JUAN PUERTO RICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1008 MB...29.77 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Peter 
was located near latitude 21.5 North, longitude 66.1 West. The 
depression is moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A 
turn to the north is expected by tonight, followed by a 
north-northeastward or northeastward motion through the end of the 
week.  On the forecast track, the center of Peter will continue 
moving away from the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some gradual weakening is expected during the next couple of days,
and Peter is forecast to degenerate into a remnant low on Thursday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Rainfall around the southern periphery of Peter could 
produce additional rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches, with storm 
total accumulations up to 9 inches, across portions of the Virgin 
Islands, Puerto Rico, and northern portions of Hispaniola through 
Thursday morning. This rainfall may lead to areas of urban and small 
stream flooding.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Peter are affecting the Virgin Islands,
Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola, and will continue spreading westward to
the Bahamas later today.  These swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Tropical Depression Peter Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
500 AM AST Wed Sep 22 2021
 
Peter is a disorganized tropical depression.  The low-level center 
is fully exposed and currently located a couple of hundred miles 
north of Puerto Rico.  Most of the associated thunderstorm activity 
remains displaced well east of the center due to about 30 kt of 
westerly shear.  The initial intensity is held at 30 kt based on a 
0206 UTC ASCAT-B pass that showed a swath of 25-30 kt winds about 60 
n mi north of the center. The ASCAT data also showed that the 
circulation has become quite elongated.  Since the hostile 
conditions of strong westerly shear and dry air entrainment are not 
expected to let up, a continued gradual decay of Peter is forecast.  
The system is still predicted to become a remnant low in 36 hours 
and dissipate in a few days, but both of these could occur sooner.
 
The depression is moving northwestward, with the latest initial 
motion estimated to be 310/10 kt.  The cyclone is expected to turn 
northward by tonight and then northeastward by the end of the week 
as the system moves in the flow on the east side of a deep-layer 
trough.  The NHC track forecast is a little to the east of the 
previous one and close to an average of the GFS and ECMWF models.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Rainfall around the southern periphery of Peter may lead to areas 
of urban and small stream flooding through Thursday morning across 
northern Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and portions of the Virgin 
Islands.

--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Rose was 
located near latitude 23.4 North, longitude 38.4 West. The 
depression is moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h) and 
this general motion should continue through tonight. A turn toward 
the north is expected on Thursday, followed by a northeastward 
motion by Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little overall change in intensity is expected during the next 
couple of days, however, Rose is forecast to degenerate into a 
remnant low by Friday night.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1009 mb (29.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Tropical Depression Rose Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172021
500 AM AST Wed Sep 22 2021
 
Rose remains a strongly sheared and poorly organized tropical 
depression.  The low-level center is fully exposed and only a small 
area of thunderstorms is lingering on the system's east side. The 
initial intensity is held at 30 kt based on the latest Dvorak 
estimates. The cyclone is currently in an environment of about 20 kt 
of northwesterly shear, and dry mid-level air has been entraining 
into the circulation.  Since the shear is expected to increase 
during the next few days, little change in strength or gradual 
weakening seems likely.  Rose is forecast to become a remnant low by 
60 hours when the shear is expected to be near 30 kt, but confidence 
in the timing of when the system will lose organized convection is 
low. Some of the models show Rose opening into a trough toward the 
end of the forecast period, but there are some solutions that hold 
on to the system for a while longer.
 
The depression is moving northwestward at 7 kt.  The system is 
expected to turn northward in about 36 hours as it moves on the 
west side of a low- to mid-level ridge.  On Friday,  a turn to the 
northeast is expected as Rose gets caught in the flow on the 
southeast side of a deep-layer trough.  The models are in good 
agreement, and the new NHC track forecast is largely an update of 
the previous one.
