Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Mon Sep 13 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Nicholas, located over the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. <br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave located over the far eastern tropical Atlantic is <br/>
producing an area of disorganized cloudiness and thunderstorms. <br/>
Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive for gradual <br/>
development of this disturbance over the next several days, and a <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form by late this week while the <br/>
system moves westward at about 15 mph across the eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
An area of low pressure is forecast to form by midweek a couple of <br/>
hundred miles north of the southeastern or central Bahamas as a <br/>
tropical wave interacts with an upper-level trough.  Some gradual <br/>
development of this system is possible thereafter, and a tropical <br/>
depression could form later this week while the system moves <br/>
north-northwestward or northward across the western Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nicholas was 
located by NOAA Doppler weather radars near latitude 26.9 North, 
longitude 96.5 West. Nicholas is moving toward the north near 12 mph 
(19 km/h) and this general motion is expected to continue through 
tonight, followed by a turn toward the north-northeast on Tuesday. 
On the forecast track, the center of Nicholas will continue to pass 
just offshore of the coast of south Texas this afternoon and move 
onshore along the coast of central Texas later this evening.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft and NOAA 
Doppler weather radars indicate that maximum sustained winds remain 
near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. Strengthening is forecast 
this afternoon and evening, and Nicholas could be near hurricane 
strength when it reaches the northwest Gulf coast.  Weakening is 
anticipated on Tuesday and Wednesday while Nicholas moves over land.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.  During the past few hours, NOAA buoy 42020 
located southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas, reported a sustained 
wind of 49 mph (80 km/h) and a gust to 56 mph (91 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nicholas can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4, WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?key_messages
 
RAINFALL:  Nicholas is expected to produce storm total rainfall of
8 to 16 inches, with isolated maximum amounts of 20 inches, across
portions of the middle and upper Texas coastal areas through the
middle of the week. Life-threatening, flash and urban flooding
impacts are possible, especially across portions of the upper Texas
Gulf Coast near Lake Jackson and Freeport, TX
 
Across the rest of southeast Texas into southwest Louisiana rainfall
of 5 to 10 inches is expected. This rainfall may produce areas of
considerable flash and urban flooding, especially in highly
urbanized metropolitan areas. Additionally, there is the potential
for isolated minor to moderate river flooding.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Port O'Connor to San Luis Pass TX including Matagorda Bay...3-5 ft
San Luis Pass, TX to Rutherford Beach, LA including Galveston
Bay...2-4 ft
Baffin Bay to Port O'Connor, TX...2-4 ft
Corpus Christi Bay, Aransas Bay and San Antonio Bay...2-4 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande to Baffin Bay...1-3 ft
Rutherford Beach, LA to Intracoastal City, LA...1-3 ft
Sabine Lake and Calcasieu Lake...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas
of onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area in southern Texas through the next few hours. These conditions
will spread northward within the warning area through tonight,
making outside preparations difficult or dangerous. Hurricane
conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch area as early as this
afternoon or this evening.
 
TORNADOES:  A couple of tornadoes are possible this afternoon and
tonight across the middle and upper Texas coast.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Nicholas will continue affecting
portions of the northwest Gulf coast through Tuesday. These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Nicholas Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142021
1000 AM CDT Mon Sep 13 2021
 
Doppler radar data from Brownsville and Corpus Christi, Texas, along 
with reconnaissance aircraft flight-level wind data, indicate that 
Nicholas' inner-core structure has undergone some radical changes 
since the previous advisory. The earlier near-eyewall pattern 
dissipated a few hours ago, and has been replaced with what appears 
to be an ongoing reformation of a new center abut 90 nmi 
north-northeast of the old center. The aircraft recently found a 
pressure of 1000 to 1002 mb with the dissipating original center, 
while Doppler radar velocity data show a pronounced mid- to 
upper-level circulation forming farther north as previously 
mentioned. The Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is going 
to be concentrating its reconnoiter mission in Nicholas' 
northeastern quadrant to see if reformation of the low-level center 
is occurring beneath the mid-level circulation noted in radar data. 
The initial wind speed remains 50 kt based on recent aircraft 850-mb 
flight-level winds of 59 kt, which equates to about 47 kt equivalent 
surface winds. 
 
The initial motion is an uncertain 005/10 kt due to the erosion and 
ongoing reformation of the center. Despite the recent inner-core 
erosion, the latest NHC model guidance remains in fairly good 
agreement on Nicholas moving northward through a weakness in the 
subtropical ridge. The GFS model has been performing exceptionally 
well with predicting the recent erosion and more northward 
reformation of the Nicholas' center. The new NHC track forecast is 
similar to but slightly east or right of the previous advisory 
track, and lies along the eastern edge of the track consensus model 
envelope, which is to the left of the GFS track prediction.
 
Although the inner-core convective pattern has been disrupted, 
recent trends in the radar data suggest that a new center should 
reform farther northeast into the convective cloud shield. The 
latest GFS- and ECMWF-based SHIPS shear analyses indicate that 
westerly shear of near 20 kt is allegedly affecting Nicholas. 
However, water vapor satellite imagery suggests that the upper-level 
shear vector is actually from a south-southwesterly direction, which 
is more along than across the cyclone's forward motion, thus 
reducing the magnitude and negative effects of the vertical wind 
shear. Therefore, strengthening is still expected until landfall 
as Nicholas continues to move over slightly warmer Gulf waters. It 
is possible that Nicholas could become a hurricane just before 
landfall, and that's the reason for the northeastward extension of 
the hurricane watch area.  Nicholas should rapidly weaken after 
landfall due to increased frictional effects, strong southwesterly 
shear, and entrainment of mid-level dry air, resulting in 
degeneration into a tropical depression by late Tuesday and a 
remnant low on Wednesday.  Otherwise, no significant changes were 
made to the previous advisory intensity forecast.

Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall will impact portions of the Texas and Louisiana 
coasts through the middle of the week. Significant rainfall amounts 
are possible, potentially resulting in areas of life-threatening 
flash and urban flooding, especially in highly urbanized 
metropolitan areas. Minor to isolated moderate river flooding is 
also expected. 
 
2. There is the danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation
along the coast of Texas from Port Aransas to Sabine Pass.
Residents in these areas should follow any advice given by
local officials.
 
3. Nicholas is forecast to approach the middle Texas coast as a
strong tropical storm by this evening, and could be near hurricane
intensity at landfall.  Tropical storm conditions are expected
along portions of the middle Texas coast beginning this afternoon, 
with hurricane conditions possible from Port Aransas to San Luis 
Pass by late afternoon through tonight. 

4. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the 
coast of south Texas into the afternoon.
