<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center has issued its last advisory on <br/>
Tropical Depression Nicholas, located just west of the Texas and <br/>
Louisiana border. Future advisories on Nicholas will be issued by <br/>
the Weather Prediction Center.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a low pressure area <br/>
located a few hundred miles south of the Cabo Verde Islands continue <br/>
to show signs of organization.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
expected to remain conducive for development, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form during the next couple of days while <br/>
the system moves generally westward at about 15 mph across the <br/>
eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A trough of low pressure located a few hundred miles northeast of <br/>
the central Bahamas is producing a large area of disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions appear <br/>
marginally conducive for gradual development during the next few <br/>
days, and a tropical depression is likely to form while the system <br/>
moves north-northwestward to northward across the western Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to emerge off of the west coast of <br/>
Africa toward the end of the week. Thereafter, environmental <br/>
conditions are forecast to be conducive for development while the <br/>
system moves generally west-northwestward to northwestward over the <br/>
far eastern Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
