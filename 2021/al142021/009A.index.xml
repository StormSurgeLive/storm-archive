Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Tue Sep 14 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
downgraded Tropical Storm Nicholas, located over the upper Texas <br/>
coastal plain near Houston.<br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave accompanied by a well-defined low pressure system <br/>
is located about 400 miles southeast of the southern Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands.  Associated shower and thunderstorm activity continues to <br/>
show signs of organization, and environmental conditions are <br/>
conducive for a tropical depression to form during the next couple <br/>
of days while system moves generally westward at about 15 mph across <br/>
the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
An area of low pressure is expected to form during the next day or <br/>
two a couple of hundred miles north of the southeastern or central <br/>
Bahamas as a tropical wave interacts with an upper-level trough.  <br/>
Some gradual development of this system is forecast thereafter, and <br/>
a tropical depression could form later this week while the system <br/>
moves north-northwestward or northward across the western Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nicholas was 
located near latitude 29.3 North, longitude 95.6 West. Nicholas is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 9 mph (15 km/h).  The storm 
should move more slowly to the northeast later today and then 
eastward by Wednesday over Louisiana.  Little motion is anticipated 
on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Nicholas should weaken further today and is
forecast to become a tropical depression by Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.  A NOAA station at Galveston Bay, Texas recently
reported a 1-minute sustained wind of 54 mph (87 km/h) gusting to
68 mph (109 km/h).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nicholas can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4, WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?key_messages
 
RAINFALL:  Nicholas is expected to produce additional rainfall of 5
to 10 inches from the upper Texas coastal area into central to
southern Louisiana, far southern Mississippi and far southern
Alabama, with isolated storm totals of 20 inches across central to
southern Louisiana. Life-threatening flash flooding impacts,
especially in urbanized metropolitan areas, are possible across
these regions.
 
Widespread minor to isolated major river flooding is expected across
portions of the upper Texas Gulf Coast and southern Louisiana and
Mississippi.
 
For the latest rainfall reports and wind gusts associated with
Hurricane Nicholas see the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with
the WMO header ACUS44KWBC or at the following link
https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Sargent, TX to High Island, TX including Galveston Bay...3-5 ft
High Island, TX to Rutherford Beach, LA...2-4 ft
Port Aransas, TX to Sargent, TX...1-3 ft
Aransas Bay, San Antonio Bay, and Matagorda Bay...1-3 ft
Rutherford Beach, LA to Intracoastal City, LA...1-3 ft
Sabine Lake and Calcasieu Lake...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas
of onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue within
the warning area across Texas coasts through this morning and start
along the Louisiana coast by afternoon.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two will be possible today and tonight
along the upper Texas Coast and southern Louisiana.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Nicholas will continue affecting portions
of the northwest Gulf coast today. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 AM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Nicholas Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Tropical Storm Nicholas Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142021
400 AM CDT Tue Sep 14 2021
 
Radar and surface observations indicate that Nicholas has continued
to move slowly inland and has weakened during the past few hours,
with the strongest winds now located near southern Galveston Bay.
The initial wind speed is set to 60 kt, perhaps generously.
Additional weakening is anticipated as Nicholas moves over land,
with increasing southwesterly shear also assisting this process.
No significant changes were made to the intensity forecast.
 
The storm is moving north-northeastward at about 8 kt, and should
gradually turn northeastward and eastward during the next day or so.
Nicholas is likely to slow to a crawl over Louisiana on Wednesday
as it loses any significant steering.  The new track forecast is
similar to the previous one, but a smidge faster. While the exact
track is tough to pin down due to inconsistent model forecasts,
most guidance shows a significant flash flood risk along the
Gulf Coast during the next couple of days.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall will impact areas from the upper coast of Texas,
across Louisiana, southern Mississippi and far southern Alabama
through the middle of the week. Significant rainfall amounts are
expected, potentially resulting in areas of life-threatening flash
and urban flooding across these areas.  Minor to isolated major
river flooding is also possible in smaller river basins and urban
areas.
 
2. There is the danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation
along the coast of Texas from Sargent to Sabine Pass. Residents in
these areas should follow any advice given by local officials.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected in Tropical Storm Warning
area along the Texas coast today and along the southwestern
Louisiana coast by afternoon.
