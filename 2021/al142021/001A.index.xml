Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Sun Sep 12 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on newly formed <br/>
Tropical Storm Nicholas, located over the southwestern Gulf of <br/>
Mexico. <br/>
<br/>
Shower activity associated with a tropical wave located just <br/>
west of the westernmost Cabo Verde Islands has diminished since <br/>
this morning.  Environmental conditions have become unfavorable,  <br/>
and significant development of this system is no longer expected. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity remains limited in association  <br/>
with a non-tropical area of low pressure located over the far <br/>
northeastern Atlantic a few hundred miles east-northeast of the <br/>
Azores. This system is forecast to move south-southeastward towards <br/>
warmer waters, which could allow the low to gradually acquire some <br/>
tropical or subtropical characteristics during the next day or so.  <br/>
After that time, the system is forecast to move inland over <br/>
Portugal ending any further development chance. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Another tropical wave is forecast to move off the west coast of <br/>
Africa on Monday. Gradual development of this system is possible <br/>
thereafter, and a tropical depression could form by the middle of <br/>
the week while it moves westward across the eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
An area of low pressure is expected to form north of the <br/>
southeastern or central Bahamas in a few days resulting from a <br/>
tropical wave interacting with an upper-level trough.  Gradual <br/>
development of this system is possible, and a tropical depression <br/>
could form later this week several hundred miles southeast of the <br/>
Carolinas while it moves northwestward across the western Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nicholas
was near latitude 21.7 North, longitude 95.5 West. Nicholas is 
moving toward the north-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h).  Satellite 
and reconnaissance aircraft data suggest that the center may be 
re-forming farther north. As a result, some erratic motion is 
possible this afternoon, but a general north-northwestward motion 
near 15 mph (24 km/h) should resume later today.  This motion 
should then continue  through tonight. A slower northward or 
north-northeastward motion is forecast by late Monday or Monday 
night. On the forecast track, the center of Nicholas will pass near 
or just offshore the coasts of northeastern Mexico and South Texas 
late Monday, and approach the south or central Texas coast Monday 
night or early Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Gradual strengthening is forecast while Nicholas approaches the 
northwestern Gulf coast during the next day or so.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nicholas can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4, WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?key_messages
 
RAINFALL:  Nicholas is expected to produce storm total rainfall of
5 to 10 inches, with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches, across
portions of coastal Texas into southwest Louisiana today through the
middle of the week. This rainfall may produce areas of flash, urban,
and isolated river flooding.
 
Over the eastern portions of the Mexican state of Tamaulipas
rainfall amounts of 2 to 5 inches can be expected today into Monday.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide
will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Mouth of the Rio Grande to High Island, TX...2-4 ft
Baffin Bay, Corpus Christi Bay, Aransas Bay, San Antonio Bay,
Matagorda Bay, and Galveston Bay...2-4
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas
of onshore flow, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area in northeastern Mexico and southern
Texas by Monday afternoon, making outside preparations difficult or
dangerous. Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area by late Monday night or early Tuesday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Tropical Storm Nicholas Forecast Discussion Number 1</title>

Tropical Storm Nicholas Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142021
1000 AM CDT Sun Sep 12 2021
 
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a broad area of low 
pressure over the southern Bay of Campeche have increased overnight 
and very recently become better organized with a loose band of 
convection around the northeastern portion of the circulation. An 
Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft that has been 
investigating the system has found 44-kt flight-level winds and 
SFMR winds that support a 35-kt initial intensity.  Based on the 
recent increase in organization and the 35-kt initial intensity, 
advisories are being initiated on Tropical Storm Nicholas, the 
fourteenth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. 

The storm is located within an environment of moderate 
south-southwesterly vertical wind shear, over warm waters, and in a 
moist and unstable atmosphere. These conditions should allow gradual 
strengthening over the next 24 to 48 hours.  The NHC intensity 
forecast follows suit and calls for gradual strengthening until 
the system reaches the coast of Texas.  The official wind speed 
forecast is near the higher end of the guidance in best agreement 
with the SHIPS statistical guidance, the HFIP corrected consensus, 
and the HWRF.  In this case, the intensity forecast is highly 
dependent on eventual track of the system.  A track to the east of 
the NHC forecast could result in a lower wind shear environment 
and slightly more time over water for the system to strengthen.  
Conversely a track to the west of the forecast track would result 
in the system interacting with land much sooner. 

Since the system is still in its formative stage the initial motion 
estimate is a somewhat uncertain 330/11 kt.  A north-northwestward 
motion around the western portion of a mid-level ridge that is 
sliding east near the coast of the Carolinas, should continue to 
steer Nicholas in that direction for the next 24 to 48 hours.  
After that time, steering currents weaken and the cyclone is 
expected to move slowly north-northeastward between a couple of 
mid-level ridges located to the east and west of Nicholas.  The 
track guidance generally agrees with this overall scenario but 
there is some cross-track spread with the UKMET along the left side 
of the guidance envelope taking the storm into northeastern Mexico, 
while the GFS, HWRF, and HMON are along the right side.  The NHC 
track is near the various consensus models and both the EC and GFS 
ensemble means.

Key Messages:

1. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the 
northeastern coast of Mexico and the coast of south Texas 
beginning on Monday.  Nicholas is forecast to approach the middle 
Texas coast as a strong tropical storm on Tuesday, and tropical 
storm conditions are possible along portions of the middle and upper 
Texas coasts late Monday night and Tuesday. 

2. There is the possibility of life-threatening storm surge along 
the coast of Texas from the Mouth of the Rio Grande to High Island. 
Residents in these areas should follow any advice given by local 
officials. 

3.  Periods of heavy rainfall are expected to impact portions of the 
Texas and Louisiana coasts today through the middle of the week. 
Significant rainfall amounts are possible, potentially resulting in 
areas of flash, urban, and isolated river flooding.
