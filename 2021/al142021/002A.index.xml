Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Sun Sep 12 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Nicholas, located over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. <br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to emerge off the west coast of Africa <br/>
on Monday.  Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive <br/>
for some gradual development of this system thereafter, and a <br/>
tropical depression could form later this week while it moves <br/>
westward at 10 to 15 mph across the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms are very limited in association with a <br/>
non-tropical area of low pressure over the far northeastern <br/>
Atlantic, located a few hundred miles east of the Azores.  <br/>
Significant development of this system appears unlikely during the <br/>
next day or so while it moves slowly eastward.  By late Tuesday, the <br/>
system is forecast to move inland over Portugal.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>
<br/>
An area of low pressure is forecast to form by midweek a couple of <br/>
hundred miles north of the southeastern or central Bahamas as a <br/>
tropical wave interacts with an upper-level trough.  Some gradual <br/>
development of this system is possible thereafter, and a tropical <br/>
depression could form later this week while the system moves <br/>
north-northwestward or northward across the western Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nicholas was
located near latitude 22.5 North, longitude 95.5 West.  Nicholas 
has been meandering or drifting northward near 2 mph (4 km/h) over 
the past couple of hours, but a north-northwestward motion near 12 
mph (19 km/h) is expected to resume later tonight and early monday.  
A northward or north-northeastward motion is forecast by late 
Monday or Monday night.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Nicholas will pass near or just offshore the coasts of northeastern 
Mexico and South Texas on Monday, and move onshore along the coast 
of south or central Texas coast Monday night or early Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast until Nicholas reaches the
northwest Gulf coast Monday night or early Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nicholas can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4, WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?key_messages
 
RAINFALL:  Nicholas is expected to produce storm total rainfall of
8 to 16 inches, with isolated maximum amounts of 20 inches, across
portions of the middle and upper Texas coastal areas tonight through
the middle of the week. Across the rest of coastal Texas into
southwest Louisiana rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is expected. This
rainfall may produce areas of considerable flash and urban flooding,
especially in highly urbanized metropolitan areas. Additionally,
there is the potential for isolated minor to moderate river
flooding.
 
Over the northeastern portions of the Mexican state of Tamaulipas
rainfall amounts of 2 to 5 inches can be expected tonight into 
Monday.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide
will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Port O'Connor to San Luis Pass TX including Matagorda Bay...3-5 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande to Port O'Connor, TX...2-4 ft
San Luis Pass to High Island, TX including Galveston Bay...2-4 ft
Baffin Bay, Corpus Christi Bay, Aransas Bay and San Antonio
Bay...2-4 ft
High Island, TX to Intracoastal City including Sabine Lake and
Calcasieu Lake..1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas
of onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area in northeastern Mexico and southern
Texas Monday morning, making outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.  These conditions will spread northward within the
warning area through Monday night.  Hurricane conditions are
possible in the Hurricane Watch area Monday night.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible within the watch area by late Monday night
or early Tuesday.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two will be possible Monday into Monday
night across the middle and lower Texas coast.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Nicholas will begin affecting portions 
of the northwest Gulf coast tonight and continue into Tuesday.  
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local 
weather office.

Tropical Storm Nicholas Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142021
400 PM CDT Sun Sep 12 2021
 
Visible satellite imagery, scatterometer wind data, and earlier
reconnaissance aircraft observations indicate that the circulation
of Nicholas is elongated from northwest to southeast.  In fact,
visible satellite imagery and the aircraft data has shown that
there have been several low-level swirls rotating about a mean
center.  This is not surprising since the tropical cyclone is
still in its formative stage.  The Air Force plane did not find
winds any stronger than they did this morning and the ASCAT data
revealed peaks winds of around 30 kt. Given the typical
undersampling of the scatterometer instrument, the earlier aircraft
data, and peak one-minute wind observations of 31 kt from NOAA buoy
42055 earlier today, the intensity remains 35 kt for this advisory.
 
Nicholas will be moving over the warm waters of the western Gulf of 
Mexico during the next day or so, and this combined with a moist, 
unstable atmosphere favors strengthening.  The primarily inhibiting 
factor appears to be moderate south-southwesterly vertical wind 
shear caused by an upper-level trough over northern Mexico. The 
trough is forecast to move westward and weaken during the next day 
or so, which could allow for a more favorable upper-level wind 
pattern later tonight and Monday.  The NHC intensity forecast again 
calls for strengthening while the system moves toward the northwest 
Gulf coast, but the main uncertainty regarding the intensity 
forecast is how much time the cyclone will spend over the Gulf 
waters.   The GFS and HWRF models, which depict a track farther 
east, show significantly more strengthening than the UKMET and ECMWF 
models which show a weaker tropical cyclone moving inland over 
northeastern Mexico or southern Texas much sooner. The NHC intensity 
forecast is similar to the previous advisory, but indicates a faster 
rate of strengthening during the next 12-24 hours.  Although not 
explicitly shown in the intensity forecast, Nicholas could approach 
hurricane strength when it nears the northwest Gulf coast, 
especially if it moves to the right of the NHC forecast track and 
spends more time over water. Due to this uncertainty a Hurricane 
Watch has been issued a for a portion of the Texas coast. The NHC 
forecast is in best agreement with the SHIPS and HFIP corrected 
consensus model, but is not as high as the latest HWRF.

The center of Nicholas appears to have re-formed farther north since 
this morning and the initial motion estimate is again a somewhat 
uncertain 340/12 kt. The track forecast reasoning has not changed 
from this morning.  Nicholas should move north-northwestward to 
northward during the next day or so around the western portion of a 
mid-level ridge that is located near the southeast U.S. coast.  The 
latest runs of the various dynamical models have shown typical 
variability, but the overall guidance envelope has not changed too 
much through the first 36 hours.  The GFS has been the most 
consistent model and its 12Z run was fairly close to the previous 
NHC track forecast.  Therefore, the NHC track leans along the right 
side of the guidance envelope between the HWRF and GFS, which 
are a little to the right of the consensus aids. Due to the acute 
angle of approach of Nicholas to the coast, users are reminded to 
not focus on the exact forecast track as small changes in the 
heading of the cyclone could result in differences in both the 
location and timing of landfall.  Regardless of where Nicholas makes 
landfall, storm surge, wind, and rainfall impacts are likely over a 
large portion of northeastern Mexico and Texas coastal areas.  
After landfall, a slower north-northeastward motion is forecast, and 
by 72 hours the cyclone is forecast to be located between a couple 
of mid-level ridges, which will likely result in weaker 
steering currents and an even slower northeastward motion.  By day 
5, the global model guidance suggest that the low-level circulation 
will become an open trough so dissipation is indicated at that time.
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Periods of heavy rainfall are expected to impact portions of the 
Texas and Louisiana coasts today through the middle of the week. 
Significant rainfall amounts are possible, potentially resulting in 
areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, especially in highly 
urbanized metropolitan areas. Isolated minor to moderate river 
flooding is also expected. 

2. There is the danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation 
along the coast of Texas from Port Aransas to San Luis Pass. 
Residents in these areas should follow any advice given by 
local officials. 

3. Nicholas is forecast to approach the middle Texas coast as a 
strong tropical storm late Monday and early Tuesday, and could be 
near hurricane intensity if it moves to the right of the forecast 
track and remains over water longer. Tropical storm conditions are 
expected along portions of the middle Texas coast beginning Monday 
afternoon, with hurricane conditions possible from Port Aransas to 
Sargent late Monday and Monday night. 

4. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the 
northeastern coast of Mexico and the coast of south Texas beginning 
Monday morning.
