<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Nicholas, located over the upper Texas coastal plain near <br/>
Houston.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a low pressure area <br/>
located a few hundred miles south-southeast of the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands continues to show signs of organization. Environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to remain conducive for development, and a  <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form during the next couple of <br/>
days while system moves generally westward at about 15 mph across <br/>
the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A trough of low pressure located a couple of hundred miles <br/>
northeast of the southeastern Bahamas is producing a large area <br/>
of disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental <br/>
conditions are forecast to be conducive for gradual development <br/>
during the next few days, and a tropical depression could form <br/>
while the system moves north-northwestward to northward across the <br/>
western Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

The Tropical Storm Warning has been discontinued for the coasts of 
Texas and Louisiana.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression 
Nicholas was located by Doppler radars, satellites, and surface 
observations near latitude 29.9 North, longitude 94.4 West. 
Nicholas is moving toward the east-northeast near 6 mph (9 km/h) 
and this general motion should continue through tonight.  An 
eastward turn is expected over Louisiana on Wednesday.  Little 
motion is anticipated on Thursday.
 
NOAA Doppler weather radar and surface observations indicate that
maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Continued gradual weakening is expected during 
the next couple of days, and Nicholas is forecast to degenerate into 
a remnant low on Wednesday or by early Thursday.  
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches)
based on nearby surface observations.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nicholas can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4, WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?key_messages
 
RAINFALL:  Nicholas is expected to produce additional rainfall
amounts of 5 to 10 inches across portions of southern and central
Louisiana, southern Mississippi, far southern Alabama, and the
western Florida Panhandle through early Friday, with isolated storm
totals of 20 inches possible from southern Louisiana to the far
western Florida Panhandle. Life-threatening flash flooding impacts,
especially in urban areas, are possible across these regions.
 
Widespread minor to isolated moderate river flooding is expected
across portions of the upper Texas Gulf Coast and southern Louisiana
and Mississippi.
 
For the latest rainfall reports and wind gusts associated with
Tropical Depression Nicholas see the companion storm summary at 
WBCSCCNS4 with the WMO header ACUS44KWBC or at the following link
https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge levels will gradually subside into this 
evening.  For information specific to your area, please see 
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast 
office.
 
WIND:  Wind gusts to tropical-storm force are possible this evening 
along the Louisiana and upper Texas coasts.  These conditions 
should diminish tonight.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two will be possible through tonight 
across southern Louisiana.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Nicholas will continue affecting portions
of the northwest Gulf coast this evening and gradually subside
tonight. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and 
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Nicholas Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142021
400 PM CDT Tue Sep 14 2021
 
Doppler weather radar data from Houston and Lake Charles, along with 
surface observations, indicate that the intensity of Nicholas has 
remained steady over the past several hours despite having moved a 
little farther inland over the upper Texas coastal plain. Both 
satellite and radar data also indicate that the overall circulation 
has tightened up somewhat, although a large swath of stable low 
clouds have advected into most of the southern semicircle of 
Nicholas' circulation. The highest sustained wind speeds of 34-36 
kt have occurred in a narrow band of fragmented, shallow convection 
between Sabine Pass, Texas, and Cameron, Louisiana, during the past 
couple of hours. Doppler radar velocity data from Lake Charles has 
also indicated wind speeds of 40-45 at 3,000 ft altitude just 
offshore the southwestern coast of Louisiana. Based on these wind 
data, the initial intensity is set at 35 kt. The estimated central 
pressure of 1003 mb is based on nearby surface observations, 
especially the reports from the Eagle Point, Texas, C-MAN station, 
which indicate that the center of Nicholas passed over or near that 
station between 1800-1900 UTC. As Nicholas moves farther inland, 
gradual weakening is forecast due to land interaction, entrainment 
of drier and more stable low- and mid-level air, and strong  
westerly vertical wind shear in excess of 30 kt. Nicholas is 
forecast to become a tropical depression later this evening and 
degenerate into a remnant low by late Wednesday or early Thursday.
 
The initial motion estimate is east-northeastward or 070 degrees at 
5 kt. Nicholas is forecast by most of the global and regional models 
continue its east-east-northeastward motion through tonight, 
followed by an eastward motion at a slower forward speed on 
Wednesday and Thursday. Nicholas could still stall over southwestern 
or central Louisiana as the low-level steering flow collapses on 
Thursday.  The new NHC track forecast is similar to the previous 
advisory track, and lies near the consensus track models TCVA and 
NOAA-HCCA.
 
Although the winds associated with Nicholas will gradually subside,
heavy rainfall and a significant flash flood risk will continue
along the Gulf Coast for the next couple of days.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall will impact areas across southern and central 
Louisiana, southern Mississippi, far southern Alabama, and the 
western Florida Panhandle through early Friday. Significant rainfall 
amounts are expected, potentially resulting in areas of 
life-threatening flash and urban flooding across these areas.  
Widespread minor to isolated moderate river flooding is also 
possible. 
 
2. Storm surge inundation along the coasts of upper Texas and 
southwestern Louisiana will gradually diminish into tonight.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions in the warning area long portions of 
the upper Texas and southwestern Louisiana coasts will gradually 
subside by this evening.
