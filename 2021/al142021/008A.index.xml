Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Mon Sep 13 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Nicholas, located near the central Texas coast. <br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave located over the far eastern tropical Atlantic is <br/>
producing an area of disorganized cloudiness and thunderstorms. <br/>
Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive for gradual <br/>
development of this disturbance over the next several days, and a <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form by later this week while the <br/>
system moves westward at about 15 mph across the eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
An area of low pressure is expected to form by midweek a couple of <br/>
hundred miles north of the southeastern or central Bahamas as a <br/>
tropical wave interacts with an upper-level trough.  Some gradual <br/>
development of this system is possible thereafter, and a tropical <br/>
depression could form later this week while the system moves <br/>
north-northwestward or northward across the western Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
Hurricane Nicholas made landfall near 1230 AM CDT (0530 UTC) on 
eastern part of the Matagorda Peninsula, about 10 miles (15 km) 
west-southwest of Sargent Beach, Texas.

At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Nicholas was
located near latitude 28.8 North, longitude 95.7 West. Nicholas is
moving toward the north-northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h) and this
general motion is expected to continue through tonight, followed by
a turn toward the northeast and a slower motion by late today and
an even slower eastward motion on Wednesday.  On the forecast track,
the center of Nicholas is expected to move slowly over 
southeastern Texas today and tonight, and over southwestern 
Louisiana on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts. Weakening is expected during the next couple of days as 
Nicholas moves over land.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115
miles (185 km). A station at San Luis Pass, Texas recently
reported a 1-minute sustained wind of 56 mph (91 km/h) gusting to
67 mph (107 km/h).
 
The latest minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.26 inches) based 
on reconnaissance dropsonde data.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nicholas can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4, WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?key_messages
 
RAINFALL:  Nicholas is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 6
to 12 inches, with isolated maximum amounts of 18 inches, across the
upper Texas coastal areas into Wednesday. Life-threatening flash
flooding impacts, especially in urbanized metropolitan areas, are
possible across portions of the upper Texas Gulf Coast into far
southwestern Louisiana.
 
Across interior southeast Texas into southern-central Louisiana and
southern Mississippi, rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches with locally
higher amounts near 10 inches are expected into Thursday.  This
rainfall may produce areas of considerable flash and urban
flooding.
 
The potential for minor to isolated major river flooding exists
across the entire region especially in smaller river basins and
urban areas.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Port O'Connor, TX to High Island, TX...3-5 ft
Matagorda Bay and Galveston Bay...3-5 ft
High Island, TX to Rutherford Beach, LA...2-4 ft
Baffin Bay, TX to Port O'Connor, TX...1-3 ft
Aransas Bay and San Antonio Bay...1-3 ft
Rutherford Beach, LA to Intracoastal City, LA...1-3 ft
Sabine Lake and Calcasieu Lake...1-3 ft
Corpus Christi Bay...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas
of onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area across the central and upper Texas coasts through this morning.
Hurricane conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch area for
the next few hours. Hurricane conditions are expected in the
warning area for the next few hours.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two will be possible today along the upper 
Texas and southwest Louisiana coast.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Nicholas will continue affecting portions
of the northwest Gulf coast today. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

<title>Hurricane Nicholas Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>
<description>Issued at 1000 PM CDT Mon Sep 13 2021  <![CDATA[<pre>

WTNT44 KNHC 140305
TCDAT4
 
Hurricane Nicholas Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142021
1000 PM CDT Mon Sep 13 2021
 
Very recently, a WeatherFlow Station at Matagorda Bay, Texas, 
reported sustained winds of 66 kt with a gust to 83 kt.  Based on 
this observation, Nicholas is being upgraded to a hurricane on this 
advisory, and a Hurricane Warning is issued.  No additional 
strengthening is anticipated until the system makes landfall, and 
gradual weakening is expected during the next 2-3 days while 
Nicholas moves over southeastern Texas and southwestern Louisiana.
 
Nicholas is moving north-northeastward, or around 020/10 kt.  The
system is currently moving through a weakness in the mid-level
subtropical ridge.  Within 12 to 24 hours, after Nicholas has moved
inland, the ridge is forecast to weaken and leave Nicholas in an
area of light steering currents.  As a result, during the next
couple of days, the cyclone is expected to turn eastward and slow to
a crawl near southwestern Louisiana.  The official forecast is
slower than the previous one, but not as slow as the new model
consensus.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall will impact portions of southeastern Texas,
Louisiana, and southern Mississippi through the middle of the week.
Significant rainfall amounts are expected, potentially resulting in
areas of life-threatening flash and urban flooding, along the
eastern Texas coast into southwestern Louisiana.  Minor to isolated
major river flooding is also possible in smaller river basins and
urban areas.
 
2. There is the danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation
along the coast of Texas from Port Aransas to Sabine Pass.
Residents in these areas should follow any advice given by
local officials.
 
3. Hurricane conditions are expected within the Hurricane 
Warning area and Tropical storm conditions are expected with 
the Tropical Storm Warning area along the Texas coast.
