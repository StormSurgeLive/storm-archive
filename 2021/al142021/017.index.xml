Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Thu Sep 16 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The Weather Prediction Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Nicholas, located inland over southwestern Louisiana. <br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms have changed little in organization in <br/>
association with an area of low pressure located more than 500 miles <br/>
west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands. In addition, earlier <br/>
satellite derived winds indicated the system also lacks a <br/>
well-defined center. However, environmental conditions are still <br/>
expected to remain conducive for development, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form during the next couple of days.  This <br/>
system is expected to move westward to west-northwestward across the <br/>
tropical Atlantic during the next several days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Shower activity remains poorly organized in association with a broad <br/>
low pressure system located several hundred miles to the <br/>
south-southeast of the Outer Banks of North Carolina.  Environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to become more conducive for development, <br/>
and a tropical depression is still likely to form during the next <br/>
day or two while the system moves north-northwestward to northward <br/>
off the southeast U.S. coast.  Regardless of development, this <br/>
system could bring high surf to portions of the southeast and <br/>
mid-Atlantic U.S. coasts later this week. Additional information on <br/>
this system, including gale warnings, can be found in High Seas <br/>
Forecasts issued by the NOAA Ocean Prediction Center.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave located just inland over Africa is expected to <br/>
emerge off the west coast of Africa in the next day or so. <br/>
Thereafter, environmental conditions are forecast to be somewhat <br/>
conducive for additional development while the system moves <br/>
west-northwestward to northwestward over the far eastern Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
