<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Nicholas, located over the upper Texas coastal plain near <br/>
Houston.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a low pressure area <br/>
located a few hundred miles south-southeast of the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands continues to show signs of organization. Environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to remain conducive for development, and a  <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form during the next couple of <br/>
days while system moves generally westward at about 15 mph across <br/>
the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A trough of low pressure located a couple of hundred miles <br/>
northeast of the southeastern Bahamas is producing a large area <br/>
of disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental <br/>
conditions are forecast to be conducive for gradual development <br/>
during the next few days, and a tropical depression could form <br/>
while the system moves north-northwestward to northward across the <br/>
western Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nicholas was
located near latitude 29.4 North, longitude 95.0 West. Nicholas is
moving toward the east-northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h) and this 
general motion should continue through tonight.  An eastward turn 
is expected over Louisiana by Wednesday.  Little motion is 
anticipated on Thursday.
 
NOAA Doppler weather radar and surface observations indicate that
maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with
higher gusts. Additional weakening is forecast during the next
couple of days, and the storm is forecast to become a tropical 
depression by tonight.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km),
mainly over water to the southeast of the center. A TCOON observing
station at Texas Point, Sabine Pass, Texas, recently measured a
1-minute sustained wind of 40 mph (65 km/h) and a gust to 53 mph 
(85 km/h) while a NOAA Ocean Service observing station at Calcasieu 
Pass, Louisiana, recently reported a 1-minute sustained wind of 
39 mph (63 km/h) and a gust to 47 mph (76 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches)
based on nearby surface observations.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nicholas can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4, WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?key_messages
 
RAINFALL:  Nicholas is expected to produce additional rainfall of
5 to 10 inches from the upper Texas coastal area into central to
southern Louisiana, far southern Mississippi, far southern Alabama
and the western Florida Panhandle through Thursday, with isolated
storm totals of 20 inches across southern Louisiana.
Life-threatening flash flooding impacts, especially in urbanized
metropolitan areas, are possible across these regions.
 
Widespread minor to isolated major river flooding is expected across
portions of the upper Texas Gulf Coast and southern Louisiana and
Mississippi.
 
For the latest rainfall reports and wind gusts associated with
Hurricane Nicholas see the companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4
with the WMO header ACUS44KWBC or at the following link
https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
High Island, TX to Cameron, LA...2-4 ft
San Luis Pass to High Island, TX...1-3 ft
Galveston Bay...1-3 ft
Cameron, LA to Intracoastal City, LA...1-3 ft
Sabine Lake and Calcasieu Lake...1-3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas
of onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue along the
Louisiana coast into this afternoon. Tropical storm conditions
in the warning area across the upper Texas coast will diminish this
afternoon as Nicholas moves farther to the east.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two will be possible today into tonight
across southern Louisiana.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Nicholas will continue affecting portions
of the northwest Gulf coast today. These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Nicholas Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142021
1000 AM CDT Tue Sep 14 2021
 
Doppler weather radar data from Houston and Lake Charles, along with 
surface observations, indicate that Nicholas has continued to weaken 
while moving farther inland. The strongest winds recently reported 
near the Texas and Louisiana coasts have been 33-35 kt at a TCOON 
observing station near Sabine Pass, Texas. The strongest winds over 
water south of southwestern Louisiana are based on Doppler radar 
average velocities of 45-50 kt between 5000-7500 ft. Based on these 
wind data, the initial intensity has been lowered to 40 kt. The 
estimated central pressure of 1002 mb is based on nearby surface 
observations in the Houston metropolitan area. Further weakening is 
expected as Nicholas moves farther inland due to frictional 
effects, entrainment of very dry mid-level air from the southern 
Plains, and increasing southwesterly to westerly shear. The latter 
condition is expected to cause the low- and upper-level circulation 
to decouple in about 24 hours, which will hasten the weakening 
process. No significant changes were made to the previous intensity 
forecast, and Nicholas is now expected to become a tropical 
depression by tonight and degenerate into a remnant low by 
late Wednesday.
 
Nicholas is now moving northeastward or 050 degrees at a slower 
forward speed of 5 kt. The cyclone should gradually turn toward the 
east-northeast by tonight, and move eastward more slowly on 
Wednesday and Thursday. It is possible that Nicholas could stall 
over southwestern or central Louisiana as the low-level steering 
flow collapses.  The new NHC track forecast is similar to but 
slightly slower than the previous advisory tack. 

Although the winds associated with Nicholas will be weakening,
heavy rainfall and a significant flash flood risk will continue 
along the Gulf Coast during the next couple of days.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall will impact areas from the upper coast of Texas,
across Louisiana, southern Mississippi, far southern Alabama and the
western Florida Panhandle through Thursday. Significant rainfall
amounts are expected, potentially resulting in areas of
life-threatening flash and urban flooding across these areas.  Minor
to isolated major river flooding is also possible in smaller river
basins and urban areas.
 
2. There is the danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation
along the coast of Texas from Port Bolivar to Sabine Pass. 
Residents in these areas should follow any advice given by local 
officials.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue along the 
Louisiana coast into this afternoon. Tropical storm conditions 
in the warning area across the upper Texas coast will diminish this 
afternoon as Nicholas moves farther to the northeast.
