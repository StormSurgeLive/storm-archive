Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Mon Sep 13 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Nicholas, located over the western Gulf of Mexico. <br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to emerge off the west coast of Africa <br/>
later today.  Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive <br/>
for gradual development of this system thereafter, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form by late this week while it moves <br/>
westward at 10 to 15 mph across the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
An area of low pressure is forecast to form by midweek a couple of <br/>
hundred miles north of the southeastern or central Bahamas as a <br/>
tropical wave interacts with an upper-level trough.  Some gradual <br/>
development of this system is possible thereafter, and a tropical <br/>
depression could form later this week while the system moves <br/>
north-northwestward or northward across the western Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms remain very limited in association with a <br/>
non-tropical area of low pressure over the far northeastern <br/>
Atlantic, about midway between the Azores and Portugal.  Tropical or <br/>
subtropical development of this system is no longer expected while <br/>
it moves eastward and then inland over Portugal by late Tuesday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
<br/>

during the next 36 hours in the indicated locations. For a
depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nicholas was
located near latitude 25.1 North, longitude 96.5 West. Nicholas is
moving toward the north-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h).  The storm
should turn northward later today and north-northeastward on 
Tuesday. On the forecast track, the center of Nicholas will pass 
near or just offshore the coasts of northeastern Mexico and south 
Texas this morning, and move onshore along the coast of south or 
central Texas Monday afternoon or evening.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Further strengthening is forecast until Nicholas
reaches the northwest Gulf coast later today.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The minimum central pressure has fallen to 1001 mb (29.56 inches) 
based on reconnaissance data.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nicholas can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4, WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?key_messages
 
RAINFALL:  Nicholas is expected to produce storm total rainfall of
8 to 16 inches, with isolated maximum amounts of 20 inches, across
portions of the middle and upper Texas coastal areas through the 
middle of the week.  Across the rest of coastal Texas into 
southwest Louisiana rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is expected.  This
rainfall may produce areas of considerable flash and urban flooding,
especially in highly urbanized metropolitan areas.  Additionally,
there is the potential for isolated minor to moderate river
flooding.
 
Over the northeastern portions of the Mexican state of Tamaulipas,
rainfall amounts of 2 to 5 inches can be expected through today.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide
will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Port O'Connor to San Luis Pass TX including Matagorda Bay... 3-5 ft
San Luis Pass, TX to Rutherford Beach, LA including Galveston
Bay...2-4 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande to Port O'Connor, TX...2-4 ft
Baffin Bay, Corpus Christi Bay, Aransas Bay and San Antonio
Bay...2-4 ft
Rutherford Beach, LA to Intracoastal City, LA...1-3 ft
Sabine Lake and Calcasieu Lake...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas
of onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area in northeastern Mexico and southern
Texas this morning, making outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.  These conditions will spread northward within the
warning area through tonight.  Hurricane conditions are possible in 
the Hurricane Watch area as early as this afternoon.  Tropical storm 
conditions are possible within the watch area by tonight or early 
Tuesday.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two will be possible today into tonight 
across the middle and lower Texas coast.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Nicholas will continue affecting 
portions of the northwest Gulf coast through Tuesday. These swells 
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current 
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Nicholas Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>
<description>Issued at 1130 PM CDT Sun Sep 12 2021  <![CDATA[<pre>

TCDAT4
 
Tropical Storm Nicholas Special Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142021
1130 PM CDT Sun Sep 12 2021

The center of Nicholas has re-formed about 150 n mi to the 
north-northwest of the previous feature we were tracking, as 
confirmed by aircraft reconnaissance and Brownsville radar, and 
this large change necessitates a special advisory. The initial wind 
speed is set to 45 kt, a blend of the reduced 56-kt flight level 
winds and 45-50 kt SFMR values recently found by the plane.  

Because of the re-formation, the track forecast has been accelerated 
to indicate a landfall about 12 hours sooner than the last advisory. 
The intensity forecast is about 5 kt stronger in the short term, 
but actually ends up near the same intensity at landfall as the 
last advisory because of less time over water.  The track forecast 
is blended with the previous one after landfall, and the intensity 
forecast is lower after landfall because it is farther inland.

No changes to the watches or warnings are required at this time.

 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Periods of heavy rainfall are expected to impact portions of the
Texas and Louisiana coasts through the middle of the week.
Significant rainfall amounts are possible, potentially resulting in
areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, especially in highly
urbanized metropolitan areas. Isolated minor to moderate river
flooding is also expected.
 
2. There is the danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation
along the coast of Texas from Port Aransas to San Luis Pass.
Residents in these areas should follow any advice given by
local officials.
 
3. Nicholas is forecast to approach the middle Texas coast as a
strong tropical storm on Monday, and could be near hurricane 
intensity if it moves to the right of the forecast track and 
remains over water longer. Tropical storm conditions are
expected along portions of the middle Texas coast beginning Monday, 
with hurricane conditions possible from Port Aransas to
Freeport late Monday and Monday night.
 
4. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
northeastern coast of Mexico and the coast of south Texas beginning
Monday morning.
