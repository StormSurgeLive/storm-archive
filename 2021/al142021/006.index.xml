NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Mon Sep 13 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Nicholas, located over the western Gulf of Mexico. <br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave has emerged off the west coast of Africa near <br/>
the coasts of Guinea and Sierra Leone.  Environmental conditions <br/>
are forecast to be conducive for gradual development of this<br/>
disturbance, and a tropical depression is likely to form by late <br/>
this week while the system moves westward at 10 to 15 mph across <br/>
the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
An area of low pressure is forecast to form by midweek a couple of <br/>
hundred miles north of the southeastern or central Bahamas as a <br/>
tropical wave interacts with an upper-level trough.  Some gradual <br/>
development of this system is possible thereafter, and a tropical <br/>
depression could form later this week while the system moves <br/>
north-northwestward or northward across the western Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>

forecast office. For storm information specific to your area
outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by
your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nicholas was
located near latitude 25.4 North, longitude 96.9 West. Nicholas has
been drifting toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h). The 
storm should move northward later today at a faster forward speed, 
and turn north-northeastward on Tuesday. On the forecast track, the 
center of Nicholas will pass near or just offshore the coasts of 
northeastern Mexico and south Texas this morning, and move onshore 
along the coast of south or central Texas late this afternoon or 
evening.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Strengthening is forecast today, and Nicholas could reach the
northwest Gulf coast as a hurricane.  Weakening is anticipated on
Tuesday and Wednesday while Nicholas moves over land.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center. A Weatherflow station on South Padre Island, 
Texas, recently reported a wind gust to 45 mph (72 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nicholas can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4, WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?key_messages
 
RAINFALL:  Nicholas is expected to produce storm total rainfall of
8 to 16 inches, with isolated maximum amounts of 20 inches, across
portions of the middle and upper Texas coastal areas through the
middle of the week. Across the rest of coastal Texas into southwest
Louisiana rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is expected. This rainfall may
produce areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, especially
in highly urbanized metropolitan areas. Additionally, there is the
potential for isolated minor to moderate river flooding.
 
STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide
will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Port O'Connor to San Luis Pass TX including Matagorda Bay... 3-5 ft
San Luis Pass, TX to Rutherford Beach, LA including Galveston
Bay...2-4 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande to Port O'Connor, TX...2-4 ft
Baffin Bay, Corpus Christi Bay, Aransas Bay and San Antonio
Bay...2-4 ft
Rutherford Beach, LA to Intracoastal City, LA...1-3 ft
Sabine Lake and Calcasieu Lake...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas
of onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area in northeastern Mexico and southern
Texas this morning, making outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.  These conditions will spread northward within the
warning area through tonight.  Hurricane conditions are possible in
the Hurricane Watch area as early as this afternoon.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible within the watch area by tonight or early
Tuesday.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two will be possible today into tonight
across the Texas coast.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Nicholas will continue affecting
portions of the northwest Gulf coast through Tuesday. These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Nicholas Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142021
400 AM CDT Mon Sep 13 2021
 
Radar data from Brownsville shows that the center of Nicholas is on
the southwestern side of a large area of deep convection over the
western Gulf of Mexico.  While southwesterly shear continues to 
affect the storm, the radar presentation has recently improved, 
with what could be the start of a partial eyewall forming in the 
northern quadrant.  The initial wind speed remains 50 kt based on 
earlier aircraft flight-level winds of 59 kt, believable SFMR 
values up to 50 kt, along with radar winds at 5000 ft near 60 kt. 
 
The storm is moving north-northwestward at about 12 kt.  Nicholas is 
forecast to turn northward soon into a weakness in the subtropical 
ridge.  The track prediction is only nudged slightly westward from 
the previous one through landfall, consistent with recent model 
guidance.  Thereafter, there isn't good agreement among the models 
on how quickly the tropical cyclone will move northeastward out of 
Texas.  Generally the models are faster this cycle, which seems 
believable given the large northward re-formation earlier likely 
exposing Nicholas to stronger mid-latitude flow.  Thus the new NHC 
forecast is trended faster as well, but remains behind the model 
consensus.  Obviously the forward speed is important to the heavy 
rainfall forecast, and this trend will be one to watch.
 
Nicholas should continue to strengthen up until landfall due 
primarily to the very warm Gulf waters and the recent inner-core 
improvements.  Moderate southwesterly shear and some dry air are the 
main inhibiting factors and will hopefully keep the strengthening in 
check.  However, it is possible that Nicholas could become a 
hurricane before landfall, and that's the reason for the hurricane 
watch area.  Nicholas should weaken after landfall, diminish into a 
tropical depression within a couple of days, and degenerate into a 
remnant low in about 3 days.  No significant changes were made to 
the previous NHC wind speed prediction.
 

Key Messages:
 
1.  Heavy rainfall will impact portions of the Texas and Louisiana 
coasts through the middle of the week. Significant rainfall amounts 
are possible, potentially resulting in areas of considerable flash 
and urban flooding, especially in highly urbanized metropolitan 
areas. Isolated minor to moderate river flooding is also expected. 
 
2. There is the danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation
along the coast of Texas from Port Aransas to San Luis Pass.
Residents in these areas should follow any advice given by
local officials.
 
3. Nicholas is forecast to approach the middle Texas coast as a
strong tropical storm today, and could be near hurricane
intensity at landfall.  Tropical storm conditions are expected 
along portions of the middle Texas coast beginning by this 
afternoon, with hurricane conditions possible from Port Aransas to 
Freeport this afternoon and tonight.
 
4. Tropical storm conditions are expected along portions of the
northeastern coast of Mexico and the coast of south Texas beginning
during the next few hours.
