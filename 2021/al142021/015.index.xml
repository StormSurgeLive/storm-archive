Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Wed Sep 15 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The Weather Prediction Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Nicholas, located near the Texas/Louisiana border. <br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms have changed little in organization in <br/>
association with an area of low pressure located a few hundred <br/>
miles southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands.  Environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to remain conducive for development, and a <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form within the next couple of <br/>
days.  This system is expected to move westward to <br/>
west-northwestward across the tropical Atlantic during the next <br/>
several days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Satellite images indicate that a low pressure system located a few <br/>
hundred miles northeast of the central Bahamas is gradually becoming <br/>
better defined.  However, the associated showers and thunderstorms <br/>
are still disorganized.  Environmental conditions are expected to <br/>
become more conducive for development, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form during the next day or two while the system moves <br/>
north-northwestward to northward off the southeast U.S. coast. <br/>
Regardless of development, this system could bring high surf to <br/>
portions of the southeast and mid-Atlantic U.S. coasts later this <br/>
week.  The Air Force Hurricane Hunters are currently enroute to <br/>
investigate the disturbance.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to emerge off the west coast of <br/>
Africa in a day or two. Thereafter, environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to be conducive for development while the system moves <br/>
generally west-northwestward to northwestward over the <br/>
far eastern Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
