Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Mon Sep 13 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Nicholas, located near the central Texas coast. <br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave located over the far eastern tropical Atlantic is <br/>
producing an area of disorganized cloudiness and thunderstorms. <br/>
Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive for gradual <br/>
development of this disturbance over the next several days, and a <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form by later this week while the <br/>
system moves westward at about 15 mph across the eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
An area of low pressure is expected to form by midweek a couple of <br/>
hundred miles north of the southeastern or central Bahamas as a <br/>
tropical wave interacts with an upper-level trough.  Some gradual <br/>
development of this system is possible thereafter, and a tropical <br/>
depression could form later this week while the system moves <br/>
north-northwestward or northward across the western Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nicholas was
located near latitude 28.1 North, longitude 96.2 West.  Nicholas is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this 
general motion is expected to continue through tonight, followed by 
a turn toward the northeast by late Tuesday.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Nicholas is expected to make landfall along 
the central Texas coast later tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is possible during 
the next few hours, and Nicholas could become a hurricane when it 
reaches the Texas coast.  Weakening is anticipated on Tuesday and 
Wednesday while Nicholas moves over land.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.  A WeatherFlow station at Matagorda Bay recently 
reported a sustained wind of 55 mph (89 km/h) with a gust to 71 mph 
(115 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 988 mb (29.18 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Nicholas can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4, WMO header WTNT44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?key_messages
 
RAINFALL:  Nicholas is expected to produce storm total rainfall of
6 to 12 inches, with isolated maximum amounts of 18 inches, across
portions of the middle and upper Texas coastal areas through
Wednesday. Life-threatening flash flooding impacts, especially in
highly urbanized metropolitan areas, are possible across portions of
the upper Texas Gulf Coast and far southwestern Louisiana.
 
Across interior southeast Texas into southern-central Louisiana and
southern Mississippi, rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches with locally
higher amounts near 10 inches are expected through Thursday.  This
rainfall may produce areas of considerable flash and urban
flooding.
 
The potential for minor to isolated moderate river flooding exists
across the entire region, along with isolated major river flooding,
especially in the smaller river basins and urban areas.
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Port O'Connor, TX to San Luis Pass including Matagorda Bay...3-5 ft
San Luis Pass to Rutherford Beach, LA including Galveston
Bay...2-4 ft
Port Aransas, TX to Port O'Connor, TX...2-4 ft
Aransas Bay and San Antonio Bay...2-4 ft
Rutherford Beach, LA to Intracoastal City, LA...1-3 ft
Sabine Lake and Calcasieu Lake...1-3 ft
Baffin Bay to Port Aransas, TX...1-3 ft
Corpus Christi Bay...1-3 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande to Baffin Bay...1-2 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas
of onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area across the central and upper Texas coasts through tonight, 
making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.  Hurricane 
conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch area as early as this 
evening.
 
TORNADOES:  A couple of tornadoes will be possible through tonight,
mainly along the upper Texas coast.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Nicholas will continue affecting portions
of the northwest Gulf coast through Tuesday. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Nicholas Discussion Number   7...Corrected
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142021
400 PM CDT Mon Sep 13 2021

Corrected third paragraph typo
 
Earlier reconnaissance aircraft flight-level wind data, along with
recent Doppler radar velocity data from Brownsville and Corpus
Christi, indicate that the inner-core wind field has still not
consolidated into a single low-level wind center. High-resolution
1-minute GOES-16 visible satellite imagery, radar data, and
reconnaissance wind data all indicate at least three small but very
tight swirls revolving counter-clockwise around a mean center. An
eye feature has tried to form on multiple occasions, only to
dissipate after less than half an hour. An Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft sampled the most of the northeastern
quadrant of Nicholas' larger circulation this morning and afternoon,
and measured 63-67-kt 850-mb flight-level winds, which roughly
equals 53-54-kt surface winds in that quadrant; the aircraft also
found SFMR surface winds of 50-51 kt in the same area. In addition,
Doppler velocity data from Corpus Christi and Brownsville have been
indicating average velocities of 59-60 kt between 9,000-10,000 ft
near the center, which also equates to about 53-54-kt surface winds.
Based on these wind data, the advisory intensity has been increased
to 55 kt.
 
The initial motion estimate is 015/10 kt. The new NHC model guidance 
has come into better agreement on Nicholas moving toward the north- 
northeast until landfall occurs, now that the 12Z ECMWF model 
has made a significant eastward shift closer to the previous and 
current GFS and HWRF model solutions. After landfall, Nicholas is 
expected to move around the northwestern periphery of a deep-layer 
subtropical ridge that is oriented east-to-west across the central 
and eastern Gulf of Mexico. The latest guidance has continued to 
trend more eastward through 24 hours, followed by a more southward 
or right-of-track trend thereafter. As a result, the new NHC track 
forecast has followed suit, and has also been shifted a little to 
the right of the previous advisory track, and lies between the 
tightly packed consensus models to the west and the GFS model to the 
east.
 
Doppler velocity data from the Houston WSR-88D radar has shown a 
large swath of hurricane-force wind speeds in the northeastern 
quadrant of Nicholas' circulation above 12,000 ft during the past 
couple of hours, with brief appearances of average velocities of 
80-100 kt at high altitudes. Thus, there is an abundance of 
large-scale cyclonic vorticity available for another burst of 
intense convection to tap into, which could allow Nicholas to 
approach hurricane strength by landfall. This would most likely 
occur tonight during the convective maximum period near landfall 
where increased frictional convergence along the coast could aid in 
the development of convection on the west side of the circulation. 
After landfall, rapid weakening is expected owing to land 
interaction, strong southwesterly vertical wind shear in excess of 
30 kt, and entrainment of mid-level dry air from the southern 
Plains. As a result of these negative conditions, Nicholas is 
forecast to weaken to tropical depression by late Tuesday and 
degenerate into a remnant low on Wednesday.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rainfall will impact portions of southeastern Texas, 
Louisiana, and southern Mississippi through the middle of the week. 
Significant rainfall amounts are possible, potentially resulting in 
areas of life-threatening flash and urban flooding, especially in 
highly urbanized metropolitan areas. Minor to isolated moderate 
river flooding is also expected, along with isolated major river 
flooding across smaller river basins and urban areas.
 
2. There is the danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation
along the coast of Texas from Port Aransas to Sabine Pass.
Residents in these areas should follow any advice given by
local officials.
 
3. Nicholas is forecast to approach the middle Texas coast as a
strong tropical storm this evening, and could be near hurricane
intensity at landfall.  Tropical storm conditions are expected
along portions of the middle and upper Texas coasts this 
evening and tonight, with hurricane conditions possible from Port 
Aransas to San Luis Pass.
