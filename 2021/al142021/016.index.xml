Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Wed Sep 15 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The Weather Prediction Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Nicholas, located over southwestern Louisiana. <br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms have changed little in organization in <br/>
association with an area of low pressure located several hundred <br/>
miles southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands.  Environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to remain conducive for development, and a <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form within the next couple of <br/>
days.  This system is expected to move westward to <br/>
west-northwestward across the tropical Atlantic during the next <br/>
several days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A low pressure system located about midway between the Bahamas and <br/>
Bermuda is producing poorly organized shower activity.  An Air <br/>
Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigating the system <br/>
this afternoon reported that the circulation was disorganized and <br/>
that the strongest winds were well to the east of the center.  <br/>
Environmental conditions are expected to become more conducive for <br/>
development, and a tropical depression is likely to form during the <br/>
next day or two while the system moves north-northwestward to <br/>
northward off the southeast U.S. coast.  Regardless of development, <br/>
this system could bring high surf to portions of the southeast and <br/>
mid-Atlantic U.S. coasts later this week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to emerge off the west coast of <br/>
Africa in a day or two. Thereafter, environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to be conducive for development while the system moves <br/>
generally west-northwestward to northwestward over the <br/>
far eastern Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
