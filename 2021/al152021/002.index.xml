Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Fri Sep 17 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on newly formed <br/>
Tropical Storm Odette, located a couple of hundred miles off the <br/>
Mid-Atlantic U.S. coast.<br/>
<br/>
The Weather Prediction Center has issued the last advisory on <br/>
Post-Tropical Cyclone Nicholas, located over Louisiana. <br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms are gradually becoming better organized in <br/>
association with an area of low pressure located about 1100 miles <br/>
east-southeast of the northern Leeward Islands. Environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to be conducive for further development <br/>
during the next couple of days, and a tropical depression is likely <br/>
to form during the next day or two while the system moves toward the <br/>
west-northwest at about 15 mph.  This system is expected to be near <br/>
the northern Leeward Islands on Monday and Tuesday, and interests <br/>
there should monitor the progress of this disturbance.  Upper-level <br/>
winds are likely to become less conducive for development when the <br/>
system reaches the southwestern Atlantic by the early to middle part <br/>
of next week.  <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located a few hundred miles south of <br/>
the Cabo Verde Islands continues to produce disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms.  This system is expected to move toward the west and <br/>
then northwest at 5 to 10 mph over the far eastern Atlantic, and <br/>
some gradual development is possible over the weekend.  However, by <br/>
early next week, further development appears unlikely as the system <br/>
is expected to move into strong upper-level winds and over cooler <br/>
waters.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

...ODETTE POORLY ORGANIZED OFF THE U.S. MID-ATLANTIC COAST...
...FORECAST TO BECOME POST-TROPICAL BY SATURDAY NIGHT SOUTH OF
ATLANTIC CANADA...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM EDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...36.4N 71.2W
ABOUT 265 MI...430 KM SE OF CAPE MAY NEW JERSEY
ABOUT 340 MI...545 KM S OF NANTUCKET MASSACHUSETTS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 50 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1010 MB...29.83 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Please refer to products issued by Environment Canada for Odette's
potential impacts to Newfoundland as a post-tropical cyclone.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Odette was 
located near latitude 36.4 North, longitude 71.2 West. Odette is 
moving toward the northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A faster 
east-northeast to northeast motion is expected this weekend.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Odette will move away from the U.S. 
Mid-Atlantic coast and pass south of Atlantic Canada over the 
weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and
Odette is expected to become a strong post-tropical low by Saturday
night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1010 mb (29.83 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Odette are affecting portions of
the United States Mid-Atlantic coast and are expected to spread
northward to portions of the U.S. Northeast and Atlantic Canada
coasts during the weekend.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM EDT.

Tropical Storm Odette Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152021
500 PM EDT Fri Sep 17 2021
 
The circulation associated with the area of low pressure off the
U.S. Mid-Atlantic coast has become better defined today, with a
new center having developed near a persistent cluster of deep
convection.  This system has some non-tropical characteristics, with
a developing frontal boundary draped around the northern and western
side of the circulation.  Although the convection is being sheared
off to the northeast of the center, the structure still resembles
that of a tropical cyclone.  An ASCAT-C pass from a few hours ago
showed that maximum winds were 30-35 kt to the north of the center,
thus advisories are being initiated on Tropical Storm Odette with
35-kt winds.
 
With the re-formation of the center, the initial motion is
uncertain but is estimated to be northeastward, or 045/13 kt.
Odette is embedded between the subtropical ridge over the western
Atlantic and a deep-layer trough over the U.S. Upper Midwest and
central Canada.  The approach of this trough should cause Odette to
accelerate toward the northeast and then east-northeast during the
next few days.  After about day 3, there is significant divergence
among the models.  The GFS ejects the system northeastward and
stalls it over the north Atlantic, south of Greenland.  The ECMWF,
UKMET, and Canadian models, however, stall the cyclone sooner and
have it meandering south of Newfoundland on days 4 and 5.  For now,
the NHC track forecast shows Odette slowing down significantly on
those days (less than 5 kt on day 5) and is a blend of the TVCA and
HCCA consensus aids.
 
Odette's transition to an extratropical cyclone is probably already
underway.  The storm is also centered over the Gulf Stream, where 
water temperatures are about 28 degrees Celsius, so in the short 
term it is likely that a combination of baroclinic and convective 
forcing will cause some intensification, despite deep-layer shear 
strengthening to near 30 kt.  The global models suggest that Odette 
should become fully extratropical by 36 hours, and the intensity 
models indicate that the post-tropical low should peak in 
intensity in 48-60 hours.  The low is then likely to occlude by day 
3, a process which typically leads to gradual weakening, which is 
indicated in the official forecast.

Odette is expected to affect portions of Newfoundland with strong 
winds and heavy rainfall Sunday and Sunday night as a 
post-tropical cyclone.  Please refer to products from Environment 
Canada for additional information on potential impacts in 
Newfoundland.
