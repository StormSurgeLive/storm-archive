Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Fri Sep 17 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The Weather Prediction Center is issuing advisories on <br/>
Post-Tropical Cyclone Nicholas, located over Louisiana. <br/>
<br/>
Recent satellite images indicate that a new and better-defined <br/>
center of circulation has developed in association with a low <br/>
pressure area located about 250 miles east of Norfolk, Virginia.  <br/>
In addition, shower and thunderstorm activity is becoming more <br/>
organized near this new center.  If these development trends <br/>
continue, then a tropical depression or tropical storm is likely to <br/>
form later today or tonight while the low moves toward the <br/>
northeast or east-northeast at 10 to 15 mph, away from the United <br/>
States Mid-Atlantic and Northeast coasts.  The low is expected to <br/>
transform into a non-tropical gale-force low Saturday or Saturday <br/>
night while it is located south of Atlantic Canada, and it is <br/>
likely to bring strong winds and heavy rains to portions of <br/>
Newfoundland by Sunday and Sunday night.  This system is also <br/>
expected to bring high surf to portions of the Mid-Atlantic and <br/>
Northeast U.S. coasts and Atlantic Canada through this weekend.  <br/>
Additional information on this system, including gale warnings, can <br/>
be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the NOAA Ocean Prediction <br/>
Center. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave and broad <br/>
area of low pressure located about midway between the Lesser <br/>
Antilles and the Cabo Verde Islands have become a little better <br/>
organized since yesterday.  Environmental conditions are expected <br/>
to be conducive for further development during the next couple of <br/>
days, and a tropical depression is likely to form over the weekend <br/>
or early next week while moving toward the west-northwest at about <br/>
15 mph across the central tropical Atlantic and then near the <br/>
northern Leeward Islands by Monday and Tuesday.  Upper-level winds <br/>
could become less conducive for development over the southwestern <br/>
Atlantic by the early to middle part of next week.  Interests in <br/>
the Leeward Islands should monitor the progress of this system <br/>
during the next few days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located a few hundred miles <br/>
south-southeast of the Cabo Verde Islands continues to produce <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  This system is expected to <br/>
move toward the west and then northwest at 5 to 10 mph over the far <br/>
eastern Atlantic, and some gradual development is possible over the <br/>
weekend before upper-level winds increase and the low moves over <br/>
cooler waters.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

...FORECAST TO BECOME POST-TROPICAL BY SATURDAY NIGHT SOUTH OF
ATLANTIC CANADA...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM EDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...36.7N 71.8W
ABOUT 225 MI...365 KM SE OF CAPE MAY NEW JERSEY
ABOUT 325 MI...525 KM SSW OF NANTUCKET MASSACHUSETTS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 45 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.

Please refer to products issued by Environment Canada for Odette's 
potential impacts to Newfoundland as a post-tropical cyclone.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Odette was
located near latitude 36.7 North, longitude 71.8 West.  Odette is
moving toward the northeast near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this  
general motion is expected to continue into tonight.  A turn toward 
the east-northeast with an increase in forward speed is expected to 
begin on Saturday and continue through Monday.  On the forecast 
track, the center of Odette will move away from the U.S. 
Mid-Atlantic coast and pass south of Atlantic Canada over the 
weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and 
Odette is expected to become a strong post-tropical low by Saturday 
night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
to the north of the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1010 mb (29.83 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Odette are affecting portions of
the United States Mid-Atlantic coast and are expected to spread
northward to portions of the U.S. Northeast and Atlantic Canada
coasts during the weekend.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM EDT.

Tropical Storm Odette Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152021
500 PM EDT Fri Sep 17 2021
 
The circulation associated with the area of low pressure off the
U.S. Mid-Atlantic coast has become better defined today, with a
new center having developed near a persistent cluster of deep
convection.  This system has some non-tropical characteristics, with
a developing frontal boundary draped around the northern and western
side of the circulation.  Although the convection is being sheared
off to the northeast of the center, the structure still resembles
that of a tropical cyclone.  An ASCAT-C pass from a few hours ago
showed that maximum winds were 30-35 kt to the north of the center,
thus advisories are being initiated on Tropical Storm Odette with
35-kt winds.
 
With the re-formation of the center, the initial motion is
uncertain but is estimated to be northeastward, or 045/13 kt.
Odette is embedded between the subtropical ridge over the western
Atlantic and a deep-layer trough over the U.S. Upper Midwest and
central Canada.  The approach of this trough should cause Odette to
accelerate toward the northeast and then east-northeast during the
next few days.  After about day 3, there is significant divergence
among the models.  The GFS ejects the system northeastward and
stalls it over the north Atlantic, south of Greenland.  The ECMWF,
UKMET, and Canadian models, however, stall the cyclone sooner and
have it meandering south of Newfoundland on days 4 and 5.  For now,
the NHC track forecast shows Odette slowing down significantly on
those days (less than 5 kt on day 5) and is a blend of the TVCA and
HCCA consensus aids.
 
Odette's transition to an extratropical cyclone is probably already
underway.  The storm is also centered over the Gulf Stream, where 
water temperatures are about 28 degrees Celsius, so in the short 
term it is likely that a combination of baroclinic and convective 
forcing will cause some intensification, despite deep-layer shear 
strengthening to near 30 kt.  The global models suggest that Odette 
should become fully extratropical by 36 hours, and the intensity 
models indicate that the post-tropical low should peak in 
intensity in 48-60 hours.  The low is then likely to occlude by day 
3, a process which typically leads to gradual weakening, which is 
indicated in the official forecast.

Odette is expected to affect portions of Newfoundland with strong 
winds and heavy rainfall Sunday and Sunday night as a 
post-tropical cyclone.  Please refer to products from Environment 
Canada for additional information on potential impacts in 
Newfoundland.
