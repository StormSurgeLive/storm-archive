Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Sat Sep 18 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Odette, located a couple of hundred miles south-southeast of <br/>
Nantucket, Massachusetts.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to become better organized in <br/>
association with an area of low pressure located about 650 miles <br/>
miles east-southeast of the northern Leeward Islands.  <br/>
Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive for further <br/>
development during the next day or two, and a tropical depression <br/>
or tropical storm is expected to form later today or tonight while <br/>
the system moves toward the west-northwest at about 15 mph.  This <br/>
system is expected to be near the northern Leeward Islands on <br/>
Monday and Tuesday, and interests there should monitor its progress. <br/>
Upper-level winds are likely to become less conducive for <br/>
development when the system reaches the southwestern Atlantic by the <br/>
early to middle part of next week.  Additional information on this <br/>
system, including gale warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts <br/>
issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A broad area of low pressure is located over the far eastern <br/>
Atlantic a few hundred miles south of the Cabo Verde Islands.  The <br/>
associated shower and thunderstorm activity has become a little <br/>
better organized since yesterday, and environmental conditions <br/>
appear conducive for further development during the next couple of <br/>
days.  A tropical depression could form while the system moves <br/>
northwestward at about 10 mph to the west of the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands before it reaches cooler waters and stronger upper-level <br/>
winds early next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>

POST-TROPICAL CYCLONE...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...38.0N 69.3W
ABOUT 225 MI...360 KM S OF NANTUCKET MASSACHUSETTS
ABOUT 545 MI...875 KM SW OF HALIFAX NOVA SCOTIA

Please refer to products issued by Environment Canada for Odette's
potential impacts to Newfoundland as a post-tropical cyclone.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Odette was 
located near latitude 38.0 North, longitude 69.3 West.  Odette is 
moving toward the northeast near 15 mph (24 km/h).  A faster 
northeast to east-northeast motion is expected during the next 
couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of Odette will 
pass south of Atlantic Canada on Sunday and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast during the next day or two, and Odette is 
expected to become a strong post-tropical low by Saturday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles (315 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Odette are affecting portions of
the United States Mid-Atlantic coast and are expected to spread
northward to portions of the U.S. Northeast and Atlantic Canada
coasts during the weekend.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Odette Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152021
500 AM AST Sat Sep 18 2021
 
Odette does not look very much like a tropical cyclone.  All of the 
deep convection continues to be displaced well to the east of the 
poorly-defined center due to strong westerly shear.  The circulation 
is elongated from southwest to northeast and contains multiple 
low-cloud swirls.  The current intensity of the system is estimated 
to be near 40 kt based on earlier scatterometer observations, and 
these stronger winds are occurring in the convection over the 
eastern semicircle of the cyclone, well removed from the center.

Since the center is not so easy to locate, the motion is rather 
uncertain.  However the system appears to be accelerating and the 
initial motion estimate is roughly 050/13 kt.  Odette is embedded 
within the flow on the south side of a mid-latitude shortwave 
trough.  This steering pattern should carry the system northeastward 
to east-northeastward for the next couple of days.  Afterwards, the 
trough is predicted by the global models to cut off to the south of 
eastern Newfoundland.  As a result, Odette is likely to turn a 
little south of east and decelerate in 3-4 days.  By the end of the 
forecast period, the cyclone is expected to begin moving 
northeastward on the east side of the cutoff low.  The official 
track forecast is similar to the previous one but a little farther 
south around days 4 and 5.  This is in good agreement with the 
latest corrected model consensus.

The dynamical guidance indicates that the vertical shear over 
Odette will get even stronger over the next few days.   As the 
system will soon begin to move over the cooler waters to the north 
of the Gulf Stream, its primary energy source should come from 
baroclinicity.  In about 24 hours, the dynamical guidance shows 
significant thermal advection around the cyclone, signifying its 
extratropical transition.  The global models show the post-tropical 
cyclone deepening through 48 hours and the official forecast calls 
for some strengthening up to that time.  Later in the period, as 
the baroclinic energy source appears to wane, gradual weakening is 
expected.
 
As Odette becomes fully extratropical and gains latitude this
weekend and into Monday, the wind field is forecast to expand 
significantly.  Odette is expected to affect portions of 
Newfoundland with strong winds and heavy rainfall Sunday and Monday 
as a strong post-tropical cyclone.  Please refer to products 
from Environment Canada for additional information on potential 
impacts in Newfoundland.
