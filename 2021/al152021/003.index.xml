Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Sat Sep 18 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Odette, located several hundred miles off the Mid-Atlantic <br/>
U.S. coast.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms continue to become better organized in <br/>
association with an area of low pressure located less than 1000 <br/>
miles east-southeast of the northern Leeward Islands. Environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to be conducive for further development <br/>
during the next day or two, and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form later today or tomorrow while the system moves toward the <br/>
west-northwest at about 15 mph.  This system is expected to be near <br/>
the northern Leeward Islands on Monday and Tuesday, and interests <br/>
there should monitor the progress of this disturbance.  Upper-level <br/>
winds are likely to become less conducive for development when the <br/>
system reaches the southwestern Atlantic by the early to middle part <br/>
of next week.  <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
An area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
south-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands has developed a more <br/>
concentrated area of showers and thunderstorms, primarily west of <br/>
the center. This system is currently nearly stationary, but is <br/>
expected to begin moving towards the northwest at 5 to 10 mph over <br/>
the far eastern Atlantic where some additional development is <br/>
possible over the weekend.  However, by early next week, further <br/>
development appears unlikely as the system is forecast to move into <br/>
less conducive upper-level winds and over cooler waters.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

POST-TROPICAL CYCLONE...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...38.0N 69.3W
ABOUT 225 MI...360 KM S OF NANTUCKET MASSACHUSETTS
ABOUT 545 MI...875 KM SW OF HALIFAX NOVA SCOTIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 50 DEGREES AT 15 MPH...24 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1008 MB...29.77 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Please refer to products issued by Environment Canada for Odette's
potential impacts to Newfoundland as a post-tropical cyclone.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Odette was 
located near latitude 38.0 North, longitude 69.3 West.  Odette is 
moving toward the northeast near 15 mph (24 km/h).  A faster 
northeast to east-northeast motion is expected during the next 
couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of Odette will 
pass south of Atlantic Canada on Sunday and Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast during the next day or two, and Odette is 
expected to become a strong post-tropical low by Saturday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles (315 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Odette are affecting portions of
the United States Mid-Atlantic coast and are expected to spread
northward to portions of the U.S. Northeast and Atlantic Canada
coasts during the weekend.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Tropical Storm Odette Forecast Discussion Number 2</title>

Tropical Storm Odette Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL152021
1100 PM EDT Fri Sep 17 2021
 
Satellite images indicate that west-southwesterly shear is taking a 
toll on Odette.  Deep convection has been separating from the 
low-level circulation, and the closest area of thunderstorms is now 
more than 100 miles east of the center.  The circulation is rather 
broad, but there is a clear center a couple of hundred miles off the 
U.S. Mid-Atlantic coast.  The initial intensity is held at 35 kt for 
this advisory.  A very recent ASCAT pass showed some stronger winds 
in the thunderstorms more than a couple of hundred miles east of the 
low-level center, but its not clear if those winds are reliable and 
representative of the storm's true intensity.  Hopefully more 
scatterometer data with be available soon to better assess Odette's 
strength.
 
Although it appears that Odette has been meandering lately, a 
12-hour average yields a northeastward motion at about 9 kt.  The 
storm is expected to move faster northeastward or east-northeastward 
off the northeast U.S. and Atlantic Canada coasts this weekend as it 
moves in the mid-latitude flow.  After that time, the models show a 
significant slow down as the cyclone cuts off from the progressive 
flow to the south or southeast of Newfoundland.  Although there is 
quite a bit of spread in the models from days 3-5, almost all of the 
guidance shows the storm stalling by the end of the forecast period. 
The new NHC track forecast is a little to the south of the previous 
one to come into better agreement with the latest models.  This 
forecast still lies to the north of the consensus aids, however.
 
Odette is already beginning the process of transitioning to an 
extratropical cyclone, and it will likely complete the transition by 
Saturday night when it is expected to be north of the Gulf Stream 
Current and merging with an approaching trough.  The cyclone is 
likely to reach its peak intensity as an extratropical storm in 
48-60 hours when the baroclinic dynamics are most favorable.  
Gradual weakening seems likely beyond that time.  The NHC intensity 
forecast is the same as the previous one and in line with the 
majority of the guidance.
 
As Odette becomes fully extratropical and gains latitude this
weekend, the wind field is forecast to expand significantly.  Odette
is expected to affect portions of Newfoundland with strong winds and
heavy rainfall Sunday and Sunday night as a post-tropical cyclone.
Please refer to products from Environment Canada for additional
information on potential impacts in Newfoundland.
