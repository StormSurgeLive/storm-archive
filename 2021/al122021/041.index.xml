Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Fri Sep 10 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Larry, located over the western Atlantic several hundred miles <br/>
southwest of Newfoundland, Canada. <br/>
<br/>
The northern part of a tropical wave is producing disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms over the western Caribbean Sea, and <br/>
portions of Central America and the Yucatan peninsula.  This system <br/>
is forecast to move into the Bay of Campeche and merge with a <br/>
pre-existing surface trough by Sunday. Environmental conditions are <br/>
expected to be conducive to support gradual development thereafter, <br/>
and a tropical depression is likely to form on Sunday or Monday <br/>
before the system moves onshore along the western Gulf of Mexico <br/>
coast.  Regardless of development, this disturbance is expected to <br/>
produce heavy rains across portions of Central America and the <br/>
Yucatan Peninsula through Saturday.  Heavy rains are likely to <br/>
reach portions of the western Gulf coast late this weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A strong tropical wave located along the west coast of Africa is <br/>
producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  This wave will <br/>
move off the coast by this evening, and gradual development is <br/>
expected thereafter. A tropical depression is likely to form late <br/>
this weekend or early next week as the system moves <br/>
west-northwestward over the far eastern Atlantic near the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands.  Interests in the Cabo Verde Islands should monitor the <br/>
progress of this system. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

* Southeastern Newfoundland from Arnold's Cove to Jones Harbour
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Southeastern Newfoundland from Francois to west of Arnold's Cove
* Southeastern Newfoundland from north of Jones Harbor to Fogo
Island
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area, in this case within the next 24
hours. Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed
to completion.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within the
next 12 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in southeastern Newfoundland should monitor the
progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Larry was located 
near latitude 43.5 North, longitude 58.2 West. Larry is moving 
quickly toward the north-northeast near 35 mph (56 km/h).  An even 
faster north-northeast to northeast motion is expected during the 
next day or so.  On the forecast track, the center of Larry will 
pass well southeast of Nova Scotia today, and move over southeastern 
Newfoundland tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected before landfall in
Newfoundland.  After landfall, Larry should weaken and become an
extratropical cyclone early Saturday before it merges with another 
low over the Labrador Sea on Sunday.
 
Larry is a large tropical cyclone.  Hurricane-force winds extend 
outward up to 105 miles (165 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 255 miles (405 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 967 mb (28.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Larry can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?key_messages
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane warning
area in southeastern Newfoundland tonight, with tropical storm
conditions expected to begin this afternoon or evening.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the tropical
storm warning area in southeastern Newfoundland later today.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
coastal flooding within the warning areas in southeastern
Newfoundland.
 
SURF: Significant swells from Larry will continue affecting Bermuda, 
the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada through 
Saturday night. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening 
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your 
local weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Heavy rains from Larry will move quickly across eastern
Newfoundland tonight, producing 1 to 2 inches of rain.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM AST.

Hurricane Larry Discussion Number  41
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122021
500 PM AST Fri Sep 10 2021
 
Even though Larry is crossing the north wall of the Gulf Stream 
Current, the hurricane remains well organized and has changed little 
during the past several hours.  Satellite images and radar data 
indicate that Larry still has an inner core, though the southern 
side has eroded some.  Large curved bands surround the inner core 
region, with dry slots noted between the core and bands. The initial 
intensity is held at 70 kt based mostly on the ASCAT data from 
earlier today, which showed peak winds of around 65 kt to the east 
of the center.  It should be noted that this intensity value is 
above the Dvorak estimates, which are often not as reliable for high 
latitude storms like Larry.  The earlier ASCAT data confirmed that 
Larry is a large cyclone with hurricane-force and 
tropical-storm-force winds extending outward up to 90 n mi and 220 n 
mi from the center, respectively.  Larry is rapidly approaching 
southeastern Newfoundland, and weather conditions are expected to 
begin to deteriorate there in a few hours.
 
The hurricane continues to accelerate to the north-northeast, and
the latest initial motion estimate is 020/30 kt.  An even faster
north-northeast to northeast motion is expected during the next day
or so as the hurricane moves in the fast flow between a mid- to
upper-level trough over the northeastern U.S./eastern Canada and a
mid-level ridge over the central Atlantic.  This motion should take
Larry across southeastern Newfoundland tonight. Larry is then
expected to merge with a large extratropical low over the Labrador
Sea on Sunday.  The NHC track forecast is largely an update of the
previous one and near the middle of the tightly clustered models.
 
Larry is expected to maintain its intensity through landfall in 
Newfoundland tonight.  However, a combination of land interaction, 
much cooler SSTs, and an increase in shear are expected to promote 
weakening shortly after landfall.  Larry should be fully 
extratropical early Saturday morning when it is forecast to be 
exiting Newfoundland and moving over the cold waters of the 
Labrador Sea. The NHC intensity forecast remains close to the GFS 
model, which often performs well for hurricanes that transition to 
extratropical cyclones.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Larry is forecast to move over portions of southeastern
Newfoundland tonight as it undergoes transition to a
hurricane-force post-tropical cyclone.  Hurricane conditions, a
dangerous storm surge, and heavy rainfall are expected in portions
of southeastern Newfoundland where a Hurricane Warning in effect.
 
2. Large swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the
Bahamas, Bermuda, and the east coast of the United States and
Atlantic Canada through Saturday night. These swells will cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and beachgoers
and other interests along these coasts are urged to follow the
guidance of lifeguards and local officials.
