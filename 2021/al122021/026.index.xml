Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Mon Sep 6 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Larry, located over the central Atlantic more than 900 miles <br/>
southeast of Bermuda. <br/>
<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue over the northern <br/>
portion of the Yucatan Peninsula and south-central Gulf of Mexico <br/>
in association with a surface trough and an upper-level disturbance. <br/>
The system is forecast to move slowly northward or northeastward <br/>
over the central and then northeastern Gulf of Mexico, likely <br/>
reaching the northern Gulf coast in a few days. Although upper-level <br/>
winds are currently unfavorable for development to occur, they are <br/>
expected to become marginally conducive for tropical cyclone <br/>
formation in a couple of days. The disturbance is then expected to <br/>
cross the southeastern United States beginning midweek, and some <br/>
development will be possible once it emerges over the Atlantic <br/>
waters late this week. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

...EXPECTED TO CAUSE DANGEROUS SURF AND RIP CURRENTS
ALONG WESTERN ATLANTIC SHORES LATER THIS WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...23.1N 54.4W
ABOUT 900 MI...1445 KM SE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...125 MPH...205 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 325 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...956 MB...28.23 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Larry. A
tropical storm watch could be required for the island tomorrow.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of the eye of Hurricane Larry 
was located near latitude 23.1 North, longitude 54.4 West. Larry is 
moving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h) and and this 
general motion is expected to continue through Wednesday, followed 
by a turn toward the north-northwest and north on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Larry is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale. Very gradual weakening is forecast over the 
next several days. 
 
Larry remains a large hurricane. Hurricane-force winds extend 
outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 956 mb (28.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Larry can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the Lesser
Antilles, portions of the Greater Antilles, and the Bahamas tonight
and tomorrow, and Bermuda through the end of the week. Significant
swells should reach the east coast of the United States and Atlantic
Canada by midweek and continue affecting these shores through the
end of the week.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Hurricane Larry Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122021
500 PM AST Mon Sep 06 2021
 
NOAA aircraft have been investigating Larry for much of this 
afternoon, providing valuable information regarding the structure 
and intensity of the hurricane. Peak 700-mb flight-level winds of 
110 kt with SFMR winds of 101 kt were measured in the northwestern 
eyewall a couple of hours ago, supporting an intensity of about 100 
kt in that portion of the cyclone. During that pass through the 
hurricane, the aircraft tail Doppler radar measured winds of 121 kt 
at a height of 3 km in the northeastern eyewall, which equate to 
about 109 kt at the surface. Therefore, the initial intensity has 
been adjusted up to 110 kt for this advisory. A pair of dropsondes 
into the eye of Larry measured a minimum central pressure of 956 mb. 
Both the aircraft and earlier ASCAT data indicated that 
hurricane-force winds extend up to 60 n mi from the center, while 
tropical-storm-force winds extend up to 160 n mi from the center.   
 
Larry is maintaining its stable, annular structure with a very 
large, mostly clear eye. The environment surrounding Larry is not 
forecast to change much over the next couple of days, so only some 
minor fluctuations in intensity are anticipated during that time. By 
72 hours, decreasing sea-surface temperatures and an increase in 
vertical wind shear should cause the hurricane to begin weakening. 
The only change to the NHC intensity forecast was a 5-kt increase 
through the first few days to accommodate the adjustment required to 
the initial intensity. By the end of the forecast period, Larry is 
expected to transition to a powerful extratropical cyclone. The 
latest NHC forecast remains on the high end of the guidance, closest 
to the Decay-SHIPS model.  

The hurricane continues to move northwest at 9 kt to the southwest 
of a subtropical ridge. The forecast track confidence has remained 
high over the past few days. Larry should continue its northwestward 
motion through Wednesday, and then reach the western periphery of 
the ridge in a few days, causing the cyclone to begin a turn to the 
north, then northeast late this week. This track would bring Larry 
on its closest approach to Bermuda on Thursday. After turning 
northeast, the cyclone should accelerate into the mid-latitude 
westerlies. The latest NHC forecast is little changed from the 
previous one, and remains near the middle of tightly clustered track 
guidance.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Larry are affecting the Lesser Antilles
and will spread to portions of the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas,
and Bermuda today through Tuesday.  Significant swells should reach
the east coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada by midweek
and continue affecting these shores through the end of the week.
These swells will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions, and beachgoers and other interests along these coasts
are urged to follow the guidance of lifeguards and local officials
this week.
 
2. Larry is forecast to approach Bermuda during the next few days as
a large and powerful hurricane, bringing a risk of strong winds,
heavy rainfall, and coastal flooding to the island by the middle of
this week.  While it is too soon to determine the magnitude of these
hazards and potential impacts on Bermuda, interests there should
closely monitor the latest forecast updates during the next several
days.
