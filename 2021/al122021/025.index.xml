Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Mon Sep 6 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Larry, located over the central Atlantic about 650 miles <br/>
east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands. <br/>
<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the northern portion of <br/>
the Yucatan Peninsula and south-central Gulf of Mexico are <br/>
associated with a surface trough and an upper-level disturbance.  <br/>
The system is forecast to move slowly northward or northeastward <br/>
over the central and then northeastern Gulf of Mexico, likely <br/>
reaching the northern Gulf coast in a few days. Although upper-level <br/>
winds are currently unfavorable for development to occur, they are <br/>
expected to become marginally conducive for tropical cyclone <br/>
formation in a couple of days. The disturbance is then expected to <br/>
cross the southeastern United States beginning midweek, and some <br/>
development will be possible once it emerges over the Atlantic <br/>
waters late this week. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

...NOAA AIRCRAFT FINDS LARRY SLIGHTLY STRONGER...
...EXPECTED TO CAUSE DANGEROUS SURF AND RIP CURRENTS
ALONG WESTERN ATLANTIC SHORES LATER THIS WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...22.5N 53.9W
ABOUT 665 MI...1070 KM ENE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 950 MI...1530 KM SE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...125 MPH...205 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...956 MB...28.23 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Larry was located
near latitude 22.5 North, longitude 53.9 West. Larry is moving
toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this general motion
is expected to continue through Wednesday, followed by a turn
toward the north-northwest and north on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Larry is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are possible
during the next couple of days.  Thereafter, some gradual weakening
is forecast.
 
Larry remains a large hurricane. Hurricane-force winds extend 
outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 956 mb (28.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the Lesser
Antilles, portions of the Greater Antilles, and the Bahamas through
Tuesday, and Bermuda through late this week. Significant swells
should reach the east coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada
by midweek and continue affecting these shores through the end of
the week.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Larry Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122021
500 PM AST Mon Sep 06 2021
 
NOAA aircraft have been investigating Larry for much of this 
afternoon, providing valuable information regarding the structure 
and intensity of the hurricane. Peak 700-mb flight-level winds of 
110 kt with SFMR winds of 101 kt were measured in the northwestern 
eyewall a couple of hours ago, supporting an intensity of about 100 
kt in that portion of the cyclone. During that pass through the 
hurricane, the aircraft tail Doppler radar measured winds of 121 kt 
at a height of 3 km in the northeastern eyewall, which equate to 
about 109 kt at the surface. Therefore, the initial intensity has 
been adjusted up to 110 kt for this advisory. A pair of dropsondes 
into the eye of Larry measured a minimum central pressure of 956 mb. 
Both the aircraft and earlier ASCAT data indicated that 
hurricane-force winds extend up to 60 n mi from the center, while 
tropical-storm-force winds extend up to 160 n mi from the center.   
 
Larry is maintaining its stable, annular structure with a very 
large, mostly clear eye. The environment surrounding Larry is not 
forecast to change much over the next couple of days, so only some 
minor fluctuations in intensity are anticipated during that time. By 
72 hours, decreasing sea-surface temperatures and an increase in 
vertical wind shear should cause the hurricane to begin weakening. 
The only change to the NHC intensity forecast was a 5-kt increase 
through the first few days to accommodate the adjustment required to 
the initial intensity. By the end of the forecast period, Larry is 
expected to transition to a powerful extratropical cyclone. The 
latest NHC forecast remains on the high end of the guidance, closest 
to the Decay-SHIPS model.  

The hurricane continues to move northwest at 9 kt to the southwest 
of a subtropical ridge. The forecast track confidence has remained 
high over the past few days. Larry should continue its northwestward 
motion through Wednesday, and then reach the western periphery of 
the ridge in a few days, causing the cyclone to begin a turn to the 
north, then northeast late this week. This track would bring Larry 
on its closest approach to Bermuda on Thursday. After turning 
northeast, the cyclone should accelerate into the mid-latitude 
westerlies. The latest NHC forecast is little changed from the 
previous one, and remains near the middle of tightly clustered track 
guidance.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Larry are affecting the Lesser Antilles
and will spread to portions of the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas,
and Bermuda today through Tuesday.  Significant swells should reach
the east coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada by midweek
and continue affecting these shores through the end of the week.
These swells will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions, and beachgoers and other interests along these coasts
are urged to follow the guidance of lifeguards and local officials
this week.
 
2. Larry is forecast to approach Bermuda during the next few days as
a large and powerful hurricane, bringing a risk of strong winds,
heavy rainfall, and coastal flooding to the island by the middle of
this week.  While it is too soon to determine the magnitude of these
hazards and potential impacts on Bermuda, interests there should
closely monitor the latest forecast updates during the next several
days.
