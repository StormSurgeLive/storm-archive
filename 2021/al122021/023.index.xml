Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Mon Sep 6 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Larry, located over the central Atlantic about 800 miles <br/>
east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands. <br/>
<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the northern portion of <br/>
the Yucatan Peninsula and south-central Gulf of Mexico are <br/>
associated with a surface trough and an upper-level disturbance.  <br/>
The system is forecast to move slowly northward or northeastward <br/>
over the central and then northeastern Gulf of Mexico, likely <br/>
reaching the northern Gulf coast in a few days. Although upper-level <br/>
winds are currently unfavorable for development to occur, they are <br/>
expected to become marginally conducive for tropical cyclone <br/>
formation in a couple of days. The disturbance is then expected to <br/>
cross the southeastern United States beginning midweek, and some <br/>
development will be possible once it emerges over the Atlantic <br/>
waters late this week. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

...LARGE LARRY STILL A MAJOR HURRICANE...
...DANGEROUS SURF AND RIP CURRENTS EXPECTED ALONG WESTERN ATLANTIC
SHORES LATER THIS WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.5N 52.4W
ABOUT 730 MI...1175 KM ENE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 1065 MI...1715 KM SE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...120 MPH...195 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...956 MB...28.23 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Larry was located 
near latitude 21.5 North, longitude 52.4 West.  Larry is moving 
toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general motion 
with a slight decrease in forward speed is expected over the next 
couple of days.  A slightly faster northwestward motion is forecast 
by early Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Larry is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are possible
during the next couple of days.  Thereafter, some gradual weakening
is forecast.
 
Larry is a large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend outward
up to 70 miles (110 km) from the center, and tropical-storm-force
winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 956 mb (28.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Larry are affecting the Lesser Antilles
and are expected to spread westward to portions of the Greater
Antilles, the Bahamas, and Bermuda today through Tuesday.
Significant swells should reach the east coast of the United States
and Atlantic Canada by midweek and continue affecting these shores
through the end of the week.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Larry Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122021
1100 PM AST Sun Sep 05 2021
 
A series of afternoon and evening passive microwave imagery indicate 
that Larry has evolved from an earlier stable eyewall structure to 
one with concentric eyewalls. The most recent microwave pass, a 2201 
UTC SSMIS overpass, showed that Larry is likely in the latter stages 
of this most recent eyewall replacement cycle (ERC), with a new 
outer eyewall radius of nearly 50 nautical miles. However, 
geostationary satellite imagery still shows quite a bit of inner 
eyewall convection and it may take a while longer before this ERC is 
complete. A recent ASCAT-A pass at 2339 UTC also indicated that 
Larry's inner-core wind field had expanded further, likely related 
to this recent ERC. The latest Dvorak intensity estimates from 
TAFB/SAB remain unchanged from this afternoon, and the initial 
intensity remains 110 kt this advisory. A NOAA P-3 aircraft will be 
conducting a research mission into the Larry tomorrow and should 
provide some helpful in-situ measurements to verify the hurricane's 
intensity.

Larry's motion to the northwest continues to gradually slow down, 
with the latest estimated motion at 310/10 kt. The forecast track 
reasoning remains the same. Larry should maintain its northwestward 
heading for the next 2-3 days as it remains steered around the 
southern periphery of a mid-level ridge to the hurricane's 
northeast. After 72 hours, Larry will be reaching the western extent 
of this ridge while an amplifying mid-latitude trough will be 
approaching from the northeastern United States. The combination of 
these features should help Larry recurve, first to the north, and 
then northeast with accelerating forward motion by the end of the 
forecast period. The track guidance continues to be in excellent 
agreement, and very few changes were made to the track forecast this 
cycle, staying close to the consensus aids HCCA and TVCA. 
 
The intensity forecast with Larry is somewhat tricky. Larry's wind 
field continues to grow, following the multiple ERCs that have 
occurred over the past few days. At the same time, Larry's forward 
motion has gradually been slowing down, with the latest estimate 
down to 10 kts. The combination of Larry's widening wind field with 
its slower forward motion opens the storm up to possible upwelling 
of cooler ocean waters near its inner-core. In fact, a drifting buoy 
that Larry moved over in the past 24 hours showed a significant drop 
in sea-surface temperatures from 27.5 C to less than 26 C. These 
in-situ measurements are helpful, because they are lower than the 
SHIPS-derived sea-surface temperature values and more consistent 
with the upwelling recently forecast by the HWRF model. Adding to 
the forecast complexity is the ongoing ERC which could be ending 
over the next 6-12 hours. The latest NHC intensity forecast is 
similar to the previous one for the first 24 hours, showing little 
change in intensity after ERC completion. Thereafter, while 
dynamical conditions near Larry are expected to become more 
favorable (lower vertical wind shear), the anticipated upwelling 
from Larry's large wind field as the storm moves slowly 
northwestward is forecast to result in gradual decay. The latest NHC 
intensity forecast is a bit lower than the previous one after 
48 hours, following the latest HCCA consensus aid closely. However, 
Larry's wind field is also forecast to expand over this time period, 
making the cyclone a prolific swell and surf producer.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Larry are already affecting the Lesser 
Antilles and will spread to portions of the Greater Antilles, the 
Bahamas, and Bermuda on Monday and Tuesday.  Significant swells 
should reach the east coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada 
by midweek.  These swells will likely cause life-threatening surf 
and rip current conditions, and beachgoers and other interests along 
these coasts are urged to follow the advice of lifeguards and local 
officials this week.
 
2. Larry is forecast to approach Bermuda during the next several 
days as a large and powerful hurricane, bringing a risk of strong 
winds, heavy rainfall, and coastal flooding to the island by the 
middle of this week.  While it is too soon to determine the 
magnitude of these hazards and potential impacts on Bermuda, 
interests there should closely monitor the latest forecast updates 
during the next several days.
