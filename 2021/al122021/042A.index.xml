Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Fri Sep 10 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Larry, located over the western Atlantic several hundred miles <br/>
southwest of Newfoundland, Canada. <br/>
<br/>
The northern part of a tropical wave is interacting with a surface <br/>
trough over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. The merger of these <br/>
features is producing a large but disorganized area of showers and <br/>
thunderstorms over the western Caribbean Sea, Central America, the <br/>
Yucatan peninsula, and Gulf of Mexico. Environmental conditions are <br/>
expected to be conducive for gradual development over the weekend, <br/>
and a tropical depression is likely to form on Sunday or Monday <br/>
before the system moves near or onshore of the western Gulf of <br/>
Mexico coast.  Regardless of development, this disturbance is <br/>
expected to produce heavy rain across portions of Central America <br/>
and the Yucatan Peninsula through Saturday which may lead to flash <br/>
flooding and mudslides. By late this weekend, heavy rain will likely <br/>
reach portions of the western Gulf coast, including coastal Texas <br/>
and Louisiana through the middle of next week. Localized significant <br/>
rainfall amounts will be possible, resulting in limited flash and <br/>
urban flooding.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A strong tropical wave located just off the west coast of Africa is <br/>
producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental <br/>
conditions appear generally conducive for additional development <br/>
and a tropical depression is likely to form late this weekend or <br/>
early next week as the system moves west-northwestward over the far <br/>
eastern Atlantic near the Cabo Verde Islands.  Interests in the Cabo <br/>
Verde Islands should monitor the progress of this system. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Larry was located
near latitude 48.7 North, longitude 53.2 West. Larry is moving
toward the north-northeast near 47 mph (76 km/h).  A very rapid

be moving quickly away from Newfoundland during the next several 
hours.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast today, and Larry is 
expected to become a strong extratropical low later this morning 
before it merges with another low over the Labrador Sea on Sunday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 255
miles (405 km).  St. John's International Airport, Newfoundland, 
recently reported sustained winds of 60 mph (96 km/h) and a wind 
gust of 90 mph (144 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 963 mb (28.44 inches)

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Larry can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC

rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local 
weather office.

<title>Hurricane Larry Forecast Discussion Number 42</title>

Hurricane Larry Discussion Number  42
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122021
1100 PM AST Fri Sep 10 2021

Satellite imagery and data from Canadian radars indicate that Larry 
is maintaining good central convective banding in the northeastern 
semicircle, and based on this it is still a tropical cyclone at 
this time. The maximum intensity is held at 70 kt based mainly on 
recently-received scattterometer data showing 64-67 kt winds to the 
east and southeast of the center.  Surface observations indicate 
that tropical storm conditions are spreading into southeastern 
Newfoundland, and hurricane condition should move onshore during 
the next few hours as the center makes landfall.

After landfall, Larry is expected to quickly lose its tropical 
cyclone characteristics and become a strong extratropical low over 
the Labrador Sea.  The cyclone is forecast to dissipate after 24 h 
as it merges with a developing mid-latitude low currently to its 
northwest.  

Larry is moving rapidly toward the north-northeast with an initial 
motion of 030/41.  This general motion should continue until Larry 
merges with the other low pressure area.  The new official forecast 
track is little changed from the previous track and is in the 
middle of the tightly clustered guidance models.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Larry will move over portions of southeastern Newfoundland 
during the next several hours as it undergoes transition to a
hurricane-force post-tropical cyclone.  Hurricane conditions, a
dangerous storm surge, and heavy rainfall are expected in portions
of southeastern Newfoundland where a Hurricane Warning in effect.
 
2. Large swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the
Bahamas, Bermuda, and the east coast of the United States and
Atlantic Canada through Saturday night. These swells will cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and beachgoers
and other interests along these coasts are urged to follow the
guidance of lifeguards and local officials.
