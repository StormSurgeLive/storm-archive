Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Wed Sep 8 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Larry, located over the central Atlantic several hundred miles <br/>
southeast of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Disorganized cloudiness and a few thunderstorms over the central <br/>
and eastern Gulf of Mexico are associated with a surface trough <br/>
and an upper-level disturbance.  The system is expected to move <br/>
northeastward over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico later today.<br/>
Upper-level winds could become slightly more favorable to support <br/>
some tropical or subtropical development as the system nears the <br/>
northern Gulf coast tonight or early Thursday.  The disturbance is <br/>
then expected to cross the southeastern United States, and some <br/>
additional development will be possible after it emerges off the <br/>
southeastern United States coast late this week.  Regardless of <br/>
development, areas of heavy rainfall will be possible across <br/>
portions of the Florida panhandle and southern Georgia through <br/>
Thursday, with localized flooding possible.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to emerge off of the western coast of <br/>
Africa in a few days.  Some development of this system is possible <br/>
thereafter as it moves west-northwestward over the far eastern <br/>
Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests in southeastern Newfoundland should monitor the progress
of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Larry was located
near latitude 27.7 North, longitude 58.3 West. Larry is moving
toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this general motion 
is expected to continue through today.  A turn toward the 
north-northwest and north with an increase in forward speed is 
forecast on Thursday, with a faster northeastward motion expected 
by Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of Larry should pass 
east of Bermuda on Thursday, and move near or over southeastern 
Newfoundland late Friday.
  
Maximum sustained winds are near 110 mph (175 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next few days, but 
Larry is expected to remain a hurricane during that time.
 
Larry is a large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend outward 
up to 70 miles (110 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force 
winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 966 mb (28.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Larry can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC 
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?key_messages
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
tonight or early Thursday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the Leeward
Islands, portions of the Greater Antilles, and the Bahamas through
midweek, and impact Bermuda through the end of the week. 
Significant swells from Larry will begin reaching the east coast of
the United States and Atlantic Canada today and continue affecting
these shores through the end of the week.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Outer rain bands from Hurricane Larry may periodically
impact Bermuda tonight into Thursday.  Significant rainfall totals
are currently not expected, however briefly heavy rain rates within
these bands may result in an inch or two of rain through Thursday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Larry Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122021
1100 AM AST Wed Sep 08 2021
 
Larry's eye has been only faintly apparent on recent satellite 
imagery, but the hurricane is still maintaining a fair amount of 
deep convection near/around the center.  An Air Force Reserve Unit 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated Larry a little while ago and 
observations found that the central pressure has risen only slightly 
since yesterday, with peak flight level winds of 118 kt in the 
northeastern quadrant.  However, the highest SFMR-observed surface 
winds were only 75 kt, indicating that the strong winds aloft are 
not very effectively being transported to the surface.  Given this, 
along with the slightly-degraded appearance of the system, the 
current intensity is reduced to 95 kt, which is just a bit above the 
latest subjective and objective Dvorak estimates.
 
The hurricane is moving northwestward at a slightly faster clip, or
320/11 kt.  Over the next 36 to 48 hours, Larry is expected to move
around the western periphery of a subtropical high pressure area
and pass to the east of Bermuda.  Thereafter, the cyclone should
accelerate northeastward ahead of a deep-layer trough moving through
the northeastern United States and become embedded within the
mid-latitude southwesterly flow.  This will take Larry near or over
southeastern Newfoundland in 60-66 hours and then over the far
North Atlantic.  The official forecast track has not changed
significantly from those in the previous few advisories, and
remains close to the dynamical model consensus, TVCA.
 
Larry should remain in an environment of low vertical shear and 
warm surface waters for the next 36-48 hours.  However, the oceanic 
heat content beneath the hurricane should be gradually decreasing 
during the next few days.  Only slow weakening is forecast, similar 
to the latest NOAA corrected consensus, HCCA, prediction.  In about 
72 hours, the global models indicate that Larry will become 
embedded within a frontal zone, so the NHC forecast shows it as an 
extratropical cyclone by that time.  In 5 days or less, the system 
is expected to merge with another large cyclone at high latitudes.

Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the
Leeward Islands, portions of the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas and 
Bermuda.  Significant swells will begin to reach the east coast of
the United States and Atlantic Canada later today and continue
affecting these shores through the end of the week.  These swells
will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,
and beachgoers and other interests along these coasts are urged to
follow the guidance of lifeguards and local officials this week.
 
2. The center of Larry is forecast to pass east of Bermuda on
Thursday, but given Larry's large size, tropical storm conditions
are expected there there Thursday, along with a risk of coastal 
flooding.  A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Bermuda, and 
interests there should closely monitor the latest forecast updates.
 
3. Larry is forecast to move near or over portions of southeastern 
Newfoundland late Friday and Friday night as it undergoes transition 
to a hurricane-force post-tropical cyclone. There is an increasing 
risk of impacts from high winds, rainfall, and storm surge in 
portions of Newfoundland, and interests there should monitor updates 
to the forecast.
