Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Sun Sep 5 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Larry, located over the central tropical Atlantic about 900 miles <br/>
east of the Leeward Islands. <br/>
<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms over portions of Central <br/>
America and the Yucatan Peninsula are associated with a surface <br/>
trough and an upper-level disturbance.  Locally heavy rains are <br/>
likely to continue today over that area.  The system is forecast to <br/>
move northwestward over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico later today, <br/>
then move slowly northward or northeastward over the western or <br/>
central Gulf of Mexico.  Upper-level winds are only expected to be <br/>
marginally conducive for tropical cyclone formation, but some slow <br/>
development is possible while the system moves across the Gulf of <br/>
Mexico through the middle of the week. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

500 AM AST Sun Sep 05 2021
 
...DANGEROUS SURF AND RIP CURRENTS EXPECTED ALONG MANY WESTERN
ATLANTIC SHORES LATER THIS WEEK DUE TO LARGE SWELLS FROM LARRY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.8N 49.0W
ABOUT 925 MI...1485 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 1350 MI...2175 KM SE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...120 MPH...195 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...958 MB...28.29 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Larry was located
near latitude 18.8 North, longitude 49.0 West. Larry is moving
toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A northwestward motion 
with a slight decrease in forward speed is expected during the next 
few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Larry is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in strength is forecast during 
the next few days, although fluctuations in intensity will be 
possible.  Larry is expected to remain a major hurricane through the 
middle of this week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles
(260 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 958 mb (28.29 inches).  A 
drifting buoy near the center of Larry recently measured a pressure 
of 962.9 mb (28.43 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Larry are expected to reach the Lesser 
Antilles today, and will spread westward to portions of the Greater 
Antilles, the Bahamas, and Bermuda on Monday and Tuesday. 
Significant swells will likely reach the east coast of the United 
States and Atlantic Canada by midweek.  These swells are likely to 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Hurricane Larry Forecast Discussion Number 18</title>

Hurricane Larry Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122021
1100 PM AST Sat Sep 04 2021
 
Larry has developed a large eye this evening that is 40-45 n mi in 
diameter, and the surrounding cloud tops have warmed somewhat.  
There have been no microwave passes over the hurricane for quite 
some time to assess its structure, but conventional satellite images 
suggest that Larry has taken on some annular characteristics (and 
the objective screening algorithm tagged it as marginally annular). 
Dvorak CI numbers and objective estimates are all between 100-102 
kt, so Larry's initial intensity is lowered slightly to 105 kt.  
 
Larry's motion remains west-northwestward (300 degrees) at 12 kt.  
The hurricane is expected to turn northwestward tonight or early 
Sunday around the southwestern periphery of a mid-level high 
centered over the central Atlantic, and then maintain that heading 
with some decrease in forward speed through day 4.  By day 5, Larry 
should turn northward and accelerate between the high and an 
approaching deep-layer trough over the eastern United States.  The 
updated NHC track forecast is largely unchanged from the previous 
advisory and is of high confidence since there is lower-than-normal 
spread among the track models.  Larry is forecast to make its 
closest approach to Bermuda in 4 to 5 days while it recurves around 
the ridge, but despite the high-confidence forecast, there is still 
uncertainty on how close that approach will be since several GEFS 
and ECMWF ensemble members bring Larry's center very close to or 
over the island.  Even with a track east of the island, Larry will 
be large enough to possibly cause some impacts on Bermuda.

Water vapor imagery shows some restriction to the outflow in the 
southwestern quadrant, which could be indicative of some shear.  
There continues to be some discrepancy among the models on how much 
shear the hurricane will contend with as it approaches a 
mid-/upper-level trough located north of the Leeward Islands.  The 
GFS keeps the shear over Larry fairly low since it's farther from 
the trough, while the ECMWF increases the shear to moderate or 
strong levels during the next 48 hours.  If Larry reaches the area 
of stronger shear, its intensity would obviously be adversely 
affected.  In terms of structure, significant re-intensification is 
now less likely since Larry has such a large eye and an expanding 
wind field.  On the positive side, the hurricane will be moving 
over gradually warmer waters for the next 3 days or so.  Given 
these conflicting factors, the updated NHC intensity forecast allows 
for some slight restrengthening in the short term but then keeps 
Larry's intensity steady for the next 3 days.  Many of the intensity 
models are even lower than what's shown in this forecast, so 
additional adjustments may be required in future advisories.    

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Larry are expected to first reach the
Lesser Antilles on Sunday and will spread to portions of the Greater
Antilles, the Bahamas, and Bermuda Monday and Tuesday.  Significant
swells will likely reach the east coast of the United States and
Atlantic Canada around midweek.  These swells will likely cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and beachgoers
and other interests along these coasts are urged to follow the
advice of lifeguards and local officials through the upcoming week.
 
2. Larry is forecast to approach Bermuda during the next several
days, possibly as a major hurricane, bringing a risk of strong
winds, heavy rainfall, and coastal flooding to the island by the
middle of next week.  While it is too soon to determine the
magnitude of these hazards and potential impacts on Bermuda,
interests there should monitor changes to the forecast during the
next several days.
