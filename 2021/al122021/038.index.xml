Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Thu Sep 9 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Larry, located over the western Atlantic a few hundred miles <br/>
northeast of Bermuda, and on Tropical Depression Mindy, located <br/>
offshore the southeast coast of the United States. <br/>
<br/>
The northern portion of a tropical wave is producing disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms over northeastern Honduras and the western <br/>
Caribbean Sea.  This system is forecast to move into the Bay of <br/>
Campeche and merge with a pre-existing surface trough located over <br/>
the southwestern Gulf of Mexico by this weekend.  Environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to be conducive to support some gradual <br/>
development, and a tropical depression could form by early next week <br/>
before the system moves inland over mainland Mexico. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A strong tropical wave is expected to emerge off of the west coast <br/>
of Africa in the next day or so.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to be conducive for development thereafter, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form by early next week as the system moves <br/>
west-northwestward over the far eastern Atlantic near the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Southeastern Newfoundland from Arnold's Cove to Jones Harbour
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Southeastern Newfoundland from Lamaline to west of Arnold's Cove
* Southeastern Newfoundland from north of Jones Harbor to Bonavista
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued 36
hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests elsewhere in southeastern Newfoundland should monitor the
progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Larry was located 
near latitude 35.5 North, longitude 62.3 West. Larry is moving 
toward the north near 25 mph (41 km/h). A further increase in 
forward speed is expected tonight with a turn to the northeast 
forecast by Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of Larry will 
continue to move away from Bermuda tonight, and move near or over 
southeastern Newfoundland Friday night or early Saturday morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast to begin on Friday, but Larry
is expected to remain a hurricane until it passes Newfoundland.
Larry should become an extratropical cyclone on Saturday, and is 
now forecast to be absorbed by a larger extratropical low near 
Greenland by the end of the weekend.
 
Larry remains a large hurricane. Hurricane-force winds extend 
outward up to 90 miles (150 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 966 mb (28.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Larry can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC

Hurricane Larry Discussion Number  37
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122021
500 PM AST Thu Sep 09 2021
 
A faint eye is still discernible on visible satellite images along
with some banding features.  On the Bermuda radar, the eyewall is
partially open over the southern semicircle of the hurricane.
Larry still has a prominent upper-tropospheric outflow pattern,
especially over the northern portion of the circulation.  The
advisory intensity is held at 80 kt, just above the latest
Dvorak Current Intensity Numbers from TAFB and SAB.
 
Larry is now heading a little west of north at an increasing forward 
speed, and the initial motion is 345/17 kt.  The hurricane has been 
moving around the western side of a large deep-layer high pressure 
area centered over the central Atlantic.  By Friday, the system 
should accelerate northeastward ahead of a strong mid-tropospheric 
trough over the northeastern United States, and pass near or over 
southeastern Newfoundland within 36 hours. Thereafter, post-tropical 
cyclone Larry should move over the far North Atlantic.  The official 
track forecast again lies close to the various consensus model 
predictions.
 
The hurricane is expected to remain over warm waters with weak
vertical shear for another 12 to 24 hours.  Thereafter, Larry is
forecast to move over the cooler waters north of the Gulf Stream
and the shear will increase.  These factors should induce
weakening, but possible baroclinic forcing associated with the
trough to the west of the cyclone could result in Larry maintaining
some strength over the next few days.  The NHC intensity forecast
is similar to the latest NOAA corrected-consensus guidance, HCCA.
Global model predictions indicate that Larry will merge with a
front, and therefore become an extratropical cyclone, in 48 hours.
These models also show the system merging with another large
extratropical low over the north Atlantic in 3 to 4 days.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Larry is forecast to move near or over portions of southeastern 
Newfoundland Friday night or early Saturday morning as it undergoes 
transition to a hurricane-force post-tropical cyclone.  Hurricane 
conditions and dangerous storm surge are expected in portions of 
southeastern Newfoundland where a Hurricane Warning in effect. 
 
2. Large swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the 
Leeward Islands, portions of the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, 
Bermuda, and the east coast of the United States and Atlantic
Canada through the end of the week. These swells will cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and beachgoers and 
other interests along these coasts are urged to follow the
guidance of lifeguards and local officials.
 
3. Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda through 
this evening, along with a risk of coastal flooding.

Tropical Depression Mindy Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132021
500 PM EDT Thu Sep 09 2021

The latest infrared satellite imagery indicates that Mindy has been 
devoid of convection near its center since about the time it emerged 
over the Atlantic this morning. Deep convection is present well to 
the northeast of Mindy along a surface trough that extends 
northeastward from the cyclone. A late morning ASCAT pass showed a 
large area of 25 to 30 kt winds southeast of the center. The initial 
intensity is set to 30 kt based on this data. The ASCAT data and 
surface observations indicate that the circulation has become less 
well-defined, with barely any east winds observed on the north 
side. 

Mindy is located in an environment of strong south to southwesterly 
vertical wind shear. Over the next 24 h, the shear is expected to 
become even stronger. The latest forecast calls for Mindy to become 
post-tropical on Friday and dissipate Friday night. However, based 
on the lack on convection and the deteriorating wind structure, it 
is quite possible that dissipation could occur much sooner than 
forecast.

Mindy continues moving quickly off to the east-northeast, with a 
motion of 075/20 kt. There has been no change to the track forecast 
philosophy. Mindy is forecast to continue moving east-northeastward 
at a similar speed for the next 24 h near the southern portion of a 
deep-layer trough moving across the eastern United States.  Once the 
trough begins to lift northeastward, Mindy should slow down a little 
on Friday. The NHC forecast is a little south of and slightly faster 
than the previous forecast, mainly due to the farther south initial 
position.
