Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Fri Sep 10 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Larry, located over the western Atlantic several hundred miles <br/>
southwest of Newfoundland, Canada. <br/>
<br/>
The northern portion of a tropical wave is producing disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms over Honduras, the western Caribbean Sea, <br/>
and portions of the Yucatan peninsula.  This system is forecast to <br/>
move into the Bay of Campeche and merge with a pre-existing surface <br/>
trough located over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico by this weekend. <br/>
Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive to support <br/>
gradual development, and a tropical depression is likely to form <br/>
Sunday or Monday before the system moves onshore along the western <br/>
Gulf of Mexico coast.  Regardless of development, this disturbance <br/>
is expected to produce heavy rains across portions of Central <br/>
America through Saturday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A strong tropical wave is expected to emerge off of the west coast <br/>
of Africa by tonight.  Environmental conditions are forecast to be <br/>
conducive for gradual development thereafter, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form late this weekend or early next week as <br/>
the system moves west-northwestward over the far eastern Atlantic <br/>
near the Cabo Verde Islands.  Interests in the Cabo Verde Islands <br/>
should monitor the progress of this system. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Larry was located 
near latitude 39.2 North, longitude 60.8 West. Larry is moving 
quickly toward the north-northeast near 26 mph (43 km/h). A turn to 
the northeast with an increase in forward speed is expected later 
today.  On the forecast track, the center of Larry will pass well 
southeast of Nova Scotia today, and move over southeastern 
Newfoundland tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next day or so, but
Larry is expected to remain a hurricane until it passes
Newfoundland.  Larry should become an extratropical cyclone on
Saturday, and is now forecast to be absorbed by a larger
extratropical low near Greenland by the end of the weekend.
 
Larry is a large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend
outward up to 90 miles (150 km) from the center and tropical-storm-
force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 968 mb (28.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Larry can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?key_messages
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane warning
area in southeastern Newfoundland tonight, with tropical storm
conditions expected to begin this afternoon or evening.  
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the tropical 
storm warning area in southeastern Newfoundland later today.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
coastal flooding within the warning areas in southeastern
Newfoundland.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the Bahamas 
today.  Significant swells from Larry will continue affecting 
Bermuda, the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada 
through Saturday night. These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Heavy rains from Larry will move quickly across eastern
Newfoundland tonight, producing 1 to 2 inches of rain.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Larry Discussion Number  39
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122021
500 AM AST Fri Sep 10 2021
 
Larry's satellite presentation has remained largely unchanged
overnight. Deep convection continues to persist over and to the
northeast of the center, with a larger outer band around the
eastern portion of the circulation.  Subjective Dvorak intensity
estimates from TAFB and SAB have lowered slightly, and the initial
intensity has been adjusted downward to 75 kt.  This lies between
the lower subjective satellite estimates and the higher UW/CIMSS
ADT and SATCON values.  Larry is forecast to remain over warm
waters and in low vertical wind shear conditions this morning,
therefore little overall change in intensity is expected in the
short term.  The hurricane will cross the north wall of the Gulf
Stream over much cooler SSTs this afternoon, but the increasingly
fast forward speed of the system and baroclinic forcing from a
mid-latitude trough approaching from the west is likely to help
Larry maintain hurricane strength as is passes over southeastern
Newfoundland tonight.  Larry is forecast to become extratropical
shortly thereafter, and some slight weakening should occur before
the post-tropical cyclone is absorbed by a larger extratropical low
near southern Greenland in a couple of days.  The NHC intensity
forecast is similar to the HCCA and IVCN consensus aids and also
follows the trends of the latest global model guidance.
 
Larry has turned north-northeastward or 015/23 kt.  The track
guidance is once again in excellent agreement that Larry should
turn northeastward today and continue to accelerate ahead of
the aforementioned trough.  The center of Larry should pass over
southeastern Newfoundland tonight, but users are reminded to not
focus on the exact details of the track forecast as strong winds,
heavy rainfall, and a dangerous storm surge will extend far from
the center of the cyclone. The updated official forecast lies near 
the center of the track guidance envelope, but is slightly faster 
than the previous forecast during the first 36 hours.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Larry is forecast to move over portions of southeastern
Newfoundland tonight as it undergoes transition to a
hurricane-force post-tropical cyclone.  Hurricane conditions, a
dangerous storm surge, and heavy rainfall are expected in portions
of southeastern Newfoundland where a Hurricane Warning in effect.
 
2. Large swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the
Bahamas, Bermuda, and the east coast of the United States and
Atlantic Canada through Saturday. These swells will cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and beachgoers
and other interests along these coasts are urged to follow the
guidance of lifeguards and local officials.
