Tropical Weather Outlook...Corrected<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Tue Sep 7 2021<br/>
<br/>
Corrected to add rainfall statement<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Larry, located over the central Atlantic several hundred miles <br/>
southwest of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms have increased today over the <br/>
south-central Gulf of Mexico in association with a surface trough <br/>
and an upper-level disturbance.  The system is expected to move <br/>
slowly northeastward over the central and northeastern Gulf of <br/>
Mexico during the next couple of days.  Upper-level winds are <br/>
currently unfavorable for development, but they are forecast to <br/>
become more conducive for some limited tropical or subtropical <br/>
cyclone development as the system nears the northern Gulf coast on <br/>
Wednesday and Wednesday night.  The disturbance is then expected to <br/>
cross the southeastern United States, and some slight additional <br/>
development will be possible after it emerges off the southeastern <br/>
United States coast late this week.  Regardless of development, <br/>
areas of heavy rainfall will be possible across portions of the <br/>
Florida panhandle and southern Georgia on Wednesday and Thursday, <br/>
with localized flooding possible.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Larry was located
near latitude 24.8 North, longitude 55.8 West.  Larry is moving
toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion
is expected to continue through Wednesday.  A turn toward the
north-northwest and north with an increase in forward speed is
forecast on Thursday.  On the forecast track, the center of Larry
should pass east of Bermuda on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next several days.
 
Larry is a large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend outward
up to 70 miles (110 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force
winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 967 mb (28.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Larry can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning
late Wednesday or early Thursday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the Lesser 
Antilles, portions of the Greater Antilles, and the Bahamas through 
midweek, and impact Bermuda through the end of the week. Significant 
swells should reach the east coast of the United States and Atlantic 
Canada by midweek and continue affecting these shores through the 
end of the week.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening 
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your 
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Hurricane Larry Forecast Discussion Number 28</title>

Hurricane Larry Discussion Number  28
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122021
1100 AM AST Tue Sep 07 2021
 
An Air Force Reserve Unit Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated
Larry a little while ago and found that the hurricane has weakened
somewhat.  The central pressure has risen to 967 mb, and the eyewall
is becoming less well defined.  Satellite imagery shows that the eye
is still evident but the deep convection has has decreased in
coverage and intensity.  Using a blend of flight-level and
SFMR-observed surface winds from the aircraft gives a current
intensity estimate of 100 kt, although this may be generous.
 
The hurricane continues to move northwestward, or 315/8 kt.  Larry
is forecast to move around the western periphery of a subtropical
anticyclone during the next couple of days.  By 72 hours, the
system should begin to accelerate northeastward on the eastern side
of a mid-tropospheric trough moving through the northeastern United
States.  Thereafter, Larry should be well-embedded in the
higher-latitude southwesterly flow, pass near Newfoundland and move
into the far North Atlantic as an extratropical cyclone.  The
official track forecast is essentially the same as the previous one
and in very close agreement with the latest NOAA corrected
consensus and Florida State University (FSU) Superensemble tracks.
 
Larry is in a low-shear environment with fairly well-defined
upper-level outflow.  However dry mid-level air and possible
upwelling of cooler waters beneath the slow-moving circulation
appear to be at least partially responsible for weakening.  Since
the environment does not appear to be very hostile for the next
couple of days, only slow weakening is anticipated.  The official
intensity forecast for the next 48-72 hours lies below the
statistical dynamical Decay-SHIPS guidance and above the coupled-
HWRF dynamical model prediction.  By 96 hours, the FSU cyclone
phase analysis indicates that Larry will have undergone an
extratropical transition, and this is also shown in the official
forecast.
 
Larry is expected to pass east of Bermuda on Thursday as a large
hurricane.  Given the expansive size of Larry's wind field and
forecast uncertainties, a Tropical Storm Watch has been issued
for the island.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the
Lesser Antilles, portions of the Greater Antilles, and the Bahamas
through midweek.  Significant swells should reach the east coast of
the United States and Atlantic Canada by midweek and continue
affecting these shores through the end of the week.  These swells
will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,
and beachgoers and other interests along these coasts are urged to
follow the guidance of lifeguards and local officials this week.
 
2. The center of Larry is forecast to pass east of Bermuda on 
Thursday, but given Larry's large size, tropical storm conditions 
are possible there Thursday, along with a risk of heavy rainfall 
and coastal flooding.  A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for 
Bermuda and interests there should closely monitor the latest 
forecast updates.
