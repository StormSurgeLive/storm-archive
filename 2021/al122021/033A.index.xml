DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Larry was located
near latitude 28.9 North, longitude 59.8 West.  Larry is moving
toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and a turn toward the
north-northwest and north with an increase in forward speed is
forecast on Thursday, with a faster northeastward motion expected by
Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of Larry should pass east
of Bermuda on Thursday, and move near or over southeastern
Newfoundland late Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 105 mph (170 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next 
couple of days, but Larry is expected to remain a hurricane during 
that time.
 
Larry remains a large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend 
outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km).
 
The minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft is 968 mb (28.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Larry can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?key_messages
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
tonight or early Thursday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the Leeward
Islands, portions of the Greater Antilles, and the Bahamas through
midweek, and impact Bermuda through the end of the week. Significant
swells from Larry will continue affecting the east coast of the
United States and Atlantic Canada through the end of the week.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Outer rain bands from Hurricane Larry may periodically
impact Bermuda tonight into Thursday.  Significant rainfall totals
are currently not expected, however briefly heavy rain rates within
these bands may result in an inch or two of rain through Thursday.

<title>Hurricane Larry Forecast Discussion Number 33</title>

Hurricane Larry Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122021
500 PM AST Wed Sep 08 2021
 
Larry's overall organization has shown little change on satellite
images this afternoon.  The eye remains rather ill-defined but the
hurricane continues to produce some strong convection near/around
the center.  Cirrus-level outflow remains quite well defined,
particularly to the northwest.  The current intensity estimate is
held at 95 kt, which is only slightly above the latest Dvorak
estimates.  Another Air Force Reserve Unit Hurricane Hunter
aircraft is scheduled to investigate Larry this evening to 
provide a new intensity estimate.
 
The hurricane continues heading a little faster toward the
northwest, or at about 325/13 kt.  The track forecast philosophy
remains about the same as before.  Larry should move around the
western side of a deep-layer subtropical anticyclone over the
central Atlantic for the next 36 to 48 hours, passing east of
Bermuda tomorrow.  After that, the hurricane is expected to
accelerate northeastward on the east side of a deep-layer trough
moving through the eastern United States, and Larry will move near 
or over southeastern Newfoundland in roughly 60 hours.  Then, the 
cyclone is forecast to move over the far north Atlantic.  The 
official forecast is close to the dynamical model consensus 
solution and, again, very similar to the previous NHC track.
 
Based on the dynamical model guidance, weak to moderate vertical
shear should prevail over Larry during the next couple of days.
Sea surface temperatures below the cyclone begin to cool
significantly after 48 hours, which should induce weakening.
However, baroclinic forcing associated with the trough to the west
may help the hurricane maintain some of its intensity over cooler
waters, as suggested by the global models.  The official intensity
forecast follows the model consensus and keeps Larry at hurricane
strength even after extratropical transition.  In 5 days or less,
the system should merge with another large cyclonic circulation over
the north Atlantic.

Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the
Leeward Islands, portions of the Greater Antilles, the 
Bahamas, Bermuda, and the east coast of the United States and 
Atlantic Canada through the end of the week. These swells will 
likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and 
beachgoers and other interests along these coasts are urged to 
follow the guidance of lifeguards and local officials this week.
 
2. The center of Larry is forecast to pass east of Bermuda on
Thursday, but given Larry's large size, tropical storm conditions
are expected there there Thursday, along with a risk of coastal
flooding.  A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Bermuda, and
interests there should closely monitor the latest forecast updates.
 
3. Larry is forecast to move near or over portions of southeastern
Newfoundland late Friday and Friday night as it undergoes transition
to a hurricane-force post-tropical cyclone. There is an increasing
risk of impacts from high winds, rainfall, and storm surge in
portions of Newfoundland, and interests there should monitor updates
to the forecast.

Tropical Storm Mindy Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132021
400 PM CDT Wed Sep 08 2021
 
Through the day, the area of disturbed weather in the northeastern 
Gulf of Mexico has gradually become better organized on 
geostationary satellite and Doppler radar imagery. Earlier, a 1515 
UTC ASCAT-C pass found a number of southwesterly wind retrievals in 
the 30-kt range on the southeast side of the formative circulation. 
The ASCAT-C Ambiguities at that time also hinted that a very small 
closed circulation was trying to develop along the edge of these 
stronger winds. Since that time, a well-defined circulation become 
evident on KEVX Doppler-radar with inbound velocities occasionally 
nearing 40-45 kt to the southeast of the radar center. These 
Doppler-radar winds have been increasing over the past couple of 
hours as the center moves closer to the radar and I am reasonably 
confident this circulation is now surface based. Just in the last 
hour or so, NOAA buoy 42039 reported a peak 1-minute sustained wind 
of 35 kt just southeast of the center, confirming the system now has 
tropical storm force winds. Thus, advisories are being initiated 
on tropical storm Mindy with maximum sustained wind of 35 kt.
 
The most recent estimated motion following the center on radar is to 
the northeast at 050/18 kt. The track guidance is in good agreement 
that this quick motion should continue with a gentle shift to the 
east-northeast in the next 24-36 hours as the system is under the 
influence of a deep-layer mid-latitude trough moving across the 
eastern United States. On the current heading, the center of 
Mindy should move inland over the Florida Panhandle in the next 6-12 
hours and then already be offshore of the southeastern United States 
by 24 hours. A gradual slowdown is expected thereafter as the 
cyclone is left behind by this mid-latitude trough and also becomes 
vertically shallow.
 
Little intensification is expected prior to landfall, with land 
interaction resulting in Mindy weakening back to a depression by 24 
hours. Conditions do not appear favorable for restrengthening off 
the southeastern United States as shear is forecast to increase 
above 30 knots in 24 hours. This shear will likely strip away from 
remaining convection, and both the ECMWF and GFS simulated IR 
brightness temperatures suggest Mindy should become a remnant low in 
the day 2-3 period. This remnant low is forecast to open up into a 
trough shortly thereafter.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Mindy is expected to produce heavy rainfall from the Florida
Panhandle into southern portions of Georgia and South Carolina
through Thursday morning. This rainfall may produce isolated to
scattered flash, urban, and small stream flooding.

2. Tropical storm conditions are expected through tonight in 
portions of the Florida Panhandle where a Tropical Storm Warning is 
in effect.
