Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Sun Sep 5 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Larry, located over the central tropical Atlantic about 900 miles <br/>
east of the northern Leeward Islands. <br/>
<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the Yucatan Peninsula <br/>
and surrounding waters are associated with a surface trough and an <br/>
upper-level disturbance located over the eastern Bay of Campeche.  <br/>
Locally heavy rains are likely to continue through tonight over <br/>
that area.  The system is forecast to move slowly northward or <br/>
northeastward over the central and then northeastern Gulf of Mexico <br/>
over the next few days. Although upper-level winds are currently <br/>
unfavorable for development to occur, they are expected to become <br/>
marginally conducive for tropical cyclone formation by late Tuesday. <br/>
The disturbance is then expected to cross the southeastern United <br/>
States beginning midweek, and some development will be possible <br/>
once it emerges over the Atlantic waters by late this week. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

...LARGE LARRY LUMBERING ACROSS THE OPEN ATLANTIC...
...DANGEROUS SURF AND RIP CURRENTS ALONG WESTERN ATLANTIC SHORES
EXPECTED LATER THIS WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.0N 51.4W
ABOUT 785 MI...1265 KM ENE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 1135 MI...1825 KM SE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...125 MPH...205 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...955 MB...28.20 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Larry was located
near latitude 21.0 North, longitude 51.4 West. Larry is moving
toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this motion is
expected to continue with a slight decrease in forward speed over
the next several days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Larry is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Little change in strength is forecast during
the next day or so, with very gradual weakening thereafter.
 
Larry is a large and expanding hurricane. Hurricane-force winds now
extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from the center and
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 955 mb (28.20 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Larry are reaching the Lesser Antilles
and are expected to spread westward to portions of the Greater
Antilles, the Bahamas, and Bermuda on Monday and Tuesday.
Significant swells should reach the east coast of the United States
and Atlantic Canada by midweek.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

<title>Hurricane Larry Forecast Discussion Number 21</title>

Hurricane Larry Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122021
500 PM AST Sun Sep 05 2021
 
The overall structure of Larry has changed little today. A large eye 
remains surrounded by a cold ring of convection with cloud tops of 
-75 to -80 C. The only notable difference between now and several 
hours ago has been that some cloud cover has become evident within 
the eye. A blend of the latest T- and CI-numbers from TAFB and SAB 
suggest that the initial intensity remains 110 kt. 
 
Larry is moving northwestward, or 315/11 kt, around the 
southwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge. There has been no 
change to the forecast track reasoning, nor has there been any 
notable change to the NHC forecast track from the previous advisory, 
due to the forecast models remaining in excellent agreement. A 
northwestward motion is expected to continue for the next few days 
to the southwest of the ridge. In a few days, the hurricane is 
forecast to reach the western periphery of this ridge, resulting in 
the cyclone beginning gradual recurvature to the north then 
northeast into the mid-latitude westerlies. 

Other than some minor fluctuations in intensity due to internal 
influences, the stable, annular-like structure of Larry should allow 
for it to remain a major hurricane for the next couple of days, 
despite being surrounded by some mid-level dry air. By day 4, the 
cyclone is forecast to move over waters of progressively decreasing 
oceanic heat content, which should induce gradual weakening. The 
latest NHC intensity forecast is little changed from the previous 
one, and is near the corrected consensus HCCA and DSHP, which have 
been two of the best performing models for Larry's intensity thus 
far.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Larry are expected to reach the Lesser 
Antilles today and will spread to portions of the Greater Antilles, 
the Bahamas, and Bermuda on Monday and Tuesday.  Significant swells 
should reach the east coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada 
by midweek.  These swells will likely cause life-threatening surf 
and rip current conditions, and beachgoers and other interests along 
these coasts are urged to follow the advice of lifeguards and local 
officials this week.
 
2. Larry is forecast to approach Bermuda during the next several 
days, likely as a major hurricane, bringing a risk of strong winds, 
heavy rainfall, and coastal flooding to the island by the middle of 
this week.  While it is too soon to determine the magnitude of these 
hazards and potential impacts on Bermuda, interests there should 
closely monitor the latest forecast updates during the next several 
days.
