Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Tue Sep 7 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Larry, located over the central Atlantic several hundred miles <br/>
southeast of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms have increased somewhat this evening over <br/>
the south-central Gulf of Mexico in association with a surface <br/>
trough and an upper-level disturbance.  The system is expected to <br/>
move slowly northeastward over the central and northeastern Gulf of <br/>
Mexico during the next couple of days.  Upper-level winds are <br/>
currently only marginally conducive for development, but they are <br/>
forecast to become slightly more favorable by late Wednesday, and a <br/>
tropical or subtropical depression could form as the system nears <br/>
the northern Gulf coast Wednesday night or Thursday.  The <br/>
disturbance is then expected to cross the southeastern United <br/>
States, and some slight additional development will be possible <br/>
after it emerges off the southeastern United States coast late this <br/>
week.  Regardless of development, areas of heavy rainfall will be <br/>
possible across portions of the Florida panhandle and southern <br/>
Georgia on Wednesday and Thursday, with localized flooding possible.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of the large eye of Hurricane 
Larry was located  by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft
near latitude 25.4 North, longitude 56.5 West. Larry is moving
toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion
is expected to continue through Wednesday.  A turn toward the
north-northwest and north with an increase in forward speed is
forecast on Thursday.  On the forecast track, the center of Larry
should pass east of Bermuda on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Larry is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Slow weakening is forecast during the next
several days.
 
Larry is a large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend outward
up to 70 miles (110 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force
winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 965 mb (28.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Larry can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning
late Wednesday or early Thursday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the Lesser
Antilles, portions of the Greater Antilles, and the Bahamas through
midweek, and impact Bermuda through the end of the week. Significant
swells should reach the east coast of the United States and Atlantic
Canada by midweek and continue affecting these shores through the
end of the week.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Larry Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122021
500 PM AST Tue Sep 07 2021
 
After becoming rather ragged-looking in earlier satellite images,
Larry's eye has become a little better defined recently, and the
surrounding deep convection is more or less maintaining its
strength.  Observations from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft show
that the central pressure has fallen slightly, to 965 mb.  Peak
flight-level winds from the aircraft were 110 kt so the advisory
intensity is kept at 100 kt.  This is also consistent with a Dvorak 
Current Intensity number from TAFB.
 
Larry continues its northwestward motion at about 320/8 kt.  The
hurricane should move around the western side of a deep-layer
subtropical anticyclone during the next 48-60 hours.  After passing
Bermuda, the system is likely to accelerate northeastward while
moving into the mid-latitude westerlies ahead of a trough moving
from the northeastern United States to Atlantic Canada, and move
into the far north Atlantic by day 5.  The official track forecast
stays close to the previous NHC prediction, and remains in good
agreement the various model consensus solutions.

The hurricane continues to exhibit well-defined upper-level outflow, 
indicative of weak vertical shear.  Over the next couple of days, 
Larry will be traversing waters of gradually decreasing oceanic heat 
content.  This, combined with some dry mid-level air in the 
environment, should lead to a gradual decrease in intensity through 
48-60 hours.  Later in the forecast period, colder waters and strong 
shear should cause more rapid weakening.  By day 4, the global 
models show Larry merging with a frontal zone.  Therefore, the NHC 
forecast calls for extratropical transition by that time.  The 
official intensity forecast is generally below the 
statistical-dynamical guidance and above the coupled dynamical 
hurricane models through 72 hours, but in good agreement with the 
model consensus aids.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the
Lesser Antilles, portions of the Greater Antilles, and the Bahamas
through midweek.  Significant swells should reach the east coast of
the United States and Atlantic Canada by midweek and continue
affecting these shores through the end of the week.  These swells
will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,
and beachgoers and other interests along these coasts are urged to
follow the guidance of lifeguards and local officials this week.
 
2. The center of Larry is forecast to pass east of Bermuda on
Thursday, but given Larry's large size, tropical storm conditions
are possible there Thursday, along with a risk of heavy rainfall
and coastal flooding.  A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for
Bermuda and interests there should closely monitor the latest
forecast updates.

3. Larry is forecast to move near or over portions of southeastern 
Newfoundland late Friday and Friday night as it transitions to a 
hurricane-force post-tropical cyclone. There is a risk of impacts 
from high winds, rainfall, and storm surge in portions of 
Newfoundland, and interests there should monitor the progress of 
Larry and updates to the forecast.
