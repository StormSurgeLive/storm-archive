Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Sun Sep 5 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Larry, located over the central tropical Atlantic about 900 miles <br/>
east of the northern Leeward Islands. <br/>
<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the Yucatan Peninsula <br/>
and surrounding waters are associated with a surface trough and an <br/>
upper-level disturbance.  Locally heavy rains are likely to continue <br/>
today over that area.  The system is forecast to move slowly <br/>
northward or northeastward over the central and then northeastern <br/>
Gulf of Mexico over the next few days, when upper-level winds are <br/>
only expected to be marginally conducive for tropical cyclone <br/>
formation.  The disturbance is then expected to cross the  <br/>
southeastern United States beginning midweek, and some development <br/>
is possible once it emerges over the Atlantic waters by late this <br/>
week. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

1100 AM AST Sun Sep 05 2021
 
...LARRY EXPECTED TO CAUSE DANGEROUS SURF AND RIP CURRENTS ALONG THE
WESTERN ATLANTIC SHORES LATER THIS WEEK...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.5N 49.7W
ABOUT 880 MI...1415 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 1285 MI...2070 KM SE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...125 MPH...205 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...955 MB...28.20 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Larry was located
near latitude 19.5 North, longitude 49.7 West. Larry is moving
toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A northwestward motion
with a slight decrease in forward speed is expected during the next
few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Larry is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in strength is forecast during
the next few days, although fluctuations in intensity will be
possible.  Larry is expected to remain a major hurricane through the
middle of this week.
 
Larry is a large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend outward
up to 45 miles (75 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force
winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 955 mb (28.20 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Larry are expected to reach the Lesser
Antilles today, and will spread westward to portions of the Greater
Antilles, the Bahamas, and Bermuda on Monday and Tuesday.
Significant swells will likely reach the east coast of the United
States and Atlantic Canada by midweek.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Larry Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122021
1100 AM AST Sun Sep 05 2021
 
Larry continues as a large and intense hurricane this morning, with 
a 40 n mi diameter eye surround by cloud tops to near -80 deg C. 
There are, however, some breaks in the cold tops over the northern 
portion of the circulation.  The current intensity is adjusted 
slightly to 110 kt, based on a blend of subjective Dvorak estimates 
from TAFB and SAB along with objective ADT estimates from UW-CIMSS. 
Upper-level outflow remains somewhat restricted over the 
southwestern quadrant of the system, indicative of at least slight 
vertical shear.  This shear is probably being caused by the flow to 
the east of an upper-level low to the north of Puerto Rico. The low 
is forecast to move northwestward over the next few days, possibly 
lessening the shear over Larry.
 
The hurricane is moving northwestward at a slightly slower speed, or 
310/11 kt.  Larry is likely to continue its northwestward trek 
along the southwestern periphery of a mid-tropospheric anticyclone 
during the next 2-3 days, with only a slight reduction in forward 
speed.  Around 96 hours, the hurricane is forecast to turn toward 
the north-northwest and north while rounding the western side of 
the ridge.  By the end of the forecast period, Larry is expected to 
begin its recurvature into the mid-latitude westerlies.  The new 
official forecast track essentially follows the previous one, and is 
also very close to the latest NOAA corrected consensus and Florida 
State University Superensemble guidance.
 
Larry's large eye suggests that no rapid changes in strength are
likely during the short term.  Since vertical shear is not expected 
to increase and the system will be traversing warm waters, the 
hurricane should be able to more or less maintain its intensity 
during the next few days.  One inhibiting factor is the presence of 
relatively dry mid-level air in the environment.  The official 
intensity forecast is on the high side of the model guidance and 
keeps Larry as a major hurricane through 72 hours.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Larry are expected to reach the Lesser
Antilles today and will spread to portions of the Greater Antilles,
the Bahamas, and Bermuda on Monday and Tuesday.  Significant swells
will likely reach the east coast of the United States and Atlantic
Canada by midweek.  These swells will likely cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions, and beachgoers and other interests
along these coasts are urged to follow the advice of lifeguards and
local officials this week.
 
2. Larry is forecast to approach Bermuda during the next several
days, likely as a major hurricane, bringing a risk of strong
winds, heavy rainfall, and coastal flooding to the island by the
middle of this week.  While it is too soon to determine the
magnitude of these hazards and potential impacts on Bermuda,
interests there should closely monitor the latest forecast updates
during the next several days.
