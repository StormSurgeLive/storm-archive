Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Sun Sep 5 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Larry, located over the central tropical Atlantic about 900 miles <br/>
east of the northern Leeward Islands. <br/>
<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms over portions of Central <br/>
America and the Yucatan Peninsula are associated with a surface <br/>
trough and an upper-level disturbance.  Locally heavy rains are <br/>
likely to continue today over that area.  The system is forecast to <br/>
move northwestward over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico later today, <br/>
then move slowly northward or northeastward over the western or <br/>
central Gulf of Mexico.  Upper-level winds are only expected to be <br/>
marginally conducive for tropical cyclone formation, but some slow <br/>
development is possible while the system moves across the Gulf of <br/>
Mexico through the middle of the week. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

...DANGEROUS SURF AND RIP CURRENTS EXPECTED ALONG MANY WESTERN
ATLANTIC SHORES LATER THIS WEEK DUE TO LARGE SWELLS FROM LARRY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.8N 49.0W
ABOUT 925 MI...1485 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 1350 MI...2175 KM SE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...120 MPH...195 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...958 MB...28.29 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Larry was located
near latitude 18.8 North, longitude 49.0 West. Larry is moving
toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A northwestward motion 
with a slight decrease in forward speed is expected during the next 
few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Larry is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in strength is forecast during 
the next few days, although fluctuations in intensity will be 
possible.  Larry is expected to remain a major hurricane through the 
middle of this week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles
(260 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 958 mb (28.29 inches).  A 
drifting buoy near the center of Larry recently measured a pressure 
of 962.9 mb (28.43 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Larry are expected to reach the Lesser 
Antilles today, and will spread westward to portions of the Greater 
Antilles, the Bahamas, and Bermuda on Monday and Tuesday. 
Significant swells will likely reach the east coast of the United 
States and Atlantic Canada by midweek.  These swells are likely to 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Larry Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122021
500 AM AST Sun Sep 05 2021
 
Larry remains a powerful hurricane this morning. The system has a 
warm, well-defined eye with a large diameter of around 40 n mi. 
Larry's central dense overcast has become more symmetric overnight, 
although the upper-level outflow is still somewhat restricted on the 
southwestern side of the hurricane. This is likely an indication of 
some vertical wind shear impinging on the cyclone. However, recent 
AMSR2 microwave data indicate that the vortex is still well-aligned 
vertically, with a pronounced eyewall that slopes outward with 
height. The initial intensity is held at 105 kt for this advisory 
based on consensus T5.5/102 kt Dvorak classifications from TAFB and 
SAB, and a recent UW-CIMSS ADT estimate of 105 kt. 
 
The initial motion of Larry is northwestward, or 305/12 kt. Larry is 
expected to continue moving northwestward for the next several days 
around the southwestern periphery of a mid-level ridge over the 
central Atlantic. By Thursday, the cyclone is forecast to accelerate 
northward ahead of a deep-layer trough that will move off the east 
coast of the United States later this week. The latest track 
guidance is very tightly clustered, and the official NHC forecast is 
similar to the previous one and lies near the multi-model consensus 
aids. Confidence remains high in Larry's track forecast given the 
excellent model agreement. The hurricane is still expected to make 
its closest approach to Bermuda at days 4 and 5, but it remains too 
early to pinpoint how close it will come to the island. Even if the 
center passes east of Bermuda as forecast, it could still be large 
enough to produce some impacts on the island.

Over the next few days, some fluctuations in Larry's intensity are 
possible. The oceanic heat content along the forecast track is 
certainly sufficient for some intensification. However, vertical 
wind shear associated with an upper-level trough/low to the west of 
Larry may inhibit strengthening at times during the next couple of 
days, especially if the stronger shear values in the ECMWF-based 
SHIPS guidance are realized. Given Larry's large eye size, it does 
not appear as if the cyclone is poised to significantly intensify. 
The official NHC intensity forecast shows slight strengthening in 
the near-term, but then levels off the intensity through 48 h. The 
NHC forecast keeps Larry at major hurricane intensity through day 4, 
as the environment appears favorable enough between 48-96 h for 
Larry to maintain its organization, even as the cyclone gains 
latitude. Overall, this forecast lies on the high end of the 
intensity guidance, above the HFIP corrected consensus approach 
(HCCA) and the other multi-model consensus aids.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Larry are expected to reach the Lesser 
Antilles today and will spread to portions of the Greater Antilles, 
the Bahamas, and Bermuda on Monday and Tuesday.  Significant swells 
will likely reach the east coast of the United States and Atlantic 
Canada by midweek.  These swells will likely cause life-threatening 
surf and rip current conditions, and beachgoers and other interests 
along these coasts are urged to follow the advice of lifeguards and 
local officials this week.
 
2. Larry is forecast to approach Bermuda during the next several 
days, possibly as a major hurricane, bringing a risk of strong 
winds, heavy rainfall, and coastal flooding to the island by the 
middle of this week.  While it is too soon to determine the 
magnitude of these hazards and potential impacts on Bermuda, 
interests there should closely monitor the latest forecast updates 
during the next several days.
