Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Fri Sep 10 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Larry, located over the western Atlantic a few hundred miles <br/>
north-northeast of Bermuda, and has issued the last advisory on <br/>
Post-Tropical Cyclone Mindy, located a few hundred miles east of <br/>
Charleston, South Carolina. <br/>
<br/>
The northern portion of a tropical wave is producing disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms over Honduras, the western Caribbean Sea, <br/>
and portions of the Yucatan peninsula.  This system is forecast to <br/>
move into the Bay of Campeche and merge with a pre-existing surface <br/>
trough located over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico by this weekend. <br/>
Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive to support <br/>
gradual development, and a tropical depression could form Sunday or <br/>
Monday before the system moves onshore along the western Gulf of <br/>
Mexico coast. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A strong tropical wave is expected to emerge off of the west coast <br/>
of Africa later today or tonight.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to be conducive for development thereafter, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form by early next week as the system moves <br/>
west-northwestward over the far eastern Atlantic near the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands.  Interests in the Cabo Verde Islands should monitor the <br/>
progress of this system. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

hours. Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed
to completion.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within the
next 12 to 24 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in southeastern Newfoundland should monitor the
progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Larry was located
near latitude 37.7 North, longitude 61.8 West. Larry is moving
toward the north-northeast near 26 mph (43 km/h). A turn to the 
northeast with a further increase in forward speed is expected
today.  On the forecast track, the center of Larry will pass well
southeast of Nova Scotia today, and move over southeastern
Newfoundland tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next day or so,
but Larry is expected to remain a hurricane until it passes
Newfoundland.  Larry should become an extratropical cyclone on
Saturday, and is now forecast to be absorbed by a larger
extratropical low near Greenland by the end of the weekend.
 
Larry remains a large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend
outward up to 90 miles (150 km) from the center and tropical-storm-
force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 968 mb (28.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Larry can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?key_messages
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane warning
area in southeastern Newfoundland tonight, with tropical storm
conditions expected by late today.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected in the tropical storm warning area in southeastern
Newfoundland by late today.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
coastal flooding within the warning areas in southeastern
Newfoundland.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the Bahamas
today.  Significant swells from Larry will continue affecting 
Bermuda, the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada
through Saturday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
RAINFALL: Heavy rains from Larry will move quickly across eastern
Newfoundland tonight, producing 1 to 2 inches of rain.

Hurricane Larry Discussion Number  39
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122021
500 AM AST Fri Sep 10 2021
 
Larry's satellite presentation has remained largely unchanged
overnight. Deep convection continues to persist over and to the
northeast of the center, with a larger outer band around the
eastern portion of the circulation.  Subjective Dvorak intensity
estimates from TAFB and SAB have lowered slightly, and the initial
intensity has been adjusted downward to 75 kt.  This lies between
the lower subjective satellite estimates and the higher UW/CIMSS
ADT and SATCON values.  Larry is forecast to remain over warm
waters and in low vertical wind shear conditions this morning,
therefore little overall change in intensity is expected in the
short term.  The hurricane will cross the north wall of the Gulf
Stream over much cooler SSTs this afternoon, but the increasingly
fast forward speed of the system and baroclinic forcing from a
mid-latitude trough approaching from the west is likely to help
Larry maintain hurricane strength as is passes over southeastern
Newfoundland tonight.  Larry is forecast to become extratropical
shortly thereafter, and some slight weakening should occur before
the post-tropical cyclone is absorbed by a larger extratropical low
near southern Greenland in a couple of days.  The NHC intensity
forecast is similar to the HCCA and IVCN consensus aids and also
follows the trends of the latest global model guidance.
 
Larry has turned north-northeastward or 015/23 kt.  The track
guidance is once again in excellent agreement that Larry should
turn northeastward today and continue to accelerate ahead of
the aforementioned trough.  The center of Larry should pass over
southeastern Newfoundland tonight, but users are reminded to not
focus on the exact details of the track forecast as strong winds,
heavy rainfall, and a dangerous storm surge will extend far from
the center of the cyclone. The updated official forecast lies near 
the center of the track guidance envelope, but is slightly faster 
than the previous forecast during the first 36 hours.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Larry is forecast to move over portions of southeastern
Newfoundland tonight as it undergoes transition to a
hurricane-force post-tropical cyclone.  Hurricane conditions, a
dangerous storm surge, and heavy rainfall are expected in portions
of southeastern Newfoundland where a Hurricane Warning in effect.
 
2. Large swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the
Bahamas, Bermuda, and the east coast of the United States and
Atlantic Canada through Saturday. These swells will cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and beachgoers
and other interests along these coasts are urged to follow the
guidance of lifeguards and local officials.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Mindy Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132021
1100 PM EDT Thu Sep 09 2021
 
The structure of Mindy this evening has become quite diffuse, with a
linear band of convection mostly associated with a prominent outflow
boundary emanating away from the system. The last-light visible
low-level cloud motions gave the impression that Mindy was opening
up into a trough, with southwesterly flow ahead and northeasterly
flow immediately behind the estimated center. Indeed, a ASCAT-A pass
valid at 0002 UTC suggested that Mindy no longer has closed cyclonic
flow on its northeast side, with a lack of easterly wind vectors in
this sector of the system. In addition, a rapidly advancing frontal
boundary has already moved off of the Carolina coast and will
soon be merging with the leftover vort-max associated with Mindy.
The accumulation of all this evidence indicates that Mindy no
longer meets the definition of a tropical cyclone, and this will be
the final advisory on the system.
 
The post-tropical remains of Mindy have continued to accelerate to
the east-northeast this evening at 070/25 kt, moving almost as
quickly as the the maximum sustained winds, which is another reason
why the circulation is likely no longer closed. This motion should
continue for the next 12-24 hours with a gradual slowdown until what
remains of the circulation becomes indistinguishable from the
frontal boundary it is becoming embedded in.
