Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Sat Sep 11 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Larry, located over the Labrador Sea. <br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave and an upper-level trough are producing a large area <br/>
of disorganized showers and thunderstorms over portions of Central <br/>
America, southeastern Mexico, and the adjacent waters of the <br/>
northwestern Caribbean Sea and southern Gulf of Mexico.  Although <br/>
upper-level winds are not conducive for development currently, they <br/>
are expected to become more favorable for the system during the next <br/>
day or so. A tropical depression is likely to form on Sunday or <br/>
Monday while the disturbance moves northwestward and then northward <br/>
near the coast of northeastern Mexico.  Further development will be <br/>
possible through the middle of next week if it remains over water, <br/>
and interests along the western and northwestern Gulf coast should <br/>
monitor the progress of this system. <br/>
<br/>
Regardless of development, this disturbance is expected to produce <br/>
heavy rain across portions of Central America and the Yucatan <br/>
Peninsula through today which may lead to flash flooding and <br/>
mudslides. By late this weekend, heavy rain will likely reach <br/>
portions of the western Gulf coast, including coastal Texas and <br/>
Louisiana through the middle of next week. Localized significant <br/>
rainfall amounts will be possible, potentially resulting in areas of <br/>
flash and urban flooding.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave continues to produce a concentrated area of showers <br/>
and thunderstorms just southeast of the Cabo Verde Islands. <br/>
Environmental conditions appear generally conducive for gradual <br/>
development, and a tropical depression is likely to form late this <br/>
weekend or early next week while the system moves westward over the <br/>
far eastern Atlantic.  Regardless of development, this system is <br/>
likely to bring gusty winds and locally heavy rain across the Cabo <br/>
Verde Islands later today and tonight.  <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Another tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of <br/>
Africa in a few days.  Some development of this system will be <br/>
possible through the middle of next week while it moves westward <br/>
across the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some slight weakening is possible before Larry merges with 
another extratropical low.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310 miles (500 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 963 mb (28.44 inches).

<title>Post-Tropical Cyclone Larry Forecast Discussion Number 43</title>

Hurricane Larry Discussion Number  43
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122021
500 AM AST Sat Sep 11 2021
 
Larry made landfall near South East Bight, Newfoundland, around 0345
UTC.  Since then, the hurricane has moved quickly north-
northeastward at 42 kt and is now well northeast of Newfoundland.
Although the hurricane still has some central convection, the low-
and mid-level centers are separating, and the remaining convection
is decreasing.  The initial winds are lowered to 65 kt, consistent
with the degraded structure.  Larry should quickly transition into
a strong post-tropical cyclone later today while it continues its
speedy north-northeastward course, then dissipate as it merges with
a developing mid-latitude low over the Labrador Sea.  No
significant changes were made to the track or intensity forecasts.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the
Bahamas, Bermuda, the east coast of the United States, and
Atlantic Canada through tonight. These swells will cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and beachgoers
and other interests along these coasts are urged to follow the
guidance of lifeguards and local officials.
