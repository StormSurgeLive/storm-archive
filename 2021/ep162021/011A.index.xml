DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM MDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pamela was
located near latitude 21.5 North, longitude 108.9 West. Pamela is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 9 mph (15 km/h). A faster 
northeastward motion is expected to begin overnight and continue 
through late Wednesday.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Pamela will pass well south of the southern tip of the Baja 
California peninsula through tonight, and make landfall in 
west-central Mexico within the hurricane warning area Wednesday 
morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Restrengthening is forecast overnight, and Pamela is 
expected to become a hurricane again before it reaches the coast 
of west-central Mexico Wednesday morning.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 989 mb (29.21 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pamela can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?key_messages.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge is expected to produce significant
coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds near where the center
of Pamela makes landfall in southwestern Mexico.  Near the coast,
the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the Hurricane
Warning area by late tonight or early Wednesday, with tropical
storm conditions beginning later this evening. Tropical storm 
conditions, primarily in gusts, are possible within the Tropical 
Storm Watch area in Baja California del Sur through this evening.
 
RAINFALL: Through Thursday, Pamela is expected to produce the
following rainfall amounts:
 
Across the Mexican States of Sinaloa, western Durango, and northern
Nayarit...4 to 8 inches with isolated maximum totals of 12 inches.
This rainfall may trigger significant and life-threatening flash
flooding and mudslides.
 
Across southern portions of Baja California Sur...2 to 4 inches
with isolated maximum totals of 6 inches.
 
Across portions of central Texas and southeastern Oklahoma...3 to 6
inches with isolated maximum totals of 8 inches. This may result in
considerable flash and urban flooding impacts.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pamela will continue to affect portions 
of the southern Baja California peninsula, as well as southwestern 
and west-central mainland Mexico through Wednesday. These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. 
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Pamela Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162021
300 PM MDT Tue Oct 12 2021
 
Entrainment of very dry mid-level air from the west and northwest 
appears to have eroded Pamela's deep convection in the northwestern 
semicircle, leaving the low-level center partially exposed again 
similar to this time yesterday. Although there could still be some 
upper-level wind shear affecting the cyclone, dropsonde wind data 
from an earlier Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft indicate 
that the vortex column from the surface to at least the 700-mb level 
was vertically aligned with no tilt evident. The highest aircraft 
flight-level and SFMR winds only support an intensity of about 55 
kt. However, the aircraft measured a central pressure of 989 mb on 
its second and outbound pass through the center, which was a 
decrease of 2 mb from the first pass, and would support an intensity 
close to hurricane strength. Based on the relatively low central 
pressure, and the possibility that stronger winds might exist east 
of the center in an area that wasn't sampled by the aircraft, 
Pamela's intensity has only been lowered to 60 kt for this advisory. 
Data from the aircraft indicated that the 34-kt wind radii had 
expanded in all quadrants despite Pamela's peak winds having 
weakened. Another Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft is 
scheduled to investigate Pamela later tonight around 0530 UTC.
 
The initial motion estimate is northward, or 360/08 kt. Now that 
Pamela is on or just north of the axis of a deep-layer ridge, a 
sharp turn toward the north-northeast should occur very soon, 
followed by a northeastward motion tonight as the cyclone becomes 
embedded within southwesterly flow ahead of a broad mid- to 
upper-level trough. Pamela should then accelerate toward the 
west-central coast of Mexico tonight through Wednesday due to the 
deep-layer steering flow on the southeast side of the aforementioned 
trough. Landfall is still expected to occur along the west-central 
coast of Mexico a little before 1200 UTC Wednesday morning. After 
the hurricane moves inland, Pamela, or its remnants will continue to 
accelerate northeastward across central and northern Mexico, and 
move into Texas by Thursday night. The new NHC track model guidance 
remains tightly packed around the previous advisory track, so no 
significant changes were required.
 
It might not seem like it based on the downward satellite trends 
today, but the negative effects from modest vertical shear and dry 
air that have been affecting the cyclone will gradually subside once 
Pamela makes the expected northeastward turn later this evening. 
During that same time, the deep-layer shear vector is forecast to 
slowly back around to a southwesterly direction and become aligned 
with the hurricane's forward motion, which will help to reduce some 
of the effects of the shear. Surrounding dry mid-level air could 
still be a hindering factor, but this negative parameter is expected 
to be offset by Pamela moving over very warm sea-surface 
temperatures of almost 31 deg C overnight. The higher ocean heat 
content should increase the available instability during the normal 
convective maximum period tonight, enabling the cyclone to 
restrengthen to hurricane status, and continue to strengthen right 
up until landfall occurs. Although it now appears unlikely that the 
cyclone will become a major hurricane, Pamela could still become a 
category 2 hurricane prior to landfall.  After landfall occurs, 
rapid decay due to interaction with the mountainous terrain of 
Mexico is expected, with the cyclone ultimately dissipating over 
northern Mexico in a couple of days. The latest NHC intensity 
forecast lies near or above the upper end of the intensity guidance.
 
Although the cyclone is forecast to dissipate over the rugged
terrain of Mexico, deep moisture associated with the system's
remnants are likely to spread over north-central and northeastern
Mexico on Wednesday, and then move into portions of the
south-central United States late Wednesday or Thursday.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Pamela is forecast to restrengthen into a hurricane before it
reaches the west-central coast of Mexico on Wednesday morning, and
life-threatening storm surge and dangerous hurricane-force winds
are expected within the Hurricane Warning area.  Residents in this
area should follow any advice given by local officials.
 
2. Pamela is expected to pass south of the southern tip of the Baja
California peninsula as a hurricane this afternoon and tonight, and
tropical-storm conditions are possible within the Tropical Storm
Watch area, primarily in strong gusts.
 
3. Heavy rains associated with Pamela are expected to move into the 
Mexican States of Sinaloa and western Durgano along with southern 
portions of Baja California Sur Tuesday and Wednesday. This will 
pose a threat of significant and life-threatening flash flooding and 
mudslides.
 
4. Heavy rains associated with the remnants of Pamela are expected 
across portions of central Texas and southeastern Oklahoma late 
Wednesday and Thursday. This may result in considerable flash and 
urban flooding impacts.
