A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within 24 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Pamela was located 
near latitude 19.2 North, longitude 108.9 West. Pamela is moving 
toward the north near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this motion should 
continue today, followed by a faster northeastward motion by 
tonight.  On the forecast track, the center of Pamela will pass well 
south of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula through 
tonight, and make landfall in west-central Mexico within the 
hurricane warning area Wednesday morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Steady to rapid strengthening is forecast, and 
Pamela is expected to be near major hurricane strength when it 
reaches the coast of Mexico early Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 988 mb (29.18 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge is expected to produce significant
coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds near where the center
of Pamela makes landfall in southwestern Mexico.  Near the coast,
the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the Hurricane
Warning area by late tonight or early Wednesday, with tropical
storm conditions beginning as early as this evening. Tropical
storm conditions are possible within the Tropical Storm Watch area
in Baja California del Sur this afternoon.
 
RAINFALL: Through Thursday, Pamela is expected to produce the 
following rainfall amounts:

Across the Mexican States of Sinaloa and western Durango...4 to 8 
inches with isolated maximum totals of 12 inches. This rainfall may 
trigger significant and life-threatening flash flooding and 
mudslides.

Across southern portions of Baja California Sur...2 to 4 inches 
with isolated maximum totals of 6 inches.

Across portions of central Texas and southeastern Oklahoma...3 to 5 
inches with isolated maximum totals of 8 inches.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pamela will begin to affect portions of 
the southern Baja California peninsula, southwestern and 
west-central mainland Mexico beginning later today. These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  
Please consult products from your local weather office.

<title>Hurricane Pamela Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Tropical Storm Pamela Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162021
900 PM MDT Mon Oct 11 2021
 
Pamela continues to be affected by some modest northwesterly 
mid-level shear that has caused the low-level center to be located 
near the northwestern edge of the deep convection.  This was evident 
in an earlier AMSR2 microwave image that arrived shortly after the 
release of the previous NHC advisory package.  Recent objective and 
subjective Dvorak T-numbers still support an intensity of around 
60 kt, and that value is maintained as the initial wind speed for 
this advisory.  An Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft is 
scheduled to fly into the storm late tomorrow morning and early 
afternoon to better provide a better assessment of Pamela's 
structure, intensity, and wind field.  

The guidance suggests that the shear that has been plaguing Pamela 
should relax during the next 12-24 hours, allowing for 
strengthening.  Nearly all of the statistical and dynamical model 
intensity guidance calls for strengthening, but they have trended 
toward a lower peak intensity primarily due to the fact that Pamela 
so far has not strengthened as much as expected.  The NHC intensity 
forecast again calls for Pamela to become a hurricane overnight or 
early Tuesday, and shows the system nearing major hurricane strength 
before it reaches the coast of mainland Mexico early Wednesday. 
Although the official forecast is at the high end of the intensity 
guidance, it is supported by the GFS model which has been consistent 
in significantly deepening Pamela during the cyclone's approach to 
Mexico on Tuesday and Tuesday night. After landfall, rapid weakening 
should occur as the system moves over the mountainous terrain of 
west-central Mexico, and Pamela is forecast to become a 
post-tropical remnant low or dissipate by Thursday. 

Pamela is moving north-northwestward or 335/7 kt.  The track 
forecast philosophy again remains unchanged this advisory. The 
cyclone is forecast to turn northward tonight as it reaches the 
western portion of a deep-layer subtropical ridge. A faster 
northeastward motion is expected by late Tuesday as Pamela recurves 
ahead of a broad mid-latitude trough moving into northwestern 
Mexico. The track guidance is in very good agreement on the overall 
evolution of the steering pattern, but there are still some 
differences in how quickly Pamela accelerates northeastward on 
Tuesday.  Therefore, the NHC forecast is once again close to the 
various multi-model consensus aids. 

Although the cyclone could dissipate over the mountainous terrain 
of Mexico, deep moisture associated with the system's remnants are 
likely to spread over north-central and northeastern Mexico on 
Wednesday, and then move into portions of the south-central United 
States late Wednesday or Thursday. 

Key Messages:
 
1. Pamela is forecast to be near major hurricane intensity when it 
reaches the southwestern coast of Mexico on Wednesday morning, and 
life- threatening storm surge and dangerous hurricane-force winds 
are expected within the Hurricane Warning area.  Residents in this 
area should follow any advice given by local officials.
 
2. Pamela is expected to pass south of the southern tip of the Baja
California peninsula as a hurricane on Tuesday and Tuesday night,
and tropical-storm conditions are possible within the Tropical
storm Watch area.
 
3. Heavy rains associated with Pamela are expected to move into the
Mexican States of Sinaloa and western Durgano along with southern
portions of Baja California Sur Tuesday and Wednesday. This will
pose a threat of significant and life-threatening flash flooding and
mudslides.
 
4. Heavy rains associated with the remnants of Pamela are expected
across portions of central Texas and southeastern Oklahoma late
Wednesday and Thursday.  This may result in flash and urban
flooding.
