DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM MDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Pamela was making 
landfall on the west-central coast of Mexico near Estacion Dimas 
estimated at latitude 23.7 North, longitude 106.8 West.  Pamela is 
moving toward the northeast near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A faster 
northeastward motion is expected later today. On the forecast track, 
the center of Pamela will move farther inland over western Mexico 
later today.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Rapid weakening is forecast as the center moves farther 
inland.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140
miles (220 km).  A wind gust of 46 mph (74 km/h) was recently 
observed at Mazatlan Airport, Mexico.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pamela can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?key_messages.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge is expected to produce significant
coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds near Pamela's 
landfall location in southwestern Mexico.  Near the coast,
the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the Hurricane
Warning area for the next few hours, with tropical storm conditions
continuing to spread over portions of the coast.
 
RAINFALL:  Through Thursday, Pamela or its remnant is expected to
produce the following rainfall amounts:
 
Across the Mexican States of Sinaloa, western Durango, and northern
Nayarit...4 to 8 inches with isolated maximum totals of 12 inches.
This rainfall may trigger significant and life-threatening flash
flooding and mudslides.
 
Across portions of central Texas and southeastern Oklahoma...3 to 6
inches with isolated maximum totals of 8 inches. This may result in
considerable flash and urban flooding impacts.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pamela will continue to affect portions
of the southern Baja California peninsula, as well as southwestern
and west-central mainland Mexico through today.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.

Hurricane Pamela Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162021
300 AM MDT Wed Oct 13 2021

Although Dvorak satellite intensity estimates have not changed, 
recent imagery indicates that the center is more involved 
with the deep convection than it was earlier, suggesting that at 
least some strengthening has taken place.  Moreover, an excellent 
ASCAT-B scatterometer pass from around 0500 UTC showed a couple of 
53 to  54 kt wind vectors, which is likely an undersampling of the 
peak intensity.  On this basis, the estimated intensity of Pamela 
is increased slightly to 65 kt, so the system is once again a 
hurricane.  Since the tropical cyclone is close to landfall and the 
upper-level winds are not conducive for much more strengthening, 
little change in intensity is likely until the center crosses the 
coast.  Rapid weakening will occur after the center moves inland, 
and the official forecast may be a little on the high side given 
the mountainous terrain that the system will traverse.

Center fixes from geostationary imagery and the scatterometer 
indicate that Pamela is now moving faster toward the northeast, or 
at about 045/12 kt.  Additional acceleration is expected during the 
next 12 to 24 hours while the cyclone is embedded in the deep-layer 
southwesterly flow between a ridge over the western Gulf of Mexico 
and a broad trough over the west-central United States.  The 
official forecast track has been shifted a little to the southeast 
of the previous one, but still moves Pamela across the coast of 
Mexico withing the Hurricane Warning area this morning.  Later 
today and tonight, the rapidly weakening cyclone should move 
over central and northern Mexico.  By 36 hours, the global models 
show the system losing its identity.  The official forecast track 
is close to the simple and corrected consensus model solutions.
 
Although Pamela is likely to dissipate over the rugged terrain of
Mexico, deep moisture associated with the system's remnants 
are likely to spread over north-central and northeastern Mexico on
Wednesday, and then move into portions of the south-central United
States later today or Thursday.


Key Messages:
 
1. Pamela is forecast to make landfall on the west-central coast of 
Mexico this morning, and life-threatening storm surge and dangerous 
hurricane-force winds are expected within the Hurricane Warning 
area.  Residents in this area should follow any advice given by 
local officials.

2. Heavy rains associated with Pamela are expected to continue to 
move into the Mexican States of Sinaloa and western Durango today.  
This will pose a threat of significant and life-threatening flash 
flooding and mudslides.
 
3. Heavy rains associated with the remnants of Pamela are expected
across portions of central Texas and southeastern Oklahoma later 
today or Thursday. This may result in considerable flash and urban 
flooding impacts.
