...TROPICAL STORM PAMELA MOVING INLAND OVER WEST-CENTRAL MEXICO
BRINGING STRONG GUSTY WINDS AND HEAVY RAINS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM MDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.4N 106.0W
ABOUT 85 MI...140 KM NNE OF MAZATLAN MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 45 DEGREES AT 23 MPH...37 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...992 MB...29.30 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has changed the Hurricane Warning to a 
Tropical Storm Warning from Bahia Tempehuaya to Escuinapa.
 
All other Tropical Storm Warnings have been discontinued.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bahia Tempehuaya to Escuinapa
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
occurring within the warning area now.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pamela was
located near latitude 24.4 North, longitude 106.0 West. Pamela is
accelerating toward the northeast near 23 mph (37 km/h) and this
motion is expected to continue at a faster speed prior to
dissipation.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts. Additional rapid weakening is forecast as the center moves 
farther inland.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pamela can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header WTPZ41 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep1.shtml?key_messages.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge is expected to produce significant coastal
flooding in areas of onshore winds within the warning area. Near the
coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
WIND:  Tropical Storm conditions are occuring within the Tropical
Storm Warning area for the next few hours but should end later this
afternoon.
 
RAINFALL: Through Thursday, Pamela or its remnants are
expected to produce the following rainfall amounts:
 
Across the Mexican States of Sinaloa, western Durango, and northern
Nayarit...4 to 8 inches with isolated maximum totals of 12 inches.
This rainfall may trigger significant and life-threatening flash
flooding and mudslides.
 
Across portions of central Texas and southeastern Oklahoma...3 to 6
inches with isolated maximum totals of 8 inches. This may result in
considerable flash and urban flooding impacts.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pamela will continue to affect portions
of the southern Baja California peninsula, as well as southwestern
and west-central mainland Mexico through today.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1200 PM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 300 PM MDT.

Hurricane Pamela Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162021
300 AM MDT Wed Oct 13 2021

Although Dvorak satellite intensity estimates have not changed, 
recent imagery indicates that the center is more involved 
with the deep convection than it was earlier, suggesting that at 
least some strengthening has taken place.  Moreover, an excellent 
ASCAT-B scatterometer pass from around 0500 UTC showed a couple of 
53 to  54 kt wind vectors, which is likely an undersampling of the 
peak intensity.  On this basis, the estimated intensity of Pamela 
is increased slightly to 65 kt, so the system is once again a 
hurricane.  Since the tropical cyclone is close to landfall and the 
upper-level winds are not conducive for much more strengthening, 
little change in intensity is likely until the center crosses the 
coast.  Rapid weakening will occur after the center moves inland, 
and the official forecast may be a little on the high side given 
the mountainous terrain that the system will traverse.

Center fixes from geostationary imagery and the scatterometer 
indicate that Pamela is now moving faster toward the northeast, or 
at about 045/12 kt.  Additional acceleration is expected during the 
next 12 to 24 hours while the cyclone is embedded in the deep-layer 
southwesterly flow between a ridge over the western Gulf of Mexico 
and a broad trough over the west-central United States.  The 
official forecast track has been shifted a little to the southeast 
of the previous one, but still moves Pamela across the coast of 
Mexico withing the Hurricane Warning area this morning.  Later 
today and tonight, the rapidly weakening cyclone should move 
over central and northern Mexico.  By 36 hours, the global models 
show the system losing its identity.  The official forecast track 
is close to the simple and corrected consensus model solutions.
 
Although Pamela is likely to dissipate over the rugged terrain of
Mexico, deep moisture associated with the system's remnants 
are likely to spread over north-central and northeastern Mexico on
Wednesday, and then move into portions of the south-central United
States later today or Thursday.


Key Messages:
 
1. Pamela is forecast to make landfall on the west-central coast of 
Mexico this morning, and life-threatening storm surge and dangerous 
hurricane-force winds are expected within the Hurricane Warning 
area.  Residents in this area should follow any advice given by 
local officials.

2. Heavy rains associated with Pamela are expected to continue to 
move into the Mexican States of Sinaloa and western Durango today.  
This will pose a threat of significant and life-threatening flash 
flooding and mudslides.
 
3. Heavy rains associated with the remnants of Pamela are expected
across portions of central Texas and southeastern Oklahoma later 
today or Thursday. This may result in considerable flash and urban 
flooding impacts.
