DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Larry was located
near latitude 28.9 North, longitude 59.8 West.  Larry is moving
toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and a turn toward the
north-northwest and north with an increase in forward speed is
forecast on Thursday, with a faster northeastward motion expected by
Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of Larry should pass east
of Bermuda on Thursday, and move near or over southeastern
Newfoundland late Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 105 mph (170 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next 
couple of days, but Larry is expected to remain a hurricane during 
that time.
 
Larry remains a large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend 
outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km).
 
The minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft is 968 mb (28.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Larry can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?key_messages
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
tonight or early Thursday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the Leeward
Islands, portions of the Greater Antilles, and the Bahamas through
midweek, and impact Bermuda through the end of the week. Significant
swells from Larry will continue affecting the east coast of the
United States and Atlantic Canada through the end of the week.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Outer rain bands from Hurricane Larry may periodically
impact Bermuda tonight into Thursday.  Significant rainfall totals
are currently not expected, however briefly heavy rain rates within
these bands may result in an inch or two of rain through Thursday.

<title>Hurricane Larry Forecast Discussion Number 33</title>

Hurricane Larry Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122021
500 PM AST Wed Sep 08 2021
 
Larry's overall organization has shown little change on satellite
images this afternoon.  The eye remains rather ill-defined but the
hurricane continues to produce some strong convection near/around
the center.  Cirrus-level outflow remains quite well defined,
particularly to the northwest.  The current intensity estimate is
held at 95 kt, which is only slightly above the latest Dvorak
estimates.  Another Air Force Reserve Unit Hurricane Hunter
aircraft is scheduled to investigate Larry this evening to 
provide a new intensity estimate.
 
The hurricane continues heading a little faster toward the
northwest, or at about 325/13 kt.  The track forecast philosophy
remains about the same as before.  Larry should move around the
western side of a deep-layer subtropical anticyclone over the
central Atlantic for the next 36 to 48 hours, passing east of
Bermuda tomorrow.  After that, the hurricane is expected to
accelerate northeastward on the east side of a deep-layer trough
moving through the eastern United States, and Larry will move near 
or over southeastern Newfoundland in roughly 60 hours.  Then, the 
cyclone is forecast to move over the far north Atlantic.  The 
official forecast is close to the dynamical model consensus 
solution and, again, very similar to the previous NHC track.
 
Based on the dynamical model guidance, weak to moderate vertical
shear should prevail over Larry during the next couple of days.
Sea surface temperatures below the cyclone begin to cool
significantly after 48 hours, which should induce weakening.
However, baroclinic forcing associated with the trough to the west
may help the hurricane maintain some of its intensity over cooler
waters, as suggested by the global models.  The official intensity
forecast follows the model consensus and keeps Larry at hurricane
strength even after extratropical transition.  In 5 days or less,
the system should merge with another large cyclonic circulation over
the north Atlantic.

Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the
Leeward Islands, portions of the Greater Antilles, the 
Bahamas, Bermuda, and the east coast of the United States and 
Atlantic Canada through the end of the week. These swells will 
likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and 
beachgoers and other interests along these coasts are urged to 
follow the guidance of lifeguards and local officials this week.
 
2. The center of Larry is forecast to pass east of Bermuda on
Thursday, but given Larry's large size, tropical storm conditions
are expected there there Thursday, along with a risk of coastal
flooding.  A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Bermuda, and
interests there should closely monitor the latest forecast updates.
 
3. Larry is forecast to move near or over portions of southeastern
Newfoundland late Friday and Friday night as it undergoes transition
to a hurricane-force post-tropical cyclone. There is an increasing
risk of impacts from high winds, rainfall, and storm surge in
portions of Newfoundland, and interests there should monitor updates
to the forecast.

<title>Tropical Storm Mindy Forecast Discussion Number 2</title>

Tropical Storm Mindy Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132021
1100 PM EDT Wed Sep 08 2021
 
Doppler radar data and surface observations indicate that the
center of Mindy made landfall over St. Vincent Island, Florida,
near 0115 UTC. Since that time, the center has been moving along
the shoreline of Apalachee Bay.  The intensity is held at 40 kt
based on continuity from earlier buoy data and a 43-kt wind at an
elevated tower south of Apalachicola.  The central pressure has
been lowered to 1002 mb based on surface obs from the Apalachicola
area.  It should be noted that while Mindy is not well organized in 
satellite imagery, but it has a good radar presentation.
 
The initial motion is 055/17.  A general east-northeastward motion 
should continue for the next 24 h or so as Mindy moves along the 
southern edge of a deep-layer mid-latitude trough moving across the
eastern United States. After that, a decrease in forward speed and 
a more eastward motion are expected as the aforementioned trough 
moves away from Mindy and the cyclone becomes vertically shallow.  
The forecast track keeps the center along the Gulf coast for a few 
more hours, followed by a motion across northern Florida and 
southeastern Georgia into the Atlantic.  The new forecast track is 
a little faster than the previous forecast.

Little change in strength is likely during the next few hours while 
the center of Mindy straddles the coast.  Weakening should occur as 
the center moves farther inland later tonight, aided by an increase 
in westerly vertical wind shear.  By the time the cyclone reaches 
the Atlantic, the shear should be strong enough to make the system 
continue to weaken.  The new intensity forecast is a little 
stronger than the previous forecast during the first 12 h, then is 
similar to the previous forecast in calling for the cyclone to 
dissipate after 72 h.


Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical Storm Mindy is expected to produce heavy rainfall from 
the Florida Panhandle into southern portions of Georgia and South 
Carolina through Thursday morning. This rainfall may produce 
isolated to scattered flash, urban, and small stream flooding. 
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected through tonight in
portions of the Florida Panhandle where a Tropical Storm Warning is
in effect.  Tropical storm conditions are also possible across 
portions of the northern Florida Peninsula and southeastern Georgia 
near the center of Mindy.
