Honduras and the western Caribbean Sea is forecast to emerge over <br/>
the southern Bay of Campeche on Saturday.  Environmental conditions <br/>
are expected to be conducive to support some gradual development of <br/>
the system before it moves over mainland Mexico early next week. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A strong tropical wave is expected to emerge off of the west coast <br/>
of Africa on Saturday.  Environmental conditions are forecast to be <br/>
conducive for development thereafter, and a tropical depression <br/>
could form by early next week as it moves west-northwestward over <br/>
the far eastern Atlantic near the Cabo Verde Islands.  <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Southeastern Newfoundland from Lamaline to west of St. Schotts
* Southeastern Newfoundland from north of Pouch Cove to Bonavista
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area. 
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in southeastern Newfoundland should monitor the
progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Larry was located
near latitude 32.0 North, longitude 61.6 West.  Larry is moving
toward the north-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h), and a turn toward
the north with an increase in forward speed is forecast today, with
a faster northeastward motion expected by Friday.  On the forecast
track, the center of Larry will pass east of Bermuda today, and
move near or over southeastern Newfoundland Friday night or early
Saturday morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of
days, but Larry is expected to remain a hurricane during that time.
Larry should become an extratropical cyclone early Saturday, after
passing by Newfoundland, then weaken further while it passes
southeast of Greenland Sunday night.  Larry is expected to be
absorbed by a larger extratropical low east of Greenland by Monday.
 
Larry is a large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend outward 
up to 90 miles (150 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force 
winds extend outward up to 220 miles (350 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 966 mb (28.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Larry can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?key_messages
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda today.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area in
southeastern Newfoundland Friday night, with tropical storm
conditions possible by late Friday.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible in the tropical storm watch area in southeastern 
Newfoundland by late Friday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the Leeward
Islands, portions of the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, and Bermuda
through the end of the week. Significant swells from Larry will
continue affecting the east coast of the United States and Atlantic
Canada through the end of the week. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Outer rain bands from Hurricane Larry may periodically
impact Bermuda today. Significant rainfall totals are currently
not expected, however brief heavy rain from these bands may result 
in an inch or two of rain through Thursday.  

Heavy rains from Larry will move quickly across eastern Newfoundland 
Friday night, producing 1 to 2 inches of rain.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Larry Discussion Number  35
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122021
500 AM AST Thu Sep 09 2021
 
This morning's conventional satellite presentation appears to
indicate a more banding eye feature rather than a previously noted
irregular-type eye. A timely Advanced Technology Microwave
Sounder (ATMS) image and an AMSR2 lower frequency pass, however, 
clearly shows the majority of the eyewall intact.  The primary 
curved band wrapping around the west semicircle consists of -78 
Celsius cloud tops.  The western portion of the eyewall is now 
discernible on the Bermuda Weather Service Radar.  The initial 
intensity is held at possibly generous 85 kt for this advisory and 
is based on a compromise of the subjective and objective satellite 
intensity estimates.  A 53rd Air Force Reserve Unit reconnaissance 
mission is scheduled for this morning and will provide new 
information on Larry's intensity.
 
The 0000 UTC GFS global model sounding revealed 15 to 20 kt of
southwesterly effective shear impinging on the western
half of the cyclone while the UW-CIMSS shear analysis showed 20-25 
kt of bulk shear in the same area.  This, along with a 
significantly higher statically stable surrounding environment 
(about 55 percent RH), has disrupted the inner core and more than 
likely created a SW to NW tilt with height.  Larry is expected to 
change little in strength during the next 12 to 24 hours, then 
gradually weaken as the cyclone traverses sharply decreasing cooler 
water north of the gulf stream while the southwesterly shear 
increases significantly.  The dynamic forcing, however, associated 
with a mid-latitude major shortwave trough near Atlantic Canada 
should aid in maintaining Larry as a hurricane while it passes near 
or over Newfoundland.  Afterwards, Larry is expected to transition 
into a large extratropical cyclone, as indicated by the FSU Cyclone 
Phase Diagram.  By early next week, Larry is expected to be 
absorbed by a larger extratropical low.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be north-northwestward, or 
330/14 kt.  The track philosophy remains unchanged.  Larry is 
expected to move around the western periphery of a subtropical high 
pressure system anchored over the central Atlantic.  The hurricane 
should make its closest approach to the east of Bermuda later today 
while slowly turning north-northwestward and northward. Through the 
remaining portion of the forecast, Larry should  accelerate 
generally northeastward in response to the aforementioned 
mid-latitude trough and move near or over southeastern Newfoundland 
Friday night.  The NHC forecast has been nudged a bit to the left 
of the previous advisory and is close to the various multi-model 
consensus aids.
 
The wind radii were decreased slightly in all quadrants based on
earlier METOP A and B scatterometer passes.

Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the
Leeward Islands, portions of the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas,
Bermuda, and the east coast of the United States and Atlantic
Canada through the end of the week. These swells will likely cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and beachgoers
and other interests along these coasts are urged to follow the
guidance of lifeguards and local officials this week.
 
2. The center of Larry is forecast to pass east of Bermuda later 
today, Tropical storm conditions are expected today, along with a 
risk of coastal flooding.  A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for 
Bermuda, and interests there should closely monitor the latest 
forecast updates.
 
3. Larry is forecast to move near or over portions of southeastern
Newfoundland Friday night, early Saturday morning as it undergoes 
transition to a hurricane-force post-tropical cyclone.  Hurricane 
and Tropical Storm Watches are in effect for southeastern 
Newfoundland.  There is an increasing risk of impacts from high 
winds, rainfall, and storm surge in portions of Newfoundland, and 
interests there should monitor updates to the forecast.

Tropical Depression Mindy Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132021
1100 AM EDT Thu Sep 09 2021
 
Doppler radar data and surface observations show that the center of
Mindy has recently moved offshore the coast of Georgia.  Buoy 
41008 located off the Georgia coast recently recorded 1-min 
sustained winds of 29 kt with gusts as high as 33 kt.  Thus, 30 kt 
is maintained as the intensity for this advisory. 

Mindy is located in an environment of strong south to southwesterly 
vertical wind shear.  Over the next 24 h, the shear is expected to 
become even stronger.  The strong shear should prevent 
restrengthening and is likely to strip away any remaining convection 
by Friday or Friday night.  Mindy is forecast to become 
post-tropical Friday evening.  Most of the global models suggest 
that the cyclone will open up into a trough in 36-48 h, but it is 
possible this could happen sooner, as surface observations already 
show that easterly winds on the north side have become quite weak.  
The NHC forecast calls for dissipation Friday night, which is sooner 
than the previous advisory.
 
Mindy continues moving quickly to the east-northeast or 065/18 kt. 
There has been no change to the track forecast philosophy.  Mindy is 
forecast to continue moving east-northeastward at a similar speed 
for the next 24 h near the southern portion of a deep-layer trough 
moving across the eastern United States.  Once the trough begins to 
lift northeastward, Mindy should slow down a little on Friday.  The 
main adjustment to the NHC track is to show a slightly faster motion 
toward the east-northeast at the 24-36 h points.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Mindy will produce locally heavy rainfall across portions of
coastal South Carolina through early this afternoon. This rainfall
may produce isolated to scattered flash, urban, and small stream
flooding.
