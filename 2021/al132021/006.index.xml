Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Thu Sep 9 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Larry, located over the western Atlantic a few hundred miles <br/>
northeast of Bermuda, and on Tropical Depression Mindy, located <br/>
offshore the southeast coast of the United States. <br/>
<br/>
The northern portion of a tropical wave is producing disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms over northeastern Honduras and the western <br/>
Caribbean Sea.  This system is forecast to move into the Bay of <br/>
Campeche and merge with a pre-existing surface trough located over <br/>
the southwestern Gulf of Mexico by this weekend.  Environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to be conducive to support some gradual <br/>
development, and a tropical depression could form by early next week <br/>
before the system moves inland over mainland Mexico. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A strong tropical wave is expected to emerge off of the west coast <br/>
of Africa in the next day or so.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to be conducive for development thereafter, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form by early next week as the system moves <br/>
west-northwestward over the far eastern Atlantic near the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests elsewhere in southeastern Newfoundland should monitor the
progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Larry was located 
near latitude 35.5 North, longitude 62.3 West. Larry is moving 
toward the north near 25 mph (41 km/h). A further increase in 
forward speed is expected tonight with a turn to the northeast 
forecast by Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of Larry will 
continue to move away from Bermuda tonight, and move near or over 
southeastern Newfoundland Friday night or early Saturday morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast to begin on Friday, but Larry
is expected to remain a hurricane until it passes Newfoundland.
Larry should become an extratropical cyclone on Saturday, and is 
now forecast to be absorbed by a larger extratropical low near 
Greenland by the end of the weekend.
 
Larry remains a large hurricane. Hurricane-force winds extend 
outward up to 90 miles (150 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 966 mb (28.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Larry can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?key_messages
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane warning
area in southeastern Newfoundland Friday night, with tropical storm
conditions expected by late Friday.  Tropical storm conditions are

Hurricane Larry Discussion Number  38
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122021
1100 PM AST Thu Sep 09 2021

There is not much new to report in the satellite structure with 
Larry this evening. The hurricane consists of a small core region of 
cold convective cloud tops near and just north of the center with a 
much larger concentric band of more moderate convective activity 
encircling the smaller core. Radar from Bermuda also shows this 
structure well even as the hurricane pulls away from the island. The 
most recent subjective Dvorak satellite intensity estimates from SAB 
and TAFB were unchanged from this afternoon, and the initial 
intensity will remain at 80 kt for this advisory.

Larry is now moving to the north and beginning to accelerate at 
360/20 kt. The track guidance remains in good agreement that Larry 
should soon turn to the northeast and continue accelerating quickly 
ahead of a large mid-latitude trough. On the current track, Larry 
should pass near or over southeastern Newfoundland tomorrow night or 
Saturday morning, becoming post-tropical shortly after it passes by. 
The post-tropical cyclone Larry should continue to move rapidly to 
the northeast until it is absorbed by the aforementioned 
mid-latitude trough after 48 hours. The official track forecast 
again lies close to the various consensus model predictions, and is 
just a touch faster than the previous forecast.

Larry has another 12 hours or so over warm Gulf Stream waters, and 
most of the guidance is in agreement that the hurricane should 
maintain its intensity in the short-term. However, more gradual 
weakening should begin thereafter once Larry moves over much cooler 
waters. Unfortunately, there is not much time for Larry to weaken 
before the hurricane impacts Newfoundland, and it also is possible 
the rapidly approaching mid-latitude trough will provide some 
baroclinic forcing that could expand the wind field of the 
hurricane further. The NHC intensity forecast remain close to the 
latest HCCA guidance which is quite similar to the previous 
forecast. After 24 hours, the latest forecast GFS and ECMWF 
simulated IR brightness temperature suggest that Larry's convection 
should quickly shear off after passing by Newfoundland, with the 
hurricane becoming a powerful post-tropical cyclone by 36 hours. 
Both of these models now also suggest the post-tropical cyclone 
will quickly be stretched and then absorbed as its captured by an 
even larger extratropical cyclone produced by the upstream 
trough after 48 hours.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Larry is forecast to move near or over portions of southeastern
Newfoundland Friday night or early Saturday morning as it undergoes
transition to a hurricane-force post-tropical cyclone.  Hurricane
conditions and dangerous storm surge are expected in portions of
southeastern Newfoundland where a Hurricane Warning in effect.
 
2. Large swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the
Leeward Islands, portions of the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas,
Bermuda, and the east coast of the United States and Atlantic
Canada through the end of the week. These swells will cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and beachgoers and
other interests along these coasts are urged to follow the
guidance of lifeguards and local officials.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Mindy Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132021
1100 PM EDT Thu Sep 09 2021
 
The structure of Mindy this evening has become quite diffuse, with a
linear band of convection mostly associated with a prominent outflow
boundary emanating away from the system. The last-light visible
low-level cloud motions gave the impression that Mindy was opening
up into a trough, with southwesterly flow ahead and northeasterly
flow immediately behind the estimated center. Indeed, a ASCAT-A pass
valid at 0002 UTC suggested that Mindy no longer has closed cyclonic
flow on its northeast side, with a lack of easterly wind vectors in
this sector of the system. In addition, a rapidly advancing frontal
boundary has already moved off of the Carolina coast and will
soon be merging with the leftover vort-max associated with Mindy.
The accumulation of all this evidence indicates that Mindy no
longer meets the definition of a tropical cyclone, and this will be
the final advisory on the system.
 
The post-tropical remains of Mindy have continued to accelerate to
the east-northeast this evening at 070/25 kt, moving almost as
quickly as the the maximum sustained winds, which is another reason
why the circulation is likely no longer closed. This motion should
continue for the next 12-24 hours with a gradual slowdown until what
remains of the circulation becomes indistinguishable from the
frontal boundary it is becoming embedded in.
