<br/>
The northern portion of a tropical wave over the western Caribbean <br/>
Sea is forecast to emerge over the southern Bay of Campeche on <br/>
Saturday.  Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive to <br/>
support some gradual development of the system before it moves <br/>
into mainland Mexico early next week. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A strong tropical wave is expected to emerge off of the west coast <br/>
of Africa on Saturday.  Environmental conditions are forecast to be <br/>
conducive for development thereafter, and a tropical depression <br/>
could form by early next week as it moves west-northwestward over <br/>
the far eastern Atlantic near the Cabo Verde Islands.  <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Southeastern Newfoundland from St. Schotts to Pouch Cove
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Southeastern Newfoundland from Lamaline to west of St. Schotts
* Southeastern Newfoundland from north of Pouch Cove to Bonavista
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in southeastern Newfoundland should monitor the
progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Larry was located
near latitude 30.9 North, longitude 61.1 West. Larry is moving
toward the north-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h), and a turn toward
the north-northwest and north with an increase in forward speed is 
forecast today, with a faster northeastward motion expected by 
Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of Larry should pass 
east of Bermuda today, and move near or over southeastern 
Newfoundland Friday night or early Saturday morning.

Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple
of days, but Larry is expected to remain a hurricane during that
time. Larry should become an extratropical cyclone early Saturday,
after passing by Newfoundland, then weaken further while it passes
southeast of Greenland Sunday night.  Larry is expected to be 
absorbed by a larger baroclinic system east of Greenland Monday.

Larry remains very large, with Hurricane-force winds extending 
outward up to 90 miles (150 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extending outward up to 220 miles (350 
km) from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 969 mb (28.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Larry can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?key_messages
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
later this morning.  

Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area in 
southeastern Newfoundland Friday night with tropical storm 
conditions possible by late Friday. Tropical storm conditions are 
possible in the tropical storm watch area in southeastern 
Newfoundland by late Friday. 
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the Leeward
Islands, portions of the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, and Bermuda
through the end of the week. Significant swells from Larry will
continue affecting the east coast of the United States and Atlantic
Canada through the end of the week. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Outer rain bands from Hurricane Larry may periodically 
impact Bermuda Thursday. Significant rainfall totals are currently 
not expected, however briefly heavy rain rates within these bands 
may result in an inch or two of rain through Thursday.  Heavy rains 
from Larry will move quickly across eastern New Foundland Friday 
night, producing 1 to 2 inches of rain.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Larry Discussion Number  34
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122021
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 08 2021
 
The infrared satellite presentation of Larry this evening is giving 
the false impression of a well-organized hurricane, with a ring of 
colder cloud tops (-65 to -70 C) and a warm spot within. However, we 
are fortunate to have in-situ data provided by an Air Force 
Reconnaissance Hurricane Hunter mission investigating Larry this 
evening. Their observations show that Larry's center is actually 
southwest of the warm spot seen on satellite. In fact, the plane was 
unable to identify an eye with Larry, and the highest flight-level 
and SFMR winds were found nearly 80 nautical miles away from the 
center. Moreover, there remains a large discrepancy between the peak 
700-mb flight level winds (108-kt) versus the much lower SFMR peak 
values (67-kt). This suggests that the 90 percent reduction factor 
that is typically applied to 700-mb flight level winds in the 
eyewall may not be appropriate for this hurricane given its very 
large radius of maximum winds more associated with weaker outer 
convection. Given these factors, the latest NHC initial intensity 
has been lowered to 85 kt for this advisory. This intensity is also 
a good compromise between the SAB and TAFB subjective Dvorak 
estimates. 

The hurricane's heading is still off to the northwest with the 
latest motion at 330/14 kt. The track forecast philosophy has not 
changed much for the last few days, with Larry moving around the 
western periphery of a deep-layer subtropical anticyclone over the 
central Atlantic. The hurricane should make its closest approach to 
the east of Bermuda tomorrow as it gradually turns north-northwest 
and north. After that, the hurricane will begin to dramatically 
accelerate to the northeast as Larry is picked up by a deep-layer 
trough moving offshore of the eastern United States. The latest 
forecast track is quite similar to the previous one, and takes Larry 
across the southeast portion of Newfoundland in 48-60 hours. The 
official forecast remains close to the tightly clustered track 
guidance consensus. 

The current structure of Larry appears to be somewhat tilted with 
height, with the low-level center identified by recon located to the 
southwest of the apparent center on IR satellite. While the shear as 
diagnosed by SHIPS appears to be lower, it appears dry air has 
significantly disrupted Larry's inner core structure, to the point 
that it likely will be unable to take advantage of the more 
favorable conditions. The latest NHC intensity forecast is lower 
than the previous one, owing to the lower initial intensity, but 
begins to show more pronounced weakening after 24 hours when the 
hurricane will accelerate poleward of the northern wall of the Gulf 
Stream. However, Larry is still forecast to be a hurricane as it 
passes near or over Newfoundland, though likely beginning to 
undergo extratropical transition. The models continue to maintain 
Larry as a large formidable cyclone after extratropical transition 
is complete while it moves into the far north Atlantic east of 
Greenland. This cyclone will eventually merge with another 
extratropical cyclone by the end of the forecast period.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the
Leeward Islands, portions of the Greater Antilles, the
Bahamas, Bermuda, and the east coast of the United States and
Atlantic Canada through the end of the week. These swells will
likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and
beachgoers and other interests along these coasts are urged to
follow the guidance of lifeguards and local officials this week.
 
2. The center of Larry is forecast to pass east of Bermuda on
Thursday, but given Larry's large size, tropical storm conditions
are expected there on Thursday, along with a risk of coastal
flooding.  A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Bermuda, and
interests there should closely monitor the latest forecast updates.
 
3. Larry is forecast to move near or over portions of southeastern
Newfoundland late Friday and Friday night as it undergoes transition
to a hurricane-force post-tropical cyclone. There is an increasing
risk of impacts from high winds, rainfall, and storm surge in
portions of Newfoundland, and interests there should monitor updates
to the forecast.

Tropical Depression Mindy Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132021
500 AM EDT Thu Sep 09 2021
 
Doppler radar data and surface observations show that the center of
Mindy has moved inland over southern Georgia overnight.  Now that
more of the circulation has moved over land, the cyclone has
weakened and the latest observations indicate that Mindy has
become a tropical depression with an estimated intensity of 30 kt.
Mindy is forecast to move over the western Atlantic by this
afternoon, but strong southwesterly shear is expected to prevent
re-strengthening.  In fact, the shear is forecast to increase to
around 35 kt by tonight, and this is likely to strip away any
remaining deep convection and cause gradual weakening.  Mindy is
forecast to become a remnant low in about 48 hours and dissipate by
day 3, but given the expected shear both of those events could
occur sooner.
 
Mindy continues to move briskly northeastward or 055/17 kt. There
has been no change to the track forecast philosophy since the
previous advisory.  Mindy should continue to move northeastward near
the southern portion of a deep-layer trough that will be moving
across the eastern United States today.  Once the trough begins to
lift northeastward late tonight and Friday, Mindy should slow down
and turn east-northeastward until dissipation occurs. The guidance
envelope has shifted slightly northward this cycle, and the updated
NHC track forecast has been modified accordingly. The new NHC track
lies between the GFEX consensus aid and the GFS ensemble mean.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Mindy is expected to produce heavy rainfall across portions of
southern Georgia and coastal South Carolina this morning. This
rainfall may produce isolated to scattered flash, urban, and small
stream flooding.
 
2. Tropical-storm-force wind gusts are possible across portions of
southeastern Georgia this morning.
