Special Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
320 PM EDT Wed Sep 8 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Special outlook issued to update discussion of the disturbance in <br/>
the Gulf of Mexico. <br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Larry, located over the central Atlantic several hundred miles <br/>
east-southeast of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
Updated:  Satellite and radar data indicate that shower and <br/>
thunderstorm activity continues to gradually become better organized <br/>
in association with an area of low pressure located about 115 miles <br/>
southwest of Apalachicola, Florida. In addition, satellite-derived <br/>
wind data indicate that the circulation has become somewhat better <br/>
defined today. If these development trends continue, advisories will <br/>
likely be initiated on this system as a tropical depression or <br/>
tropical storm later this afternoon, and tropical storm warnings <br/>
could be required for portions of the coast of the Florida <br/>
Panhandle. After reaching the Florida Panhandle tonight, this system <br/>
is expected to move across the southeastern United States and emerge <br/>
over the western Atlantic by late Thursday, where environmental <br/>
conditions appear unfavorable for additional development.  <br/>
Regardless of development, areas of heavy rainfall are likely across <br/>
portions of the Florida panhandle and southern Georgia through <br/>
Thursday, with localized flooding possible. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to emerge off of the western coast of <br/>
Africa in a few days.  Some development of this system is possible <br/>
thereafter as it moves west-northwestward over the far eastern <br/>
Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Interests in southeastern Newfoundland should monitor the progress
of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Larry was located
near latitude 28.9 North, longitude 59.2 West.  Larry is moving
toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and a turn toward the
north-northwest and north with an increase in forward speed is
forecast on Thursday, with a faster northeastward motion expected by
Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of Larry should pass east
of Bermuda on Thursday, and move near or over southeastern
Newfoundland late Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 110 mph (175 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of
days, but Larry is expected to remain a hurricane during that time.
 
Larry is a large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend outward
up to 70 miles (110 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force
winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 966 mb (28.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Larry can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?key_messages
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
tonight or early Thursday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the Leeward
Islands, portions of the Greater Antilles, and the Bahamas through
midweek, and impact Bermuda through the end of the week. Significant
swells from Larry will continue affecting the east coast of the 
United States and Atlantic Canada through the end of the week.  
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local 
weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Outer rain bands from Hurricane Larry may periodically
impact Bermuda tonight into Thursday.  Significant rainfall totals
are currently not expected, however briefly heavy rain rates within
these bands may result in an inch or two of rain through Thursday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Larry Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122021
500 PM AST Wed Sep 08 2021
 
Larry's overall organization has shown little change on satellite
images this afternoon.  The eye remains rather ill-defined but the
hurricane continues to produce some strong convection near/around
the center.  Cirrus-level outflow remains quite well defined,
particularly to the northwest.  The current intensity estimate is
held at 95 kt, which is only slightly above the latest Dvorak
estimates.  Another Air Force Reserve Unit Hurricane Hunter
aircraft is scheduled to investigate Larry this evening to 
provide a new intensity estimate.
 
The hurricane continues heading a little faster toward the
northwest, or at about 325/13 kt.  The track forecast philosophy
remains about the same as before.  Larry should move around the
western side of a deep-layer subtropical anticyclone over the
central Atlantic for the next 36 to 48 hours, passing east of
Bermuda tomorrow.  After that, the hurricane is expected to
accelerate northeastward on the east side of a deep-layer trough
moving through the eastern United States, and Larry will move near 
or over southeastern Newfoundland in roughly 60 hours.  Then, the 
cyclone is forecast to move over the far north Atlantic.  The 
official forecast is close to the dynamical model consensus 
solution and, again, very similar to the previous NHC track.
 
Based on the dynamical model guidance, weak to moderate vertical
shear should prevail over Larry during the next couple of days.
Sea surface temperatures below the cyclone begin to cool
significantly after 48 hours, which should induce weakening.
However, baroclinic forcing associated with the trough to the west
may help the hurricane maintain some of its intensity over cooler
waters, as suggested by the global models.  The official intensity
forecast follows the model consensus and keeps Larry at hurricane
strength even after extratropical transition.  In 5 days or less,
the system should merge with another large cyclonic circulation over
the north Atlantic.

Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the
Leeward Islands, portions of the Greater Antilles, the 
Bahamas, Bermuda, and the east coast of the United States and 
Atlantic Canada through the end of the week. These swells will 
likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and 
beachgoers and other interests along these coasts are urged to 
follow the guidance of lifeguards and local officials this week.
 
2. The center of Larry is forecast to pass east of Bermuda on
Thursday, but given Larry's large size, tropical storm conditions
are expected there there Thursday, along with a risk of coastal
flooding.  A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Bermuda, and
interests there should closely monitor the latest forecast updates.
 
3. Larry is forecast to move near or over portions of southeastern
Newfoundland late Friday and Friday night as it undergoes transition
to a hurricane-force post-tropical cyclone. There is an increasing
risk of impacts from high winds, rainfall, and storm surge in
portions of Newfoundland, and interests there should monitor updates
to the forecast.
