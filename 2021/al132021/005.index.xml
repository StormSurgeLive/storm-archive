DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Larry was located
near latitude 32.9 North, longitude 62.0 West.  Larry is moving
toward the north-northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h), and a turn toward
the north with an increase in forward speed is forecast today, with
a faster northeastward motion expected by Friday.  On the forecast
track, the center of Larry will pass east of Bermuda today, and move
near or over southeastern Newfoundland Friday night or early
Saturday morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of
days, but Larry is expected to remain a hurricane during that time.
Larry should become an extratropical cyclone early Saturday, after
passing by Newfoundland, then weaken further while it passes
southeast of Greenland Sunday night.  Larry is expected to be
absorbed by a larger extratropical low east of Greenland by Monday.
 
Larry is a large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend outward
up to 90 miles (150 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force
winds extend outward up to 220 miles (350 km).  A wind gust to 41 
mph (67 km/h) was recently reported at Flatts Village, Bermuda.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 966 mb (28.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Larry can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2, WMO header WTNT42 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?key_messages
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda today.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area in
southeastern Newfoundland Friday night, with tropical storm
conditions possible by late Friday.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible in the tropical storm watch area in southeastern
Newfoundland by late Friday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the Leeward
Islands, portions of the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, and Bermuda
through the end of the week. Significant swells from Larry will
continue affecting the east coast of the United States and Atlantic
Canada through the end of the week. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
RAINFALL:  Outer rain bands from Hurricane Larry may periodically
impact Bermuda today. Significant rainfall totals are currently
not expected, however brief heavy rain from these bands may result
in an inch or two of rain through Thursday.
 
Heavy rains from Larry will move quickly across eastern Newfoundland
Friday night, producing 1 to 2 inches of rain.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Hurricane Larry Forecast Discussion Number 36</title>

Hurricane Larry Discussion Number  36
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122021
1100 AM AST Thu Sep 09 2021
 
Larry continues to feature a banding-type eye on satellite images,
and the eye is clearly evident on the Bermuda radar.  Satellite and
radar data also show a moat-like area of low precipitation between
the eyewall and a large band of convection farther removed from the
center.  This outer band is expected to affect Bermuda or the
waters just east of the island over the next several hours.
Observations from an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate
that the central pressure has changed little since yesterday.
Flight-level winds from the aircraft were as high as 95 kt, but the
peak SFMR-observed surface winds were only 69 kt.  This again
indicates that in this case the strong winds aloft are not being
transported to the surface as effectively as in a typical hurricane
at lower latitudes.  Blending these data results in an intensity
estimate of 80 kt for this advisory.  This is just a little higher
than the latest subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB.
 
The hurricane is gradually turning to the right and the initial
motion is 340/14 kt.  Larry is currently moving around the western
side of a deep-layer subtropical anticyclone over the central
Atlantic, and is passing east of Bermuda.  The flow on the east
side of a strong mid-level trough moving from the northeastern
United States to Atlantic Canada will cause Larry to turn toward
the northeast and accelerate in 24 to 48 hours.  Larry will move 
near or over southeastern Newfoundland in 36 to 48 hours, and 
then move over the far north Atlantic around the end of the 
forecast period.  There is very little change to the NHC track 
forecast from the previous advisory, which remains close to the 
various consensus model solutions.

Larry is likely remain over warm waters with low shear for 
another 24 hours or so.  Thus the system will probably maintain 
much of its intensity into Friday.  By Friday night and over the 
weekend, cooler SSTs and increasing shear should cause weakening.  
However, baroclinic forcing associated with the trough to the west 
of the hurricane could slow the weakening process.  The official 
intensity forecast keeps Larry at hurricane-force through 48 hours 
even as it undergoes extratropical transition.  In 3-4 days, the 
global models show Larry merging with another large extratropical 
cyclone over the north Atlantic.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Larry will continue to affect the
Leeward Islands, portions of the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas,
Bermuda, and the east coast of the United States and Atlantic
Canada through the end of the week. These swells will likely cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and beachgoers
and other interests along these coasts are urged to follow the
guidance of lifeguards and local officials this week.
 
2. The center of Larry is forecast to pass east of Bermuda later
today, and tropical storm conditions are expected there today, 
along with a risk of coastal flooding.
 
3. Larry is forecast to move near or over portions of southeastern
Newfoundland Friday night or early Saturday morning as it undergoes
transition to a hurricane-force post-tropical cyclone. Hurricane 
conditions are storm surge are possible in portions of southeastern 
Newfoundland where a hurricane watch is in effect. Interests there 
should monitor updates to the forecast.

<title>Tropical Depression Mindy Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>

Tropical Depression Mindy Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132021
1100 AM EDT Thu Sep 09 2021
 
Doppler radar data and surface observations show that the center of
Mindy has recently moved offshore the coast of Georgia.  Buoy 
41008 located off the Georgia coast recently recorded 1-min 
sustained winds of 29 kt with gusts as high as 33 kt.  Thus, 30 kt 
is maintained as the intensity for this advisory. 

Mindy is located in an environment of strong south to southwesterly 
vertical wind shear.  Over the next 24 h, the shear is expected to 
become even stronger.  The strong shear should prevent 
restrengthening and is likely to strip away any remaining convection 
by Friday or Friday night.  Mindy is forecast to become 
post-tropical Friday evening.  Most of the global models suggest 
that the cyclone will open up into a trough in 36-48 h, but it is 
possible this could happen sooner, as surface observations already 
show that easterly winds on the north side have become quite weak.  
The NHC forecast calls for dissipation Friday night, which is sooner 
than the previous advisory.
 
Mindy continues moving quickly to the east-northeast or 065/18 kt. 
There has been no change to the track forecast philosophy.  Mindy is 
forecast to continue moving east-northeastward at a similar speed 
for the next 24 h near the southern portion of a deep-layer trough 
moving across the eastern United States.  Once the trough begins to 
lift northeastward, Mindy should slow down a little on Friday.  The 
main adjustment to the NHC track is to show a slightly faster motion 
toward the east-northeast at the 24-36 h points.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Mindy will produce locally heavy rainfall across portions of
coastal South Carolina through early this afternoon. This rainfall
may produce isolated to scattered flash, urban, and small stream
flooding.
