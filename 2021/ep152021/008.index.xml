An area of low pressure is expected to form south of the southern <br/>
coast of Mexico over the weekend.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
expected to be favorable for at least gradual development of this <br/>
system, and a tropical depression could form late this weekend or <br/>
early next week while it moves west-northwestward or northwestward <br/>
near the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Olaf was located
near latitude 21.2 North, longitude 108.3 West. Olaf is moving
toward the north-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h). A turn toward the
northwest is forecast by tonight, followed by a slower westward
motion Friday night and Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center
of Olaf will approach southern Baja California Sur today, move near
or over the southern part of the peninsula tonight and on Friday,
and then move westward away from land Friday night and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 75 mph (120 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is likely before Olaf
nears the southern coast of the Baja California peninsula tonight.
Weakening is likely on Friday and through the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Olaf can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?key_messages
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within
the hurricane warning area tonight.  Winds are expected to first
reach tropical storm strength by this afternoon or this evening,
making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to
protect life and property should be rushed to completion.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in southern
portions of the tropical storm warning area tonight and will spread
northward within the warning area on Friday.
 
RAINFALL:  Olaf is expected to produce total rainfall amounts of 3
to 6 inches with maximum amounts of 10 inches across portions of far
southern Baja California Sur today through Friday.  This rainfall
may trigger flash flooding and mudslides.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
coastal flooding within the warning areas in regions of onshore
winds.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
damaging waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Olaf are beginning to reach portions of
the coasts of southern Baja California Sur, Nayarit, and Sinaloa,
and will spread northward along the west coast of Baja California
Sur through Saturday.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1200 PM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 300 PM MDT.

<title>Hurricane Olaf Forecast Discussion Number 8</title>

Hurricane Olaf Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152021
900 AM MDT Thu Sep 09 2021
 
Recent microwave imagery shows that Olaf's structure has improved
considerably during the past 6 hours, and it now has well-defined
eye. The eye is also now evident in radar imagery from Cabo San
Lucas. Although an eye is not yet evident in infrared or visible
imagery, satellite intensity estimates had increased and supported
an intensity of 60-65 kt at 1200 UTC. Given the continued
impressive satellite appearance since then, the estimated intensity
is 65 kt for this advisory, making Olaf a hurricane.
 
Olaf has a microwave ring structure that is known to indicate
intensification in the short term. The wind shear that previously
affected the hurricane seems to have lessened and the environment
should also support further strengthening today. The hurricane is
therefore forecast to quickly intensify during the next 12 h or so
while it approaches the southern tip of the Baja California
peninsula. After that, interaction with land and cold sea surface
temperatures should cause the cyclone to quickly weaken over the
weekend. Olaf is forecast to become post-tropical in about 60 h as
it moves farther away from land. The NHC intensity forecast is
above the previous advisory, and is above most of the guidance
through 24 h. Beyond that, there have been only slight adjustments
to the official intensity forecast, which is based on the multi-
model consensus.
 
The track forecast has shifted closer to the southern Baja
California peninsula. In line with the intensity forecast, the NHC
forecast now slightly favors the stronger GFS and regional hurricane
models, compared to the weaker ECMWF, but is still near the HCCA and
TVCN consensus aids. Olaf is moving north-northeast but should turn
northwestward later today, steered by a mid-level ridge centered
over the western United States. The models with a stronger hurricane
show Olaf turning slightly slower, and bring the center very near or
even over Baja California Sur tonight. As Olaf weakens it should
begin to be steered by lower-level flow, which will cause it to
eventually turn westward and then southwestward as it moves away
from land early next week.
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Olaf is forecast to pass very near or over the southern portion
of Baja California Sur tonight and Friday, and hurricane conditions
are likely within the hurricane warning area tonight. Tropical storm
conditions are expected to begin within the hurricane warning area
this afternoon, and preparations should be rushed to completion.
 
2.  Heavy rains associated with Olaf are expected across portions of
southern Baja California Sur through Friday. This will pose a threat
of significant and life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides.
