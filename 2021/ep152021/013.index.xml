Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 AM PDT Fri Sep 10 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
downgraded Tropical Storm Olaf, located near the southwestern coast <br/>
of Baja California Sur, Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms located within a couple of <br/>
hundred miles of the coasts of Guatemala and southern Mexico are <br/>
associated with the southern portion of an approaching tropical <br/>
wave.  A broad area of low pressure is expected to form along this <br/>
wave to the south of the southern coast of Mexico during the next <br/>
day or so.  Thereafter, environmental conditions could support some <br/>
development of this system, and a tropical depression could form <br/>
late this weekend or early next week while it moves generally <br/>
northwestward near the southern and southwestern coasts of Mexico. <br/>
Regardless of development, this system will likely produce heavy <br/>
rains across portions of Central America and southern Mexico during <br/>
the next few days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

SUMMARY OF 300 PM MDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.6N 112.7W
ABOUT 30 MI...45 KM WSW OF CABO SAN LAZARO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warning for Baja California Sur Mexico south of Santa Fe and
around the peninsula to Loreto.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Baja California Sur Mexico from Puerto San Andresito southward to
Santa Fe
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected or occurring somewhere within the tropical storm warning
area.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM MDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Olaf was 
located near latitude 24.6 North, longitude 112.7 West.  Olaf is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A turn 
toward the west is expected tonight and Saturday, followed by a 
southwestward motion beginning on Saturday night and continuing into 
early next week.  On the forecast track, the center of Olaf will 
move away from the southwestern coast of Baja California Sur 
tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Additional weakening is expected during the next 
couple of days, and Olaf is forecast to degenerate to a 
post-tropical remnant low on Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.  A weather station at Puerto Cortes reported a
wind gust of 38 mph (61 km/h) during the past couple of hours.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Olaf can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?key_messages
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring within portions of
the tropical storm warning area, but are expected to subside during
the next several hours.
 
RAINFALL:  Olaf is expected to produce an additional 2 to 4 inches
of rain with isolated maximum amounts of 6 inches across portions of
southern Baja California Sur through tonight. This rainfall may
trigger life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge is expected to produce coastal flooding in
regions of onshore winds within the warning area.  Near the coast,
the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Olaf will affect portions of the coasts
of Nayarit and Sinaloa through this evening, and portions of the
west coast of Baja California Sur through Saturday.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 600 PM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 900 PM MDT.

Tropical Storm Olaf Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152021
900 AM MDT Fri Sep 10 2021
 
The satellite presentation of Olaf has significantly degraded over 
the past several hours after the center moved across the southern 
portion of Baja California Sur overnight. The system's organized 
convection has collapsed, and infrared satellite imagery indicates 
cloud top temperatures are rapidly warming near the estimated center 
position. The initial intensity is lowered to 60 kt for this 
advisory, which now makes Olaf a tropical storm. This estimate may 
still be generous, but limited surface observations and radar data 
make it difficult to confidently assess the intensity. Hopefully, 
scatterometer data this afternoon will provide more insight into 
changes in Olaf's surface wind field. 
 
The tropical storm has slowed down a bit since last night, and its 
estimated motion is northwest (310 degrees) at 9 kt. Recent 
microwave imagery suggests the center of Olaf is just offshore the 
southwestern coast of Baja California Sur, and the cyclone is likely 
to move roughly parallel to the coast today. Then, a strong 
mid-level high pressure ridge centered over the southern Rockies is 
expected to build westward to the north of Olaf. This ridge should 
turn Olaf toward the west by tonight, and then toward the southwest 
through early next week. The official NHC track forecast has been 
adjusted to the south of the previous forecast once again, in 
agreement with the latest multi-model consensus aids.
 
Olaf is likely to continue rapidly weakening during the next couple 
of days. In the short-term, its proximity to the mountainous terrain 
of the Baja California peninsula will disrupt its ability to sustain 
organized convection. As Olaf moves away from land, the cyclone will 
encounter decreasing sea-surface temperatures and very dry mid-level 
air, which should expedite its transition into a post-tropical 
cyclone. In fact, the latest GFS and ECMWF model simulated satellite 
imagery show Olaf becoming completely devoid of convection within 
the next 24-36 h. The latest NHC intensity forecast shows more rapid 
weakening than the previous one, primarily based on recent satellite 
trends and the lower initial intensity. The official forecast 
remains below the HCCA and IVCN consensus aids, which are inflated 
by the SHIPS and LGEM models that fail to weaken Olaf during the 
next 24 h.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Olaf is forecast to move along the southwestern coast of the 
Baja California peninsula today, with tropical storm conditions 
continuing over southern portions of Baja California Sur through 
this evening.  These winds should diminish tonight as Olaf continues 
weakening and turns westward away from land.
 
2.  Heavy rains associated with Olaf are expected across portions of 
southern Baja California Sur through today. This will pose a threat 
of significant and life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides.
