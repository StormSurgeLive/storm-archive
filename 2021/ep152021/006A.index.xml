DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1200 AM MDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Olaf was
located near latitude 20.3 North, longitude 108.2 West.  Olaf is
moving toward the north-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A northwest
to north-northwest motion along with an increase in forward speed is
expected through Friday.  A turn toward the west-northwest is
forecast by Friday night, followed by a turn toward the west on
Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of Olaf will move just
to the southwest of southern Baja California Sur tonight and on 
Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast during the next day or so, and 
Olaf could be near hurricane strength by this evening or tonight. 
The storm is expected to begin weakening on Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Olaf can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO
header WTPZ45 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?key_messages
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the Hurricane Watch
area in Baja California Sur tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are 
expected to begin in southern portions of the Tropical Storm 
Warning area later this afternoon or evening and will spread 
northward within the warning area tonight.
 
RAINFALL:  Olaf is expected to produce total rainfall amounts
of 3 to 6 inches with maximum amounts of 10 inches across portions
of far southern Baja California Sur today through Friday.  This
rainfall may trigger flash flooding and mudslides.
 
SURF:  Olaf is expected to generate swells that will affect portions
of the coasts of Baja California Sur and Sinaloa later today,
spreading northward along the west coast of Baja California Sur
through Friday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Olaf Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Olaf Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152021
900 PM MDT Wed Sep 08 2021
 
Olaf appears to be gradually strengthening.  Deep convection has
been increasing over the center, and banding features are becoming a
little more pronounced.  The latest Dvorak estimates range from 35
to 45 kt. Since the system appears to be better organized from
the time of the ASCAT pass earlier today, the initial intensity is
nudged up and set near the high end of the estimates at 45 kt.
 
Satellite images and recent microwave data suggest that the center
of Olaf is a little to the east of the previous track, and the
latest initial motion estimate is 335/6 kt.  Olaf is expected to
move generally northwestward for another 24 to 36 hours, which
should bring the system just off the coast of southern Baja
California Sur during that time.  There is some spread in the models
on how close the storm will get to the coastline, with the GFS to
the east of the official forecast and the UKMET and ECMWF to the
west and farther offshore.  Beyond 36 hours, Olaf is expected to be
located to the south of a strong mid-level ridge and that will cause
a turn to the west-northwest away from Mexico.  The NHC track
forecast is adjusted again to the east of the previous one in the
short term and then to the south of the previous one at the longer
lead times. The new track forecast lies near the middle of the
guidance envelope, near the various consensus aids.
 
Olaf is located over warm waters, and embedded in a low wind shear
and fairly moist environment.  These conditions should allow for
additional strengthening during the next day or so.  Although not
explicitly forecast, Olaf could become a hurricane when it is just
off the coast of southern Baja California Sur, and a hurricane
watch remains in effect for the possibility of those winds
occurring on land.  By Friday, a combination of cooler waters and a
much drier environment should cause steady weakening, and the
system is likely to become a remnant low over the weekend.  The NHC
intensity forecast lies close to the IVCN and IVDR consensus models.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Olaf is forecast to strengthen to near hurricane intensity while
it passes offshore of the southern portion of Baja California Sur
Thursday and Friday. Tropical storm conditions are expected and
hurricane conditions are possible across that area beginning late
Thursday. Interests there should continue to monitor the progress of
Olaf.
 
2.  Heavy rains associated with Tropical Storm Olaf are possible
across portions of far southern Baja California Sur Thursday through
Friday.  This will pose a threat of flash flooding and mudslides.
