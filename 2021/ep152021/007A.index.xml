<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Olaf, located a couple of hundred miles southeast of Cabo San <br/>
Lucas, Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
An area of low pressure is expected to form south of the southern <br/>
coast of Mexico over the weekend.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
expected to be favorable for at least gradual development of this <br/>
system, and a tropical depression could form late this weekend or <br/>
early next week while it moves west-northwestward or northwestward <br/>
near the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM MDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Olaf was
located near latitude 20.8 North, longitude 108.1 West.  Olaf is
moving toward the north-northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this
motion is expected to continue today.  A turn toward the northwest
is forecast by tonight, followed by a slower westward motion Friday
night and Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of Olaf will
approach southern Baja California Sur today, move near or over the
southern part of the peninsula tonight and on Friday, and then move
westward away from land Friday night and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast, and Olaf 
is expected to become a hurricane later today.  Weakening is 
forecast to start on Friday when Olaf begins to move away from Baja 
California Sur.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.26 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Olaf can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header
WTPZ45 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?key_messages
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within
the hurricane warning area tonight.  Winds are expected to first
reach tropical storm strength by this afternoon or this evening,
making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to
protect life and property should be rushed to completion.  Tropical
storm conditions are expected to begin in southern portions of the
tropical storm warning area tonight and will spread northward
within the warning area on Friday.
 
RAINFALL:  Olaf is expected to produce total rainfall amounts of 3
to 6 inches with maximum amounts of 10 inches across portions of
far southern Baja California Sur today through Friday.  This
rainfall may trigger flash flooding and mudslides.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
coastal flooding within the warnings areas in regions of onshore
winds.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
damaging waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Olaf are beginning to reach portions of
the coasts of southern Baja California Sur, Nayarit, and Sinaloa,
and will spread northward along the west coast of Baja California
Sur through Saturday.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.

<title>Tropical Storm Olaf Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Tropical Storm Olaf Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152021
300 AM MDT Thu Sep 09 2021
 
Olaf's convective canopy has been expanding somewhat and become a 
little more circular since last evening with clouds tops as cold as 
-80 degrees Celsius.  Dvorak estimates have bounced up to T3.5 from 
TAFB, SAB, and the UW-CIMSS ADT, and Olaf's maximum winds are 
therefore now estimated to be 55 kt.  Recent scatterometer data also 
indicated that the tropical-storm-force wind field is a little 
bigger than previously estimated.
 
Also with the help of the scatterometer data, Olaf's center appears 
to have tracked a bit to the east, and the initial motion is 
estimated to be north-northwestward, or 340/5 kt.  This has been 
the recent trend over the past day or so, with the motion having 
a more northward component than anticipated--but not surprising 
given what previous GFS model runs have been suggesting.  A strong 
mid-level high over the western United States is expected to 
eventually force Olaf toward the northwest and then west, but 
probably not soon enough to avoid impacts on the southern Baja 
California peninsula.  Mostly due to the adjusted initial position, 
the track models--and the NHC official forecast--have again shifted 
closer to the southern tip of the peninsula, with a closest approach 
in about 24 hours.  This updated forecast is very close to the HCCA 
consensus aid and would be close enough for the core of the storm to 
at least graze land.  It's also concerning that the GFS, HMON, and 
COAMPS-TC models are still to the right of the official forecast and 
the other models and show Olaf's center potentially moving over the 
southern tip of the peninsula in about 24 hours.  Olaf should 
finally begin to move westward away from the peninsula in about 48 
hours.

Although satellite images and model analyses suggest that some 
moderate westerly shear is undercutting the outflow layer, Olaf has 
been able to strengthen nonetheless.  If Olaf's center does not 
move over the Baja California peninsula, the storm will have the 
opportunity to strengthen for another 24-36 hours while ocean 
waters are warm and deep-layer shear is low.  Therefore, the new 
NHC intensity forecast is near the upper end of the guidance 
envelope and shows Olaf becoming a hurricane later today.  Further 
strengthening beyond what's shown in the official forecast is 
possible, with rapid intensification indices now close to a 50 
percent chance of a 25-kt increase in winds over the next 24 hours. 
By 48 hours, colder waters should cause Olaf's convection to 
decrease, and global models suggest it could degenerate to a 
convection-less post-tropical low by day 3.
 
The updated track and intensity forecasts have necessitated the 
issuance of a Hurricane Warning by the government of Mexico for 
southern portions of Baja California Sur, and an extension of 
Tropical Storm Warnings northward along both east and west coasts 
of the peninsula.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Olaf is forecast to strengthen to a hurricane later today and 
then pass very near or over the southern portion of Baja California 
Sur tonight and on Friday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected 
to begin within the hurricane warning area this afternoon, and 
preparations should therefore be rushed to completion this morning.
 
2.  Heavy rains associated with Olaf are possible across portions of 
far southern Baja California Sur today through Friday.  This will 
pose a threat of flash flooding and mudslides.
