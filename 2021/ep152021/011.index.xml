<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Olaf, located over southern Baja California Sur, Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms near the Pacific coast of <br/>
Central America and the adjacent waters are associated with the <br/>
southern portion of a tropical wave.  A broad area of low pressure <br/>
is expected to form along this wave south of the southern coast of <br/>
Mexico during the next day or two, and the low could then develop <br/>
further into a tropical depression late this weekend or early next <br/>
week while it moves west-northwestward or northwestward near the <br/>
southern and southwestern coasts of Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Olaf was located
near latitude 23.7 North, longitude 110.7 West.  Olaf is moving
toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this motion is
expected to continue today.  A turn toward the west at a slower 
forward speed is forecast on Saturday, followed by a turn toward 
the southwest on Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Olaf 
will move along the southwestern coast of Baja California Sur today 
and then turn westward away from land by tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Olaf is forecast to remain a hurricane while it 
moves along the southwestern coast of Baja California Sur today.  
It is expected to weaken to a tropical storm by tonight when it 
begins to move away from land and then degenerate to a 
post-tropical cyclone by Saturday night.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 981 mb (28.97 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Olaf can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?key_messages
 
WIND:  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are occurring within
southern portions of their respective warning areas and will spread
northward across portions of Baja California Sur today.  Hurricane
and tropical storm conditions should end over Baja California Sur
by tonight.
 
RAINFALL:  Olaf is expected to produce total rainfall amounts of 5
to 10 inches with maximum amounts of 15 inches across portions of
southern Baja California Sur through today.  This rainfall may
trigger significant and life-threatening flash flooding and
mudslides.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
coastal flooding within the warning areas in regions of onshore
winds.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
damaging waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Olaf are affecting portions of the coasts
of southern Baja California Sur, Nayarit, and Sinaloa, and will
spread northward along the west coast of Baja California Sur through
Saturday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 600 AM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.

Hurricane Olaf Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152021
300 AM MDT Fri Sep 10 2021
 
Olaf made landfall very near San Jose del Cabo, Baja California 
Sur, around 0300 UTC based on radar images from Los Cabos and 
surface pressure reports from the region.  Since then, the radar 
data showed that the center crossed the peninsula and re-emerged 
just off the southwestern coast a few hours ago with heavy 
rainbands continuing to stream northward across the area between 
Cabo San Lucas and La Paz.  Assuming some weakening over land, the 
initial intensity is set at 75 kt, which matches the latest Dvorak 
Current Intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB.

The hurricane continues to move toward the northwest but has turned 
more to the left, or 315/11 kt.  A strong mid-level high centered 
over the southern Rockies is forecast to build westward over the 
Pacific during the next few days, which should cause Olaf to turn 
westward by 36 hours and then southwestward by 60 hours until the 
end of the forecast period.  On this track, Olaf will move along 
the southwestern coast of Baja California Sur for the next 12-18 
hours but then turn westward away from land by tonight.  This part 
of the forecast is unchanged from the previous advisory.  There is 
some disagreement among the models on how far south Olaf will move 
on days 3 through 5 (as a remnant low), and the new NHC forecast 
has been nudged southward at those times toward the GFS, ECMWF, and 
HCCA model solutions.

Olaf's proximity to the mountainous terrain of the Baja California 
peninsula during the next 12 to 18 hours will likely cause 
additional steady weakening, and the winds are forecast to fall 
below hurricane force by this evening.  The storm will then move 
over waters colder than 26 degrees Celsius when it turns west of 
Cabo San Lazaro tonight, which should spur additional weakening.  
The SHIPS and LGEM models appear to be keeping Olaf's winds too 
high for the next day or so, and as a result the NHC intensity 
forecast is set below the HCCA consensus aid, closer to the GFS 
and ECMWF intensity trends.  In fact, model-simulated satellite 
imagery suggests that the cold water could cause all of Olaf's deep 
convection to dissipate in 36-48 hours, and the cyclone is therefore 
forecast to degenerate to a post-tropical cyclone by Saturday night.

 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Olaf is forecast to move along the southwestern coast of the 
Baja California peninsula today, with hurricane and tropical storm 
conditions continuing over southern portions of Baja California Sur 
through this evening.  These winds should diminish tonight once 
Olaf weakens and turns westward away from land.

2.  Heavy rains associated with Olaf are expected across portions of
southern Baja California Sur today.  This will pose a threat of 
significant and life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides.
