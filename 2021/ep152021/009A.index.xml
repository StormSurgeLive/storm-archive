For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Olaf, located a little more than 100 miles southeast of Cabo San <br/>
Lucas, Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
An area of low pressure is expected to form south of the southern <br/>
coast of Mexico over the weekend.  Subsequent gradual development of <br/>
this system will be possible, and a tropical depression could form <br/>
late this weekend or early next week while it moves <br/>
west-northwestward or northwestward near the coast of southern and <br/>
southwestern Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM MDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Olaf was located
near latitude 22.7 North, longitude 109.3 West. Olaf is moving
toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A slight turn
toward the northwest is expected tonight, and Olaf is forecast to
continue moving toward the northwest on Friday. A turn toward the
west is expected over the weekend. On the forecast track, the center
of Olaf will move near or over the southern coast of the Baja 
California peninsula during the next few hours, and then move very 
near or over southern Baja California Sur tonight and on Friday. The
hurricane will begin to move westward away from land late Friday or
early Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Strengthening is possible before the hurricane reaches the 
coast tonight. Weakening is expected on Friday after Olaf begins to 
interact with land. Further weakening is likely over the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105
miles (165 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 977 mb (28.85 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Olaf can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?key_messages
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within
the hurricane warning area in the next few hours and then spread 
northward through Friday. Tropical Storm conditions are occuring 
near the southern coast of Baja California Sur and will spread 
northward during the next several hours, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous. Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in southern
portions of the tropical storm warning area Friday night.
 
RAINFALL:  Olaf is expected to produce total rainfall amounts of 5
to 10 inches with maximum amounts of 15 inches across portions of
southern Baja California Sur through Friday. This rainfall may
trigger significant and life-threatening flash flooding and
mudslides.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
coastal flooding within the warning areas in regions of onshore
winds.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
damaging waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Olaf are affecting portions of the coasts
of southern Baja California Sur, Nayarit, and Sinaloa, and will
spread northward along the west coast of Baja California Sur through
Saturday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

<title>Hurricane Olaf Forecast Discussion Number 9</title>

Hurricane Olaf Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152021
300 PM MDT Thu Sep 09 2021
 
Olaf is quickly strengthening. An eye is now apparent in visible and 
satellite imagery. For most of the morning and early afternoon, a 
large and very symmetric eyewall was also apparent in radar data 
from Cabo San Lucas. Dvorak intensity estimates at 1800 UTC were 
4.5/77 kt from both TAFB and SAB at 1800 UTC, and estimates from the 
U-W CIMSS ADT have increased to 80 kt since then. The initial 
intensity has been set at 80 kt, in close agreement with all 
available estimates.
 
Olaf has moved consistently to the right of the forecast track for 
the past 12 hours, and the NHC track forecast has been shifted in 
that direction again. Olaf is now forecast to move very near or over 
southern Baja California Sur tonight. Regardless of the hurricane's 
exact track, it is very likely that a portions of southern Baja 
California Sur will get direct impacts from the eyewall of Olaf 
tonight. A large ridge centered over the southwestern U.S. is still 
expected to cause Olaf to make a slight turn toward the northwest 
tonight or early Friday. The hurricane should then make a westward 
turn by early Saturday as it weakens and the ridge extends westward. 
Despite the recent adjustments required to the NHC forecast, this 
forecast is still generally supported by all of the 
typically-reliable track guidance. By around 60 h, Olaf will likely 
have lost all of its deep convection and become a shallow 
post-tropical low, steered primarily southwestward by low-level 
flow.
 
The environment should support additional intensification during the 
next 12 h as Olaf approaches the Baja California peninsula, so any 
fluctuations in intensity will likely be driven by internal dynamics 
at this point. The appearance of Olaf's eyewall in radar imagery has 
degraded a little during the past couple of hours, but it is 
possible this is due to attenuation of the radar signal and not 
fully representative of the hurricane's structure. Regardless, Olaf 
should begin to weaken once it interacts with land or moves inland. 
By late Friday, the rate of weakening is forecast to increase due to 
a combination of continued land interactions and cool sea surface 
temperatures. Olaf should quickly weaken over the weekend as it 
continues to move over cold water, and it will likely become a 
post-tropical cyclone on Sunday. The NHC intensity forecast is above 
the consensus at 12 h to allow for additional short-term 
strengthening, but follows the consensus closely at 36 h and beyond.
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Olaf is forecast to move very near or over the southern portion
of Baja California Sur tonight and Friday. Hurricane conditions
are expected to begin within the southern portion of the hurricane
warning area tonight and will spread northward through Friday.
 
2.  Heavy rains associated with Olaf are expected across portions of
southern Baja California Sur through Friday. This will pose a threat
of significant and life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides.
