Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 PM PDT Fri Sep 10 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Olaf, located just off the southwestern coast of Baja <br/>
California Sur, Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms located within a couple of <br/>
hundred miles of the coasts of Guatemala and southern Mexico are <br/>
associated with the southern portion of an approaching tropical <br/>
wave.  A broad area of low pressure is expected to form along this <br/>
wave to the south of the southern coast of Mexico during the next <br/>
day or so.  Thereafter, environmental conditions could support some <br/>
development of this system, and a tropical depression could form <br/>
late this weekend or early next week while it moves generally <br/>
northwestward near the southern and southwestern coasts of Mexico. <br/>
Regardless of development, this system will likely produce heavy <br/>
rains across portions of Central America and southern Mexico during <br/>
the next few days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

...OLAF WEAKENS TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION...
...ALL TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS HAVE BEEN DISCONTINUED...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 PM MDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.7N 113.3W
ABOUT 65 MI...100 KM W OF CABO SAN LAZARO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 270 DEGREES AT 6 MPH...9 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1003 MB...29.62 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Government of Mexico has discontinued all Tropical Storm
Warnings for Baja California Sur Mexico.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM MDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Olaf was
located near latitude 24.7 North, longitude 113.3 West. The
depression is now moving toward the west near 8 mph (13 km/h). A
turn toward the southwest is expected by Saturday night, with this 
motion continuing into early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) with
higher gusts. Additional weakening is expected during the next
couple of days, and Olaf is forecast to degenerate to a
post-tropical remnant low tomorrow morning.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Olaf will affect portions of the coasts
of Nayarit and Sinaloa through this evening, and portions of the
west coast of Baja California Sur through tomorrow.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 300 AM MDT.

Tropical Storm Olaf Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152021
300 PM MDT Fri Sep 10 2021
 
The low-level center of Olaf is completely exposed in visible 
satellite imagery this afternoon. The system has been devoid of 
organized convection since around 1200 UTC, and Olaf is at risk of 
losing its status as a tropical cyclone overnight if it is unable to 
generate new convection within the next 12 h. Despite its lack of 
convection, a weather station at Puerto Cortes measured sustained 
tropical-storm-force winds several hours ago as the center of Olaf 
passed very near the observation site, and it has more recently 
reported several tropical-storm-force gusts. The initial intensity 
is lowered to 40 kt for this advisory based on the aforementioned 
surface observations and T2.5/35 kt Dvorak classifications from TAFB 
and SAB.
 
Olaf has rapidly weakened today, and this weakening trend is 
expected to continue during the next couple of days. The cyclone 
will be moving over sub-26 deg C sea-surface temperatures and into a 
drier, more stable environment that should largely suppress new 
convective development. Model simulated satellite imagery from the 
GFS and ECMWF indicate that Olaf will struggle to produce any new 
convection by tomorrow, and the intensity guidance consensus favors 
continued weakening as the vortex spins down. The official NHC 
intensity forecast shows Olaf becoming a 25-kt remnant low by 24 h. 
The remnant low is forecast to linger around for several days after, 
but remain weak as it moves over the open waters of the eastern 
Pacific.
 
The tropical storm has begun moving more westward away from Baja
California Sur, and its initial motion is estimated to be
west-northwest (295 degrees) at 9 kt. A mid-level ridge building to
the north of Olaf should steer the cyclone westward tonight into
Saturday. By late Saturday, the shallow cyclone will begin moving
southwestward as it is steered around a low-level ridge to its
northwest. The official NHC track forecast lies near the middle of
the guidance envelope, closest to the multi-model consensus aids.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Olaf is moving away from the Baja California peninsula, and
lingering tropical storm conditions along portions of the
southwestern coast of Baja California Sur are forecast to diminish
this evening.
 
2.  Heavy rains associated with Olaf are expected across portions of
southern Baja California Sur through tonight. This rainfall may
trigger life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides.
