Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
500 PM PDT Fri Sep 10 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Olaf, located just off the southwestern coast of Baja <br/>
California Sur, Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms located within a couple of <br/>
hundred miles of the coasts of Guatemala and southern Mexico are <br/>
associated with the southern portion of an approaching tropical <br/>
wave.  A broad area of low pressure is expected to form along this <br/>
wave to the south of the southern coast of Mexico during the next <br/>
day or so.  Thereafter, environmental conditions could support some <br/>
development of this system, and a tropical depression could form <br/>
late this weekend or early next week while it moves generally <br/>
northwestward near the southern and southwestern coasts of Mexico. <br/>
Regardless of development, this system will likely produce heavy <br/>
rains across portions of Central America and southern Mexico during <br/>
the next few days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

SUMMARY OF 300 PM MDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...24.6N 112.7W
ABOUT 30 MI...45 KM WSW OF CABO SAN LAZARO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warning for Baja California Sur Mexico south of Santa Fe and
around the peninsula to Loreto.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Baja California Sur Mexico from Puerto San Andresito southward to
Santa Fe
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected or occurring somewhere within the tropical storm warning
area.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM MDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Olaf was 
located near latitude 24.6 North, longitude 112.7 West.  Olaf is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A turn 
toward the west is expected tonight and Saturday, followed by a 
southwestward motion beginning on Saturday night and continuing into 
early next week.  On the forecast track, the center of Olaf will 
move away from the southwestern coast of Baja California Sur 
tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Additional weakening is expected during the next 
couple of days, and Olaf is forecast to degenerate to a 
post-tropical remnant low on Saturday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.  A weather station at Puerto Cortes reported a
wind gust of 38 mph (61 km/h) during the past couple of hours.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Olaf can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?key_messages
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring within portions of
the tropical storm warning area, but are expected to subside during
the next several hours.
 
RAINFALL:  Olaf is expected to produce an additional 2 to 4 inches
of rain with isolated maximum amounts of 6 inches across portions of
southern Baja California Sur through tonight. This rainfall may
trigger life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides.
 
STORM SURGE:  Storm surge is expected to produce coastal flooding in
regions of onshore winds within the warning area.  Near the coast,
the surge will be accompanied by large waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Olaf will affect portions of the coasts
of Nayarit and Sinaloa through this evening, and portions of the
west coast of Baja California Sur through Saturday.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 600 PM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 900 PM MDT.

Tropical Storm Olaf Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152021
300 PM MDT Fri Sep 10 2021
 
The low-level center of Olaf is completely exposed in visible 
satellite imagery this afternoon. The system has been devoid of 
organized convection since around 1200 UTC, and Olaf is at risk of 
losing its status as a tropical cyclone overnight if it is unable to 
generate new convection within the next 12 h. Despite its lack of 
convection, a weather station at Puerto Cortes measured sustained 
tropical-storm-force winds several hours ago as the center of Olaf 
passed very near the observation site, and it has more recently 
reported several tropical-storm-force gusts. The initial intensity 
is lowered to 40 kt for this advisory based on the aforementioned 
surface observations and T2.5/35 kt Dvorak classifications from TAFB 
and SAB.
 
Olaf has rapidly weakened today, and this weakening trend is 
expected to continue during the next couple of days. The cyclone 
will be moving over sub-26 deg C sea-surface temperatures and into a 
drier, more stable environment that should largely suppress new 
convective development. Model simulated satellite imagery from the 
GFS and ECMWF indicate that Olaf will struggle to produce any new 
convection by tomorrow, and the intensity guidance consensus favors 
continued weakening as the vortex spins down. The official NHC 
intensity forecast shows Olaf becoming a 25-kt remnant low by 24 h. 
The remnant low is forecast to linger around for several days after, 
but remain weak as it moves over the open waters of the eastern 
Pacific.
 
The tropical storm has begun moving more westward away from Baja
California Sur, and its initial motion is estimated to be
west-northwest (295 degrees) at 9 kt. A mid-level ridge building to
the north of Olaf should steer the cyclone westward tonight into
Saturday. By late Saturday, the shallow cyclone will begin moving
southwestward as it is steered around a low-level ridge to its
northwest. The official NHC track forecast lies near the middle of
the guidance envelope, closest to the multi-model consensus aids.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Olaf is moving away from the Baja California peninsula, and
lingering tropical storm conditions along portions of the
southwestern coast of Baja California Sur are forecast to diminish
this evening.
 
2.  Heavy rains associated with Olaf are expected across portions of
southern Baja California Sur through tonight. This rainfall may
trigger life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides.
