WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Meteorological Service of Mexico has issued a Tropical Storm
Watch for the southern portion of Baja California Sur from Todos
Santos to Los Barriles.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* The southern portion of Baja California Sur from Todos
Santos to Los Barriles
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Baja California Sur should monitor the
progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM MDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression 
Fifteen-E was located near latitude 18.2 North, longitude 107.4 
West. The depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 5 mph 
(7 km/h). A turn to the northwest is forecast to occur later 
tonight, and this motion along with a gradual increase in forward 
speed is expected through Thursday.  On the forecast track, the 
center of the cyclone will approach the southern end of the Baja 
California Peninsula late Thursday and Thursday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is expected over the next couple of days, and the
depression is forecast to become a tropical storm tonight, and a
hurricane on Thursday or Thursday night.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in
Baja California Sur by late Thursday or Thursday night.
 
RAINFALL: Outer rainbands from the depression are likely to produce
locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds along the coast of the
Mexican states of Colima and Jalisco through tonight.  Locally
heavy rainfall is also possible over portions of Baja California
Sur Thursday and Thursday night.
 
SURF:  The strengthening cyclone is expected to generate swells
that will affect the portions of the southern Baja California
peninsula by Thursday.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 1200 AM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 300 AM MDT.

<title>Tropical Depression Fifteen-E Forecast Discussion Number 2</title>

Tropical Depression Fifteen-E Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152021
900 PM MDT Tue Sep 07 2021

Satellite imagery indicates that Tropical Depression Fifteen-E has 
changed little in organization during the past several hours.  
While the system is producing good convective banding in the 
eastern semicircle, the convection near the center is currently 
poorly organized, and there is no evidence that the inner core has 
consolidated.  Thus, the initial intensity remains 30 kt based 
mainly on continuity from the previous advisory.  A combination of 
conventional and 37 GHz microwave satellite imagery suggests that 
the center is farther east than previously thought, so the new 
initial position is about a half degree east of the previous 
advisory position.

The initial motion is a somewhat uncertain 300/5. A large mid-level 
anticyclone is located over the southwestern United States with a 
ridge extending southeastward across Mexico.  The anticyclone 
should shift a little eastward during the next few days, with the 
ridge extending southward across Mexico.  This evolution should 
steer the tropical cyclone generally northwestward for the next 
several days, followed by a more westward motion as the cyclone 
weakens over cooler water and is steered by low-level easterly flow. 
The track guidance is in good agreement with this scenario, and the 
new forecast track is near the consensus models.  However, the 
more eastward initial position required an eastward shift to the 
forecast track.  It should be noted that some erratic motion is 
possible until the cyclone develops a better-defined inner core.

Conditions appear favorable for strengthening until the system 
reaches the 26-deg-C SST isotherm in 60-72 h, with the main 
restraining factor being the current lack of internal organization.  
The intensity forecast has only minor adjustments from the previous 
forecast and calls for the depression to become a tropical storm in 
about 12 h and a hurricane in about 48 h.  Steady to rapid weakening 
is expected after 60-72 h due to the cooler water and dry air 
entrainment.

The more easterly initial position and the new forecast track 
require a Tropical Storm Watch for portions of Baja California Sur 
at this time.  Interests elsewhere in Baja California Sur should 
monitor the progress of this system.
