WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has extended the Tropical Storm Watch
northward along the west coast of Baja California Sur to Santa Fe.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Baja California Sur Mexico from Los Barriles to Santa Fe
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere in Baja California Sur should monitor the
progress of this system.  Additional watches or warnings may be
required later today.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression
Fifteen-E was located near latitude 18.5 North, longitude 107.1
West.  The depression is moving toward the north-northwest near 3 
mph (6 km/h).  A turn toward the northwest is expected later today, 
with an increasing forward speed through Friday.  A turn toward the 
west-northwest is forecast by Friday night.  On the forecast track, 
the center of the depression will move just to the southwest of 
southern Baja California Sur on Thursday and Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast, and the depression is expected to become 
a tropical storm later today.  It could then become a short-lived 
hurricane Thursday or Thursday night.  Weakening is expected on 
Friday when the system moves over colder waters.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Depression Fifteen-E can be found in the 
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO 
header WTPZ45 KNHC.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in
Baja California Sur by late Thursday or Thursday night.
 
RAINFALL:  The depression is expected to produce total rainfall
amounts of 1 to 3 inches with maximum amounts of 5 inches across the
southern portions of Baja California Sur Thursday through Friday.
This rainfall may trigger flash flooding and mudslides.
 
SURF:  The strengthening cyclone is expected to generate swells that
will affect portions of the coasts of Baja California Sur and
Sinaloa by Thursday, spreading northward along the west coast of
Baja California Sur through Friday.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 600 AM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.

Tropical Depression Fifteen-E Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152021
300 AM MDT Wed Sep 08 2021
 
The circulation of the depression has continued to become better 
defined, and there has been a substantial increase in deep 
convection within bands to the north and northeast of the center.  
However, the inner core remains slightly displaced from this 
activity, and a combination of subjective and objective intensity 
estimates supports maintaining the cyclone as a 30-kt depression 
for this advisory.

The system has either been meandering or its center re-formed 
yesterday, and the long-term motion is a drift toward the 
north-northwest (335 degrees) at about 3 kt.  This motion is likely 
due to the depression being caught within weak steering currents 
between a mid-level low west of the Baja California peninsula and 
troughing extending across Mexico to the Gulf of Mexico.  A strong 
mid-tropospheric high over the western United States should 
gradually cause the system to move faster toward the northwest 
during the next 2 to 3 days, bringing it very close to Baja 
California Sur in about 48 hours.  Of the track models, the GFS and 
COAMPS-TC models are the solutions which bring the cyclone's center 
closest to Baja California Sur, while the ECMWF and UKMET models 
have the farther-offshore tracks.  The new NHC track forecast 
splits the difference among these solutions and is a little east 
of the previous forecast during the first 36 hours to account for 
recent short-term motions.  After 36 hours, it falls more or less 
in line with the previous prediction and is very close to the 
consensus aids, HWRF, and HMON.

There are counteracting factors at play regarding the depression's 
future intensity.  Although deep-layer shear is forecast to be low, 
the GFS suggests that moderate to strong mid-level shear could 
develop below the outflow level during the next 24-48 hours.  Sea 
surface temperatures will be plenty warm for strengthening during 
the next 48 hours, yet upper-level divergence is not expected to be 
ideal.  Since the system's circulation appears to be improving, 
steady strengthening is forecast during the first 48 hours, and the 
depression could become a short-lived hurricane while it passes the 
Baja California peninsula.  This forecast is near the upper end 
of the guidance envelope, close to the GFS, HWRF, COAMPS-TC, and 
HCCA solutions.  The cyclone will be moving over colder waters in 
2-3 days, which should cause quick weakening and a degeneration to 
remnant low status by day 4.
 
 
Key Messages:

1.  Tropical Depression Fifteen-E is expected to strengthen to a 
tropical storm later today, and it could become a short-lived 
hurricane while it passes just to the southwest of southern 
portions of Baja California Sur Thursday and Friday.  A Tropical 
Storm Watch is in effect for southern portions of Baja California 
Sur, and interests there should continue to monitor the progress of 
the depression.

2.  Heavy rains associated with Tropical Depression Fifteen-E are 
possible across southern portions of Baja California Sur Thursday 
through Friday.  This will pose a threat of flash flooding and 
mudslides.
