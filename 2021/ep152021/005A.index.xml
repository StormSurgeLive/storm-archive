The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Olaf, located a couple of hundred miles south-southeast of <br/>
the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
An area of low pressure is expected to form in a few days to <br/>
the south of the southern coast of Mexico.  Environmental <br/>
conditions appear favorable for development of this system, and a <br/>
tropical depression could form late this weekend or early next week <br/>
while it moves west-northwestward near the coast of southern and <br/>
southwestern Mexico.<br/>

before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 PM MDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Olaf was
located near latitude 19.7 North, longitude 107.7 West. Olaf is
moving toward the northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h). This general motion
along with an increase in forward speed are expected through Friday.
A turn toward the west-northwest is forecast by Friday night,
followed by a turn toward the west on Saturday. On the forecast
track, the center of Olaf will move just to the southwest of
southern Baja California Sur on Thursday and Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next day or so, and 
Olaf could be near hurricane strength by late Thursday. The storm 
is expected to begin weakening on Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Olaf can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO
header WTPZ45 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?key_messages
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the Hurricane Watch
area in Baja California Sur Thursday night. Tropical storm
conditions are expected in the Tropical Storm Warning area in Baja
California Sur by late Thursday or Thursday night.
 
RAINFALL:  Olaf is expected to produce total rainfall amounts
of 3 to 6 inches with maximum amounts of 10 inches across portions
of far southern Baja California Sur Thursday through Friday. This
rainfall may trigger flash flooding and mudslides.
 
SURF:  Olaf is expected to generate swells that will affect portions
of the coasts of Baja California Sur and Sinaloa by Thursday,
spreading northward along the west coast of Baja California Sur
through Friday.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Olaf Forecast Discussion Number 5</title>

Tropical Storm Olaf Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152021
300 PM MDT Wed Sep 08 2021

Olaf's appearance has remained steady today and the storm is 
characterized by a large curved band that encompasses much of the 
circulation. There is good outflow in all quadrants, indicative of a 
low-shear environment. An earlier ASCAT pass sampled peak winds of 
37 kt, and this data along with a blend of the latest Dvorak 
T-numbers from TAFB and SAB indicate that the initial intensity is 
around 40 kt.
 
The storm is forecast to remain over warm waters and in a moist 
environment for the next 36 hours. Therefore, additional 
strengthening is likely during that time period. In a couple of 
days, the cyclone is forecast to begin moving over cooler waters, 
and into a drier and a much more stable atmospheric environment. 
This should result in rapid weakening, and Olaf is expected to 
become a remnant low this weekend. The latest NHC intensity forecast 
is little changed from the previous one, and continues to be in good 
agreement with the IVCN intensity consensus aid. Although the NHC 
forecast does not explicitly show Olaf becoming a hurricane, this 
could still occur Thursday or Thursday night.
 
Olaf continues to move slowly northwestward, or 325/5 kt. A 
mid-level ridge building over northern Mexico should help maintain 
this heading for a couple of days with a gradual increase in forward 
speed. By Friday night, Olaf is expected to turn west-northwestward 
as it weakens, and by Saturday a westward motion is forecast when 
the shallow cyclone is steered by the surrounding low-level flow. 
The overall model guidance shifted slightly to the east through 48 
hours, and thus the NHC track forecast was nudged in that direction 
for that time frame. Because of this track shift, probabilities of 
tropical storm and hurricane conditions have increased for southern 
portions of Baja California Sur. Therefore, the government of 
Mexico has issued a Hurricane Watch and a Tropical Storm Warning 
for portions of this area. After 48 h, the guidance has shifted a 
little to the south, and the NHC forecast was tweaked in that 
direction as well.
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Olaf is forecast to strengthen to near hurricane intensity while 
it passes to the southwest of the southern portion of Baja 
California Sur Thursday and Friday. Tropical storm conditions are 
expected and hurricane conditions are possible across that area 
beginning late Thursday. Interests there should continue to monitor 
the progress of Olaf.
 
2.  Heavy rains associated with Tropical Storm Olaf are possible 
across portions of far southern Baja California Sur Thursday through 
Friday.  This will pose a threat of flash flooding and mudslides.
