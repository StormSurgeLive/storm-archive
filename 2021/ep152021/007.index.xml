the next 24 to 36 hours.  Preparations to protect life and property
should be rushed to completion.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the tropical storm warning area within 36

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Olaf was
located near latitude 20.5 North, longitude 108.0 West.  Olaf is
moving toward the north-northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this
motion is expected to continue today.  A turn toward the northwest 
is forecast by tonight, followed by a slower westward motion Friday 
night and Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of Olaf will 
approach southern Baja California Sur today, move near or over the 
southern part of the peninsula tonight and on Friday, and then move 
westward away from land Friday night and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast during the 
next day or so, and Olaf is expected to become a hurricane later 
today.  Weakening is forecast to start on Friday when Olaf begins 
to move away from Baja California Sur.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 993 mb (29.33 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Olaf can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header
WTPZ45 KNHC and on the web at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?key_messages
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within
the hurricane warning area tonight.  Winds are expected to first
reach tropical storm strength by this afternoon or this evening,
making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to
protect life and property should be rushed to completion.  Tropical
storm conditions are expected to begin in southern portions of the
tropical storm warning area tonight and will spread northward
within the warning area on Friday.
 
RAINFALL:  Olaf is expected to produce total rainfall amounts of 3
to 6 inches with maximum amounts of 10 inches across portions of
far southern Baja California Sur today through Friday.  This
rainfall may trigger flash flooding and mudslides.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
coastal flooding within the warnings areas in regions of onshore
wind.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
damaging waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Olaf are beginning to reach portions of
the coasts of southern Baja California Sur, Nayarit, and Sinaloa,
and will spread northward along the west coast of Baja California
Sur through Saturday.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

<title>Tropical Storm Olaf Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Olaf Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152021
900 PM MDT Wed Sep 08 2021
 
Olaf appears to be gradually strengthening.  Deep convection has
been increasing over the center, and banding features are becoming a
little more pronounced.  The latest Dvorak estimates range from 35
to 45 kt. Since the system appears to be better organized from
the time of the ASCAT pass earlier today, the initial intensity is
nudged up and set near the high end of the estimates at 45 kt.
 
Satellite images and recent microwave data suggest that the center
of Olaf is a little to the east of the previous track, and the
latest initial motion estimate is 335/6 kt.  Olaf is expected to
move generally northwestward for another 24 to 36 hours, which
should bring the system just off the coast of southern Baja
California Sur during that time.  There is some spread in the models
on how close the storm will get to the coastline, with the GFS to
the east of the official forecast and the UKMET and ECMWF to the
west and farther offshore.  Beyond 36 hours, Olaf is expected to be
located to the south of a strong mid-level ridge and that will cause
a turn to the west-northwest away from Mexico.  The NHC track
forecast is adjusted again to the east of the previous one in the
short term and then to the south of the previous one at the longer
lead times. The new track forecast lies near the middle of the
guidance envelope, near the various consensus aids.
 
Olaf is located over warm waters, and embedded in a low wind shear
and fairly moist environment.  These conditions should allow for
additional strengthening during the next day or so.  Although not
explicitly forecast, Olaf could become a hurricane when it is just
off the coast of southern Baja California Sur, and a hurricane
watch remains in effect for the possibility of those winds
occurring on land.  By Friday, a combination of cooler waters and a
much drier environment should cause steady weakening, and the
system is likely to become a remnant low over the weekend.  The NHC
intensity forecast lies close to the IVCN and IVDR consensus models.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1.  Olaf is forecast to strengthen to near hurricane intensity while
it passes offshore of the southern portion of Baja California Sur
Thursday and Friday. Tropical storm conditions are expected and
hurricane conditions are possible across that area beginning late
Thursday. Interests there should continue to monitor the progress of
Olaf.
 
2.  Heavy rains associated with Tropical Storm Olaf are possible
across portions of far southern Baja California Sur Thursday through
Friday.  This will pose a threat of flash flooding and mudslides.
