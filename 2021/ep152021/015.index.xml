Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
1100 PM PDT Fri Sep 10 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently <br/>
downgraded Tropical Depression Olaf, located less than 100 miles <br/>
west of Cabo San Lazaro, Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
A broad area of low pressure developing a couple of hundred miles <br/>
south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec is producing a large area of <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions <br/>
are generally conducive for some development of this system if it <br/>
remains over water, and a tropical depression could form late this <br/>
weekend or early next week while moving west-northwestward at 5 to <br/>
10 mph near the southern and southwestern coasts of Mexico.  <br/>
Regardless of development, this system will likely produce heavy <br/>
rains across portions of Central America and southern Mexico during <br/>
the next few days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Olaf
was located near latitude 24.4 North, longitude 114.0 West.  Olaf 
is moving toward the west near 6 mph (9 km/h).  A motion toward the 
west-southwest or southwest is expected to begin later today and 
continue through Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast during the next few days, and the remnant low 
could open up into a trough at any time.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Residual swells from Olaf along the west coast of Baja
California Sur will continue to subside today but could still cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system.  For additional information on the remnant 
low please see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather

Post-Tropical Cyclone Olaf Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP152021
300 AM MDT Sat Sep 11 2021
 
Olaf has been without deep convection for about the last 18 hours, 
and it is therefore being designated as a remnant low.  A 
scatterometer pass from several hours ago still showed winds of 
25-30 kt occurring to the north of the center, so the initial 
intensity remains 30 kt.  Weakening is expected during the next few 
days while the remnant low traverses waters of about 25 degrees 
Celsius and through a very dry air mass.  Global model fields show 
the circulation opening up into a trough anywhere between 2 and 6 
days from now, so as a compromise the official forecast indicates 
this happening by day 4, but it's likely to be sooner than that.

Olaf is now losing latitude and moving south of due west, or 260/5 
kt.  A strengthening low- to mid-level ridge to the north is 
expected to force the remnant low to the west-southwest and 
southwest during the next several days.  In fact, the models have 
been trending toward a more pronounced loss of latitude, and this 
final NHC track forecast has been shifted southward from the 
previous advisory--close to the TVCE model consensus but not nearly 
as far south as the HCCA aid.
 
For additional information on the remnant low please see High Seas
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php
