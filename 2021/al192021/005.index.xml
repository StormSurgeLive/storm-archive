NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Sat Sep 25 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane  <br/>
Sam, located almost 1100 miles east-southeast of the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands, and on recently downgraded Subtropical Depression <br/>
Teresa, located about 140 miles north of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
An area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms associated with <br/>
the remnants of Peter is located several hundred miles south of <br/>
Bermuda. Environmental conditions appear marginally conducive for <br/>
slow development of this disturbance over the next few days as it <br/>
moves northeastward at 5 to 10 mph.<br/>
*Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
*Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa by <br/>
early Monday. Thereafter, environmental conditions are forecast <br/>
to be conducive for gradual development, and a tropical depression <br/>
could form by the middle of next week while the system moves <br/>
westward at 10 to 15 mph over the far eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 PM AST Sat Sep 25 2021
 
...SAM RAPIDLY INTENSIFIES TO A CATEGORY FOUR HURRICANE...
...SOME ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING EXPECTED THROUGH TONIGHT...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...13.3N 48.5W
ABOUT 1025 MI...1655 KM ESE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...140 MPH...220 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...943 MB...27.85 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 13.3 North, longitude 48.5 West. Sam is moving toward
the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A slower motion to the
west-northwest is expected over the weekend, followed by a turn to
the northwest on Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near near 140 mph
(220 km/h) with higher gusts.  Sam is now a category 4 hurricane on
the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional strengthening
is expected through tonight. Some fluctuations in the hurricane's
intensity are then possible early next week.
 
Sam remains a small hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend
outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the center and
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 943 mb (27.85 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam are forecast to reach the Lesser
Antilles early next week. These swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

<title>Hurricane Sam Forecast Discussion Number 13</title>

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 PM AST Sat Sep 25 2021
 
After a brief hiccup, Sam has resumed rapid strengthening and now
shows a 12-15 n mi wide well-defined eye embedded in a central 
dense overcast with cloud tops colder than -70C. Subjective 
satellite intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were 115 kt at 18Z, 
and objective intensity estimates have also been near 115 kt.  
Since the organization has increased some since 18Z, the initial 
intensity is increased to 120 kt.  A NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
is currently enroute to Sam to provide a better estimate of the 
intensity.  The hurricane has good cirrus outflow in all quadrants. 
However, a large arc cloud to the northwest of the central core 
suggests dry air is present in that area.
 
The initial motion is still west-northwestward or 290/9.  There are
again no changes to the forecast track reasoning.  The weak
subtropical ridge currently to the north of Sam is forecast to shift
eastward as a large deep-layer mid-latitude trough develops over the
western Atlantic.  This evolution should cause Sam to continue
west-northwestward with some decrease in forward speed during the
next couple of days, followed by a turn toward the northwest.  Some
increase in forward speed is likely by 120 h as Sam encounters
stronger steering flow.  The track guidance has shifted a little to
the north and east since the previous advisory, and the new forecast
track is also nudged in that direction, with the new track lying
between the HCCA corrected consensus model and the other consensus
models.  Based on the NHC forecast, and all of the other guidance,
Sam is expected to still be well to the east or northeast of the
northern Leeward Islands through day 5.
 
The current strengthening is expected to continue for the next
6-12 h, and based on this the new intensity forecast now calls for a
peak intensity of 130 kt.  After the peak, Sam is expected to be in
an environment of warm sea surface temperatures and light wind
shear for at least the next 3-4 days.  This suggests the intensity
will be controlled mainly by eyewall replacement cycles and
possible intrusions of dry air, which would cause some short-term
fluctuations in intensity.  In the bigger picture, the intensity
guidance calls for a slow weakening during the 24-120 h forecast
period, and the new intensity forecast does the same.  However, it
is likely that Sam will remain a major hurricane through 120 h.

Subtropical Depression Teresa Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192021
1100 AM AST Sat Sep 25 2021
 
Teresa has been devoid of deep convection for more than 12 hours
now.  The cloud pattern consists of a swirl of low-level clouds and
a band of showers and thunderstorms located about 250 n mi north of
the center.  This patch of convection is detached from the
low-level circulation, and it appears to be more involved with an
upper-level trough to the northeast of Teresa.  A 1210 UTC ASCAT-A
pass shows that the winds within that convection have decreased,
with several vectors in the 25 to 30 kt range.  Based on that
data, the intensity is lowered to 30 kt, making Teresa a
subtropical depression.
 
Teresa is unlikely to redevelop any convection near its center as
strong west-southwesterly wind shear continues over the cyclone.
This will prevent any opportunity for strengthening.  Teresa is
expected to become a remnant low later today or this evening and
dissipate on Sunday.  The global models are in good agreement with
this scenario.
 
Teresa has moved little during the past 12 hours, so a stationary
motion is currently indicated for this advisory.  However, a motion
toward the northeast should begin within the next few hours and
continue through dissipation as the cyclone moves in the flow ahead
of a deep-layer trough.  The track forecast was adjusted a little
to the east of the previous advisory, and is in agreement with the
model consensus.
