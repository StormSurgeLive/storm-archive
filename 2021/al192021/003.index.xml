<title>Hurricane Sam Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 AM AST Sat Sep 25 2021
 
Sam continues to rapidly intensify.  Geostationary satellite and
microwave images show that the storm has a very small and distinct
eye surrounded by a nearly symmetric ring of cold cloud tops.  The
latest Dvorak estimates range from 90 to 102 kt, and based on that
data, the initial intensity is increased to 95 kt.  Although Sam
is nearly a major hurricane, it remains quite compact with
tropical-storm-force and hurricane-force winds estimated to only
extend 50 n mi and 15 n mi from the center, respectively.
 
The hurricane is moving west-northwestward at 11 kt and is currently
being steered by a mid-level ridge to its north. There has been
little change to the track forecast philosophy or model guidance.
Sam is expected to continue west-northwestward during the next two
or three days, but it is forecast to move at a notably slower pace
of 6-8 kt during most of that time period.  After that time, the
ridge is expected to shift eastward as a deep-layer trough becomes
established over the western Atlantic.  This change in the steering
pattern should cause Sam to turn northwestward and speed up some by
the middle of next week.  The models are in fairly good agreement,
and the NHC track forecast is largely an update of the previous one.
Based on this forecast, and nearly all of the reliable guidance,
Sam is expected to still be well to the east or northeast of the
northern Leeward Islands through day 5.
 
Continued steady or rapid strengthening is expected during the next 
day or two as the hurricane remains in near ideal conditions of very 
low wind shear and warm 29 deg C waters.  However, beyond that time 
the shear is expected to increase a little, and that will likely 
cause Sam to level off in strength or weaken slightly next week.  
The NHC intensity forecast is slightly above the models in the short 
term, given the impressive structure of the hurricane and favorable 
conditions, but falls in line with the consensus aids at the longer 
lead times.  Regardless of how strong Sam gets, nearly all of the 
models indicate that it will remain a powerful hurricane during the 
next several days.

Subtropical Storm Teresa Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192021
500 AM AST Sat Sep 25 2021
 
Teresa is poorly organized and it likely won't be a subtropical
cyclone for much longer.  The cloud pattern consists of a swirl of
low-level clouds and a band of showers and thunderstorms that is
located more than 250 n mi northeast of the center.  This patch of
convection has been detaching from the low-level circulation and it
appears to be more involved with an upper-level low to the east of
Teresa.  ASCAT-B and ASCAT-C caught the circulation several hours
ago, and showed winds of 25-30 kt near it.  However, that instrument
did not sample the area of convection well northeast of the center,
where the winds could be a little stronger.  Given the degraded
structure of the system, the initial intensity is lowered to a
possibly generous 35 kt.
 
Now that the upper-level low has pulled away from the subtropical
storm, west-southwesterly shear is increasing across the circulation
and that should prevent convective organization and any opportunity
for strengthening.  Due to the strong shear and dry air entrainment,
Teresa is likely to become a remnant low later today or tonight and 
dissipate on Sunday.
 
Teresa is moving slowly west-northwestward at 5 kt.  A turn to the
north is expected later today, followed by a northeast motion as the
cyclone moves in the flow ahead of a deep-layer trough.
