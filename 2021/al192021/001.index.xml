Special Tropical Weather Outlook...Retransmitted<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
400 PM EDT Fri Sep 24 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
Special tropical weather outlook issued for the system located to <br/>
the north-northeast of Bermuda. <br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane  <br/>
Sam, located about 1300 miles east-southeast of the northern Leeward <br/>
Islands. <br/>
<br/>
Updated: Recent visible satellite imagery indicates that a <br/>
well-defined center has formed with a surface low located a couple <br/>
hundred miles north-northeast of Bermuda interacting with an <br/>
upper-level trough. In addition, the low is producing gale-force <br/>
winds on the north side of its circulation. Additional development <br/>
into a subtropical storm is now expected, and advisories will likely <br/>
be initiated this afternoon as the system moves slowly toward the <br/>
north-northwest. Additional information on this system, including <br/>
gale warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the <br/>
National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A gale-force, non-tropical low pressure system, the remnants of <br/>
Odette, is located less than 600 miles west of the westernmost <br/>
Azores.  Showers and thunderstorms have mostly dissipated near the <br/>
low, and strong upper-level winds are now expected to prevent <br/>
further development as this system moves gradually southward until <br/>
dissipation.  Additional information on this system, including gale <br/>
warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National <br/>
Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa by <br/>
the end of this weekend.  Thereafter, environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to be conducive for gradual development, and a tropical <br/>
depression could form by the middle of next week while the system <br/>
moves westward at 10 to 15 mph over the far eastern tropical.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 PM AST Fri Sep 24 2021
 
Sam's structure on satellite has improved this afternoon, with 
overshooting cloud tops rotating quickly around the small central 
dense overcast, providing the appearance that the hurricane is 
mixing out the dry air that affected its core structure this 
morning. In fact, the last few visible satellite images suggest that 
a small eye is clearing out within the cirrus canopy. Interestingly, 
a recent 1930 UTC SSMIS pass suggests concentric bands are also 
forming in Sam's core structure and it remains to be seen how that 
structure will affect the wind field evolution of the hurricane. The 
latest subjective Dvorak intensities estimates form TAFB and SAB 
were a consensus T4.5/75 kt, while the latest SATCON and ADT 
estimates from UW-CIMSS have also increased this afternoon. The 
current advisory intensity has been set to 75-kt. Given the 
recent trends on satellite, this may be conservative.
 
The motion of Sam has remained on the same heading, though the
storm is beginning to slow down with the estimate now at 280/10
kt. An additional slowdown in forward motion is anticipated in the
short-term as the mid-level ridging shuffles to the northwest of
the tropical cyclone, impeding its forward motion. However, after 
72 hours, this same ridge is expected to shift back to the 
northeast of Sam as a deep-layer trough off the Eastern United 
States coastline becomes established. Track guidance spread 
increases towards the end of the forecast, with the ECMWF and GFS 
remaining at odds, with the former on the equatorward side, and 
the latter on the poleward side of the track envelope. The 
consensus aids, however, have changed little from the previous 
advisory and the latest NHC track forecast is quite similar to the 
previous one. 

Now that Sam appears to have mixed out the dry air seen this 
morning, intensification, likely rapid, is resuming. The only fly in 
the ointment is the current concentric banding structure on 
microwave imagery, which hints at the possibility of an eyewall 
replacement cycle. Assuming the smaller eye will not collapse in the 
short term, rapid intensification appears likely over the next 12-24 
hours and the intensity has been raised in the short term, taking 
Sam to major hurricane intensity by tomorrow. The latest NHC 
intensity forecast now shows a slightly higher peak at 120-kt in 48 
hours followed by very gradual decay, due to a subtle increase in 
vertical wind shear, potentially some upwelling effects due to the 
slow forward notion, and eyewall replacement cycles that could lead 
to a broadening of the wind field. The latest NHC intensity forecast 
starts out on the high side of the intensity guidance but ends up 
very close to the HCCA consensus aid by the end of the forecast 
period.  Regardless of the details, Sam is expected to be a 
significant hurricane through the forecast period.

Subtropical Storm Teresa Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192021
500 PM AST Fri Sep 24 2021
 
The disturbance just north of Bermuda interacting with a mid- to 
upper-level low has developed a prominent band of deep convection
within its eastern semicircle as well as a well-defined surface 
center. Additionally, the system is not displaying any significant 
baroclinicity (i.e., frontal boundaries), so it is not an 
extratropical cyclone.  All of which indicates that the system has 
evolved into a subtropical cyclone. ASCAT-C scatterometer data from 
1440Z suggested peak winds were around 40 kt, which is the basis 
for calling the system Subtropical Storm Teresa.

The system is moving toward the northwest at 12 kt is it rounds the 
northern part of the mid- to upper-level low.  By Saturday, Teresa 
should turn northward and then northeastward, as it begins to be 
caught up in the mid-latitude westerlies. The forecast is based upon 
the TVCN track consensus technique.

Teresa will not be long-lived.  A  developing extratropical system 
forming off of New England should absorb Teresa between 36 and 48 
hours.  Until then, the subtropical storm has a small window to 
intensify slightly while traversing lukewarm water and 
encountering moderate vertical shear.  If deep convection develops 
near the system's center, then Teresa could evolve into a tropical 
storm.  However, it is more likely that Teresa will remain a 
subtropical storm until dissipation in around two days.

It is worth noting that Teresa will likely be the 9th so-called 
"shortie" of the 2021 hurricane season -- systems that are short- 
lived and relatively weak.
