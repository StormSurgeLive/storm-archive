200 AM EDT Mon Oct 4 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Sam, located over the far North Atlantic, and on Tropical <br/>
Depression Victor, located over the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
A large area of disorganized cloudiness and showers continues over <br/>
the southeastern Bahamas and adjacent southwestern Atlantic waters <br/>
in association with a surface trough.  Upper-level winds are not <br/>
expected to be especially conducive, and any development of <br/>
this system should be slow to occur while it moves slowly <br/>
northwestward through late this weekend.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

...SAM NORTH OF THE GULF STREAM AND EXPECTED TO WEAKEN SOON...
...FORECAST TO BECOME POST-TROPICAL BY EARLY TUESDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...40.8N 48.7W
ABOUT 465 MI...745 KM SSE OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...105 MPH...165 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 45 DEGREES AT 30 MPH...48 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...957 MB...28.26 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 40.8 North, longitude 48.7 West. Sam is moving toward
the northeast near 30 mph (48 km/h). A northeastward motion at
a faster forward speed is expected over the next couple of days. The
cyclone is forecast to slow down over the far north Atlantic
southwest of Iceland around midweek.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next few days, and 
Sam is expected to transition into a powerful post-tropical cyclone 
by early Tuesday.
 
Sam is a large hurricane. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up 
to 70 miles (110 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds 
extend outward up to 255 miles (405 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 957 mb (28.26 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, the eastern United
States and Atlantic Canada for the next couple of days.  These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Hurricane Sam Forecast Discussion Number 47</title>
<description>Issued at 500 AM AST Mon Oct 04 2021  <![CDATA[<pre>
ZCZC MIATCDAT3 ALL
TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM
 
Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  47
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 AM AST Mon Oct 04 2021
 
A 0255Z GPM microwave pass indicated that Sam had continued to go 
through an eyewall replacement cycle, consisting of a 20-nmi-wide 
inner eye and an 85-nmi-wide outer eye. The inner eye was rapidly 
eroding on the northwest side compared to microwave data from just a 
few hours earlier. Additionally, late-arriving ASCAT surface wind 
data from 0000-0100Z indicated that the inner-core wind field had 
contracted or weakened, while the outer wind field (34-kt radii) had 
continued to expand in all quadrants. Satellite intensity estimates 
have decreased to around 80 kt. However, the advisory intensity has 
been maintained at 90 kt based on the 10-kt increase in forward 
speed, which should offset any weakening of the tangential winds. 
Gradual weakening is expected now that Sam has passed north of the 
warm Gulf Stream and is moving over sub-25-deg-C sea-surface 
temperatures (SST), with much colder SSTs lying ahead of the 
hurricane. Vertical wind shear is forecast to increase to more than 
30 kt by 18 h, which should cause further weakening. By 24 h and 
beyond, interaction with a strong upper-level trough/low should 
cause Sam to transition into a powerful extratropical cyclone by 
early Tuesday to the east of Newfoundland.  This baroclinic 
interaction is expected to cause extratropical-Sam to maintain 
hurricane-force winds until early Wednesday.  Slow weakening is 
forecast thereafter as the very large cyclone slowly spins down as 
an occluded low pressure system.  No significant changes were made 
to the previous intensity forecast.
 
Sam has continued to accelerate and is now moving at 045/26 kt. A 
northeastward motion along with continued acceleration is forecast 
through today as Sam moves into stronger southwesterly flow ahead of 
an approaching mid-latitude trough. The large cyclone is expected to 
remain the primary surface low center as it merges with the trough 
in a couple days. A gradual turn toward the north and northwest is 
expected on days 4 and 5 when extratropical-Sam moves around another 
high-latitude trough.  The new NHC forecast track is essentially 
just an update of the previous advisory track, and lies close to 
the tightly packed consensus track models.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward Islands,
the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the eastern United
States and Atlantic Canada for the next couple of days.  These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Depression Victor Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
1100 PM AST Sun Oct 03 2021
 
In its battle against dry air and shear, Victor is far from its
namesake. The depression continues to produce only minimal deep
convection to the north. Furthermore, an ASCAT overpass near 2219
UTC casts doubt on whether Victor still has a closed and 
well-defined circulation, showing generally light winds south of 
the suspect center. However, no visible imagery is currently 
available to confirm the state of Victor's surface center, so 
advisories will continue for now. ASCAT data showed winds a little 
above 25 kt to the northeast of Victor's center, so the initial 
intensity is held at 30 kt for this advisory.
 
Victor is moving northwestward at a slightly faster speed (305/13 
kt).  Based on the ASCAT data and recent ProxyVis imagery, the 
center of Victor was relocated about 40 n mi south of previous 
estimates, which has resulted in a southern shift in the forecast 
track. That said, Victor is not expected to persist for much longer. 
The hostile surrounding environment will likely cause Victor to 
become a remnant low or dissipate on Monday. Victor, or its 
remnants, should move generally northwestward or west-northwestward 
until dissipation occurs within a day or so.
