Tropical Weather Outlook...Corrected<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Mon Sep 27 2021<br/>
<br/>
Corrected geographic reference for the remnants of Peter<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Sam, located several hundred miles east of the Lesser Antilles.<br/>
<br/>
The area of low pressure associated with the remnants of Peter is <br/>
located a few hundred miles east of Bermuda.  The low has become <br/>
better defined today, and the shower and thunderstorm activity has <br/>
become a little better organized.  Any further increase in <br/>
organization could result in the formation of a short-lived tropical <br/>
depression, while it moves northeastward at about 10 mph.  By <br/>
Wednesday, environmental conditions are expected to become <br/>
unfavorable for further development.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles southwest <br/>
of the Cabo Verde Islands is producing disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions are conducive for further <br/>
development of this disturbance, and a tropical depression is likely <br/>
to form in a few of days while it moves westward to <br/>
west-northwestward at 5 to 10 mph over the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave located just offshore the west coast of Africa is <br/>
producing a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  <br/>
Upper-level winds are conducive for gradual development, and a <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form in a few days while the system <br/>
moves westward to west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph over the far <br/>
eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>

500 PM AST Mon Sep 27 2021
 
...SAM BEGINNING TO REGROUP AFTER WEAKENING...
...SOME REINTENSIFICATION EXPECTED THROUGH TONIGHT...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.3N 52.7W
ABOUT 700 MI...1125 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...120 MPH...195 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 315 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...957 MB...28.26 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 16.3 North, longitude 52.7 West. Sam is moving toward
the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this motion is expected to
continue for the next few days, with an increase in forward speed
beginning on Thursday.  A turn to the north is expected by Friday.
On the forecast track, Sam will pass well to the northeast of the
northern Leeward Islands Wednesday and Thursday.
 
An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicates that the 
maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Sam is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some strengthening is expected through 
tonight. Thereafter, fluctuations in intensity are possible through 
Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles
(165 km).
 
The minimum central pressure measured by the aircraft is 957 mb 
(28.26 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the Lesser Antilles for
the next several days.  Swells are expected to reach Bermuda and the
Bahamas mid-to-late week, and then spread to the United States east
coast late this week.  These swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 PM AST Mon Sep 27 2021
 
Sam's weakening trend ended earlier today, with the intensity likely 
bottoming out between the issuance of the previous advisory and now. 
Over the past few hours, microwave data and satellite imagery 
indicate that the inner core and eyewall of the hurricane are making 
a comeback. There is now a clear eye in visible imagery, convective 
cloud tops colder than -65 degrees C wrap completely around the 
center, and the convective mass is becoming more circular once 
again. An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft currently 
investigating Sam indicates the central pressure has dropped to 957 
mb, with peak 700-mb flight-level winds of 106 kt, SFMR values of 
100 kt, and dropsonde surface winds of 102 kt. Given possible minor 
undersampling and the recent dropping of the hurricane's pressure, 
the initial advisory intensity is set at 105 kt.
 
Sam continues to move northwest, or 315/8 kt. The hurricane is
expected to continue this northwestward motion around a subtropical
ridge over the next few days. By late Thursday or early Friday a
turn toward the north is anticipated as Sam rounds the western
periphery of the ridge. The cyclone should begin to gradually
accelerate during that time in the increasing flow ahead of a mid-
to upper-level trough emerging off the U.S. east coast later this
week. Model guidance remains in very good agreement on this
scenario and the latest NHC forecast track is little changed from
the previous one, and lies near tightly clustered consensus track
guidance.
 
The southwesterly winds that brought in some dry air and disrupted
Sam's impressive satellite appearance last night appear to have
abated. As long as environmental winds surrounding the hurricane
remain light, then the dry air surrounding the cyclone should not 
have as much of an impact on the hurricane's strength over the next 
few days. Based on the improving inner-core structure appearance of 
Sam, re-strengthening is forecast over the next 12 h. Thereafter, 
mainly minor fluctuations in intensity are indicated through 72 h. 
Beyond that time, increasing vertical wind shear and decreasing 
sea-surface temperatures should cause Sam to weaken. The latest NHC 
intensity forecast was nudged slightly upward through 36 h and is 
on the high end of the guidance. Thereafter, no changes were made, 
and that portion of the forecast is close to the various multimodel 
consensus solutions.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Sam are affecting the Leeward Islands 
and will spread to portions of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, 
Hispaniola, the Bahamas, and Bermuda by Thursday or Friday.  
Significant swells will likely reach the east coast of the United 
States and Atlantic Canada by the weekend.  These swells will likely 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and 
beachgoers and other interests along these coasts are urged to 
follow the advice of lifeguards and local officials through the 
upcoming weekend.
