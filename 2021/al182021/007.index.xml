Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Fri Sep 24 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Storm Sam, located about 1500 miles east-southeast of the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands.<br/>
<br/>
A gale-force, non-tropical low pressure system, the remnants of <br/>
Odette, is located a little more than 600 miles west-northwest of <br/>
the westernmost Azores.  Showers and thunderstorms remain limited <br/>
near the low, and this system has only a brief window of opportunity <br/>
to become a subtropical or tropical cyclone while it moves generally <br/>
south-southeastward over marginally warmer waters.  Strong <br/>
upper-level winds are expected to develop over the system by late <br/>
today, which should then limit further development.  Additional <br/>
information on this system, including gale warnings, can be found in <br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A large area of showers and thunderstorms centered a couple of <br/>
hundred miles east of Bermuda is associated with a surface and <br/>
upper-level trough.  Some tropical or subtropical development <br/>
of this system could occur through early Saturday as it moves <br/>
generally north-northwestward.  After that time, development <br/>
is not expected due to strong upper-level winds. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa by <br/>
the end of this weekend.  Thereafter, environmental conditions are <br/>
forecast to be conducive for gradual development, and a tropical <br/>
depression could form by the middle of next week while the system <br/>
moves westward at 10 to 15 mph over the far eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>

<title>Hurricane Sam Forecast Discussion Number 7</title>

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 AM AST Fri Sep 24 2021
 
Sam continues to rapidly intensify.  Satellite images show a small,
but well-developed inner core and pronounced curved bands that wrap
most of the way around the center.  There are some dry slots,
however, between the core and bands.  The latest satellite intensity
estimates range from 55 to 77 kt, and based on that data and the
continued improvement in the cyclone's structure, the initial wind
speed is increased to 65 kt.  This makes Sam a hurricane, the
seventh one of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season. It should be
noted that Sam has a compact wind field, with hurricane-force and
tropical-storm-force winds estimated to only extend outward up to 15
and 50 n mi from the center, respectively.
 
Sam is moving westward at about 13 kt, and this general motion
should continue for another 12 to 24 hours as it moves in the flow
on the south side of a mid-level ridge.  After that time, a decrease
in forward speed and a turn to the west-northwest are expected, and
the official forecast has Sam moving at a slow pace of only 6-8 kt
during the 48-96-hour time period.  By the middle of next week, the
ridge is forecast to slide eastward as a trough moves over the
western Atlantic. In response, the hurricane will likely turn
northwestward as it approaches the northern Leeward Islands.  The
models have changed little this cycle with the GFS still on the
northern side of the guidance envelope and the ECMWF on the
southern side.  The NHC track forecast is essentially an update of
the previous one and lies between the GFS and ECMWF models, and near
the consensus aids.
 
The large scale environmental conditions all appear favorable for 
continued rapid intensification during the next day or so as the 
hurricane is expected to remain over warm 29 deg C waters and in 
very low wind shear conditions.  All of the SHIPS rapid 
intensification indices are well above the climatological means, and 
the NHC intensity forecast calls for Sam to become a major hurricane 
by early Saturday.  Beyond a couple of days, the environment is 
likely to become a little less ideal, and most of the models show 
Sam leveling off in strength, and so does the official forecast. 
This intensity prediction lies near a blend of the FSSE, HCCA, and 
IVCN consensus models.  Regardless of the details, Sam is expected 
to be a significant hurricane during the next several days.
