Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Wed Sep 22 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Peter, located a few hundred miles north of Puerto Rico, <br/>
and on Tropical Depression Rose, located about 1000 miles <br/>
west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands. <br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms remain well organized in association with <br/>
a tropical wave located several hundred miles southwest of the Cabo <br/>
Verde Islands. In addition, recent satellite wind data indicates <br/>
that the circulation is gradually becoming better defined. If these <br/>
trends continue, a tropical depression could form as soon as this <br/>
afternoon or evening. This system should move westward at 10 to 15 <br/>
mph across the eastern and central tropical Atlantic Ocean. <br/>
Additional information on this system, including gale warnings, can <br/>
be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather <br/>
Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...near 100 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...near 100 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A gale-force, non-tropical low pressure system, the remnants of <br/>
Odette, is located more than 500 miles west-northwest of the <br/>
westernmost Azores. This low is beginning to develop more <br/>
concentrated shower activity and could become a subtropical or <br/>
tropical cyclone as it moves slowly across marginally warm waters <br/>
over the north-central Atlantic Ocean during the next several days. <br/>
However, by the weekend, this system is expected to move south into <br/>
an environment of strong upper-level winds.  Additional information <br/>
on this system, including gale warnings, can be found in High Seas <br/>
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
&&<br/>
<br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br/>
found under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and <br/>
online at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php<br/>

Tropical Depression Peter Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
500 PM AST Wed Sep 22 2021
 
Peter continues to just barely maintain its classification as a 
tropical cyclone. While the low-level circulation has remained 
intact today, the convection continues to be located well downshear 
to the east. However, there have been a few convective elements 
forming a bit closer to the center recently and that is the 
primarily justification for maintaining advisories on Peter as 
a tropical cyclone this afternoon. The initial intensity is 
maintained at 30 kt given the earlier scatterometer data, though 
this might be generous. Continued strong southwesterly vertical wind 
shear within a dry mid-level environment should ultimately strip the 
remaining convection away from Peter, with the tropical cyclone 
expected to finally peter out as a post-tropical remnant low in the 
next 12 hours. 

The depression has been moving very slowly recently, with an 
estimated north-northwestward motion of 340/4 kt. The cyclone is 
expected to turn northward and then north-northeastward following a 
weakness in the low-level ridge until the system finally opens up 
into a trough, sometime in the 48 to 60 hour period.

Tropical Depression Rose Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172021
500 PM AST Wed Sep 22 2021
 
Rose is currently comprised of a swirl of low-level clouds, with 
the only significant convection occurring about 120 n mi southeast 
of the center.  Satellite intensity estimates have decreased, and 
are now 25 kt from TAFB and too weak to classify from SAB.  Based 
mainly on earlier scatterometer data, the initial intensity is held 
at a possibly generous 30 kt.  Rose remain in an area of 
northwesterly shear and upper-level convergence, and dry mid-level 
air has been entraining into the circulation.  The large-scale model 
guidance indicates that the hostile conditions will continue for at 
least another 36 h, and based on model forecasts of convection Rose 
is now expected to degenerate into a remnant low pressure area in 
24 h or less.  It should be noted that the GFS and HWRF models 
suggest the possibility that convection could re-develop in the 
48-96 h period due to the remnant low interacting with an 
upper-level trough.  For now, the intensity forecast will not call 
for re-generation at that time.
 
The initial motion is now west-northwestward or 300/9 kt.  A 
northwestward motion is expected for the next 12-24 hours as Rose or 
its remnants are steered by a mid-level ridge over the eastern 
Atlantic.  After that time, the system is expected to turn 
northward, northeastward, and eventually east-northeastward as it 
becomes steered by a deep-layer trough that includes the remnants 
of Odette.  Since Rose has moved a bit to the west of the previous 
forecast, the guidance and the new forecast track have also shifted 
westward during the first 36 h. The new NHC track is to the east of 
the consensus models for the first 36 h, and close to the consensus 
aids after that time.

Tropical Depression Eighteen Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 PM AST Wed Sep 22 2021

The tropical wave that NHC has been monitoring over the last several 
days has gradually become better organized. The satellite structure 
in particular is quite impressive for a tropical depression, with 
both the 1800 UTC subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB 
at T2.5/35 kt. This bigger question, however, was if the system 
possessed a well-defined closed earth-relative circulation. An 
ASCAT-C pass from earlier this morning hinted that the circulation 
was becoming better defined, with the development of westerly 
low-level winds to the south of the convective shield. This westerly 
low-level flow is also confirmed by atmospheric motion vectors 
(AMVs) available from the GOES-16 meso domain over the system. While 
the low-level circulation may still be somewhat broad, it now 
appears to be well-defined enough to mark the formation of a 
tropical cyclone. The initial intensity is set at 30-kt, in 
agreement with peak wind retrievals of 28-30 kt by the earlier 
scatterometer data.  

The initial motion is estimated to be at 270/13 kt, though this is 
somewhat uncertain given that the center has only recently formed. 
An expansive mid-level ridge is located to the north and west of 
the cyclone, which should maintain its heading toward the west, 
though with a gradual gain in latitude as the system approaches 
the western extent of the ridge by day 5. The track guidance is in 
excellent agreement on this track evolution for the first three 
days, with just a bit more spread in the guidance thereafter. The 
ECMWF and its ensemble mean towards the end of the forecast is on 
the left side of the guidance envelope, while the GFS and HWRF 
models are currently on the right side. For the first NHC track 
forecast, I have elected to stay close to the track consensus aids, 
taking a blend of the HCCA and TCVN aids which are near the 
middle of the guidance envelope.

The environment ahead of the tropical depression appears quite 
favorable for intensification. Vertical wind shear is forecast by 
both the ECWMF- and GFS-based SHIPS guidance to stay at or under 10 
kt for the next 3-5 days as the storm traverses warm 28-29 C sea 
surface temperatures. Most of the guidance responds to this 
environment by indicating strengthening, and the NHC intensity 
guidance follows suit, showing a steady increase in intensity 
throughout the forecast period. While it might take a bit of time 
for the formative low-level circulation to become vertically aligned 
with the mid-level center, once that occurs, it is possible a period 
of rapid intensification could occur during the five day forecast. 
The forecast intensity by 120 hours (100 kt) is on the higher end of 
the guidance envelope, but not as high as the latest HWRF or HAFS-B 
forecasts.
