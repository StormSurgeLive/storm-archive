waters in association with a surface trough.  Upper-level winds are <br/>
not expected to be favorable for significant tropical development <br/>
of this system while it moves slowly northwestward over the next <br/>
several days.  By this weekend, the system is forecast to merge <br/>
with a front near the coast of the southeastern United States.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM GMT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 47.7 North, longitude 40.2 West. Sam is moving toward
the north-northeast near 29 mph (46 km/h).  This general motion
should continue overnight with a decrease in forward speed.  A
slow east-northeastward motion is forecast to begin by late today,
and a northeastward motion is expected Wednesday and Wednesday
night.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 85 mph (140 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Although gradual weakening is forecast during
the next few days, Sam is expected to transition into a powerful
post-tropical cyclone over the north Atlantic within the next 6-12
hours.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 460
miles (740 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 965 mb (28.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands, the Greater Antilles, portions of the Bahamas, and
southeastern Newfoundland through midweek.  These swells could
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM GMT.

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  50
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
300 AM GMT Tue Oct 05 2021
 
Sam's extratropical transition is well underway.  The central core
convection has decreased over the past several hours, with the
telltale elongated cloud pattern forming on the northwestern side
of the circulation.  Still, AMSU-microwave data just before 00Z was 
very clear it is still has a healthy warm core, so advisories will
continue.  The initial wind speed is decreased to 75 kt, a bit
above the satellite estimates.
 
An approaching mid-latitude trough should cause Sam to quickly
transition into a powerful extratropical cyclone within the next
6-12 hours while maintaining hurricane-force winds for about the
next day.  A slow weakening is expected after that time as Sam loses
its baroclinic forcing.  The only significant change from the
last advisory is that models are in better agreement that Sam will
become absorbed by another extratropical low in about 3 days,
rather than be the dominant center, so the 96 h forecast is now
dissipated.
 
Sam is moving north-northeastward or 030/25 kt.  The system is
forecast to slow down as it merges with the mid-latitude trough. By
late Tuesday, the post-tropical cyclone should turn east-
northeastward before it moves northward and northwestward around the
eastern portion of another trough/cut-off low over the north
Atlantic.  The latest NHC forecast is very close to the last one and
the model consensus.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands, the Greater Antilles, portions of the Bahamas, and
southeastern Newfoundland through midweek.  These swells
could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
