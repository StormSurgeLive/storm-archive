NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Mon Oct 4 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Sam, located over the far North Atlantic, and has issued the last <br/>
advisory on the remnants of Victor, located over the central <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
A large area of disorganized cloudiness and showers continues over <br/>
the southeastern Bahamas and adjacent southwestern Atlantic waters <br/>
in association with a surface trough.  Upper-level winds are not <br/>
expected to be favorable for significant development of this system <br/>
while it moves slowly northwestward over the next several days.  By <br/>
this weekend, the system is forecast to merge with a front near the <br/>
coast of the southeastern United States.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

SUMMARY OF 900 PM GMT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...45.1N 42.5W
ABOUT 520 MI...840 KM E OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 35 DEGREES AT 36 MPH...57 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...965 MB...28.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 PM GMT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 45.1 North, longitude 42.5 West. Sam is moving toward
the northeast near 36 mph (57 km/h).  This general motion should 
continue tonight. A slower east-northeastward motion is forecast to 
begin by late Tuesday, and a northeastward motion is expected 
Wednesday and Wednesday night. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts. Although gradual weakening is forecast during the next few 
days, Sam is expected to transition into a powerful post-tropical 
cyclone over the north Atlantic tonight.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275
miles (445 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 965 mb (28.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands, the Greater Antilles, portions of the Bahamas, and
southeastern Newfoundland through early Tuesday.  These swells
could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  49
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
900 PM GMT Mon Oct 04 2021
 
Sam's cloud pattern has finally begun to degrade as it moves over
the cooler waters of the north Atlantic. The cloud tops have
warmed and the eye is no longer discernible in infrared imagery,
but banding features still remain well defined in all quadrants.
Dvorak T- and CI-numbers from both SAB and TAFB have continued to
decline and a blend of the latest subjective and objective
estimates yields an initial intensity estimate of 80 kt for this 
advisory.  Scatterometer data that arrived just after the release 
of the previous advisory showed that Sam's wind field has continued 
to expand and the latest radii estimates are based on those data.
 
Sam should gradually weaken this evening as it moves over
progressively colder waters and into an area of strong southwesterly
upper-level winds.  However, an approaching mid-latitude trough
should result in the system's quick transition into a powerful
extratropical cyclone overnight.  The post-tropical cyclone is 
forecast to maintain hurricane-force winds for until late Tuesday, 
but gradual weakening should occur after that time as the system 
occludes and baroclinic forcing decreases. It is not entirely 
clear as to whether Post-Tropical Sam will remain the dominant low 
(GFS solution) or if it will be absorbed by another extratropical 
low (ECMWF solution) later in the week.  As a compromise, the new 
official forecast calls for absorbed by day 5 which is between 
the solutions from those typically reliable global models. 
 
Sam is moving briskly northeastward or 035/31 kt.  The cyclone is
currently caught in strong southwesterly flow ahead of the
aforementioned mid-latitude trough and a rapid northeastward motion
is expected overnight.  After that time, the post-tropical cyclone
is forecast to slow down as it merges with the cut-off low.  By 
late Tuesday, the post-tropical cyclone should turn east- 
northeastward before it rotates cyclonically around the eastern 
portion of another trough/cut off low over the north Atlantic.  The 
latest NHC forecast is a blend of the GFS and ECMWF models and 
their respective ensemble means.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands, the Greater Antilles, portions of the Bahamas, and
southeastern Newfoundland through early Tuesday.  These swells
could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Remnants Of Victor Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
1100 AM AST Mon Oct 04 2021
 
Victor is no longer a tropical cyclone. A timely 1048 UTC ASCAT-A 
pass confirms that Victor does not have a closed surface 
circulation. Since the system has degenerated into a trough of low 
pressure over the central Atlantic, this will be the final NHC 
advisory on Victor. An area of 20 to 22-kt scatterometer winds is 
noted well to the northeast of the trough axis, but these winds 
should diminish through tonight as the trough dampens and the 
remnants move west-northwestward. Hostile environmental conditions, 
including strong southerly shear and very dry mid-level air, will 
inhibit any redevelopment of this system.

Additional information on the remnants of Victor can be found in 
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under 
AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
