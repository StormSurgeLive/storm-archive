<title>Hurricane Sam Forecast Discussion Number 10</title>

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 PM AST Fri Sep 24 2021
 
Sam developed a 10-n mi wide eye in infrared satellite images a 
few hours ago, surrounded by a ring of cloud tops as cold as about 
-70 degrees Celsius.  The core of the hurricane remains compact.  
In fact, recent Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data indicated that 
the radius of maximum winds is only about 6 n mi.  Dvorak estimates 
were T5.0/90 kt from TAFB and T4.5/77 kt from SAB at 0000 UTC, and 
given the additional clearing of the eye since then, Sam's intensity 
is raised to 85 kt.

Sam has been moving toward the west-northwest during the past 6 to 
12 hours with a motion of 285/12 kt.  The track forecast reasoning 
remains the same, and the model guidance is packed more tightly 
than normal through day 5.  A blocking ridge lying to the north and 
northwest is expected to cause Sam to slow down over the weekend 
and maintain a motion toward the west or west-northwest.  On days 3 
through 5, the ridge is expected to shift eastward, with a 
deep-layer trough developing over the western Atlantic.  This 
should allow Sam to turn northwestward toward the end of the 
forecast period.  The NHC track forecast has not budged much and 
remains close to the TVCA consensus aid.  Based on this forecast, 
and nearly all of the reliable guidance, Sam is expected to still 
be well to the east or northeast of the northern Leeward Islands 
through day 5.
 
Deep-layer shear is expected to be less than 10 kt for the next day 
or two, and Sam will be heading toward waters of higher oceanic 
heat content.  These conditions favor continued strengthening, and 
the hurricane is forecast to become a major hurricane on Saturday 
and possibly reach a peak intensity in 2 to 3 days.  For this 
period, the NHC forecast is close to the HCCA consensus aid and 
is near the high end of the guidance envelope.  As is usually the 
case with hurricanes this small and strong, fluctuations in 
intensity due to eyewall replacement cycles will be possible.  On 
days 3 through 5, some increase in shear as Sam approaches the 
deep-layer western Atlantic trough is possible, and modest weakening 
is shown at those times.

Subtropical Storm Teresa Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192021
500 PM AST Fri Sep 24 2021
 
The disturbance just north of Bermuda interacting with a mid- to 
upper-level low has developed a prominent band of deep convection
within its eastern semicircle as well as a well-defined surface 
center. Additionally, the system is not displaying any significant 
baroclinicity (i.e., frontal boundaries), so it is not an 
extratropical cyclone.  All of which indicates that the system has 
evolved into a subtropical cyclone. ASCAT-C scatterometer data from 
1440Z suggested peak winds were around 40 kt, which is the basis 
for calling the system Subtropical Storm Teresa.

The system is moving toward the northwest at 12 kt is it rounds the 
northern part of the mid- to upper-level low.  By Saturday, Teresa 
should turn northward and then northeastward, as it begins to be 
caught up in the mid-latitude westerlies. The forecast is based upon 
the TVCN track consensus technique.

Teresa will not be long-lived.  A  developing extratropical system 
forming off of New England should absorb Teresa between 36 and 48 
hours.  Until then, the subtropical storm has a small window to 
intensify slightly while traversing lukewarm water and 
encountering moderate vertical shear.  If deep convection develops 
near the system's center, then Teresa could evolve into a tropical 
storm.  However, it is more likely that Teresa will remain a 
subtropical storm until dissipation in around two days.

It is worth noting that Teresa will likely be the 9th so-called 
"shortie" of the 2021 hurricane season -- systems that are short- 
lived and relatively weak.
