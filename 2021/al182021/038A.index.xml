WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Sam was located near 
latitude 32.1 North, longitude 61.1 West.  Sam is moving toward the 
north-northeast near 17 mph (28 km/h).  A turn toward the northeast 
is expected by tonight, with this motion continuing through Monday.  
On the forecast track, the center of Sam will move away from Bermuda 
today.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 140 mph (220 
km/h) with higher gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional weakening is 
forecast during the next couple of days, but Sam is expected to 
remain a major hurricane into Sunday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km).  Several automated stations on Bermuda have 
recently reported wind gusts between 40 and 50 mph (65 to 80 km/h).
 
Data from the Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the minimum 
central pressure has risen to 945 mb (27.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
WIND:  Wind gusts to tropical storm force are likely to continue on 
Bermuda for the next several hours.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, and Bermuda during the
next couple of days.  Swells are expected to reach the United States
east coast and Atlantic Canada today.  These swells could cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

<title>Hurricane Sam Forecast Discussion Number 38</title>
<description>Issued at 1100 PM AST Fri Oct 01 2021  <![CDATA[<pre>

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  38
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 PM AST Fri Oct 01 2021

The satellite appearance of Sam has degraded slightly during the 
past few hours, with the eye becoming more cloud filled and the 
eyewall cloud tops become a little less symmetric.  Various 
subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates are in the 
115-130 kt range, and based on the slight decay the initial 
intensity is lowered to 125 kt.  An Air Force Reserve Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft is currently enroute to investigate Sam.

Sam is making its forecast turn toward the north-northeast with the 
initial motion now 020/15 kt.  There is no change to the track 
forecast philosophy and little change to the forecast track from the 
previous advisory.  The steering flow between a deep-layer ridge to 
the northeast and east of Sam and a large mid-latitude low pressure 
system centered over Atlantic Canada should cause Sam to turn 
northeastward during the next 24 h, followed by a continued 
northeastward motion as the system become entrained in southwesterly 
mid-latitude flow.  The models are in fairly good agreement, 
although there is some spread in both the track and the speed due to 
model differences in the cyclone's evolution as it becomes 
extratropical.  The new forecast track lies close to the center of 
the guidance envelope and the various consensus models.

Slow weakening is expected to continue during the next 2-3 days as 
Sam moves over cooler sea surface temperatures and begins 
extratropical transition.  This is likely to be complete by 72 h, 
with the global models suggesting that Sam will evolve into a 
warm-core seclusion extratropical low.  Based on this and the 
guidance, it is likely that the cyclone will maintain hurricane 
strength until after the transition is done.  By the end of the 
forecast period, the extratropical low is expected to be decaying 
over the far north Atlantic.  The new intensity forecast lies at the 
upper edge of the intensity guidance.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward Islands
the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, and Bermuda during the next
couple of days.  Swells are expected to reach the United States
east coast and Atlantic Canada on Saturday.  These swells could
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda during the 
next several hours, and a Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for 
the island.

Tropical Storm Victor Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
1100 PM AST Fri Oct 01 2021
 
The structure of Victor this evening continues to degrade with the
low-level center becoming decoupled from the mid- to upper-level
circulation associated with the deeper convection. While the
tropical storm does continue to produce a region of deep convection
with cloud tops colder than -70 C, this activity is organized in a
linear band that is now more than 150 n mi northeast of the exposed
low-level center as seen on Proxy-Vis satellite imagery. Both
ASCAT-B/C clipped the western half of Victor's circulation, showing
peak winds of 40 kt on the far edge of the pass. In addition, the
latest subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates have
been falling this evening. The latest intensity for this advisory
has been lowered to 50 kt this advisory, assuming the scatterometer
data missed higher wind values to the northeast of Victor closer to
the convection. However, given Victor's current structure, this
estimate may still be generous.
 
Now that the low-level cloud swirl is readily apparent on satellite 
imagery, it is somewhat easier to track Victor this evening, with 
the estimated motion still west-northwest at 290/11 kt. Because the 
cyclone is also becoming more vertically shallow, the primarily 
steering feature will be a large low-level subtropical ridge 
centered to the north, which should guide Victor on a general 
west-northwestward to northwestward heading for the next 2-3 days at 
a similar forward motion. The latest track guidance has shifted 
westward this cycle, likely in response to Victor being a weaker 
cyclone less coupled to the deep convection. The latest NHC track 
forecast was also shifted a bit west over the forecast period, 
staying closer to the consensus aids HCCA and TVCA, though it is 
worth nothing this is still not as far west as the latest GFS or 
ECMWF runs.
 
While the deep-layer 200-850 hPa vertical wind shear has not been
prohibitively strong today (15-20 kt), more substantial mid-level
shear underneath the outflow layer (25-30 kt) appears to be
responsible for the current disheveled appearance of Victor. This
shear is related to a large upper-level cutoff low upstream of the
tropical storm. Even though the current shear is not expected to
increase much more in the short-term, the mid-level environment over
Victor is expected to continue drying as the existing shear will
import very dry air upstream into the core of the cyclone. All of
the guidance responds to these unfavorable conditions by gradually
weakening Victor over the next few days, and the latest NHC
intensity forecast has been lowered a bit more compared to the
previous advisory. While pulses of deep convection are likely to
continue north of Victor over the next several days, the circulation
is expected to gradually lose definition, and the global and
high-res regional hurricane models now open up the system into a
trough between 72-96 hours. The latest NHC intensity forecast now
follows suit, showing dissipation by 96 hours.
