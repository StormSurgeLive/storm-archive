WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Bermuda Weather Service has issued a Tropical Storm Warning for
Bermuda.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Sam was located by 
an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 23.6 North, 
longitude 60.9 West.  Sam is moving toward the northwest near 14 
mph (22 km/h), and a turn toward the north-northwest with an 
additional increase in forward speed is expected tonight.  A turn 
toward the north is anticipated on Friday, and a northeastward 
motion is forecast to begin on Saturday.  On the forecast track, the 
core of Sam will pass to the east of Bermuda early Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are expected
during the next couple of days, but Sam is forecast to remain a
major hurricane into Saturday, with more significant weakening
anticipated later in the weekend.  

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).
 
The minimum central pressure reported by the Hurricane Hunters is 
938 mb (27.70 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
Friday night or early Saturday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands and the Greater Antilles, including Puerto Rico, during the
next few days.  Swells are expected to reach Bermuda and the Bahamas
by Friday, and then spread to the United States east coast by this
weekend.  These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

<title>Hurricane Sam Forecast Discussion Number 32</title>

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 AM AST Thu Sep 30 2021
 
Sam continues to look quite impressive on satellite images, with a 
20-25 n mi wide eye surrounded by very deep convection.  The 
system's convective banding features and upper-level anticyclonic 
outflow also remain well-defined, with particularly strong outflow 
to the northwest and north.  Subjective and objective Dvorak 
intensity estimates have not changed significantly since earlier 
this morning, so the advisory intensity will remain at 125 kt.  
Interestingly, aircraft observations show that Sam has been a 
little stronger than indicated by satellite-derived intensity 
estimates, which underscores the value of aerial reconnaissance 
of tropical cyclones.  Another Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
is scheduled to investigate the hurricane later today.

Sam should continue to move over waters of high oceanic heat 
content and within a low-shear atmospheric environment for the next 
24 hours or so.  Thus, it could still strengthen a little today and 
tonight. By 48 hours, decreasing SSTs and increasing shear should 
lead to a gradual weakening trend.  Around day 5, global model 
fields suggest that Sam will be merging with a baroclinic zone and 
transition into a large and powerful extratropical cyclone over the 
north Atlantic.  The official intensity forecast is in good 
agreement with the HCCA corrected consensus model prediction.

The hurricane is moving a little faster toward the northwest, or at 
about 320/11 kt.  During the next couple of days, a gradual turn 
toward the north is likely as Sam rounds the western end of a large 
subtropical anticyclone over the eastern and central Atlantic. 
Thereafter, Sam is forecast to move generally northeastward in the 
flow between the anticyclone and a trough near Atlantic Canada.  
The NHC forecast is very similar to a consensus of the typically 
reliable GFS and ECMWF predictions, with a little bit of smoothing 
around days 3-4.
 
Although the core of Sam is forecast to pass east of Bermuda early
Saturday, the tropical-storm-force wind field is forecast to expand
and could pass very close to the island beginning late Friday night
or early Saturday. Therefore, a Tropical Storm Watch is in effect 
for Bermuda.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the Northern Leeward Islands
and the Greater Antilles, including Puerto Rico, during the next
few days.  Swells are expected to reach Bermuda and the Bahamas by
Friday, and then spread to the United States east coast by this
weekend.  These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning
Friday night or early Saturday, and a Tropical Storm Watch has
been issued for that island.

<title>Tropical Storm Victor Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Victor Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
500 PM AST Thu Sep 30 2021
 
Victor has been relatively steady in strength during the past
several hours.  Satellite images continue to show that the storm has
a large circulation with numerous curved bands surrounding the
center. However, recent microwave images indicate that the cyclone
has yet to develop a well-defined inner core, which is likely why
the system has not strengthened much despite the favorable
environmental conditions.  The Dvorak classifications are again
unchanged and range from 35 to 45 kt, and on this basis, the initial
intensity is held at 40 kt.
 
Victor is still moving west-northwestward, or 290 degrees, at 12 kt.
The storm is forecast to continue on that same general track for
about another day as it remains on the south side of a deep-layer
ridge over the subtropical eastern Atlantic.  By late Friday, a mid-
to upper-level low is expected to form over the central Atlantic,
and that feature should erode the western portion of the ridge.  As
a result, Victor is expected to turn northwestward by the weekend
and then northward by early next week when it is forecast to move in
the flow between the ridge and the low.  The GFS has shifted
westward this cycle and is now not far from the ECMWF track.  The
new NHC forecast track is nudged westward toward a consensus of the
GFS, ECMWF, UKMET, and HMON models.  The standard consensus aids
could be too far to the east since the latest run of the HWRF, which
is a member of those models, is a significant outlier to the east.
 
As mentioned above, although the storm has been in favorable 
conditions for strengthening during the past day or so, it has not 
taken full advantage likely due to its broad structure.  The 
favorable environment for Victor should persist for about another 24 
hours, so gradual strengthening is possible during that time period. 
However, by the weekend, the models show Victor moving into a region 
of moderate to strong southwesterly shear and a progressively drier 
airmass.  These negative factors for the storm along with slightly 
cooler SSTs should cause Victor to lose strength this weekend and 
early next week.  In fact, some of the models suggest that Victor 
could dissipate by the end of the forecast period.  The new NHC 
intensity forecast is again a little lower than the previous one, 
trending toward the HCCA, IVCN, and IVDR consensus aids.
