For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Sam was located near
latitude 27.5 North, longitude 61.8 West.  Sam is moving toward the
north-northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h).  A turn toward the north and
north-northeast, at a similar forward speed, is expected later today
and tonight, followed by a northeastward motion Saturday night
through Monday.  On the forecast track, the center of Sam will pass
well to the east of Bermuda tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 150 mph (240 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Although fluctuations in intensity are still
possible today, weakening is forecast during the next couple of
days.  However, Sam is expected to remain a major hurricane through
at least Saturday night.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175
miles (280 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 934 mb (27.58 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
tonight or early Saturday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands and the Greater Antilles, including Puerto Rico, during the
next couple of days.  Swells are expected to reach Bermuda and the
Bahamas later today, and then spread to the United States east
coast and Atlantic Canada this weekend.  These swells could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  35
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 AM AST Fri Oct 01 2021
 
An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated Sam a 
few hours ago and found that the already-intense hurricane had 
strengthened a bit since yesterday afternoon's reconnaissance 
flight.  The plane measured a peak 700-mb flight-level wind of 147 
kt in the northeastern eyewall, and using a typical 90-percent 
reduction from that altitude, the intensity is estimated to be 130 
kt.  Dropsondes released in the eye also indicated that the central 
pressure had fallen to 934 mb.  This drop in pressure is likely due 
to a combination of the strengthening and an expansion of the 
tropical-storm- and hurricane-force wind fields, which was 
confirmed by the aircraft and scatterometer data from last evening.

Sam is moving a little faster toward the north-northwest (345/15 
kt) as it curves around the western periphery of a mid-tropospheric 
ridge located over the eastern and central subtropical Atlantic.  
The hurricane is expected to turn northward later today and then 
northeastward by Saturday night--passing well to the east of 
Bermuda--when it begins to move between the ridge and a mid- to 
upper-level low located over the northeastern United States and 
Atlantic Canada.  Interaction and a possible merger with the 
aforementioned low during extratropical transition is likely to 
cause a sudden north-northeastward acceleration to the southeast of 
Newfoundland on day 4, followed by a slower motion toward the 
east-northeast on day 5.  The track models are very tightly 
clustered for much of the 5-day forecast period, yielding high 
confidence in the NHC track forecast.  The new NHC forecast is 
relatively unchanged from the previous forecast, and closely 
follows the GFEX and TVCA consensus aids.

Although fluctuations in intensity will still be possible, a 
general weakening trend is anticipated in the coming days as Sam 
moves over a gradually cooler ocean, reaching sub-26C waters by day 
3.  However, the weakening is not expected to be rapid due to 
continued upper-level divergence and only light-to-moderate 
deep-layer shear, and Sam could remain a major hurricane at least 
through Saturday night.  Global models now indicate that Sam should 
complete extratropical transition by day 4, and baroclinic forcing 
is likely to keep the system as a potent hurricane-force 
post-tropical cyclone through the end of the forecast period.  The 
NHC intensity forecast is essentially an update of the previous 
forecast, lying close to the HCCA and IVCN consensus aids.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward Islands
and the Greater Antilles, including Puerto Rico, during the next
couple of days.  Swells are expected to reach Bermuda and the 
Bahamas today, and then spread to the United States east coast and 
Atlantic Canada this weekend.  These swells could cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda beginning
tonight or early Saturday, and a Tropical Storm Warning is in effect 
for the island.

Tropical Storm Victor Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
500 AM AST Fri Oct 01 2021
 
Infrared and microwave satellite imagery indicate that Victor has 
continued to become a little better organized, with a 0342Z AMSR2 
overpass showing that a 75-percent-closed mid-level eye feature had 
formed. However, both data sources also revealed that a pronounced 
dry slot has formed in the southeastern quadrant. Upper-level 
outflow remains well established in all quadrants except to the 
south where it is somewhat restricted. Despite the slightly improved 
satellite signatures, subjective and objective intensity 
classifications have not changed since the previous advisory, so the 
intensity remains at 50 kt for this advisory.
 
The initial motion estimate is 305/13 kt. Victor has made a slight 
jog toward the northwest, but this is likely a temporary motion due 
to redevelopment of the center farther into the convective cloud 
shield. The cyclone should resume a west-northwestward motion later 
today and maintain that motion for another day or so as Victor moves 
along the southwestern periphery of a strong subtropical ridge 
situated over the east-central Atlantic. The latest model runs 
continue to show a broad mid- to upper-level low developing over the 
central Atlantic to the west of Victor in the 24-72-h forecast 
period, which will act to erode the western portion of the ridge and 
create a deep-layer southerly flow pattern across the cyclone.  As a 
result, Victor is forecast to turn northwestward by the weekend and 
then move northward by early next week. Owing to a more robust 
mid-/upper-level low forecast to develop than previously expected, 
the latest NHC track guidance has made a significant westward shift 
by at least 100 nmi at 72 h and nearly 200 nmi on days 4 and 5. This 
westward shift is due to Victor now forecast to weaken faster and 
become more vertically shallow, with the dominant steering flow 
shifting to low-level easterlies. The new NHC track forecast has 
also been shifted westward, but not as far west as the tightly 
packed consensus models, all of which lie well to the east of the 
westernmost GFS solution.
 
Victor is expected to remain in a somewhat favorable environment for 
the next 18 h or so, which should allow for at least some slight 
strengthening to occur.  Thereafter, however, southwesterly 
deep-layer vertical wind shear is forecast by the GFS and ECMWF 
models to increase to 20-25 kt in 24 hours and 30-35 kt by 72 h. 
These hostile shear conditions, in conjunction with a drier air 
mass, should result in gradual weakening during the 24-120-h period, 
with Victor becoming a remnant low on day 5. The new official 
intensity forecast is a little below the previous advisory, but it 
is above the consensus intensity models ICON, HCCA, and FSSE, due to 
the recent development of the aforementioned primitive eye feature.
