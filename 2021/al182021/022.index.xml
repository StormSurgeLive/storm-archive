NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Mon Sep 27 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Sam, located several hundred miles east of the northern Leeward <br/>
Islands.<br/>
<br/>
A well-defined low pressure system associated with the remnants of <br/>
Peter is located a few hundred miles east of Bermuda. Although <br/>
shower and thunderstorm activity is currently disorganized, <br/>
environmental conditions are expected to remain marginally <br/>
conducive for a short-lived tropical depression to form tonight or <br/>
Tuesday while the system moves northeastward at about 10 mph.  By <br/>
Wednesday, however, conditions are expected to become unfavorable <br/>
for further development.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles southwest <br/>
of the Cabo Verde Islands is producing a large area of disorganized <br/>
showers and thunderstorms. Environmental conditions are conducive <br/>
for further development, and a tropical depression is likely to form <br/>
during the next day or two while the system moves westward to <br/>
west-northwestward at 5 to 10 mph over the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave located just offshore the west coast of Africa <br/>
continues to produce a large area of disorganized showers and <br/>
thunderstorms.  Upper-level winds are conducive for gradual <br/>
development, and a tropical depression is likely to form in a couple <br/>
of days while the disturbance moves westward to west-northwestward <br/>
at 10 to 15 mph over the far eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Sam Advisory Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 PM AST Mon Sep 27 2021
 
...SAM EXPECTED TO REMAIN A POWERFUL HURRICANE FOR SEVERAL MORE 
DAYS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...16.8N 53.2W
ABOUT 660 MI...1060 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...120 MPH...195 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 315 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...956 MB...28.23 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 16.8 North, longitude 53.2 West. Sam is moving toward
the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this motion is expected to
continue for the next few days, with an increase in forward speed 
beginning on Thursday.  A turn to the north is expected by Friday.
On the forecast track, Sam will pass well to the northeast of the
northern Leeward Islands Wednesday and Thursday.
 
Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter plane indicate that maximum 
sustained winds remain near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher gusts.  
Sam is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind 
Scale.  The hurricane could strengthen some overnight, and Sam is 
anticipated to be a category 3 or 4 hurricane for the next several 
days.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure from NOAA aircraft data is 
956 mb (28.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the Lesser Antilles for
the next several days.  Swells are expected to reach Bermuda and the
Bahamas mid-to-late week, and then spread to the United States east
coast late this week.  These swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 PM AST Mon Sep 27 2021
 
The NOAA Hurricane Hunters have been flying through Sam tonight, 
with radar and wind observations showing broken concentric eyewalls 
at times.  The maximum 700-mb flight-level winds on the mission 
were 114 kt, with peak SFMR values to 103 kt and a central pressure 
around 956 mb, so the initial wind speed will remain 105 kt.  While 
the overall intensity doesn't seem to have changed much in the past 
several hours, the aircraft data show that the hurricane has grown 
in size, and that is reflected in the initial wind radii.

The future intensity of Sam is hard to pinpoint.  Eyewall cycles 
will likely play a key role in determining its second peak intensity 
since the hurricane should remain in low- or moderate-shear and 
warm-water environments for the next few days.  Those cycles are 
basically impossible to forecast, but there is some suggestion on 
satellite that a larger eye is trying to form, which could allow for 
some increase in strength in the near term.  It seems likely that 
Sam will be a category 3 or 4 hurricane given the conducive 
environment for most of the forecast period, so the new NHC forecast 
is similar to the previous one, with the most significant change 
showing a larger hurricane consistent with the latest guidance.  

Sam continues to move northwestward, or 315/8 kt.  The hurricane 
should move in that direction for the next few days around the 
southwestern portion of the subtropical high.  A turn to the north 
is likely as Sam meets the western edge of the high, with a gradual 
acceleration to the northeast anticipated by the weekend due to an 
incoming mid-latitude trough from the west.  While there are some 
speed differences in the models, especially near and after 
recurvature, the NHC forecast leans toward the faster GFS solution 
over the slower ECMWF, given the magnitude of the strong 
southwesterly flow that Sam should encounter at long range, plus a 
nod to the superior performance of late for the American model.  The 
new forecast is adjusted a bit to the right and faster beyond day 3, 
with no significant changes made before that time.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Sam are affecting the Leeward Islands 
and will spread to portions of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, 
Hispaniola, the Bahamas, and Bermuda by Thursday or Friday. 
Significant swells will likely reach the east coast of the United 
States and Atlantic Canada by the weekend.  These swells will likely 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and 
beachgoers and other interests along these coasts are urged to 
follow the advice of lifeguards and local officials through the 
upcoming weekend.
