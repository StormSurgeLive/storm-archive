Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Sat Sep 25 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane  <br/>
Sam, located about 1000 miles east-southeast of the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands, and has issued the last advisory on Post-Tropical <br/>
Cyclone Teresa, located about 150 miles north of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
An area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms associated with <br/>
the remnants of Peter is located several hundred miles <br/>
south-southeast of Bermuda.  Environmental conditions appear <br/>
marginally conducive for slow development of this disturbance over <br/>
the next few days as it moves northeastward at about 10 mph.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa by <br/>
early Monday.  Thereafter, environmental conditions are forecast <br/>
to be conducive for gradual development, and a tropical depression <br/>
could form by the middle of next week while the system moves <br/>
westward at 10 to 15 mph over the far eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A broad area of low pressure could form over the eastern or central <br/>
tropical Atlantic early next week, to the west of the tropical <br/>
wave that will be moving off the coast of Africa.  Environmental <br/>
conditions appear favorable for some development of this <br/>
disturbance while it moves slowly westward through the middle of <br/>
next week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...13.5N 49.0W
ABOUT 990 MI...1595 KM ESE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...145 MPH...230 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 13.5 North, longitude 49.0 West. Sam is moving toward
the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this general motion is 
forecast to continue through Sunday. A turn toward the northwest is 
expected on Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Fluctuations in intensity are likely into 
early next week.
 
Sam remains a small hurricane. Hurricane-force winds extend outward 
up to 30 miles (45 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force 
winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on data from the NOAA
reconnaissance aircraft is 943 mb (27.85 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam are forecast to reach the Lesser
Antilles early next week. These swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 PM AST Sat Sep 25 2021
 
It's been an interesting evening with regards to analyzing the 
various data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter research flight into 
Hurricane Sam. Dropsonde data in both the southeast and northwest 
quadrants indicate that small eyewall mesovortices and possibly even 
tornado-scale vortices were present based on the wind profiles 
showing sharply opposite-direction winds from what would normally be 
expected in those regions of the hurricane. Some dropsonde surface 
winds have been as high as 162 kt, which is more representative of a 
gust, while SFMR surface winds have been as high as 133 kt. However, 
the strongest 700-mb flight-level winds have been 138-139 kt in the 
northeastern quadrant, which equates to about 125-kt tangential 
surface winds. Three dropsondes released in the eye indicate that 
the pressure had remained steady at 943-944 mb during the duration 
of the aircraft reconnoiter. That pressure equates to about 125 kt 
based on various pressure-wind relationships. Based on that estimate 
and the 700-mb flight-level to surface-wind conversion, the advisory 
intensity is 125 kt, which is representative of the mean tangential 
winds and no localized wind perturbations.
 
The initial motion is toward the west-northwest, or 295/07 kt.  
Not to sound like a broken record, but no significant changes were 
made to the previous track forecast and reasoning. Sam is expected 
to move slowly west-northwestward and northwestward over the next 
few days around the southwestern periphery of a deep-layer 
subtropical ridge that is situated to the north and northeast of the 
small hurricane. On days 4 and 5, an upper-level trough/low is 
forecast to dig southward and amplify off the U.S. east coast and 
extend all the way to the Bahamas. This feature should act to lift 
Sam northward at a faster forward speed. The latest NHC model 
guidance based on 12Z and 18Z model runs has shifted noticeably to 
the east of the previous runs, and the new NHC track forecast has 
been nudged in that direction as well. However, since the NOAA G-IV 
jet aircraft has been out there sampling the environment around 
Sam, it's best to remain conservative and not shift the track any 
farther to the east until the new 00Z model runs with that new 
aircraft data come in for the next advisory package at 0600Z. The 
new NHC track forecast lies about halfway between the previous 
advisory track on the left and the tightly packed consensus track 
models on the right.
 
The radar images from the reconnaissance aircraft indicated that the 
eyewall was thin in many locations due to dry-air intrusions, and 
the latest SHIPS intensity output indicates that Sam will remain 
within a fairly dry mid-level environment. Also, the depth of the 
warm water beneath the hurricane isn't overly deep, which could 
result in cold upwelling owing to Sam's slow forward motion of only 
5-7 kt during the next couple of days. Eyewall replacement cycles 
are also likely now due to the hurricane's small size and strong 
intensity. Thus, fluctuations in intensity seem likely for the next 
couple of days even though the vertical wind shear is expected to 
remain quite low at only 5-10 kt. On days 3-5, however, the shear is 
forecast to increase to 15-20 kt from the southwest, which is 
expected to induce a slow weakening trend. However, it is likely 
that Sam will remain a major hurricane through 120 h, even on days 
3-5 due to the cyclone moving over warmer and deeper water during 
that 3-day period. The new official intensity forecast is 
essentially the same as the previous advisory, and remains above the 
consensus model and is near the higher end of the intensity 
guidance.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Teresa Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192021
500 PM AST Sat Sep 25 2021
 
Teresa has continued to consist of just a swirl of low-level clouds 
since last night. Although a convective band persists a couple 
hundred miles northeast of the low center, the system no longer 
meets the definition of a tropical cyclone. Strong 
west-southwesterly wind shear should prevent any regeneration of 
convection near the center. All of the global models show the 
remnant low degenerating into an open trough by Sunday morning.  

Teresa has been moving eastward or 090/4 kt during the past 12 
hours.  A turn to the northeast is expected within the next couple 
of hours as the cyclone moves in the southwesterly flow ahead of a 
deep-layer trough.  The northeastward motion should continue until 
the low dissipates Sunday morning.

Additional information on Post-Tropical Cyclone Teresa can be found 
in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under 
AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
