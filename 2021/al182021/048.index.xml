Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Mon Oct 4 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Sam, located over the far North Atlantic, and on Tropical <br/>
Depression Victor, located over the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
A large area of disorganized cloudiness and showers continues over <br/>
the southeastern Bahamas and adjacent southwestern Atlantic waters <br/>
in association with a surface trough.  Upper-level winds are not <br/>
expected to be especially conducive, and any development of this <br/>
system should be slow to occur while it moves slowly northwestward <br/>
through the end of this week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 42.6 North, longitude 45.7 West. Sam is moving toward
the northeast near 32 mph (52 km/h). A faster northeastward motion 
is expected through tonight. A slower east-northeastward motion is 
forecast to begin on Tuesday and continue through midweek. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next few days, and
Sam is expected to transition into a powerful post-tropical cyclone
over the north Atlantic tonight or early Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275 miles
(445 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 960 mb (28.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands, the Greater Antilles, portions of the Bahamas, and
southeastern Newfoundland for the next day or so.  These swells
could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  48
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 AM AST Mon Oct 04 2021
 
Sam remains a formidable high-latitude hurricane this morning. An 
earlier 1102 UTC GMI microwave overpass continued to depict 
concentric eyewalls with a fairly well-defined inner-eye that was 
open over the southwestern quadrant. Although there has been a 
generally warming of the cloud tops in infrared satellite imagery, 
the eye remains apparent and the system is still fairly symmetric. 
A blend of the subjective Dvorak T- and CI-numbers from both SAB 
and TAFB yield an intensity of 85 kt, which is used as the initial 
intensity for this advisory. 

Now that Sam has moved north of the north wall of the Gulf Stream 
it will be moving over progressively colder waters and into much 
higher vertical wind shear conditions by this evening, which should 
cause some gradual weakening.  However, the interaction of the 
cyclone with a strong upper-level trough is likely to lead to the
rapid transition of Sam into a powerful extratropical cyclone later 
this evening.  The post-tropical cyclone is expected to maintain 
hurricane-force winds until late Tuesday.  Gradual weakening should 
occur after that time as the baroclinic forcing decreases, and the 
system is forecast to spin down slowly over the north Atlantic later 
this week. 

Sam continues to accelerate northeastward and is now moving at 
045/28 kt.  A faster northeastward motion is forecast through 
tonight as Sam moves within the strong southwesterly flow ahead of 
a mid-latitude trough. The post-tropical cyclone is forecast to 
slow down on Tuesday as it interacts with the trough/cut-off low.  
After that time, the system is forecast to turn east-northeastward, 
and then rotate cyclonically around the eastern flank of yet 
another cut-off low later in the week.  The dynamical model 
guidance remains in generally good agreement on the overall track 
forecast scenario, albeit for some forward speed variations.  The 
latest official forecast is similar to the previous advisory and 
lies near the TVCA multi-model consensus in deference to the 
aforementioned along-track differences. 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands, the Greater Antilles, portions of the Bahamas, and 
southeastern Newfoundland for the next day or so.  These swells 
could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Remnants Of Victor Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
1100 AM AST Mon Oct 04 2021
 
Victor is no longer a tropical cyclone. A timely 1048 UTC ASCAT-A 
pass confirms that Victor does not have a closed surface 
circulation. Since the system has degenerated into a trough of low 
pressure over the central Atlantic, this will be the final NHC 
advisory on Victor. An area of 20 to 22-kt scatterometer winds is 
noted well to the northeast of the trough axis, but these winds 
should diminish through tonight as the trough dampens and the 
remnants move west-northwestward. Hostile environmental conditions, 
including strong southerly shear and very dry mid-level air, will 
inhibit any redevelopment of this system.

Additional information on the remnants of Victor can be found in 
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under 
AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php
