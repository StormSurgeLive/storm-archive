Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Sun Sep 26 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Sam, located about 850 miles east-southeast of the northern Leeward <br/>
Islands.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms have become a little better organized <br/>
today in association with a surface trough that is the remnants of <br/>
Peter. Upper-level winds are marginally conducive for some slow <br/>
development of this disturbance over the next couple of days as it <br/>
moves northeastward at about 10 mph. By midweek, environmental <br/>
conditions are expected to become unfavorable for further <br/>
development. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa on <br/>
Monday.  Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive for <br/>
gradual development thereafter, and a tropical depression could form <br/>
by midweek while the system moves westward to west-northwestward at <br/>
10 to 15 mph over the far eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A broad area of low pressure is expected to form over the eastern or <br/>
central tropical Atlantic early this week, to the west of the <br/>
tropical wave that will be moving off the coast of Africa.  <br/>
Thereafter, environmental conditions are forecast to support some <br/>
development of this disturbance, and a tropical depression could <br/>
form by late this week while it moves westward at 5 to 10 mph.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 PM AST Sun Sep 26 2021
 
...SMALL BUT FEROCIOUS SAM STRENGTHENS SOME MORE...
...EXPECTED TO REMAIN A MAJOR HURRICANE FOR SEVERAL DAYS
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.2N 50.5W
ABOUT 880 MI...1415 KM ESE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...150 MPH...240 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...938 MB...27.70 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 14.2 North, longitude 50.5 West. Sam is moving toward
the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h) and this motion is expected to
continue for the next few days, along with a gradual increase in 
forward speed commencing by midweek. 
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 150 mph (240 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity 
are expected during the next couple of days.  Thereafter, some slow 
weakening is forecast.
 
Sam is a small tropical cyclone. Hurricane-force winds extend 
outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 938 mb (27.70 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam are forecast to reach the Lesser

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 PM AST Sun Sep 26 2021
 
Sam has found a way to strengthen some more today. The ring of 
intense convection surrounding the 15-n-mi-diameter eye has expanded 
in size over the past several hours, while cloud tops colder than 
-70C still completely surround the center. An earlier GMI microwave 
overpass revealed very strong eyewall convection tightly wrapped 
around the small eye, a feature oftentimes seen with intense 
hurricanes. The latest Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB 
remain T6.5/127 kt. However, the UW-CIMSS ADT estimate has recently 
increased to T6.6/130 kt. Based on the expansion of the ring of 
convection and a blend of these Dvorak estimates, the initial 
intensity is raised to 130 kt for this advisory. Sam remains 
compact, with winds of tropical storm force extending only 70 n mi 
from the center. A NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft is en route to 
investigate Sam and will provide more detailed intensity data.

It would not take much further expansion of the convection and 
cooling of the cloud tops over the inner-most core of Sam for it to 
become a rare Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane 
wind scale. Although plausible given the ideal environmental 
conditions over the next couple of days, this strengthening is not 
explicitly forecast to occur. The only factors within the next 2-3 
days that could cause Sam to weaken would be an eyewall replacement 
cycle or the upwelling of cooler waters due to the hurricane's 
relatively slow forward motion. By 72 h, vertical wind shear is 
forecast to increase, which should cause gradual weakening. However, 
given the current strength of Sam, the new forecast calls for it to 
remain a major hurricane throughout the 5-day forecast period. The 
latest NHC intensity forecast was increased by 5 kt through 60 h due 
to the change in the initial intensity and remains on the high end 
of the guidance through that time. At 72 h and beyond, the intensity 
forecast is near the HFIP corrected consensus approach (HCCA) model.

Sam has been wobbling a little north-northwestward and has slowed 
down over the past few hours, but the 12-h-average motion is about 
305/06 kt. A subtropical ridge centered to the northeast of the 
hurricane should steer it northwestward for the next 3-4 days. By 
late Thursday, Sam is expected to reach the western periphery of the 
ridge and turn north-northwestward and begin to increase its forward 
speed as the cyclone starts to get caught up in the southerly flow 
between the ridge and an approaching mid-latitude trough. The 
various track model guidance is in better agreement today compared 
to yesterday, especially in the day 3-5 time frame. The latest NHC 
track forecast is little changed from the previous one, and lies 
near the various consensus track model solutions.
